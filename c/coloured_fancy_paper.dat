60|$|So James {{had to take}} to {{the farm}} in summer, while in the winter he began to work as a sort of amateur {{carpenter}} in a small way. As yet he had lived entirely in the backwoods, and had never seen a town or even a village; but his education in practical work had begun from his very babyhood, and he was handy after the usual fashion of American or colonial boys--ready to turn his hand to anything that happened to present itself. In new countries, where everybody has not got neighbours and workmen within call, such rough-and-ready handiness is far more common than in old England. The one carpenter of the neighbourhood asked James to help him, on the proud day when Tom brought back his earnings from Michigan, and set about the building of the frame house, for which he had already collected the unhewn timber. From that first beginning, {{by the time he was}} thirteen, James was promoted to assist in building a barn; and he might have taken permanently to a carpenter's life, had it not been that his boyish passion for reading had inspired him with an equal passion for going to sea. He had read Marryatt's novels and other sailor tales--what boy has not?--and he was fired with the usual childish desire to embark upon that wonderful life of chasing buccaneers, fighting pirates, capturing prizes, or hunting hidden treasure, which is a lad's brilliantly <b>coloured</b> <b>fancy</b> picture of an everyday sailor's wet, cold, cheerless occupation.|$|R

40|$|Early in {{the nineteenth}} century the London {{publishers}} and printsellers, S. and J. Fuller, packaged paper dolls and storybooks together in their Temple of <b>Fancy</b> <b>paper</b> doll books. This article examines the tension between the narratives of these works—typically moral tales for children in which a love of clothing is punished—and the accompanying paper dolls, which celebrate costume and dressing up. The textual morals against love of clothing are gendered in problematic ways, with female characters mortified for this flaw more readily than male characters. However, the variety of potential reading experiences offered by the form of the paper doll book, in which picture and word are separate, is viewed as a challenge to the gendered moral content of the stories. Ultimately this article argues that the form of the paper doll book sheds new light on D. F. McKenzie's (1986) ideas about how readers make meaning from texts...|$|R

60|$|Several {{writers have}} {{objected to the}} whole theory of sexual selection, by {{assuming}} that with animals and savages {{the taste of the}} female for certain colours or other ornaments would not remain constant for many generations; that first one colour and then another would be admired, and consequently that no permanent effect could be produced. We may admit that taste is fluctuating, but it is not quite arbitrary. It depends much on habit, as we see in mankind; and we may infer that this would hold good with birds and other animals. Even in our own dress, the general character lasts long, and the changes are to a certain extent graduated. Abundant evidence will be given in two places in a future chapter, that savages of many races have admired for many generations the same cicatrices on the skin, the same hideously perforated lips, nostrils, or ears, distorted heads, etc.; and these deformities present some analogy to the natural ornaments of various animals. Nevertheless, with savages such fashions do not endure for ever, as we may infer from the differences in this respect between allied tribes on the same continent. So again the raisers of fancy animals certainly have admired for many generations and still admire the same breeds; they earnestly desire slight changes, which are considered as improvements, but any great or sudden change is looked at as the greatest blemish. With birds in a state of nature {{we have no reason to}} suppose that they would admire an entirely new style of coloration, even if great and sudden variations often occurred, which is far from being the case. We know that dovecot pigeons do not willingly associate with the variously <b>coloured</b> <b>fancy</b> breeds; that albino birds do not commonly get partners in marriage; and that the black ravens of the Feroe Islands chase away their piebald brethren. But this dislike of a sudden change would not preclude their appreciating slight changes, any more than it does in the case of man. Hence with respect to taste, which depends on many elements, but partly on habit and partly on a love of novelty, there seems no improbability in animals admiring for a very long period the same general style of ornamentation or other attractions, and yet appreciating slight changes in colours, form, or sound.|$|R

6000|$|I {{believed}} {{that all this}} morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy {{between him and his}} countrymen were touched. But my persuasions were vain, the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination. Shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion, with its mixture of good and evil, of disappointment and disquiet. Such opened again the wounds of his own heart; and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy, forgetting love and hate, and regret and lost hope, in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset, from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight, from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods,--which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines, the flow of a murmuring stream, and the thousand harmonious sounds which Nature creates in her solitudes.

The author as ‘travel guide’ points out features of potential interest to two visiting criminological colleagues as they ‘pass by’ scenery of great beauty shadowed by acts of spectacular violence. The everyday acts of walking and talking while {{passing through a}} ‘landscape’ serve to constitute a criminology of everyday life, illustrating {{the way in which}} a consciousness of crime, crime sites, analyses and theories permeates the ways a ‘tourist trail’ might be experienced and seen, myths made and histories forged. The walk starts with the unseen lines of penal force radiating from Long Bay Gaol, before skirting through surfing and its regulation; the ‘brotherhood’ of the BRA Boys; the Hines killing and the politics of self defence; the shark arm case, the Virgin Mary and the Bali bombing memorial at Coogee; zones of the beach and Jock Young’s Vertigo at Bronte and Tamarama; before finishing at the Marks Park ‘badlands’ at Bondi, scene of a series of mostly unsolved and unpunished homophobic killings, giving rise to reflections on ‘ungrievable lives’, memory, mourning and forgetting...|$|R
40|$|In 1942 a {{coalition}} of twenty scientific societies formed the Conference on the Supply of Experimental Animals (CSEA) {{in an attempt to}} pressure the Medical Research Council to accept responsibility for the provision of standardised experimental animals in Britain. The practice of animal experimentation was subject to State regulation under the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876, but no provision existed for the provision of animals for experimental use. Consequently, day-to-day laboratory work was reliant on a commercial small animal market which had emerged to sustain the hobby of animal <b>fancying.</b> This <b>paper</b> explores how difficulties encountered in experimental practice within the laboratory led to the problematisation of biomedical science’s reliance upon a commercial market for animals during the inter-war period. This is shown to have produced a crisis within animal reliant experimental science in the early 1940 s which enabled the left-wing Association of Scientific Workers to cast science’s reliance on a free market as economically inefficient and a threat to the reliability of British research. It is argued that the development of standard experimental animals in Britain was, therefore, embedded within the wider cultural, societal, political and economic national context of the time...|$|R
50|$|Diamonds {{in larger}} sizes are rare, and their price is {{dependent}} on the individual features of the diamond. Fashion and marketing aspects can also cause fluctuations in price. This makes it difficult to establish a uniform and readily understood pricing system. Martin Rapaport produces the Rapaport Diamond Report, which lists prices for polished diamonds. The Rapaport Diamond Report is relatively expensive to subscribe to and, as such, is not readily available to consumers and investors. Each week, there are matrices of diamond prices for various shapes of brilliant cut diamonds, by colour and clarity within size bands. The price matrix for brilliant cuts alone exceeds 1,400 entries, and even this is achieved only by grouping some grades together. There are considerable price shifts near the edges of the size bands, so a 0.49 carat mg stone may list at $5,500 per carat = $2,695, while a 0.50 carat mg stone of similar quality lists at $7,500 per carat = $3,750. This difference seems surprising, but in reality stones near the top of a size band (or rarer <b>fancy</b> <b>coloured</b> varieties) tend to be uprated slightly. Some of the price jumps are related to marketing and consumer expectations. For example, a buyer expecting a 1 carat mg diamond solitaire engagement ring may be unwilling to accept a 0.99 carat mg diamond.|$|R
40|$|Ono-no-Tofu(894 - 966), Fujiwara-no-Sari (944 - 998) and Fujiwara-no-Kozei (972 - 1027) who {{appeared}} in the tenth century after the three eminent calligraphers, known as "Sampitsu (Three Brushes, i. e. Kukai (774 - 835), Emperor Saga (786 - 842), Tachibana-no-Hayanari (?- 842)) have been called "Sanseki" (Three Brush Traces; another set of three eminent calligraphers), {{and they are the}} representative masters of Japanese calligraphy who started and established "wayo" (the Japanese style) which means the break from the direct influence of "karayo" (the Chinese style) that had originated in China and then later was introduced to Japan. Sari, one of the above-mentioned "Sanseki", was a very unique person who has greatly influenced the present-day calligraphers like us in our fundamental attitudes towards making our own calligraphic works. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to give a tentative explanation for the charm of his art by paying special attention to his way of lije and the age in which he lived. Sari was born to the north branch of the reputable Fujiwara Clan, and he lost his father when he was four years old and then lost his grandfather, too, who had been his guardian after the death of his father. That prevented him from holding an important place in the political world of his days. But he was very good at writing calligraphic works on tablets and "shikishi" (square pieces of <b>fancy</b> <b>paper)</b> attached to "byobu" (folding screens) and he gradually became known as one of the finest calligraphic artists. Only a few of his works are now extant － that is, Shikaishi and five letters. Judging from his calligraphical characteristics that we can see in those extant works of his, he was not a mere successor to Tofu who started "wayo", but he established his own free style with the aesthetic and rhythmical writing of his own. The main feature of Sari's calligraphy has been traditionally called "ichiboku-no-yo" (the style of ink in one streamline), which means writing several characters with one stroke, but at the same time, giving variations to each character, which reminds us of "renmentai" (the style of unbroken line) of "kana" syllabary. It is often said that when you see a man's writing you can see the man. Sari's calligraphic style seems to have much to do with his own personality and the historical background of the age in which he lived. He was never a worldly-wise man and he was sometimes even called "jodeinin" (a loose man). But he doggedly lived up to his own way of life without going with the current of his times. We can say that Sari's writing is nothing but his own sincere attitude towards life itself...|$|R

It was published in Posthumous Poems in 1824 edited by Mary Shelley. The work, which Shelley called [...] "a fanciful poem", was dedicated to Mary Shelley, the dedication [...] "To Mary" [...] first appearing in the Poetical Works edition of 1839. Mary Shelley wrote that The Witch of Atlas [...] "is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered, and his <b>fancy</b> <b>coloured,</b> during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved." [...] She objected, however, that Shelley was [...] "discarding human interest and passion" [...] in favour of [...] "fantastic ideas" [...] which were [...] "abstract" [...] and [...] "wildly fanciful" [...] and [...] "full of brilliant imagery". She argued that Shelley should have written works that were more consonant with the popular tastes of that time: [...] "The surpassing excellence of The Cenci had made me greatly desire that Shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the Witch of Atlas." [...] Shelley responded in the prefatory verses that she was [...] "critic-bitten ... by some review" [...] and defended the work as [...] "a visionary rhyme". The Witch of Atlas contained Utopian themes that first appeared in Queen Mab (1813).|$|R

He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it troubled him. He did not say to himself, [...] "It is none of my business. I've no right to say anything," [...] as many people would have done. He only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle.

60|$|Thus, day by day, our adventurous {{travellers}} penetrated {{deeper and}} deeper {{into the heart of the}} wilderness, which became more savage and mountainous as they left the coast. Stanley drew forth his quadrant and compass, wherewith he guided the party towards their future home. At night, after the labour of the day was over, he and Frank would spread their charts in the blaze of the camp fire, and study the positions of the land so far as it was laid down; while Edith sat beside her mother, helping her to repair the torn and way-worn habiliments of her husband and Frank, or listening with breathless interest to the men, as they recounted their experiences of life in the different regions through which they had travelled. Many of these tales were more or less <b>coloured</b> by the <b>fancy</b> of the narrators, but most of them were founded on fact, and proved an unfailing source of deep interest to the little child. Frank's fishing-rod was frequently in requisition, and often supplied the party with more than enough of excellent fish; and at every new bend and turn of the innumerable lakes and rivers through which they passed, reindeer were seen bounding on the mountain-sides, or trotting down the ravines to quench their thirst and cool their sides in the waters; so that food was abundant, and their slender stock of provisions had not to be trenched upon, while the berries that grew luxuriantly everywhere proved a grateful addition to their store. Thus, day by day, they slowly retreated farther and farther from the world of mankind-- living in safety under the protection of the Almighty, and receiving the daily supply of all their necessities from His fatherly and bountiful hand; thus, day by day, they rose with the sun, and lay down at night to rest upon the mountain's side or by the river's bank; and thus, day by day, they penetrated {{deeper and deeper}} into the heart of the unknown wilderness.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{military}} forces {{around the world}} embrace modelling and simulation as a fundamental enabling technology necessary to help them meet strategic objectives, the limitations and potential misuses of these tools and the processes that use them are worth closer examination. Of particular concern {{is the potential for}} decision-makers to be unduly influenced by state-of-the-art animation and 3 D graphics that make the simulation appear more realistic than the underlying data and algorithms would suggest. The old adage “Garbage in, garbage out! ” applies as much to a simulation study as it does to any type of data analysis effort. In simulation studies, however, it is an even greater concern as the simulation developer {{can take advantage of the}} ever-improving representation technologies to make the simulation appear to be very realistic potentially resulting in “Garbage in, Hollywood out! ” As appropriate as this may be for a video game, or in some cases for a virtual simulator used for training, it also affords analysts and others the opportunity to influence decision-makers in potentially inappropriate ways.

6000|$|Now Mary {{had never}} thought any such thing. She knew that her uncle much wished her to marry Roswell, and had all along <b>fancied</b> that the <b>paper</b> she held, which indeed was {{contained}} in an envelop addressed to her lover, contained some expression of his wishes on this to her the most interesting of all subjects, and nothing else.

It was, consequently, the most natural thing in the world that she should have fallen into some such error as this. But, now that the subject was brought to her mind in this new light, she arose, went to her own room, and soon re-appeared with the paper in her hand. Both Mr. Job Pratt and Rev.

But there is not one change in the casting of the jagged shadows along the hollows of the hills, but it is fixed on his mind for ever; not a flake of spray has broken from the sea of cloud about their bases, but he has watched it as it melts away, and could recall it to its lost place in heaven by the slightest effort of his thoughts. Not only so, but thousands and thousands of such images, of older scenes, remain congregated in his mind, each mingling in new associations with those now visibly passing before him, and these again confused with other images of his own ceaseless, sleepless imagination, flashing by in sudden troops. <b>Fancy</b> how his <b>paper</b> will be covered with stray symbols and blots, and undecipherable shorthand:--as for his sitting down to [...] "draw from Nature," [...] there was not one of the things which he wished to represent that stayed for so much as five seconds together: but none of them escaped, for all that: they are sealed up in that strange storehouse of his; he may take one of them out, perhaps, this day twenty years, and paint it in his dark room, far away. Now, observe, you may tell both of these men, when they are young, that they are to be honest, that they have an important function, and that they are not to care what Raphael did.

60|$|That is {{the element}} about the Arab {{influence}} which makes it, after its ages of supremacy {{and in a}} sense of success, remain in a subtle manner superficial. When a man first sees the Eastern deserts, he sees this influence as I first described it, very present and powerful, almost omnipresent and omnipotent. But I fancy that to me and to others it is partly striking only because it is strange. Islam is so different to Christendom that to see it at all is at first like entering a new world. But, in my own case at any rate, as the strange colours became more customary, and especially as I saw more of the established seats of history, the cities and the framework of the different states, I became conscious of something else. It was something underneath, undestroyed and even in a sense unaltered. It was something neither Moslem nor modern; not merely oriental and yet very different from the new occidental nations from which I came. For a long time I could not put a name to this historical atmosphere. Then one day, standing in one of the Greek churches, one of those houses of gold full of hard highly <b>coloured</b> pictures, I <b>fancied</b> it came to me. It was the Empire. And certainly not the raid of Asiatic bandits we call the Turkish Empire. The thing which had caught my eye in that coloured interior was the carving of a two-headed eagle in such a position as to make it almost as symbolic as a cross. Every one has heard, of course, of the situation which this might well suggest, the suggestion that the Russian Church was far too much of an Established Church and the White Czar encroached upon the White Christ. But as a fact the eagle I saw was not borrowed from the Russian Empire; it would be truer to say that the Empire was borrowed from the eagle. The double eagle is the ancient emblem of the double empire of Rome and of Byzantium; the one head looking to the west and the other to the east, as if it spread its wings from the sunrise to the sunset. Unless I am mistaken, it was only associated with Russia as late as Peter the Great, though it had been the badge of Austria as the representative of the Holy Roman Empire. And what I felt brooding over that shrine and that landscape was something older not only than Turkey or Russia but than Austria itself. I began to understand a sort of evening light that lies over Palestine and Syria; a sense of smooth ruts of custom such as are said to give a dignity to the civilisation of China. I even understood a sort of sleepiness about the splendid and handsome Orthodox priests moving fully robed about the streets. They were not aristocrats but officials; still moving with the mighty routine of some far-off official system. In so far as the eagle was an emblem not of such imperial peace but of distant imperial wars, it was of wars that we in the West have hardly heard of; it was the emblem of official ovations.|$|R
