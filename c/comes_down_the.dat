25|$|I {{have found}} that in the {{composition}} of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... I have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.|$|E
25|$|Tintin, Haddock, and Tournesol go to {{the home}} of Professor Hippolyte Bergamotte (Hercules Tarragon) to protect him, as he and Tournesol were {{students}} together. The police detectives Dupont and Dupond (Thomson and Thompson) have also been sent to protect Bergamotte. Bergamotte reveals the mummy of Rascar Capac, and Tintin reads the prophecy that the expedition found in his tomb. A storm comes, a ball of lightning <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> chimney, destroys the mummy, and Bergamotte realises that the prophecy is true. He is then struck down by the curse like the others.|$|E
25|$|The band filmed a {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{depicting}} a teenage boy with bleached hair who is harassed by others. Wanting to fit in, he starts by cutting his hair short. He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters the kitchen, where his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.|$|E

2500|$|Rahane is a {{versatile}} player who adapts to the pitch and weather conditions easily, {{for which he}} has performed consistently [...] on overseas pitches. His trademark shot is the back-foot square-punch towards the off-side against the seamers. He {{is also a good}} hooker and puller of the ball. Against spinners, his most-productive shot is the slog sweep-over mid-wicket. He occasionally uses his feet and <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch to loft the ball over the bowler's head for a boundary or the maximum. He is a good timer of the ball; the gift of timing combined with power is what makes Rahane successful in all formats, according to skipper Virat Kohli.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to his casting as Gowron, Robert O'Reilly {{appeared}} in the [...] episode [...] "" [...] as a character referred to as Scarface. When casting was underway for the Jonathan Frakes directed episode [...] "", Frakes was looking for an actor who could portray a Klingon {{with a sense of}} humour. O'Reilly later remarked that he was considered because of what he called [...] "that crazy loon eyeball thing". He went directly from a performance of King Lear where he portrayed the character Edmund, and introduced elements of that character into the Klingon. O'Reilly described Gowron's initial appearances as being [...] "the only one with honor, and he was sort of a crazed warrior {{who did not want to}} be anywhere near 'hew-mons'". He felt that like Edmund, Gowron was an outsider who became a leader. He said that they were [...] "very, very similar in nature", and said that this set the character apart from the other Klingons who had appeared on the show until that point. Michael Westmore was in charge of designing the prosthetics for O'Reilly's performances as Gowron, describing it as one of his favourites of all the Klingons he's worked on because of the beard that <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> side of his face.|$|E

[...] God smites the Egyptians with 10 terrible plagues (Plagues of Egypt) including a river of blood, many frogs, {{and the death of}} first-born sons. [...] Moses leads the Israelites out of bondage after a final chase when the Pharaoh reneges on his coerced consent (Crossing the Red Sea and Yam Suph). The desert proves arduous, and the Israelites complain and long for Egypt, but God provides manna and miraculous water for them. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God, where Moses' father-in-law Jethro visits Moses; at his suggestion Moses appoints judges over Israel. God asks whether they will agree to be his people. They accept. The people gather {{at the foot of the}} mountain, and with thunder and lightning, fire and clouds of smoke, and the sound of trumpets, and the trembling of the mountain, God appears on the peak, and the people see the cloud and hear the voice [...] of God. Moses is told to ascend the mountain. God pronounces the Ten Commandments (the Ethical Decalogue) in the hearing of all Israel. Moses goes up the mountain into the presence of God, who pronounces the Covenant Code (a detailed code of ritual and civil law), and promises Canaan to them if they obey. Moses <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> mountain and writes down God's words and the people agree to keep them. God calls Moses up the mountain where he remains for 40 days and 40 nights. At the conclusion of the 40 days and 40 nights, Moses returns holding the set of stone tablets.|$|E
