I saw the light shine on her bare arms and her bright eyes, and there went out of me a yell so big that I thought it was my death.|$|E
60|$|At length we spy'd three Ships <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> <b>up</b> to us {{with the}} Wind; we could easily see they were not Europeans by their Sails, and began to prepare {{ourselves}} for a Prize, not for a Fight; but were a little disappointed, when we found the first Ship full of Guns, and full of Soldiers, and in Condition, had she been manag'd by English Sailors, to have fought two such Ships as ours were; however, we resolv'd to attack her {{if she had been}} full of Devils as she was full of Men.|$|E

50|$|The {{narration}} {{begins at}} that point explaining that the fleet {{on its way to}} Okinawa will be the first in history to come into battle with a land-based aerial opponent. Up to this point the Japanese have been at an aerial disadvantage, needing to fly a great distance from Japan to engage the enemy, or be stationed on an aircraft carrier that could be sunk. But now the Americans were <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>right</b> under their home base. The narrator also talks at length about the kamikaze pilots and the difficulties the Navy has had with them in recent months.|$|R

I want to explain especially new cosmological data which are <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>right</b> now and their implication for the cosmological model. N. B.

60|$|Now such a {{book and}} such a book alone would put {{the people of the}} world upon an {{absolutely}} new footing with regard to social and international affairs. They would be told a history <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> <b>up</b> to the Daily Newspaper. They would see themselves and the news of to-day as part of one great development. It would give their lives significance and dignity. It would give the events of the current day significance and dignity. It would lift their imaginations up to a new level. I say lift, but I mean restore their imaginations to a former level. Because if you look back into the lives of the Pilgrim Fathers, let us say, or into those of the great soldiers and statesmen of Cromwellian England, you will find that these men had a sense of personal significance, a sense of destiny, such as no one in politics or literature seems to possess to-day. They were still in touch with the old Bible. To-day if life seems adventurous and fragmentary and generally aimless it is largely because of this one thing. We have lost touch with history. We have ceased to see human affairs as one great epic unfolding. And only by the universal teaching of Universal History can that epic quality be restored.|$|E

60|$|Either {{owing to}} the fore-top-mast staysail, or to some providential sea, the vessel did fall off, however, and {{presently}} she <b>righted,</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with great force, with a heavy roll to windward. The staysail helped us, I feel persuaded, as the stay had got taut in the wreck, and the wind had blown out the hanks. The brig's helm being hard up, {{as soon as she}} got way, the craft flew round like a top, coming up on the other tack, in spite of us, and throwing her nearly over again. She did not come fairly down, however, though I thought she was gone, for an instant.|$|R

5000|$|Fitzsimmons {{was taller}} and quicker than Sharkey and {{dominated}} the fight {{from the opening}} bell. In the eighth, the two were punching at such close quarters that virtually no one witnessed the hits the two men exchanged clearly. What was obvious to everyone watching was that Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey with his famous [...] "solar plexus punch," [...] an uppercut that struck under the opponent's heart and could temporarily leave the opponent helpless. Different sources describe the alleged foul. In the much-criticized and disputed biography Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal, Stuart N. Lake wrote that Sharkey [...] "stumbled forward instead of back. Fitzsimmons' <b>right,</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up,</b> struck Sharkey in the groin."Sharkey later testified Fitzsimmons hit him below the belt. Sharkey went down, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas, screaming foul.|$|R

5000|$|Scows came in {{all manner}} of shape and sizes and {{all manner of}} sailing rigs, but the [...] "true" [...] sailing scow {{displayed}} no fine lines or fancy rigging. They were designed for hard work and heavy haulage and they did their job remarkably well. They took cattle north from the stockyards of Auckland and returned with a cargo of kauri logs, sacks of kauri gum, shingle, firewood, flax or sand. With their flat bottoms they could be sailed or poled much further up the many tributaries and rivers where the bushmen and bullock teams had the freshly sawn kauri logs amassed, thereby saving {{a great deal of time}} and energy on the part of the bushmen. The flat-bottomed scows were also capable of <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> <b>up</b> on to the beach and grounding, then over the side went duckboards, wheelbarrows and banjo shovels. The crew would then fill the vessel with a cargo of sand, racing against the turn of the tide, and when the tide did turn, back onboard would go the equipment and the ship would float off and put to sea. Of course, occasionally an inexperienced skipper would overload the scow; then as the water level against the outside of the hull rose (diminishing the amount of safe [...] "free board"), rapid shovelling by the crew could be observed to reduce the contents in the hold to a safe level.|$|E

5000|$|... "Vincent's brigade, {{consisting}} of the Sixteenth Michigan on the right, Forty-fourth New York, Eighty-third Pennsylvania, and Twentieth Maine regiments, reached this position ten minutes before my arrival, and they piled a few rocks from boulder to boulder, making the zigzag line more complete, and were concealed behind it ready to receive us. From behind this ledge, unexpectedly to us, because concealed, they poured into us the most destructive fire I ever saw. Our line halted, but did not break. The enemy was formed in line as named from their right to left. ... As men fell their comrades closed the gap, returning the fire most spiritedly. I {{could see through the}} smoke men of the Twentieth Maine in front of my right wing running from tree to tree back westward toward the main body, and I advanced my right, swinging it around, overlapping and turning their left. I ordered my regiment to change direction to the left, swing around, and drive the Federals from the ledge of rocks, for the purpose of enfilading their line ... gain the enemy's rear, and drive him from the hill. My men obeyed and advanced about half way to the enemy's position, but the fire was so destructive that my line wavered like a man trying to walk against a strong wind, and then slowly, doggedly, gave back a little; then with no one upon the left or right of me, my regiment exposed, while the enemy was still under cover, to stand there and die was sheer folly; either to retreat or advance became a necessity. ... Captain C. Brainard, one of the bravest and best officers in the regiment, in leading his company forward, fell, exclaiming, 'O God! that I could see my mother,' and instantly expired. Lieutenant John A. Oates, my dear brother, succeeded to the command of the company, but was pierced through by a number of bullets, and fell mortally wounded. Lieutenant H. Cody fell mortally wounded, Captain C. Bethune and several other officers were seriously wounded, while the carnage in the ranks was appalling. I again ordered the advance, knowing the officers and men of that gallant old regiment, I felt sure that they would follow their commanding officer anywhere in the line of duty. I passed through the line waving my sword, shouting, 'Forward, men, to the ledge!' and promptly followed by the command in splendid style. We drove the Federals from their strong defensive position; five times they rallied and charged us, twice coming so near that some of my men had to use the bayonet, but in vain was their effort. It was our time now to deal death and destruction to a gallant foe, and the account was speedily settled. I led this charge and sprang upon the ledge of rock, using my pistol within musket length, when the rush of my men drove the Maine men from the ledge. ... About forty steps up the slope there is a large boulder about midway the Spur. The Maine regiment charged my line, <b>coming</b> <b>right</b> <b>up</b> in a hand-to-hand encounter. My regimental colors were just a step or two to the right of that boulder, and I was within ten feet. A Maine man reached to grasp the staff of the colors when Ensign G. Archibald stepped back and Sergeant Pat O'Connor stove his bayonet through the head of the Yankee, who fell dead." ...|$|E
