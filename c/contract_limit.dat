30|$|In {{this novel}} scenario, a home {{management}} system should enable users to perform all the above tasks in an integrated, highly configurable, easy-to-use, pervasive fashion. Users {{should be able}} to specify their preferences according to their own goals and priorities – from energy saving to protection, from comfort-oriented choices regarding heating or air conditioning to practical aspects such as having the washing machine finished when they arrive at home, so that they can switch on the air conditioning or the oven to get a pizza with their friends without violating the electricity <b>contract</b> <b>limit,</b> etc. They should also {{be able to do so}} in a natural way, interacting with the system easily – either in their natural language, possibly exploiting the voice recognition facilities available in any smartphone, or writing short messages like SMSs or tweets in a Twitter-like #tag fashion, or maybe writing longer phrases in English, Italian, French, etc. – and possibly exploiting some advanced forms of gesture-based interaction provided by todays’ gaming consoles, 3 D screens, etc. Moreover, users {{should be able to}} do so dynamically, free to change their mind and programs at any time, because our everyday life is often unpredictable and any of us can be late, forget something, or decide to watch a TV match with friends in ten minutes, and so on. Even more, it should be possible to do this in mobility, without having to go home to reconfigure the system or change an option, because most of us spend far from home most of the day – and smartphones are already in everyone’s pocket. Since smartphones embed geo-localisation and are also “the” entry point for all social networks, their availability opens further intriguing possibilities – from geo-related home management services, to the social sharing of user experiences, in several senses.|$|E
40|$|The current BNFL Inc. {{flowsheet}} for the pretreatment of the Hanford high-level tank wastes {{includes the}} use of Superlig{reg_sign} materials for removing {sup 137 }Cs from the aqueous fraction of the waste. The Superlig materials applicable to cesium removal include the cesium-selective Superlig 632 and Superlig 644. These materials have been developed and supplied by IBC Advanced Technologies, Inc., American Fork, Utah. This report describes the testing of the Superlig 644 ion exchange material in a small dual-column system. The bed volume of the lead column was 18. 6 mL (L/D = 7), and the bed volume of the lag column was 15. 9 mL (L/D = 6) during the loading phase. The sample processed was approximately 1. 6 L of diluted waste ([Na{sup +}] = 4. 84 M) from Tank 241 -AN- 107 (Envelope C). This sample had been previously treated for removal of Sr/transuranic (TRU) values and clarified in a single tube cross-flow filtration unit. All ion exchange process steps were tested, including resin-bed preparation, loading, feed displacement, water rinse, elution, eluant rinse, and resin regeneration. A summary of performance measures for both columns is shown in Table S 1. The Cs {lambda} values represent {{a measure of the}} effective capacity of the SL- 644 resin. The Cs {lambda} of 20 for the lead column is much lower than the estimated 150 obtained by the Savannah River Technology Center during Phase 1 A testing. Equilibrium data obtained with batch contacts using the AN- 107 Cs IX feed predicts a Cs {lambda} of 183. A Cs {lambda} for the lag column could not be determined due to insufficient breakthrough, but it appeared to work well and removed nearly all of the cesium not removed by the lead column. The low value for the lead column indicates that it did not perform as expected. This may have been due to air or gas in the bed that caused fluid channeling or blinding of the resin. The maximum decontamination factor (DF) for {sup 137 }Cs listed in Table S 1 is based on {sup 137 }Cs concentration in the first samples collected from each column and the {sup 137 }Cs concentration in the feed. The composite DF for {sup 137 }Cs was 1, 760, which provided an effluent with a {sup 137 }Cs concentration of 8. 7 E- 02 Ci/m{sup 3 }. The {sup 137 }Cs concentration is below the basis of design limit and is 7. 2 % of the <b>contract</b> <b>limit</b> for {sup 137 }Cs...|$|E

The Superlig materials applicable to cesium removal include the cesium selective Superlig 632 and Superlig 644. These materials have been developed and supplied by IBC Advanced Technologies, Inc., American Fork, UT. The work contained in this report involves testing the Superlig 644 ion exchange material in a small dual column system (15 mL each; L/D = 5. 7). The sample processed was approximately 2. 5 L of diluted waste [Na{sup +}] = 4. 6 M from Tank 241 -AW- 101 (Envelope A). This waste had been previously clarified in a single tube cross-flow filtration unit. All ion exchange process steps were tested including resin bed preparation, loading, feed displacement water rinse, elution and resin regeneration. During the initial run, the lag column did not perform as expected so that the {sup 137 }Cs concentration in the effluent composite was above the LAW treatment limits. This required a second column run with the partially decontaminated feed that was conducted at a higher flow rate. A summary of performance measures for both runs is shown in Table S 1. The Cs {lambda} values represent a measure of the effective capacity of the SL- 644 resin. The Cs {lambda} of 143 for the lead column in run 1 is very similar to the value obtained by the Savannah River Technology Center during Phase 1 A testing. The larger Cs {lambda} value for run 2 reflects a general trend for the effective capacity of the SL- 644 material to increase as the cesium concentration decreases. The low value for the lag column during the first run indicates that it did not perform as expected. This may have been due to insufficient conditioning of the bed {{prior to the start of}} the loading step or to air in the bed that caused channeling. Equilibrium data obtained with batch contacts using the AW- 101 Cs IX feed indicates a range for the Cs {lambda} of 80 [...] 97. The maximum decontamination factor (DF) for {sup 137 }CS is based on analysis of the first samples collected from each column and the concentration in the feed for each run. While the DF's are lower for the second run, this is attributed to the lower {sup 137 }Cs concentration in the feed and the increased flowrate. The overall composite DF for run 2 was quite good since both columns functioned well. The overall DF for both runs was 3, 000, which provided an effluent with a {sup 137 }Cs concentration of 5. 89 E- 02 Ci/m{sup 3 } (C/C{sub 0 } = 3. 3 IE- 04). The {sup 137 }Cs concentration in the effluent composite was 7. 3 % of the <b>contract</b> <b>limit</b> for {sup 137 }Cs and also below the basis of design limit...|$|E
