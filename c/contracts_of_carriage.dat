40|$|This {{rigorous}} thesis titled <b>Contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>Carriage</b> in the International <b>Carriage</b> <b>of</b> Goods by Road {{deals with}} the legislation in respect <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road. This involves general interpretation {{of the system of}} rules in the international private law, of the difference between a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and a forwarding contract, and detailed interpretation of the legal sources <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road, especially of the CMR Convention. The main objective of the rigorous thesis is to describe and analyze rights and obligations of the participants to the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road, including the recipient, not a party to the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> The thesis further provides the interpretation of the breach of obligations under the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and <b>of</b> liability {{on the part of the}} carrier, and/or the sender, as a result of breaching the duties under the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> The rigorous thesis also presents the obligation to pay damages on the part of an international road carrier, proviso and complaints under the CMR, special statute of limitation under the CMR, and resolutions of disputes in relation to a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international carriage by [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} the law {{applicable to}} <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods under the European Union {{choice of law}} rules. It analyses two decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU), and a decision of the English High Court on choice of law rules for <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods under the Rome Convention. The Rome Convention is then compared with Rome I Regulation. The author observes and concludes {{that some of the}} complex problems of determining the law applicable to a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods through the default rules under the Rome Convention appear to have been improved under Rome I, which creates more certainty. However, the Rome I regime for determining the law applicable to a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods is by no means perfect, and a resort to some other case law decisions from the CJEU may prove to be helpful in the future...|$|R

50|$|A {{contract}} of carriage is a contract between a carrier of goods or passengers and the consignor, consignee or passenger. <b>Contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> typically define the rights, duties and liabilities of parties to the contract, addressing topics such as acts of God and including clauses such as force majeure. Among common carriers, they are usually evidenced by standard terms and conditions printed on the reverse of a ticket or carriage document.|$|E

50|$|The {{party to}} be sued on a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> may vary from the shipowner, the {{charterer}} or the freight forwarder. A distinction is {{made between the}} physical carrier and the legal carrier, the person contractually responsible for the carriage. If the consignee is suing on an implied <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> or there is negligent <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods, it is the physical carrier against whom action is brought.|$|R
50|$|Carriers {{typically}} incorporate further exceptions into a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> often specifically claiming {{not to be}} {{a common}} carrier.|$|R
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of deviation is a particular aspect of <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> of goods by sea. A deviation is {{a departure from the}} [...] "agreed route" [...] or the [...] "usual route", and it can amount to a serious a breach of contract. The consequences of unjustified deviation are very grave for the carrier, who is thereby prevented from relying upon any exclusion clause which limits his liability.|$|E
50|$|A freight {{forwarder}} offering a consolidation service, will issue its own air waybill or bill of lading. From now on AWB {{will be used}} to refer to both. This is called a Forwarder's or House AWB with its equivalent House BL. These act as <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> between the shipper and the forwarder, who in this case becomes a Deemed Carrier. The forwarder in turn enters into contracts with one or more carriers, often using more than one mode of transportation. The contract of carriage between the forwarder and carrier is called a Master Air Waybill (MAWB or MBL). A House Air Waybill (HAWB) or Bill of Lading (HBL) could act as a multimodal transport document.|$|E
5000|$|In most <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> {{the carrier}} has greater {{bargaining}} power than the shipper, {{and in the}} 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties. Beginning with the Hague Rules, the various conventions set out to codify and develop the English common law principles by providing a basic set of standards to be met by the carrier; but in practice the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on {{a wide array of}} exemptions from liability (such as [...] "Act of God", [...] "Perils of the Sea" [...] and [...] "negligence in navigation or management of the ship").|$|E
5000|$|Under Article X, the Rules apply if ("a) {{the bill}} of lading is issued in a {{contracting}} State, or (b) the carriage is from a port in a contracting State, or (c) the <b>contract</b> (<b>of</b> <b>carriage)</b> provides that(the) Rules ... are to govern the contract". If the Rules apply, the entire text of Rules is incorporated into the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> and any attempt to exclude the Rules is void under Article III (8).|$|R
40|$|The {{liability}} of the carrier in international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods is a classical issue, which is well known, but still actual. The increasing intensity {{of international trade}} has impact on the demand for the transport services. Different rules in different legal systems constitute a hindrance for a proper functioning of international transport services. Nowadays, this problem is well solved by the international conventions containing certain rules, regarding <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in international transport of goods. However, these conventions govern the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> only in particular mode of transport which {{is the reason why}} it is necessary to describe the {{liability of}} the carrier in all these particular modes of transport. The starting point of this thesis is to describe the applicable sets of rules, which can govern the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in international transport. Today, the relation among these sets of rules can appear be genuinely complicated. The most crucial point seems {{to solve the problem of}} relation between the conventions containing certain rules regarding <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and the legislation of the EU. In the EU, the most important sets of rules are Regulation (EC) No. 593 / 2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to [...] ...|$|R

40|$|At the {{international}} level, conventions on the contracts for the {{carriage of goods}} by sea were gradually developed and four major legal regimes have been emerged, namely, the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading 1924 (the Hague Rules); the Hague Rules as Amended by the Brussels Protocol 1968 (the Hague-Visby Rules); the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea 1978 (the Hamburg Rules); and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea 2008 (the Rotterdam Rules). There were concerns over lack of uniformity among the previous legal regimes governing {{the international}} carriage of goods by sea, i. e., the Hague Rules, the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules. There was also no universal regime to govern <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> involving various modes of transport in connection with <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> by sea. In addition, they do not provide any legal basis for modern transport practices such as containerisation, the use of electronic transport documents and door-to-door transport contracts (see the Preamble of the Rotterdam Rules) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{bill of lading}} from carrier to shipper {{can be used as}} an {{evidence}} <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> by {{the fact}} that carrier has received the goods and upon the receipt the carrier would deliver the goods. In this case, the bill of lading would be used as a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> Also, the bill of lading can perform as a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> a <b>carriage.</b> In this case, the bill of lading can be used if shipper does not properly ship the goods than the shipper cannot receive the bill of lading from the carrier. Eventually, the shipper would have to deliver the bill of lading to the seller. In this case, the bill of lading is used as a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> between seller and carrier. However, when the bill of lading is negotiated to a bona fide third party then the bill of lading becomes a conclusive evidence where no contradictory evidence can be introduced. It is because the third party cannot examine the actual shipment and can only pay attention to the document itself, not survey or examination of the shipment itself. However, the bill of lading will rarely be the contract itself, since the cargo space will have been booked previously, perhaps by telephone, email or letter. The preliminary contract will be acknowledged by both the shipper and carrier to incorporate the carrier's standard terms of business. If the Hague-Visby Rules apply, then all of the Rules will be automatically annexed to the bill of lading, thus forming a statutory contract.|$|R
40|$|Rights and Duties of Passengers in Public Transport The {{topic of}} this thesis {{is the issue}} of passenger's rights and duties in public transport.
