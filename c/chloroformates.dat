50|$|<b>Chloroformates</b> are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds which are esters of chloroformic acid. They are widely used as reagents in organic chemistry. For example, benzyl chloroformate is used to introduce the Cbz protecting group and fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride is used to introduce the FMOC protecting group.

They enable relatively simple transformation of large array of metabolites (aminoacids, amines, carboxylic acids, phenols) for analysis by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry.|$|E
50|$|Takemoto and {{coworkers}} observed that addition of <b>chloroformates</b> are required as electrophilic activating agents, {{and the reaction}} does not proceed without them. Also, a 1,2-amino alcohol functionality is required on the catalyst for the reaction to proceed stereoselectively. They rationalize these findings by suggesting that the chloroformate reagent reacted with the quinoline nitrogen to make an N-acyated quinolinium intermediate B, which is further activated by electrophilic chiral thiourea. They also suggest that the 1,2-amino alcohol functionality of the catalyst is chelating to the alkenyl boronic acids and that such chelation directed the stereochemical outcome.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the nature of the {{reactions}} of n-propyl and benzyl <b>chloroformates</b> with tetra-n-butylammonium nitrate in actonitrile as a reaction medium. A thermodynamic investigation associated with the enthalpy of formation and vaporization of these <b>chloroformates</b> has also been undertaken. The reaction kinetics were determined at various concentrations of <b>chloroformates</b> and tetra-n-butyl-ammonium nitrate at different temperatures. The reactions have been found to be second-order and to follow pseudo-first-order rate coefficients proportional to the nitrate ion concentration. The changes in entropies, deltaS +/-, ranged from - 59. 5 for n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl to - 14. 5 J mol- 1 deg- 1 for C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, which indicates that the reaction proceeded by a bimolecular SN 2 mechanism. The studies give evidence that the rate-determining step is the initial reaction between the <b>chloroformates</b> and NO- 3 to give nitratocarbonate via a tetrahedral intermediate. The expected products, nitrate ester and carbon dioxide, are obtained in maximum yields of 18 - 20 % and 61 % respectively. Addition of pyridine or tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate, has little effect on the yield of nitrate ester product. The tetra-n-butylammonium chloride product is more reactive towards both n-propyl and benzyl <b>chloroformates</b> than the corresponding nitrate. The enthalpies of solution of n-propyl and benzyl <b>chloroformates</b> in sodium hydroxide (1 mol dm - 3) have been measured over a range of concentrations at 298. 15 K, using a solution reaction calorimeter. The variation with the concentration of the enthalpy of hydrolysis was not significant over the concentration ranges studied deltaHthetaf (C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 1) = - 524. 396 +/- 0. 767 kj mol- 1 for 5791 <n < 19593 and deltaHtheta(C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, 1) = - 375. 244 +/- 1. 088 kJ mol- 1 for 36804 < n < 52495. Enthalpies of vaporization have been obtained from measurements of vapour pressure over the temperature range 293. 13 to 306. 30 K, deltaHthetav (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 298. 15 K) = 40. 676 +/- 0. 450, and 293. 770 to 302. 34 K, deltaHthetav (C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOC 1, 298. 15 K) = 38. 527 +/- 0. 1 10 Kj mol - 1. Enthalpies of vaporization were also obtained using a vaporization calorimeter, giving deltaHthetav (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, 298. 15 K) = 40. 742 + 0. 403 kj mol - 1. These values of deltaHthetav, obtained from the vapour pressure measurements, are combined with the enthalpies of formation of deltaHthetaf (1) values to give enthalpies of formation in the gaseous state at 298. 15 K viz., deltaHthetaf (n-C 3 H 7 OCOCl, g) = - 483. 720 +/- 0. 864 kj mol deltaHthetaf (C 6 H 5 CH 2 OCOCl, g) = - 336. 717 + 1. 094 kJ mol<p...|$|E
