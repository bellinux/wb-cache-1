The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was charged with evaluating information on primary condensate smoke flavorings. Information on twelve products from ten applicants were evaluated by EFSA. Opinions were published on all twelve. [...] The products considered were what each applicant considered their own primary product prior to any further processing or derivatization. All twelve products were determined to be genotoxic positive by in vitro methods, but when evaluated by in vivo methods ten were found to not be of concern by EFSA. The AM-01 product was judged inconclusive and FF-B was considered weakly genotoxic. Based upon the NOAEL determinations for each product and supplemental information supplied by some manufacturers usage limits for most products have been established and are conveyed by manufacturers to users. Most of these primary products and their derivatives remain in commercial use.

40|$|In Germany, {{pesticides}} {{pass through}} a national authorisation procedure. They must be effective and may not harm either the user or the environment when applied properly. Furthermore pesticide residues in foods and especially in drinking water may not cause harm to consumer health. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) {{is responsible for the}} health assessment of pesticides. The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) is responsible for the authorisation of pesticides. Since the 1990 s, active substances in pesticides have been assessed in the European Union (EU) by a <b>community</b> <b>procedure</b> according to Council Directive 91 / 414 /EEC and, more re-cently, also on the basis of EU Regulation 1107 / 2009. The BfR is involved in this <b>community</b> <b>procedure.</b> Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) values are determined as part of the health as-sessment of this procedure. The BfR incorporates these in regard to national authorisation procedures of pesticides. ADI values, the so-called acceptable daily intake, identify, {{on the basis of the}} body mass or body weight, the maximum amount of an active substance that consumers could take in daily over the course of a lifetime without assuming damage to their health. Based on these val-ues, the BfR also determines a drinking water guide value (Trinkwasser-Leitwert – LWTW) for different active substances. The LWTW indicates the highest concentration of a substance in drinking water that that could be consumed in a lifetime without causing health concerns. The Federal Environment Agency (UBA) uses these drinking water guide values as a refer-ence when defining its typically much lower Action Values (AV) for drinking water (Trink-wasser-Maßnahmewerte MWTW, previously TWMW) ...|$|R

40|$|Is the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) {{which has}} {{developed}} from the Maastricht Treaty (TEU) an old friend or a new enemy? Does it merely carry forward the procedures and ethos of European Political Cooperation (EPC) [...] an old friend, predictable in its functioning and threatening no interests [...] or is it so interwoven with <b>Community</b> <b>procedures</b> that it alarms both the neo-Gaullists, determined to keep foreign policy intergovernmental, and the integrationists, equally determined to safeguard <b>Community</b> <b>procedures?</b> Is it the new enemy of both orthodoxies? This paper describes the features that made EPC work, and the drawbacks to that process. It suggests that the negative features of EPC persist in the post-Maastricht period, while the positive ones are being eroded. It chronicles the development of "consistency" and {{the genesis of the}} Maastricht Treaty, and shows how the TEU’s inability to grasp procedural mettles has left a clear field for rival bureaucratic groups representing rival foreign policy cultures to contend for power. The old foreign policy establishment appears to be losing out in this struggle. Finally, through an examination of the concept of legitimacy, it suggests that the on-going institutional debate in the Intergovernmental Conference is ultimately sterile, and that only a reevaluation {{of the nature of the}} Union’s foreign policy can prevent the CFSP from falling victim to an argument which neither side can win...|$|E
40|$|Françafrique, Francophonie, l’état franco-africain and Mafiafrique – {{all these}} terms are {{commonly}} used if one comes to talk about French-African relations after the severing of colonial ties in 1960. Even though they bear slightly different meanings, they share {{the notion of a}} very close, stable, and continuous if not to say colonially-styled relationship. According to the relevant literature, the European Economic Community (EEC) acted thereby as a stabilizing instrument. Against this backdrop, the paper tries to present new perspectives on the complex relationship between the EEC, France and its former African colonies associated to the community since 1958. The paper explores to what extent France’s belonging to the EEC triggered Europeanization processes that directly affected French-African relations and eventually acted in favor of decolonization of metropolitan France. I will argue that {{in the course of the}} 1960 s, emulation of <b>community</b> <b>procedures</b> as well as supranational legal coercion to a certain extent transformed French development co-operation and trade relations with the Francophone African states and in the end fostered France’s regional reconfiguration towards Europe.

Surgical training in such procedures, which are currently hospital based, may therefore be adversely affected unless surgical training also takes advantage of these opportunities. There is potential for surgical trainees to benefit from training in the community setting. ASiT supports the development of formal surgical training in the community setting for junior surgical trainees, providing high standards of patient care and training provision are ensured. Anticipated problems relating to the migration of surgical services to the community relate to the availability and quality assurance of training opportunities in primary care, its funding, including exposure to issues of indemnity cover for trainees, and also the release of surgical trainees from hospital duties in order to attend these training opportunities. These consensus recommendations set out a framework through which both patient care and training remain {{at the forefront of}} these continued service reconfigurations...|$|E

For this purpose sensitive, event specific methods capable of reliably detecting and quantifying the presence of GMOs with limits of quantification within this threshold are necessary.

The research was to be conducted chiefly through the dispatching of field teams to gather their data primarily through systematic observations and interviews. Field studies of domestic disasters were to be used to make “in-depth” i. e., intensive studies of particular organizations. Foreign disasters were to provide comparative data and to serve as opportunities to examine alternate organizational and <b>community</b> <b>procedures</b> for coping with major emergencies.

40|$|Exploring students' {{experiences}} navigating {{community college}} {{is important for}} understanding the relevance of <b>community</b> college <b>procedures</b> and personnel as students make decisions about their day-to-day actions and continued enrollment. Data exists about the multiple obligations many community college students have, which may complicate their college enrollment. Yet, {{little is known about}} how those outside obligations influence students as they interact within the community college environment to implement their college-going choices. Furthermore, little data exists about the continued educational choices students make during their enrollment and what role college procedures and personnel may play. Choices for students do not end after choosing a college to attend. Rather, decision-making is an on-going process. Ironically, the on-going educational choices of students are missing from college choice, integration, and persistence models. This study used a qualitative approach to examine how students experienced the institution through the lens of these micro-decisions. A combination of the model of student success, rational action theory, and cooling out provided the framework to understand how community college students made sense of their interactions with college personnel, and in what ways the community college might contribute to cooling out. Overall, findings demonstrate the <b>community</b> college's <b>procedures</b> constrain students' available choices.
