40|$|This paper investigates {{whether a}} new carrier decides {{to enter a}} slot-constrained <b>congested</b> <b>airport</b> or a {{secondary}} airport located far from the city center using a very simple model. In addition, this paper analyzes the slot allocation to maximize social welfare.

When the distance between the secondary airport and the city center is large (small), the new carrier enters the <b>congested</b> <b>airport</b> (secondary airport). Next, when the carrier’s cost difference between entering the <b>congested</b> <b>airport</b> and entering the secondary airport is small (large), the new carrier has an excessive incentive to enter the secondary (<b>congested)</b> <b>airport.</b> Finally, given that an authority distributes slots to maximize social welfare, if the marginal cost for slot allocation is large, the new carrier may choose to enter the secondary airport, which is not socially preferable. ...|$|E

This is not generally the case for an undifferentiated charge, which {{is found to be}} a weighted average of first-best charge rules for the two airlines, and is less-than-optimally efficient because of its inability to differentiate between them. Tradable slots may yield the first-best outcome if the congestion externality is relatively important and the market power distortion relatively unimportant, but may be less efficient than non-intervention when the reverse is true. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This holds regardless of the leader's internalization of congestion in the unregulated equilibrium, and regardless of the assumed demand substitution pattern between firms. This result implies that the financial deficit under optimal pricing may be less severe than what earlier studies suggest.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of finding {{equitable}} demand management strategies in congested systems with the presence of several classes of customers. Although the conclusions of the paper can be easily adapted to any market-based demand management philosophy, we mainly focus on congestion pricing, starting from a purely market-based economic approach. In this approach, the congestion toll paid by a customer should be set equal to the external cost he imposes on other customers. When demand consists of customers belonging to different classes, application of this principle may lead to tolls that are unaffordable for customers of {{one or more of these}} classes. This raises important issues of fairness. In this paper we discuss several alternative approaches where considerations of equitability and affordability are incorporated into the process of assessing congestion prices.

40|$|Air {{transport}} delays {{have increased}} {{during the past}} decade both in Europe and US. The main reasons have been continuously growing air transport demand, constrained capacity of the system infrastructure, and disruption of services caused by bad weather, failures of the infrastructure components, facilities and equipment, and industrial action of the aviation staff. Growing demand combined with constrained infrastructure capacity and frequently disrupted by a bad weather have been identified as the most frequent causes of congestion and delays at large airports. Potential remedies have shown to be improvement of utilisation of the existing infrastructure capacity by introducing technological and operational innovations, physical expansion of this capacity, and management of access to the scarce infrastructure capacity. The first option has shown to have the very limited effect. In many cases, the second option has been impossible to be implemented due to the various political and environmental constraints in terms of land take in both the airport airside and landside area. The solution of management of access to the existing scarce infrastructure capacity (i. e., ?demand management) has recently been considered as an additional viable option to relief the congestion problem. This paper deals with modelling of management of access to a <b>congested</b> <b>airport</b> by using congestion charging. The complexity of setting up a relevant congestion charge (toll) based on the system delays imposed by an additional aircraft on itself and on the others during peak-periods has been particularly elaborated. For such a purpose, queuing model of a <b>congested</b> <b>airport,</b> as an essential tool for estimating the aircraft delays, particularly in cases of changes of the airport capacity caused by disruptions, is developed. The existing theory of congestion pricing is upgraded by an explicit introduction of the differences between particular customers - the aircraft - requesting service during peaks in terms of the arrival time, type (seat capacity, operational cost), type of flight (short, medium, long-haul), and actual number of passengers on board. These all are also the most important factors expected to influence a tool, which, if consequently applied, is expected to change in line with changes of these factors. This also illustrates controversy and complexity of implementing such tool, the process, which is under consideration (i. e., in a rudimentary phase) at some airports in the U. S. and Europe.
