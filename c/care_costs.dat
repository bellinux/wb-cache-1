5|$|A {{survey of}} New York {{businesses}} found {{an increase of}} 8.5 percent in health <b>care</b> <b>costs,</b> less than the prior year's survey had expected. A 10 percent increase was expected for 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E

This influence is divided into {{the number of children}} and child <b>care</b> <b>cost.</b> Based on the estimated multinomial logit model,the number of children is found to have significant and negative effects on the probability of work. The marginal effect of the number of children aged 0 - 1. 4 years and 1. 5 - 2. 5 years in the highest. The effect of the number of children is also found much larger on probability of work as an employee,when compared to probability of work as an employer, and as a self-employed/family worker. Child <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> of the nursery does not have a significant negative impact,but, other child is found to be negative and significant. This negative impact is highest at RM 300 and below per month. This implies that the government subsidies on child <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> (other than nursery) can help in increasing the married women labour force partcipation especially for those that have child <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> of RM 300 and below per month.

5|$|During {{the debate}} on health care reform, Franken {{was one of the}} strongest {{supporters}} of a single-payer system.

On September 30, 2013, Franken voted to remove a provision that would repeal the medical device tax in Obamacare from a government funding bill.

5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health <b>care</b> <b>costs,</b> with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E

25|$|Overall health <b>care</b> <b>costs</b> were {{projected}} in 2011 {{to increase}} by 5.8 percent annually from 2010 to 2020, {{in part because of}} increased utilization of medical services, higher prices for services, and new technologies. Health <b>care</b> <b>costs</b> are rising across the board, but the cost of insurance has risen dramatically for families and employers as well as the federal government. In fact, since 1970 the per-capita cost of private coverage has grown roughly one percentage point faster each year than the per-capita cost of Medicare. Since the late 1990s, Medicare has performed especially well relative to private insurers. Over the next decade, Medicare’s per capita spending is projected to grow at a rate of 2.5 percent each year, compared to private insurance’s 4.8 percent. Nonetheless, most experts and policymakers agree containing health <b>care</b> <b>costs</b> is essential to the nation’s fiscal outlook. Much of the debate over the future of Medicare revolves around whether per capita costs should be reduced by limiting payments to providers or by shifting more costs to Medicare enrollees.|$|E

40|$|Currently, rising health <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> is an {{important}} topic on many agendas and platforms. In 2007, health care spending in the United States reached $ 2. 3 trillion, and was projected to reach $ 3 trillion in 2011 (NCHC, 2007). Increasing health <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> is in direct relationship with {{the rise in the}} ageing population, chronic illness, and the uninsured lower socioeconomic population as well. The research on medical compliance and attendance (missed/kept appointment) behavior is {{an important}} area to explore because it is critical for all aspects of successful treatment, disease prevention, and health promotions that have direct correlation with health <b>care</b> <b>cost</b> (Winnick et al., 2004). Research suggests that if a person keeps their medical appointments, they will likely have an improved health status.

Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC’s) are a designated entities to care for the uninsured lower socioeconomic however, there are many requirements and demands placed upon them. Productivity and payer mix (Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance and self pay) are vital for their sustainability. Actual attendance {{is at the core of}} medical compliance and is very essential in the success of FQHC’s.
