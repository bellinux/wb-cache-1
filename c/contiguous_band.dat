30|$|An {{imaging system}} is {{commonly}} {{considered to be}} multispectral {{if the number of}} spectral bands is greater than 3 and less than 20, for which the working bandwidth is between 10 and 50  nm. In turn, systems with hundreds of <b>contiguous</b> <b>bands</b> with a bandwidth less than 5  nm are considered hyperspectral [9]. The definitions of multispectral and hyperspectral are very author-dependent. Goetz argues that the term multispectral should be used if no <b>contiguous</b> <b>bands</b> are acquired, irrespective of the range of spectral sensitivity of the equipment, while hyperspectral should apply if <b>contiguous</b> <b>bands</b> are acquired [10]. With this definition in mind, all of the equipment {{used in the present study}} may be considered as hyperspectral, some limited to the visible range and others covering the Visible + NIR range.

Since chalk forms in layers separated by <b>contiguous</b> <b>bands</b> of flints, the physical structure affects how the cliffs erode. Wave action undermines the lower cliffs, causing frequent slab failures - slabs from layers of chalk break off, undermining the upper parts of the cliffs, which eventually collapse. In contrast to small rock falls, mass movements are less common. A mass movement happened in 2001 when, after a winter of heavy rain, the water had begun to seep into the cracks which had frozen and caused the cracks to widen. This then made the cliff edge erode and collapse into the sea, destroying a well-known chalk stack called the Devil's Chimney.|$|R

Earlier analysis found strong evidence of higher contraceptive prevalence in districts of Bangladesh that border Bengali-speaking districts of India.

Using multilevel analysis to control for variations in individual- and household-level correlates and mapping districts that deviate considerably from their regional averages, the present analysis highlights an important role for cross-border influences only in districts that share the same language across the border.

40|$|Abstract—Spectrum sensing, {{the task}} of {{discovering}} spectrum usage at a given location, is a fundamental problem in dynamic spectrum access networks. While sensing in narrow spectrum bands is well studied in previous work, wideband spectrum sensing is challenging since a wideband radio is generally too expensive and power consuming for mobile devices. Sequential scan, on the other hand, can be very slow if the wide spectrum band contains many narrow channels. In this paper, we propose an analog-filter based spectrum sensing technique, which is much faster than sequential scan and much cheaper than using a wideband radio. The key insight is that, if the sum of energy on a <b>contiguous</b> <b>band</b> is low, we can conclude that all channels in this band are clear with just one measurement. Based on this insight, we design an intelligent search algorithm to minimize the number of total measurements. We prove that the algorithm has the same asymptotic complexity as compressed sensing while our design is much simpler and easily implementable in the real hardware. We show the availability of our technique using hardware devices that include analog filters and analog energy detectors. Our extensive evaluation using real TV “white space” signals shows the effectiveness of our technique. I...|$|E

An understanding of the spatial dimensions of the epidemic is central {{in the development and}} implementation of appropriate intervention strategies. This study is a geographic analysis of HIV/AIDS infection in Nigeria from 1991 – 2001. The three objectives of this study were: 1) to examine the geographic pattern of the epidemic, 2) to examine the spatial-temporal trend and diffusion pattern of the epidemic, and 3) to explore the factors associated with the spatial (geographic) variation of the infection. Methods: Data was spruced from HIV/AIDS sentinel surveys conducted in Nigeria 1991 - 2001 and the 1999 Nigeria National Demographic and Health Survey. Data analyses involved descriptive cartographic analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis, spatial-temporal analysis and comparative data analysis. Results:- Cartographic analysis revealed distinctive regional differences in the spatial pattern and intensity of HIV infection within the country. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that HIV/AIDS rates were strongly autocorrelated. The epidemic 2 ̆ 7 s epicenter was located in a narrow <b>contiguous</b> <b>band</b> bypassed by a major highway.

One {{of the main}} applications of hyperspectral image analysis is anomaly detection where the problem of interest is the detection of small rare objects that stand out from their surroundings. A common approach to anomaly detection is to rst model the background scene and then to use a detector that quanti es the di erence of a particular pixel from this background. However, identifying the dominant background components and modeling them is a challenging task. We propose an anomaly detection framework that uses Gaussian mixture models for characterizing the scene background in hyperspectral images. First, the full spectrum is divided into several <b>contiguous</b> <b>band</b> groups for dimensionality reduction {{as well as for}} exploiting the peculiarities of di erent parts of the spectrum. Then, sparse spectral unmixing is performed for each band group for identifying signi cant endmembers in the scene. Three methods for identifying the dominant background groups such as thresholding, hierarchical clustering and biclustering are used in the endmember abundance space to retrieve the sets of pixel groups that represent dominant background components. Next, these pixel groups are used for initializing individual Gaussian mixture models that are estimated separately for each spectral band group. The proposed method enables automatic identi cation of the number of mixture components and e ective initialization of the estimation procedure for the mixture model. Finally, the Gaussian mixture models for all groups are statistically fused for obtaining the nal anomaly map for the scene. Comparative experiments showed that the proposed methods performed better than two other density-based anomaly detectors, especially for small false positive rates, on an airborne hyperspectral data set. by Acar Erdinç.
