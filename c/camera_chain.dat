The station's two studios shared two DuMont TA-142 Image Orthicon {{monochrome}} <b>camera</b> <b>chains.</b> One of {{the studio}} <b>camera</b> <b>chains</b> {{could also be used}} to broadcast film projected by either of two General Precision Labs 16mm motion picture projectors, with an FTL Poly-Efex dual flying spot monochrome slide scanner and effects mixer for televising still images (such as advertisement slides or station identification cards), and for producing limited special video effects. The noted equipment compliment allowed for two-camera studio operations, and switching to film without having to use a monoscope test pattern or still slide while moving a studio camera into position for film operations.|$|R
50|$|Propulsion for the mid-course {{trajectory}} correction {{was provided}} by a 224 N thrust monopropellant hydrazine engine with four jet-vane vector control. Orientation and attitude control about three axes was enabled by twelve nitrogen gas jets coupled {{to a system of}} three gyros, four primary Sun sensors, two secondary Sun sensors, and an Earth sensor. Power was supplied by 9,792 silicon solar cells contained in the two solar panels, giving a total array area of 2.3 square meters and producing 200 W. Two 1200 watt-hour AgZnO batteries rated at 26.5 V with a capacity for 9 hours of operation provided power to each of the separate communication/TV <b>camera</b> <b>chains.</b> Two 1000 watt-hour AgZnO batteries stored power for spacecraft operations.|$|R

5000|$|Critics {{praised the}} film for its honesty and the {{diversity}} of its student subjects. [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club said, [...] "By turns playful, harrowing, intensely moving, and uproariously funny, <b>Chain</b> <b>Camera</b> cuts away all documentary artifice and goes straight to the source, allowing these kids to reveal themselves with the utmost directness and candor." [...] Several critics also made favorable comparisons to Michael Apted's Up series, which has chronicled the lives of several Britons {{over the course of}} several decades. [...] Dick has acknowledged Apted's influence and has stated that he plans to follow the Up paradigm by making a sequel film that documents <b>Chain</b> <b>Camera's</b> subjects as adults.|$|R
50|$|At a young age, Alcott {{started his}} career in film by {{becoming}} a clapper boy, which was the lowest position in the <b>camera</b> crew <b>chain.</b> As time progressed however, he moved his way up and eventually became the third highest position of the camera following the lighting cameraman and the main camera operator. His position was extremely important, as {{his job was to}} adjust, focus and measure the lens and distance between the actor or object being shot and the camera itself.|$|R

40|$|A {{rule based}} system for 3 D shape {{recovery}} and orientation estimation {{from a single}} perspective view is described. The primary input to our system {{is a set of}} line segments extracted from images by a complex segmentation process. In practice, humans are able to interpret 3 D shape and orientation from 2 D images with very little a priori information. The heuristics behind shape constancy suggest that certain regularity assumptions play an important role. Fifteen rules have been developed for the rule base which can be extended to include additional rules. The current rules deal with parallel lines, perpendicular lines, and right corners in the object space that lead to the given image instance recorded by the <b>camera.</b> Forward <b>chaining</b> methodology is adopted. The implementation is written in the rule base language OPS 5 in conjunction with Pascal on a VAX /VMS system. Two examples are presented, and the results are consistent with human perception. 1...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 90s, ooze began to {{incorporate}} video into its satire, receiving worldwide attention for mocking Fundamentalist Christians with [...] "The Force Is A Tool of Satan," [...] a fake video and website purporting to represent zealous Fundamentalists {{offended by the}} Star Wars myth. The group performed live and produced numerous video pranks targeting celebrities, PETA, tourism, and mainstream pornography, with their stunts reaching over 500,000 views on Youtube.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of reconstructing a two-dimensional vertical {{cross section of}} structures in mesospheric airglow by means of tomographic inversion is investigated. A <b>chain</b> of <b>cameras</b> in a line on the ground level is assumed and the data to be inverted consist of luminosity curves from scans of airglow images. Results of inverting simulated data indicates that reconstruction of tilted structures due to gravity waves should be possible. This method should therefore allow {{the determination of the}} vertical wavelength as well as the horizontal wave parameters. The desirable number of <b>cameras</b> in a <b>chain</b> is discussed. An example of results obtained from a two-camera experiment using all-sky optics is also presented...|$|R

40|$|The focus lies on {{recommendations}} for policy makers {{in connection with}} the “enforcement chain” concept. In particular with automated enforcement (e. g. speed and red light <b>cameras)</b> this <b>chain</b> concept is crucial: if one link is not effective or efficient, enforcement is compromised and road safety is negatively affected. The automated enforcement chain consists of a dozen links from detection and measurement to fine collection and/or court proceedings. It also includes basic issues such as vehicle registration and readability of license plates. Many counties struggle to get the wide range of multi-disciplinary aspects of the enforcement chain right and are thus not able to optimise their enforcement and improve road safety. Key bottlenecks in the automated enforcement chain can be found e. g. when the legal and operational framework and its capacity are not in place for dealing with automated traffic enforcement and the resulting huge volumes of traffic violations the license plate/vehicle owner and/or driving license administration are not in order inadequate requirements for the legal integrity of evidence and equipment homologation ticket processing, issuance and fine collection are ineffective and inefficient authorities argue over ticket revenue and funding of road safety investments e. g. enforcement equipment political and administrative support for automated traffic enforcement are wavering public support suffers because the background, results and road safety benefits of enforcement are not properly communicated through various media...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIRAS 16547 - 4247 is {{the most}} {{luminous}} (6. 2 x 10 (4) L-.) embedded young stellar object known to harbor a thermal radio jet. We report the discovery using the Very Large Telescope Infrared Spectrometer and Array <b>Camera</b> of a <b>chain</b> of H- 2 2. 12 mum emission knots that trace a collimated flow extending over 1. 5 pc. The alignment of the H- 2 flow and the central location of the radio jet imply that these phenomena are intimately linked. We have also detected an isolated unresolved 12 mum infrared source toward the radio jet using TIMMI 2. Our findings affirm that IRAS 16547 - 4247 is excited by a single O-type star that is driving a collimated jet. We argue that the accretion mechanism that produces jets in low-mass star formation also operates in the higher mass regime...|$|R
30|$|The {{lifecycle}} of a smart camera {{starts with}} its setup and deployment which we described in Section 4.1. When the <b>camera</b> boots, the <b>chain</b> of trust {{has to be}} established starting at a root of trust for measurement. In the following Section 5.1, we present the realization of this boot procedure for our TrustCAM prototype system. Once the system is booted, the computer vision tasks are executed. To check {{the status of the}} system and to detect unscheduled system reboots, the control station sends a periodic lifebeat request which is described in Section 5.2. If the control station requests a video stream from the camera, data integrity, authenticity, and freshness must be ensured. This is discussed in Section 5.3. Considering the sensitivity of video data, also the confidentiality of images must be preserved. Our approach to achieve this, is described in Section 5.4. Additionally, we demonstrate the realization of two security levels.|$|R
40|$|Thixomolding® {{processes}} of magnesium have been highlighted {{in research and}} applications in the last decade. While in the past its use was mainly driven by consumer goods and electronic applications by Asian manufacturers such as notebook computer cases, digital <b>camera</b> bodies, <b>chain</b> saw housings, etc., currently Thixomolding® has been widely extended to other applications. Some examples are in automotive and sports equipment, such as automotive shift cams, bicycle saddles, fishing reels, snowboard bindings, etc. Wider applications of Thixomolding® magnesium alloys mainly depend on various advantages such as a simple and completely automatic manufacturing process, high productivity, and repeatability of the mechanical properties of parts. Moreover, due to low molding temperatures and laminar flow of the semisolid injected material, longer die life and dimensional precision are expected. In addition, complex geometry and net shape forming are possible, thus avoiding any further machining. Finally, residual porosity, {{which is one of}} the typical defects of cast parts due to gas entrapment in turbulent flow, is avoided because of the laminar flow injection molding in tool-die. In this work, the thixomolded AZ 91 D and AM 60 B alloys have been investigated. A complete analysis has been conducted on the as-supplied material, by investigating the microstructure, tensile properties and axial fatigue fatigue ratio R 0. 1 performance. To improve mechanical characteristics, the Tx heat treatment has been performed on the thixomolded material and its effect on the microstructure has been analyzed and documented as a partial dissolution of brittle -Mg 17 Al 12 phase. The effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties of the material has been investigated and documented including the evaluation of a toughness index...|$|R
40|$|The {{automated}} {{detection of}} atypical and critical traffic situations is essentially important {{to help to}} understand driver behaviour, to find functional correlations between traffic conflicts and real accidents, and eventually, to prevent, particularly severe accidents. In this paper a tool chain is introduced that enables a fully automated traffic situation detection in wide-area traffic {{on the basis of}} a single <b>camera.</b> The tool <b>chain</b> takes into account novel powerful methods for object detection, classification and tracking on the basis of robust regression with preconditioning on the one hand as well as traffic situation detection and classification on the basis of probabilistic approaches on the other hand and eventually, traffic event recording. The approach was tested at an ungated level crossing in the small town Bienrode, which is situated near Brunswick, Germany. It is shown that atypical situations, e. g. overtaking, braking, stopping, inadequate speeds and accelerations, as well as critical situations, e. g. tailgating, can be detected within a range of up to 120 m distance of the camera automatically. The approach enables new ways of analysing traffic areas with regard to traffic safety and performance. The results shown in this paper were obtained in the project OptiSiLK, whose abbreviation means “Optimisation of the safety and the performance at intersections of different traffic modes”. OptiSiLK was funded by the Ministry for Science and Culture of the State of Lower Saxony (MWK) ...|$|R
