5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of <b>carnitine</b> in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe two {{branched}} chain {{fatty acids}} pristanic acid (2, 6, 10, 14 -tetramethylpentadecanoic acid) and phytanic acid (3, 7, 11, 15 -tetramethylhexadecanoic acid) {{were converted to}} co-enzyme A thioesters by rat liver mitochondrial outer membranes. However, these branched chain fatty acids could not be converted to pristanoyl and phytanoyl <b>carnitines,</b> respectively, by mitochondrial outer membranes. As expected, the unbranched long chain fatty acids, stearic acid and palmitic acid, were rapidly converted to stearoyl and palmitoyl <b>carnitines,</b> respectively, by mitochondrial outer membranes. These observations indicate that the branched chain fatty acids could not be transported into mitochondria. The data presented strongly suggest that in rat liver, α-oxidation of phytanic acid occurs in organelles other than mitochondria...|$|R
40|$|A {{capillary}} electrophoresis-tandem {{mass spectrometry}} methodology enabling the simultaneous determination of betaines (glycine betaine, trigonelline, proline betaine and total content of <b>carnitines)</b> in vegetable oils was developed. Betaines were derivatized with butanol previous to their baseline separation in 10 min using a 0. 1 M formic acid buffer at pH 2. 0. Ion trap conditions were optimized {{in order to}} maximize selectivity and sensitivity. Analytical characteristics of the proposed method were established by evaluating its selectivity, linearity, precision (RSDs ranged from 4. 8 % to 10. 7 % for corrected peak areas), accuracy by means of recovery studies (from 80 % to 99 %) and LODs and LOQs at 0. 1 ppb level. The method was applied to the determination of the selected betaines in seed oils and extra virgin olive oils. MS 2 experiments provided the fingerprint fragmentation for all betaines studied in seed oils. In extra virgin olive oils, <b>carnitines</b> were not detected being possible to propose them as a feasible novel marker for the detection of adulterations of olive oils. Application of the developed method to the analysis of different mixtures of extra virgin olive oil with seed oil (between 2 - 10 %) enabled the detection and quantitation of the total content of <b>carnitines.</b> The results obtained show the high potential of the developed method for the authentication and quality control of olive oils...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Oxidative {{stress is}} {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of diseases, implicating that strategies directed at counterbalancing oxidative processes could have a role in clinical medicine. There is also an evidence that oxidative stress acts as a major determinant of apoptotic cell death. Many studies have reported favourable effects of antioxidant formulas on several parameters of the oxidant-antioxidant balance, but none of them has focused whether antioxidant formulas could modulate apoptosis. We investigated in 20 healthy individuals the effect of supplementation with a formula containing alpha-tocopherol, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q(10), <b>carnitines,</b> and selenomethionine, on plasma oxidant status and peroxide levels, erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes, lymphocyte apoptosis, and generation of ROS at the mitochondrial level. Control subjects received only <b>carnitines</b> or an incomplete formula with alpha-tocopherol, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q(10), and selenomethionine. Supplementation with the complete formula resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} plasma antioxidant status that was mirrored by a decrease in blood peroxide levels and a reduced generation of ROS at the mitochondrial level. This was associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of peripheral blood lymphocytes, with either CD 4 or CD 8 phenotype, undergoing apoptosis. Less consistent results were found when either incomplete formula was used. Our study suggests that supplementation with antioxidant formulas can modulate the process of apoptosis under in vivo conditions. The clinical potential of this strategy in the treatment of diseases with an elevated commitment to apoptosis should be explored...|$|R

ALC can also prevent apoptosis in pro-apoptotic mutants, pointing {{to the importance of}} mitochondrial functions in regulating yeast apoptosis and aging. We also demonstrate that ALC attenuates mitochondrial fission in aged yeast cells, indicating a correlation between its protective effect and this process.

40|$|RATIONALE For Newborn Screening (NBS) {{programs}} {{all over}} the world whole blood dried on filter paper, also referred to as dried blood spots (DBS), has been the standard specimen for decades. In recent years DBS have attracted the attention of pharmaceutical companies, mostly due to the low volume of collected sample and simplified, therefore more cost-efficient, transportation requirements. However, the classical NBS workflow did not totally fulfil the needs of their studies, especially with respect to high-throughput unassisted sample processing for tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis. Automated on-line extraction systems for direct analysis have already been tested and proved to be suitable for these pharmaceutical applications. METHODS The suitability of the automated CAMAG DBS-MS 500 interface for simultaneous detection of amino acids and (acyl-) <b>carnitines</b> has been tested together with an Acquity TQD tandem mass spectrometer from Waters and MassChrom stable isotope labelled internal standards from Chromsystems. No chromatographic sample treatment was applied; instead, the extract was directly injected into the MS/MS instrument. The feasibility of the instrumental setting for the routine newborn screening was tested on original samples coming from previously diagnosed patients. RESULTS The performance of the automated extraction technique and its application in preliminary quantitative screening for amino acids and (acyl-) <b>carnitines</b> for NBS showed very promising results. Several samples from patients, each diagnosed with one of four different inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), were tested and the correlation with the conventional punch-and-elute approach was very good. CONCLUSIONS Although the presented method still needs further optimization, our study clearly shows the possibility to use direct on-line analysis in the NBS setting. Our report on direct on-line analysis of newborn samples is a first approach {{in the development of a}} fully automated screening method for NBS analysis.

40|$|Introduction: Idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (iOAT) is {{commonly}} encountered during {{the evaluation of}} men with infertility. Antioxidants have been utilized empirically {{in the treatment of}} iOAT based on their ability to reverse oxidative stress (OS) -induced sperm dysfunction often encountered in this patient population. Methods: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, focusing on publications of antioxidant therapies for iOAT. The main objective of our review article was to report the rationale and available evidence supporting the use of antioxidants. Results: Antioxidants such as glutathione, vitamins E and C, <b>carnitines,</b> coenzyme-Q 10, N-acetylcysteine, selenium, zinc, folic acid, and lycopene have been shown to reduce OS-induced sperm damage. While rigorous scientific evidence in the form of double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials is limited, recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported a beneficial effect of antioxidants on semen parameters and live birth rates.

40|$|Male factors {{account for}} 20 %– 50 % {{of cases of}} {{infertility}} and in 25 % of cases, the etiology of male infertility is unknown.

Empirical medical treatment (EMT) {{has been used in}} men with idiopathic infertility and can be divided into two categories based on the mode of action: hormonal treatment and antioxidant supple-mentation. Hormonal medications consist of gonadotropins, androgens, estrogen receptor blockers, and aromatase inhibitors. Antioxidants such as vitamins, zinc, and <b>carnitines</b> have also been widely used to reduce oxidative stress-induced spermatozoa damage. Although scientifi-cally acceptable evidence of EMT is limited {{because of the lack of}} large, randomized, controlled studies, recent systematic reviews with meta-analyses have shown that the administration of gonadotropins, anti-estrogens, and oral antioxidants results in a significant increase in the live birth rate compared with control treatments.

The clearest effects of insulin were to reduce plasma levels of the branched chain amino acids (BCAs) leucine/isoleucine and their deaminated metabolites, and lowered free fatty acids and acylcarnitines. The highest dose of hydrocortisone increased plasma BCAs in both insulin groups but increased free fatty acids only in the high insulin group, however hydrocortisone did not affect the levels of acyl <b>carnitines</b> in either group.

Pharmacological reversal of energy depletion appears an attractive approach {{and the use of}} perhexiline has been proposed as it is thought to shift myocardial metabolism from fatty acid to glucose utilisation, increasing ATP production and myocardial efficiency. We used the Mybpc 3 -targeted knock-in mouse model of HCM to investigate changes in the cardiac metabolome following perhexiline treatment.
