The latter included 52 cases of Hodgkin's disease and 41 cases of Ki- 1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas which had previously been classified as true histiocytic lymphomas.

40|$|Introduction & Aims: Though {{platelet}} transfusions {{have greatly}} reduced {{the incidence of}} major haemorrhagic complications associated with the management of haematological and oncological disorders, refractoriness to infused platelets becomes a major clinical problem {{for many of these}} patients. Materials and methods: The present study was done to determine the percentage of platelet alloimmunisation due to platelet-reactive antibodies in 340 patients with hematologic or oncologic diseases who had received multiple transfusions (> 10) of blood and blood components and showed platelet refractoriness in 1 -hour post transfusion sample. Results: Platelet-reactive antibodies were detected in the sera of 127 out of 340 patients (37. 35 %) who received multiple transfusions (> 10) and showed platelet refractoriness. Conclusion: Platelet-reactive antibodies appear to be an important cause of platelet refractoriness in patients of acute leukaemia, aplastic anaemia, NHL, MDS and multiple myeloma receiving multiple platelet transfusions.

40|$|A reduced {{response}} of a tumour to chemotherapy {{may be due}} to the host's drug metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we measured the metabolism of a model drug, para-aminosalicylate (PAS). Volunteers and cancer patients ingested a single oral dose (2 g) of PAS and we measured the plasma disappearance curve of the drug and its metabolite. In 7 patients suffering from lymphosarcoma, acute or <b>chronic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> and resistant to cancer chemotherapy, we observed low plasma PAS concentrations, an increase in PAS acetylation and an increased number (and a higher frequency) of abnormal liver-function tests. In 14 patients with malignant blood disease, yet responding well to chemotherapy, the metabolism of PAS is similar to that of healthy controls of the same age and sex. The plasma half-life of PAS is similar in sensitive and resistant patients, but slightly longer than in volunteers. Finally, in urine collected 120 min after drug administration, we observed the same results as in plasma. In conclusion, cancer patients resistant to chemotherapy do not metabolize the model drug PAS as volunteers or sensitive patients do, and this might be relevant to the terminal stage of the disease...|$|E

We aimed to shed more light on Lyn's role in haematological neoplasm and systematically investigated Lyn expression in MPN, acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> subtypes ([*]=[*] 236). On top, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and chronic myeloid leukaemia significantly overexpressed Lyn when compared to de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and Philadelphia-chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms ([*]<[*] 0. 001). Most of acute leukaemia subtypes showed a notable down-regulation of Lyn mRNA but anyhow individual cases were labelled for the active form of Lyn protein. Intriguingly, secondary AML evolved in myelodysplastic syndromes revealed almost undetectable Lyn. Overexpression of Lyn in B-CLL was associated with a significant down-regulation of microRNA- 337 - 5 p suggesting that aberrant expression of this particular microRNA could be involved in post-transcriptional control of Lyn mRNA fate.
