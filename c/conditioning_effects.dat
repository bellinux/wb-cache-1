40|$|The <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> in {{metabolomic}} {{studies is}} {{the phenomenon of}} initial variation of analytical results in the first 5 - 10 injections of a biological sample in chromatographic systems. The deviation manifests itself as a drift in retention time, peak area and in multivariate analysis. It is a major quality assurance problem in the metabolomic field and if not accounted for would result in high analytical variance. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> and to gain further knowledge about it. The study was carried out on UPLC of hydrophilic liquid chromatography (HILIC) type coupled to quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) MS. A systematic study was designed to investigate the effects of the age of the analytical column. An investigation into certain matrix components as a possible cause of the <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> was made. Different sample preparation methods were investigated. One result showed that no conditioning could be seen and the system appeared stable from the first injection. Differences in sample composition between samples with <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> and samples without <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> were investigated. No correlation between <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> and levels of certain matrix compounds could be found. More studies of correlation between sample composition and the amount of conditioning occurring is needed. Some samples appear to have no retention time drift but have a significant drift in peak area and in multivariate analysis.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} use of panel surveys at the household or individual level. Panel data have important advantages com-pared to independent cross sections, but also two potential drawbacks: attri-tion bias and panel <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects.</b> Attrition bias arises if dropping out of the panel is correlated with a variable of interest. Panel conditioning arises if responses are influenced by participation in the previous wave(s); the experi-ence of the previous interview(s) may affect the answers to questions on the same topic, such that these answers differ systematically from those of re-spondents interviewed for the first time. In this study the authors discuss how to disentangle attrition and panel <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects</b> and develop tests for panel conditioning allowing for nonrandom attrition. First, the authors consider a nonparametric approach with assumptions on the sample design only, leading to interval identification of the measures for the attrition and panel <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects.</b> Second, the authors introduce additional assump-tions concerning the attrition process, which lead to point estimates and stan-dard errors for both the attrition bias and the panel conditioning effect.

Through welfare state policies, resources are redistributed in society. In turn, these resources enable participation in voluntary associations and organizations.

We examined {{what happens}} when dramatic stories, of which the valence evolves over time, are used as unconditioned stimuli. In three experiments, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> of stories depends on the valence of the ending, even when the beginning is of the opposite valence. Experiment 1 (N = 61) used a 2 × 3 within-participants design. Unknown consumer brands were paired with either good-ending or bad-ending stories, and the presentation of the brands was either before the beginning, before the ending, or after the ending. On both an implicit and an explicit attitude measure, we found that brands paired with good-ending stories were liked more than brands paired with bad-ending stories, and this effect was largest for brands presented after the ending. In Experiment 2 (N = 131), the explicit attitude results were replicated in a larger sample. In Experiment 3 (N = 127), the order of story segments was reversed such that the ending was told before the beginning. The <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> was replicated and as in Experiment 1 and 2, the <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> was largest for brands presented after the ending (now told first).

We refer to this model form as a heteroskedastic panel multinomial logit (panel HMNL) model.

In addition, behavior analysts have increasingly turned to direct measures of brain activation, such as electroencephalography and event-related potentials.

The current paper reports a demonstration of its use in a traditional respondent conditioning paradigm. Specifically, a male volunteer was exposed to a conditioning paradigm designed to produce both an eliciting stimulus for fear and a relief stimulus. <b>Conditioning</b> <b>effects</b> were assessed using electrodermal activation as well as blood volume changes in the frontal lobe, recorded by NIRS.

Three CS+ and three CS- trials were run during acquisition, followed on the next day by the same number of CS+ and CS- only trials. Respiratory frequency, minute ventilation, end-tidal fractional concentration of CO 2 and subjective complaints were measured throughout the experiment. While during acquisition all measures were affected, the <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects</b> included only respiratory frequency and subjective complaints. A selective association effect appeared in that the <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects</b> were confined to ammonia as CS+: respiratory frequency increased and more somatic complaints were presented when compared to the CS- condition.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Moisture of corn stover was field {{monitored}} under southeast U. S. {{ambient conditions}} to aid biomass collection decisions. Timing to collect stover at low moisture depended on elapsed time on field, elapsed time after precipitation, time of day, contact with soil, and <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> by combine header. Grain had been combine-harvested at kernel moistures of either 25 % or 15 % wet basis (w. b.). Stover moisture {{was determined by}} weighing large in-situ baskets {{for a month and}} with frequent grab samples. Experiment controls included stover dried under tent shelter and mower-cut stover for combine-conditioning effect. Stover moisture asymptotically declined over time from approximately 70 % (w. b.) to an equilibrium of approximately 20 % (w. b.) for 25 % (w. b.) grain harvest. Moisture reduction was not constant due to daily diurnal variation of eight percentage points (w. b.), and light precipitation that re-hydrated the stover. Stover moisture was significantly greater in the morning compared to afternoon and was greater for stover in contact with soil. A combine corn stalk <b>conditioning</b> <b>effect</b> reduced mean moisture (approx. 10 percentage points) for high-moisture stover at early harvest, yet conditioning increased moisture for a period after light precipitation. Correlation of daily stover moisture with the corresponding day’s evapotranspiration factor was not as strong as correlations with other combinations of environmental factors. Stover moisture generally peaked two days after rain events, so correlations and regressive predictions used previous data (2 -day delay) for rainfall, air relative humidity, and evapotranspiration data.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the role of}} personality traits in shaping electoral participation. Utilizing data from a survey conducted after the 2009 German federal election, we demonstrate that agreeableness and emotional stability increase electoral participation. Yet, the main contribution {{of this article is}} to link personality traits to attitudinal predictors of turnout. First, we demonstrate that attitudinal variables, including party identification, civic duty, political interest, and internal and external efficacy, serve as intervening variables that mediate the impact of personality on turnout. Second, we show that personality traits exhibit <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects</b> by increasing or decreasing the impact of attitudinal factors on electoral participation. By and large, the evidence suggests that openness, agreeableness, and extraversion render attitudes (somewhat) less powerful in affecting turnout while conscientiousness and emotional stability increase the impact of certain attitudes. Third, we put indirect and <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects</b> together and find that emotional stability and conscientiousness exhibit particularly interesting patterns of effects: They shape attitudes in a way conducive to higher turnout and make these attitudes more powerful in affecting voter participation...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To analyse the <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects</b> of {{localised}} acute muscle pain {{on power}} output during ipsi- and contra-lateral ballistic arm extensions. Methods: Eight male subjects performed right arm (ipsilateral) and left arm (contra-lateral) bench press movements. The power output (and force and velocity) of the concentric phase of movement was measured {{before and during}} muscle pain induced by a standardised intramuscular injection of levo-ascorbic acid in the right pectoralis major muscle (prime mover muscle) and in the lateral head of the right triceps brachii muscle (synergist). Results: The power output of ipsi- and contra-lateral arm bench press movements was significantly decreased during pain of the right pectoralis major muscle, but not during pain of the right lateral triceps muscle. The velocity and force were both affected {{and contributed to the}} decrease in power output. Conclusions: Acute muscle pain of a prime mover muscle reduces ipsi- and contra-lateral motor performance of ballistic upper limb extension. This is not a generalised or non-specific inhibitory effect on the motor system, since pain failed to modify motor performance when applied to a synergist, non-prime mover, muscle. A basically bilateral executive cortical plan for ballistic upper limb extension could explain the conditioning effect of muscle pain on both ipsi- and contra-lateral arm.

40|$|In this chapter, {{our focus}} is on panel {{conditioning}} with respect to attitude questions. Our methodological approach {{is different from the}} majority of previous studies in this area, in that we do not attempt to estimate biases in marginal and associational distributions through comparison with a fresh cross-sectional sample. Rather, our approach is based on testing hypotheses on a single dataset, derived from an explicit theoretical model of the psychological mechanism underlying <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects</b> in repeated measures of the attitude. We refer to this theoretical account as the cognitive stimulus (CS) model. Specifically, we use a range of empirical indicators to evaluate the theory that repeatedly administering attitude questions serves to stimulate respondents to reflect and deliberate more closely on the issues to which the questions pertain. This, in turn, results in stronger and more internally consistent attitudes in the later waves of a panel. The chapter proceeds in the following manner. First, we review the existing literature on panel <b>conditioning</b> <b>effects.</b> Next, we set out in more detail the rationale underlying the CS hypothesis. We then use data from the first ten waves of the British Household Panel Study (BHPS) to test four inter-related hypotheses expressed as empirical expectations of the CS model.
