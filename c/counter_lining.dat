40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{applications}} of queuing theory {{to the field}} of banking queue management problems. This review proposes a system of classification of queues in the banking sectors, which examined with the assistance of queuing models. The areas described in the literature are the common problems encountered in the queue management strategies in the banking industry. The goal is to identify the best effective method to reduce customer-waiting time at the bank to the maximum possible standard while improving the efficiency of the bank. Customer satisfaction is a concern to service industries as customers expect to get their service promptly. For a service industry like a bank, {{there is a need for}} efficient bank Teller scheduling system that takes into account recognizing various customers’ expectations. This study concentered on the single channel waiting line systems with poison arrivals and exponential service times in Bank of Ceylon, City office, Bank of Ceylon Kuliyapitiya and Bank of Ceylon Bingiriya. All above branches have separate queues for the separate <b>counters.</b> (Many <b>lines)</b> They use rule of thumb to open/close counters at the branches based on their experience. Consequent to our findings and calculations we have proved that having one <b>line</b> and many <b>counters</b> (One <b>line)</b> is effective than having many lines. Further, with respect to open/close of counters we have suggested queue probability tool. Queue probability is one of significant factor to determine to set up number of counters effectively...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the technique for deriving digital elevation models (DEM) from a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) stereo pair {{and apply it to}} an image pair over the Golf of Edremit in Western Turkey. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate DEMs from RADARSAT fine beam mode images as a function of pixel sampling and also of the terrain relief. In addition, throughout the different processing steps the contribution of various effects into error budget (i. e. ground control point acquisition, stereo-model set, image matching and DEM editing) are taken into account. The study area overlaps four 1 : 25 000 scale maps, which is about 50 km by 50 km. The elevation ranges from 0 m to 1767 m. The land cover consists mainly of a mixture of urban areas, agricultural lands and clear-cut areas. The agricultural areas mostly lay in the flat areas and partially take place along the slopes up to 60 °. In addition to small rivers, a few loose rivers are also found. The roads are at most dual carriageways surrounding the urban areas. Experiments were done with a stereo pair of RADARSAT- 1 data. Two fine beam mode scenes with 6. 25 m pixel spacing are acquired with a shallow look angle from descending orbits (F 1 and F 5) to generate a stereo configuration with a small intersection angle of 8 °. The images are orbit oriented, and coded in 16 bits without any radiometric processing. The topographic data were obtained from the Turkish General Command of Mapping. The 10 m <b>counter</b> <b>lines</b> were used to create gray-scaled DEMs, which are then transferred into a 10 m grid file. A corner reflector was installed before the flight and used as a GCP. 1...|$|R
5000|$|When Twain and Lange {{had become}} romantically {{involved}} in the mid 1990s, there was criticism of their relationship: claims that the age difference was extreme, and that Twain was solely using him to further her career. In essence, the critics did not expect their relationship to last. Twain disagreed with these criticisms and wanted to address them in public and this led to her writing [...] "You're Still the One". In an interview with [...] "Top of the Pops" [...] in 1999, she mentioned that she and Lange never intended to write a song about themselves, but that they were simply influenced by the press criticism. Later, in her memoir [...] "From This Moment On", she described her and Lange each writing separate ideas for songs for the album Come on Over and collating them together later, stated that Lange singing the <b>counter</b> <b>line</b> as backing vocals in the song got her [...] "feeling very excited" [...] and led her to sing the chorus melody and both {{to come up with}} the title [...] "You're Still the One". In this ode to the union between her and Lange, Twain explains how she is glad they did not listen to the critics, as if they had done, look at what they could have been missing. Twain and Lange divorced twelve years later in 2010 after 17 years of marriage due to an affair between her husband and her best friend.However, in her biography, Twain has stated that she cherishes the song in souvenir of her mother and of her stepfather and truly believes that they were meant to be together and that, in spite of all the trials they have been through, her parents shared a very pure and true love.|$|R

As the Germans began to drive back the Roman left flank, Crassus led his cavalry in a charge to restore balance and ordered up the cohorts of the third line. As a result, the whole German line broke and began to flee. Most of Ariovistus’ one-hundred and twenty thousand men were killed. He and what remained of his troops escaped and crossed the Rhine, never to engage Rome in battle again. The Suebi camping near the Rhine returned home. Caesar was victorious.|$|R

Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.|$|R
