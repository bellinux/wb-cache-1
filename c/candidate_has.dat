5|$|The {{mayor of}} Paris is elected {{indirectly}} by Paris voters; {{the voters of}} each arrondissement elect the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement {{has a number of}} members depending upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). The elected council members select the mayor. Sometimes the candidate who receives the most votes citywide is not selected if the other <b>candidate</b> <b>has</b> won the support of the majority of council members. Mayor Bertrand Delanoë (2001–2014) was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a majority of council members.|$|E

Where all <b>candidates</b> <b>have</b> {{at least one}} vote, only one ballot was necessary, since the winning <b>candidate</b> <b>had</b> a majority of votes in that county.|$|R

25|$|Harford County is, {{like the}} Pennsylvania Dutch Country to its north, a {{strongly}} Republican region. No Democratic presidential <b>candidate</b> <b>has</b> carried Harford County since Lyndon Johnson’s landslide of 1964. In the period before World War II Harford leaned strongly Democratic {{as it had}} sizeable Confederate sympathies, but during and since the Second World War the county has turned away from its traditional allegiances.|$|E
