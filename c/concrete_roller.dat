50|$|The Grand Valley Diversion Dam is a {{diversion}} dam in the De Beque Canyon of the Colorado River, about 15 mi northeast of Grand Junction, Colorado in the United States.

50|$|An {{arch-gravity dam}} or arched dam is a dam with the {{characteristics}} of both an arch dam and a gravity dam. It is a dam that curves upstream in a narrowing curve that directs most of the water against the canyon rock walls, providing the force to compress the dam. It combines the strengths of two common dam forms and is considered a compromise between the two. They are made of conventional <b>concrete,</b> <b>Roller</b> Compacted Concrete (RCC), or masonry. Arch-gravity dams are not reinforced except at the spillway. A typical example of the conventional concrete dam is the Hoover Dam. Changuinola Dam {{is an example of}} the RCC arch-gravity dam. A gravity dam requires a large volume of internal fill. An arch-gravity dam can be thinner than the pure gravity dam and requires less internal fill.|$|E
50|$|The {{plans for}} Michael Boland's new {{building}} {{were approved by}} the Cairns Town Engineer in May 1912 and JT Bullock was awarded the contract for the construction. Reflecting Boland's increasing wealth and social status, the building was to be an impressive structure of reinforced concrete, the first three-storeyed building in Cairns. Although Boland had pioneered all-concrete construction methods in his 1902 building, in 1912 Cairns was still a town of timber, brick and corrugated iron {{and the use of}} concrete for the new building was still a comparatively early use of reinforced concrete in Queensland. Due to its strength and insulating qualities, concrete construction proved highly suitable to the tropical climate and cyclonic conditions experienced in North Queensland and in later decades dominated its building industry.The construction work, carried out during 1912 and 1913, was a major undertaking that elicited interest from the local press. The swamp at the site was drained and filled but due to the unstable nature of the ground the building sat on a floating foundation laid with girders rather than traditional piles. The walls, floors, internal columns and decorative details of the facade were cast in moulds. The Portland cement used for the building was imported in casks from England and poured using an innovative <b>concrete</b> <b>roller</b> mixer with an independent hoist system. An English firm, Dorman, Long and Co., who later supplied steel for the Sydney Harbour Bridge, prefabricated the steel work for the building.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{compaction}} of rod concrete mixes is a {{very complex}} process, envisaging a rapid increase of linear pressures, taking into account constant change in physical-mechanical properties of compacted material. Several hundred models of compacting equipment have been manufactured to date in the world; however, {{for a long period of}} time the models and types of rollers have been created and continue to be so, by the trial and error method, without accounting for the theoretical fundamentals of the process of compaction and specific features of mechanics of the force interaction of a operating element (drum, tire) with the material compacted. Contemporary directions of development of pavement equipment necessitate the creation of machines of the multipurpose use; designing the constructions, the working processes in which incorporate new technologies, ensuring the growing production yield and labor productivity; and careful treatment of economical and material resources. To improve the quality, reliability and competitiveness of the pavement equipment, it is important to create universal pavement roller, capable of compacting the different types of surfacing, automatically changing contact pressures, having wide range of regulation of compacting impacts and designed for work at all stages of the process of compaction of rod <b>concrete</b> mixes.

40|$|Ground {{granulated}} {{blast furnace}} slag (GGBS), due to its pozzolanic nature, {{could be a great}} asset for the modern construction needs, because slag concretes can be of high performance, if appropriately designed. The use of GGBS as a cementitious material as well as fine filler is being increasingly advocated for the production of High Performance <b>Concrete</b> (HPC), <b>Roller</b> Compacted <b>Concrete</b> (RCC) and Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC), etc. However, for obtaining the required high performance in any of these concrete composites, slag should be properly proportioned so that the resulting concrete would satisfy both the strength and performance criteria requirements of the structure. The present paper is an effort towards presenting a new mix design methodology for the design of self-compacting GGBS concretes based on the efficiency concept. The methodology has already been successfully verified through a proper experimental investigation and the self-compacting slag concretes were evaluated for their self-compactability and strength characteristics. The results indicate that the proposed method is for proportioning mixes with maximum possible replacement of cement by GGBS for achieving self-compactability and strength.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the state-of-the-art {{information on the}} utilization of fly ash, silica fume and slag fume in various applications. In this paper, fly ash uses are classed into three main categories: low technology applications; medium technology applications; and, (3) high technology applications. The low technology applications {{include the use of}} fly ash in fills and embankments, pavement base and subbase courses, subgrade stabilization, landfill cover, soil improvement, land reclamations, slurried flowable ash, water pollution control, etc. The medium technology applications involve the use of fly ash in blended cements, lightweight aggregates, concretes, prestressed/precast concrete products, <b>concrete</b> pipe, <b>roller</b> compacted <b>concrete,</b> autoclaved cellular concrete, bricks, blocks, paving stones, high-strength ceramic products, filler in asphalt mixture, artificial reefs, etc. The high technology application of fly ash include metal recovery, fillers for composite materials and other applications, mineral wool, etc. Silica fume is available in several forms. Considerable amounts of research have been pursued on the utilization of silica fume as a construction material over the last decade. Typical properties of silica fume and its different uses in densified cement, blended cement, concrete, bricks, blocks, grouts, etc. have been briefly mentioned. The use of slag in cements, concrete, aggregate, flowable backfills, grouts, bricks, blocks, and other applications have also been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Affected by {{physical}} properties of various components, characteristics and stress states of junction surface and other multiple factors, concrete, {{as a kind}} of multi-phase composite material, has complicated failure mechanism, thus making its fracture mechanism research difficult. But concrete has been widely used in engineering construction, so research on concrete fracture theory is of important realistic significance and construction value. This study discusses influence rule of specimen size and crack-depth ratio (α 0 /h) on double- K fracture parameters (initial fracture toughness ini IC K and unstable fracture toughness un IC K) and its size effects by using fracture test. Different sizes of <b>concretes</b> and <b>roller</b> compacted <b>concrete</b> (RCC) specimens are adopted to explore influence of specimen size on concrete double-K fracture parameters. Results reveal that initial fracture toughness ini IC K and unstable fracture toughness un IC K increase as specimen size enlarges, showing a size effect; besides, subcritical crack extends with the increase of specimen size. With regard to specimens with different crack-depth ratios, its unstable fracture toughness un IC K is unrelated to initial crack-depth ratio when crack-depth ratio is more than or equal to 0. 4, while initial fracture toughness ini IC K is correlated with initial crack-depth ratio, which indicate that double-K fracture parameters can be considered as material constants describing concrete initial fracture, stable expansion and whole process of stability failure...|$|R
40|$|Stepped {{channels}} and spillways are used since more than 2, 500 years. Recently, new construction materials (e. g. RCC, gabions) {{have increased the}} interest for stepped chutes. The steps increase significantly the rate of energy dissipation taking place along the chute and {{reduce the size of}} the required downstream energy dissipation basin. Stepped cascades are used also in water treatment plants to enhance the air-water transfer of atmospheric gases (e. g. oxygen, nitrogen) and of volatile organic components (VOC). A first part describes the historical progress of stepped {{channels and}} spillways from the Antiquity up to today. Then the monograph reviews the hydraulic characteristics of stepped channel flows. Two different flow regimes can take place : nappe flow regime for small discharges and flat channel slopes, and skimming flow regime. The hydraulics of each flow regime is described. The effects of flow aeration and air bubble entrainment are discussed. Further the process of air-water gas transfer taking place above stepped chute is described.

40|$|Abstract — Fly ash or {{pulverized}} fuel ash is {{the residue of}} the combustion of finely ground coal used in thermal power plants. It is removed by the dust collection system as fine particle residue from the flue gases before they are discharged into the atmosphere. Use of Fly ash in concrete will not only {{solve the problem of}} disposal, but will also reduce the consumption of cement, which is a material whose production is energy intensive. Fly ash concrete has found extensive application in mass concrete, pre-cast concrete, concrete used for pavements, structural <b>concrete</b> and <b>roller</b> compacted <b>concrete</b> with the added advantages of increased workability, impermeability, resistance to chemical attack and increased durability in comparison to ordinary Portland cement concrete. Hence, this paper present the investigation of comparison between the flexural behavior of reinforced Fly ash concrete beams with that of reinforced normal concrete beams and increase the confidence levels of designers and other beneficiaries in using reinforced Fly ash concrete as a structural material. The flexural behavior of reinforced Fly ash concrete beams with different cement replacement levels (20 %, 35 % and 50 %) are compared with reinforced normal concrete beams (without containing Fly ash) under similar conditions. All the beams are reinforced as balanced sections, cured and tested at 28 days. These investigations were conducted with three grades of concrete i. e. M 30, M 40 and M 50. The flexural behaviour of these beams is discussed in terms of its cracking load and ultimate load carrying capacity.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop guidelines and criteria for design and construction of overlays on cracked and seated concrete pavements. The main factors which are investigated in this study include number of the seated roller pass, weight of seating roller pass, weight of seating roller, thickness of overlay, fiber content and fiber layer location. Eleven test sections were constructed on I- 65 and twenty two test sections were constructed on US- 31. An extensive investigation was conducted involving both field and laboratory testing. Field investigations included pavement condition survey and non destructive testing (NDT) of the pavements using FWD or Dynaflect. The laboratory investigation focused on physical property testing, complex modulus testing and fatigue testing. Three fiber extraction methods have been developed for this project. Preliminary test Results show good precision of these methods. These fiber extraction methods should be used in future projects. Deflection measurements can be used to determine the appropriate weight and drop height of the breaking head. The Guillotine breaker used in this project is effective in breaking PCC pavement. A 40 ton roller is recommended because the 50 ton roller apprears to “overwork” the crack <b>concrete</b> pavement. <b>Roller</b> passes have no significant effect on the maximum deflections. The optimum roller pass can not be determined exclusively based on the maximum deflections. One to three passes of a 40 ton pneumatic-tired roller is adequate when seating is needed to assure contact of cracked pavement pieces with the subgrade. Use of fiber and the fiber layer location do not have a significant effect on pavement strength in term of the maximum deflection. But use of fiber will delay the crack development. The least cracks were developed in the sections which have fiber in all three layers. It is recommended that fiber be used in all overlay layers. Overlay thickness has an important effect on the maximum deflections and the development of reflective cracks. General trends of crack development showed in the first two years. Cracked and seated sections have less cracks than non cracked and seated sections, with other conditions being the same. The general trends are not obvious after two years. Beams of 3 x 3 in. are recommended to be used for the flexural fatigue tests in the future due to small variability. Addition of fiber increase the fatigue life of overlay mixture. Composite samples with fiber (4. 5 lb) have predicted fatigue life two times greater than those without fiber. Loading frequency and temperature have significant effects on dynamic modulus and phase angle of overlay mixture. The addition of fiber will change the viscoelastic properties of mixture...|$|R
40|$|The stepped channel design {{have been}} used for more than 3, 500 years (chapter 2). A {{significant}} number of dams were built with overflow stepped spillways during the 19 th century and early 20 th century, before the design technique became outdated with the progresses in hydraulic jump stilling basin design. Recent advances in technology (e. g. RCC, polymer-coated gabion wire) have triggered a regain in interest for the stepped design, although much expertise had been lost in the past 80 years. The steps increase significantly the rate of energy dissipation taking place along the chute and reduce the size of the required downstream energy dissipation basin. Stepped cascades are used also in water treatment plants to enhance the air-water transfer of atmospheric gases (e. g. oxygen, nitrogen) and of volatile organic components (VOC). Research on stepped spillway hydraulics has been active between 1980 and 2000. For the period 1985 - 2000, the international database Science Citation Index® lists over sixteen journal papers and twenty-six discussions and closures on stepped chute hydraulics, all but two published between 1990 and 2000. A 1985 paper (SORENSEN, Jl Hyd Engrg) was cited seventeen times during the period; two papers published in 1994 (CHANSON, Jl of Hyd Res, No. 2 and 3) were cited fourteen and eleven times respectively (Ref. : Science Citation Index). The international database Global Books in Print® lists one book (CHANSON 1995, Pergamon). In 1998, Professor OHTSU and Dr YASUDA organised a workshop on the hydraulic characteristics of stepped channel flows in Tokyo, attended by over seventy participants. In 2000, Professors MINOR and HAGER organised an international workshop on hydraulics of stepped spillways in Zürich. The workshop attracted over forty participants from Europe, North America, Iran, and Australia; the sponsorship of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), International Association for Hydraulic Engineering and Research (IAHR) and Swiss national committee on large dams demonstrated the importance of the event. This book presents {{the state of the art}} in stepped chute hydraulics. It is based upon the research expertise of the writer, his professional experience as an expert-consultant, and his experience in teaching stepped spillway hydraulics to undergraduate students, postgraduate research students and professionals since 1982 (Fig. i). Results from more than forty five laboratory studies and four prototype investigations were re-analysed and compared. The book provides a new understanding of stepped channel hydraulics, and it is aimed at both the research and professional community. In the introduction (chapter 1), the basic concepts of stepped channels and stepped chute flows are described. A clear distinction is made between the main flow regimes (nappe flow, transition and skimming flow). A chapter presents the historical progress of stepped channels and spillways from the Antiquity up to today (chapter 2). Then the monograph reviews the hydraulic characteristics of stepped channel flows. Three different flow regimes may take place depending upon the flow conditions and chute geometry: nappe flow regime for small discharges, transition flow and skimming flow regime. The hydraulics of each flow regime is described in chapters 3, 4 and 5. The effects of flow aeration and air bubble entrainment are discussed. The gas transfer processes taking place above stepped chute are described : e. g., aeration, re-oxygenation, stripping, de-nitrification (chapter 6). Later practical examples of hydraulic design are presented : e. g. stepped fountains, stepped weirs, gabion stepped spillways, earth dam spillways with precast <b>concrete</b> blocks, <b>roller</b> compacted <b>concrete</b> (RCC) weirs, debris dams (chapter 7). The writer presents further a critical review of accidents and failures with stepped channels, highlighting that the hydrodynamic forces on the step faces are much larger than on smooth chute inverts (chapter 8). Wave phenomena and instabilities are reviewed and discussed in a separate section (chapter 9). In the last chapter (summary and conclusions, chapter 10), he summarises the key issues and he answers explicitly basic questions. At the beginning of the book, the reader will find the table of contents, a list of symbols and a glossary of technical terms and names. He will find also an index at the end of the book. After the conclusion (chapter 10), a detailed list of references is presented. It is followed by a list of physical and chemical properties of fluids (appendix I), The book presents results expressed in SI Units. A table of unit conversions is given in appendix II. Several appendices detail particular calculations : nappe trajectory at a drop structure (appendix III), bubble rise velocity calculations (appendix IV), modelling form drag and flow resistance in skimming flows (appendix V), void fraction distributions in chute flows (appendix VI), chute calculations in skimming flow (appendix VII), modelling air-water gas transfer in skimming flows (appendix VIII).
