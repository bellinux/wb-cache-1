40|$|The Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment {{adopted in}} 2001 in Cape Town (CTC) is an ambitious project aiming to {{increase}} the legal certainties in asset-based financing and leasing and attract more private capital for the acquisition and use of high-value mobile equipment. The regulatory system of the CTC ensures universal recognition and enforcement of international interest vested to the chargee, the <b>conditional</b> <b>seller,</b> and the lessor in the respective category of contract, and it {{has proved to be}} successful as applied to the aviation industry. It took more than a decade to draft the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Space Assets (SAP). Adopted in March 2012, the instrument has aroused many controversies in the space industry. Most of the concerns focus on whether the SAP will promote or hinder space financing. However, the contributions and limitations of the SAP are never fully examined and clarified. So this study conducts an in-depth analysis on the regulatory system of the SAP, taking account of the proposals raised in the treaty-making process and the examples drawn from practice. Since there are few precedents on enforcing security interest in satellite and States refuse to make commitment to facilitate constructive repossession and control of space assets, the SAP subjects the realisation of asset-based remedies to national law so that the financiers have to assess the regulatory risks like what they used to do. The contribution of the SAP lies in the registration system that encompasses international interest in space assets and assignment of debtor’s rights related to the international interest. Financing space ventures has to address various risks; a security package that can be perfected and enforced at low cost will mitigate the default risk and enhance the creditor’s confidence in recouping its investment. Therefore, contrary to the position of many SAP supporters, this study finds that the SAP does not invent a new financing option, and it will not change the scenario in the acquisition of space assets. Financings backed by the Export Credit Agencies will remain an appealing option for the start-up companies and the developing countries. In view of the dilemma faced by the SAP, this study also looks into the consensus-building process of the SAP to find out which factors prolonged the negotiation process and undermined the integrity of the SAP. While empirical study and economic impact assessment could have played a more constructive role in the treaty-making process, they are still essential at this stage for the purpose of promoting acceptance of the SAP. published_or_final_versionLawMasterDoctor of Legal Studie...|$|E

40|$|A seller can trade an {{endowment}} of {{a perfectly}} divisible good, {{the quality of}} which she privately knows. Buyers compete by offering menus of nonexclusive contracts, so that the seller can privately trade with several buyers. In this setting, we show that an equilibrium exists under mild conditions and that aggregate equilibrium allocations are generically unique. Although the good for sale is divisible, in equilibrium the seller ends up trading her whole endowment or not trading at all. Trades take place at a price equal to the expected quality of the good, <b>conditional</b> on the <b>seller</b> being ready to trade at that price. Our model thus provides a novel strategic foundation for Akerlof’s (1970) results. It also contrasts with competitive screening models in which contracts {{are assumed to be}} exclusive, as in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976). Latent contracts that are issued but not traded in equilibrium {{play an important role in}} our analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} two {{mechanisms to}} procure differentiated goods: {{a request for}} quote and an English auction with bidding credits. In the request for quote, each seller submits a price and the inherent quality of his good. Then the buyer selects the seller who offers the greatest difference in quality and price. In the English auction with bidding credits, the buyer assigns a bidding credit to each <b>seller</b> <b>conditional</b> upon {{the quality of the}} seller’s good. Then the sellers compete in an English auction with the winner receiving the auction price and his bidding credit. Game theoretic models predict the request for quote is socially efficient but the English auction with bidding credits is not. The optimal bidding credit assignment under compensates for quality advantages, creating a market distortion in which the buyer captures surplus {{at the expense of the}} seller’s profit and social efficiency. In experiments, the request for quote is less efficient than the English auctions with bidding credits. Moreover, both the buyer and seller receive more surplus in the English auction with bidding credits. ...|$|R

Consequently, a L/C is desirable in high value and/or high risk transactions. The guarantee is <b>conditional</b> upon the <b>seller</b> complying 100 % with the documentary requirements of the L/C, an issue of particular concern to exporters, as the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) estimates worldwide documentary discrepancy rates of 70 %. L/C transactions are governed by ICC rules, and whilst these provide an international standardised process, the differing interpretations of what constitutes documentary compliance create difficulties for sellers in particular. The new rules, UCP 600, supposedly have simpler and clearer wording, to reduce ambiguity and differences in interpretation, and hopefully reduce documentary discrepancy rates and the associated financial risks. This article examines the major changes introduced by the UCP 600 and comments on their likely impact on future L/C business. Whilst acknowledging some improvements were introduced in the UCP 600, the article concludes that a number of issues have been ignored to the detriment of traders. export finance; international banking regulations; international trade finance; letters of credit; UCP 600; financial risks. ...|$|R
