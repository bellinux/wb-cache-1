5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered <b>cobalt</b> <b>green,</b> and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of <b>cobalt</b> <b>green</b> (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability.

40|$|HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) can be {{considered}} as the evolution of classical spectroscopy, where “only” punctual analyses are carried out. The obtained 2 D information (i. e. one spectrum for each pixel of the target image) can be thus used to characterize, map and monitor the materials constituting cultural heritage. Such non-invasive diagnostic technique can be applied by mobile devices directly in situ. The adoption of HSI techniques allows the acquisition of the spectra without a direct physical contact and/or sampling of material objects under investigations. This research aims at the development of a methodology to classify different pigments through HSI. Reference samples were prepared using six pigments (i. e. red ocher, yellow ocher, chrome yellow, mineral blue, <b>cobalt</b> <b>green,</b> and malachite) mixed with egg tempera. The obtained products were then applied on two different supports (i. e. canvas and wood) in order to obtain different combinations among pigment/support.

40|$|Colorimetric cation {{responsive}} {{water soluble}} polymers and manageable films or membranes have beendesigned. The sensory materials respond with a colour {{change to the}} presence in water of Fe(III), Co(II),Cu(II), and Sn(II). The colour change is specific of each metal cation, and enables its identification (purplefor iron, orange for <b>cobalt,</b> <b>green</b> for copper, and yellow for tin). The design of the materials relies onan addition monomer having a terpyridine moiety, which behaves as a dye in presence of transitionmetal cations due to its proven chelating capability towards these species and the colour developmentthat always accompany the metallic complex formation. Water solutions of the sensory linear polymersallow for the UV/vis titration of Fe(III), Co(II), Cu(II), and Sn(II) with a limit of detection of 1. 3 × 10 − 7, 6. 4 × 10 − 8, 1. 3 × 10 − 5 and 1. 4 × 10 − 5 M, respectively. On the other hand, sensory kits, cut from sensorymembranes, permitted the visual quantification of the cations in a dynamic range of five decades (1 × 10 − 7 to 5 × 10 − 3 M) for Fe(III) and Co(II) and of two decades (9 × 10 − 5 to 9 × 10 − 3 M) for Cu(II) and Sn(II). Titration curves can also be drawn from a picture taken to the sensory kits with a smartphone, by usingthe digital colour definition of the materials as analytical signal. Also, after entering into contact withhands, shapes of metallic objects (iron and cobalt containing tools) can be colour revealed by pressingthe hands on paper or cotton fabrics wetted with water solutions of the linear sensory polymer.

50|$|Bernard {{most likely}} painted this {{painting}} from memory, modeled after a trip he took with Paul Gauguin in 1888 to Brittany. The painting has five Breton women {{and one man}} gathering around a wall. Their faces are pointed down toward the cobblestone wall. Their heads are covered in traditional Pont-Aven coiffes {{and they are in}} traditional Brittany wear. The painting is proliferated with bright <b>cobalts,</b> yellows, <b>greens,</b> and reds, and are chosen for effect, rather than accuracy in representation. The women all have slight facial features, but they are indistinguishable. Bernard uses harsh, graphic outlines to help define the features on the women's outfits and faces. The man is dressed in all green, and facing the rest of the women. The characters are boldly flat, recalling Bernard's love of Japanese prints. The placement of the figures shows Bernard's disregard to traditional rules, including scale or perspective.|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{to perform a}} full characterization and identification of pigments in pictorial layers {{represents one of the}} most challenging targets in the field of cultural heritage, especially if their fulfillment is achieved setting up not invasive and not destructive analytical procedures. In this perspective, HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) based sensing architectures, acting in the VIS-NIR and SWIR wavelength ranges, can represent an important diagnostic tool to realize the monitoring of paintings, as well as to evaluate their preservation status [1]. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the alteration of different pictorial layers, as resulting from the combination of different supports, pigments and binders, according to different irradiation times. Starting from the result of recent studies [2], 6 pigments were thus mixed (i. e. red ocher, yellow ocher, chrome yellow, mineral blue, <b>cobalt</b> <b>green</b> and malachite) with four different binders (i. e. Arabic gum, gouache, egg tempera, and linseed oil), applying them on two different media (i. e. wood and canvas). The resulting samples have been aged in solar box and acquired at different aging times. Surface spectra of each sample were then acquired in VIS-NIR and SWIR ranges. Starting from the collected information (i. e. hypercube) chemometric techniques have been utilized to extract and handle pictorial layers information. The sequential application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) was then applied in order to study the pictorial layers spectra variations linked to the effects of the applied aging cycles. The sensing architectures have been designed and implemented, both at hardware and software level, in order to perform both in-situ (i. e. directly where the painting is) and ex-situ (i. e. at laboratory scale) analyses. The results showed as the developed modelling procedure allows to correctly predict sample characteristics and composition. Furthermore, it is objective, rapid and non-destructive. The implementation of such approach could allow to perform a full monitoring of the state of conservation and/or the characterization of materials and/or supports not easy to assess with conventional techniques...|$|E

His painting medium consisted of oil mixed with some turpentine or sometimes with copal.

50|$|Seurat's palette {{consisted}} of the usual pigments of his time such as <b>cobalt</b> blue, emerald <b>green</b> and vermilion. Additionally, Seurat used then new pigment zinc yellow (zinc chromate), predominantly for yellow highlights in the sunlit grass {{in the middle of}} the painting but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments. In the century and more since the painting's completion, the zinc yellow has darkened to brown—a color degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat's lifetime. The discoloration of the originally bright yellow zinc yellow (zinc chromate) to brownish color is due to the chemical reaction of the chromate ions to orange-colored dichromate ions.In the third stage during 1888-89 Seurat added the colored borders to his composition.|$|R
50|$|The Meenakars engrave {{the surface}} of the metal with {{intricate}} designs using a metal stylus which is then filled in with colors. The Meena is then placed in a furnace where the colors fuse and harden to become one with the surface. Thereafter the piece is then gently rubbed with a file and cleaned with a mixture of lemon and tamarind that helps to highlight the luster of each color. Enamel colors are metal oxides mixed with a tint of finely powdered glass where the oxide content controls the shade obtained The color yellow is obtained through the use of chromate of potash, violet through carbonate of manganese, blue through <b>cobalt</b> oxide, <b>green</b> through copper oxide, brown through red oxide, and black through manganese, iron, and cobalt. The brilliant red is the most difficult of colors to achieve. White and ivory, though difficult, are achieved through a mix of antinomies of potash, hydrated iron oxide, and carbonate of zinc. The colors are applied according to their level of hardness, beginning with the hardest. Before the enamel is applied, {{the surface of}} the ornament is carefully cleaned. In their raw form these mixtures do not always show their true colors, which emerge only when they are fired in the kiln. The average firing temperature is about 850 degrees Celsius. The enamel colors are bought either from Amritsar in the Punjab or from Germany or France.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} medieval period, glass {{factories}} {{were set up}} {{where there was a}} ready supply of silica, the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt it, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as potash, soda, and lead can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as lime, are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state. Copper oxides produce green or bluish <b>green,</b> <b>cobalt</b> makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to flashed glass.|$|R
