40|$|Dry {{clutches}} {{are widely}} used in conventional and innovative automotive drivelines and represent a key element for automated manual transmissions (AMTs). In practical applications, it is fundamental to model the clutch behavior through its torque transmissibility characteristic, i. e., {{the relationship between the}} throwout bearing position (or the pressure applied by the clutch actuator) and the torque transmitted through the clutch during the engagement phase. In this paper, a new model for the torque transmissibility of dry clutches is proposed. It is analyzed how the transmissibility characteristic depends on: friction pads geometry, <b>cushion</b> <b>spring</b> compression, <b>cushion</b> <b>spring</b> load, and slip-speed-dependent friction. Corresponding functions are suitably composed determining the torque transmissibility expression. An experimental procedure for tuning the characteristic parameters is presented.

40|$|An Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) {{system is}} {{generally}} constituted by a dry or wet clutch assembly and a multi-speed gearbox, both equipped with electro-mechanical or electro-hydraulic actuators, which {{are driven by}} a control unit, the transmission control unit (TCU). The operating modes of AMTs are usually two: semiautomatic, with the driver requesting a sequential gear shift {{by means of a}} proper interface or fully automatic. In both cases, after the gear shift command, the TCU manages the shifting steps, through suitable signals to the engine, the clutch assembly and the gearbox, according to current engine regime, driving conditions and selected program. For market sectors such as large-series and ecological cars, AMT has the advantage of lower weight and higher efficiency with respect to other typologies of automatic transmissions. Furthermore, an AMT is directly derived from a manual one through the integration of actuators; then, development and production costs are generally lower than other automatic transmissions, while the reliability and durability are at highest level. For high class sport cars, vehicle dynamic performances and driving quality can further improve the results of the automatic transmissions [1]. This transmission type is also an affordable and robust solution, but the quality of the vehicle propulsion as perceived by the driver is largely dependent {{on the quality of the}} control strategies. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on control schemes for AMTs have shown that uncertainties in clutch torque characteristic can severely affect the performance of the clutch engagement: modelling in detail the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a crucial issue in order to design robust engagement control strategies [2, 3]. This paper aims at investigate the temperature influence on the dry clutch transmission characteristic through the study of physical models which separately taking into account the thermal effect on the frictional behaviour of the clutch facings, the throwout bearing characteristic positions, the <b>cushion</b> <b>spring</b> load-deflection curve.

However the chosen control strategy affects strongly the passenger's comfort and moreover the control action, particularly with regard to the clutch engagement, is influenced by the clutch torque characteristic model implemented in the Transmission Control Unit (TCU). Thus, to use a phenomenological approach to model the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a crucial issue in order to design robust engagement control strategies. Thus, to use a phenomenological approach to model the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a crucial step in order to design robust engagement control strategies.

40|$|Vibrations {{that arise}} during the slip {{phase of the}} clutch in the {{driveline}} of a motor vehicle yield to poor ride quality and result in discomfort and noise. The control systems in modern automated manual transmission systems couldn’t provide good improvement of vehicle longitudinal dynamics during gearshifts without a deep knowledge of the driveline model and its stiffness and damping parameters, along with the frictional conjunction between its main subparts. In this paper an original 5 -degree of freedom mathematical model of the dry clutch mechanism is presented {{with the intention of}} studying the excitation in a passenger car driveline of torsional vibration by frictional actions during the slip phase of the engagement. Furthermore, the analysis aims to deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called “eek noise”, 250 - 500 Hz. The results of this work substantiate that enhancing of torsional motion in the characteristic frequency range of the “eek sound” occurs even regardless of the rigid wobbling motion of the pressure plate and underline the need to include the non-linear characteristic of the clutch <b>cushion</b> <b>spring</b> in the simulation of such a phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|In Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) {{the clutch}} control {{strategies}} {{to manage the}} engagement operation and clutch vibrational behaviour are mutual interdependent and only an optimized mechatronic design could lead to an effective target from several points of view: passengers' comfort, fuel economy, system reliability, performance, driving feeling, etc. In fact, noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) phenomena are crucial subjects in the modern automotive industry. In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldn’t provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the flywheel, clutch and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers. In this paper, simulations of driveline vibrational behaviour have been performed by implementing a high-order multi-body model for the dry clutch mechanism {{with the purpose of}} studying the excitation of torsional vibration caused by frictional actions during the slip phase of the clutch engagement in manual or automated manual transmissions. The analysis aims at deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called “eek noise”, 250 - 500 Hz.

40|$|The {{tribological}} contact under sliding {{condition in}} the clutch facing surfaces during the engagement manoeuvre is strongly affected by heat transfer {{occurring in the}} system. The frictional forces acting on the contact surfaces produce mechanical energy losses which are converted in heat with ensuing temperature increase. Reports about the temperature rise after repeated clutch engagements prove the occurrence of interface temperature peaks as high as 300 °C. Unfortunately, only few papers address their focus towards experiments and their outcomes {{about the influence of}} temperature and the other operating parameters on the frictional behaviour of the clutch facing materials. In this paper, the Authors mainly explored the frictional behaviour modification for thermal level higher than 250 – 300 °C, whose effect is a sharp decline of the friction coefficient related to the decomposition of the phenol resin of the facings. Moreover, this phenomenon induces not expected transition from dry friction to mixed dry-lubricated friction which explains the reasons of the friction coefficient drop. The temperature affects also the <b>cushion</b> <b>spring</b> load-deflection characteristic and the ensuing transmitted clutch torque. Thus, an original frictional map has been implemented in a control algorithm to estimate the heat flux during vehicle launch and up-shift manoeuvres. The results of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics has been used in a FEA to predict the temperature field during repeated clutch engagement on the contact surfaces. The simulation results prove that during each engagement the interface temperature increases of 30 – 35 °C. This means that after only few repeated clutch engagements the temperature field could reach values near the critical point of 300 °C. In such a way, this paper aims at providing useful references to control engineers in order to improve the dry-clutch transmissions performances...|$|E

[...] It had a simple frontage [...] "of the Italian Style," [...] and the Leeds Times described it thus: The box entrance is the central avenue; the foyer is lofty, spacious and well-lighted; the floor is inlaid with tesselated tiles; there is a large and handsome fireplace, with a radiating hearth-stove ... and over the magnificent marble mantelpiece is a large mirror; whilst exquisite statues line the niches on either hand. A large stone staircase leads to the grand tier. The ladies' saloon is a perfect boudoir, for here are ranged round luxurious settees of maplewood covered with silk velvet. Abutting upon the saloon is the lavatory, which is replete with every comfort and convenience requisite for a public place of amusement. Immediately adjacent are the gentlemen's saloons, coffee rooms etc., which are to be fitted up in a very elegant manner.

Hence, in pantomime time, we may expect to see groups of fairies floating about in mid air, descending from the heights above, or ascending from the abyss beneath. To add to effects of this kind, a magnificent gas apparatus has been laid on by Mr Smith, the celebrated gas engineer, from Birmingham, in addition to which an illuminating machine has been obtained in the shape of a new limelight apparatus, by means of which upwards of thirty different colours of lights can be thrown upon the stage at one time.
