The range of internal temperatures was great, with the warmest speci-men being at 243. 5 °C and the cold-est at 290 °C. These findings sug-gested {{that it might}} be useful to study the temperature variation within horizontal <b>chest-type</b> <b>freezers.</b> In 1974, blood samples were ob-tained from 25 802 adult volunteers in Washington County, Maryland.
