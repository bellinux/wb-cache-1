40|$|SummaryBackgroundConsistent {{delivery}} of medication to treat asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{is critical for}} disease control. Dose tracking may eliminate the possibility of sub-therapeutic dosing. This study evaluated the overall performance, including accuracy and ruggedness, of the mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with an integrated numerical dose-counting mechanism in adolescent and adult subjects (aged ≥ 12  y) with persistent asthma or COPD. MethodsIn a phase III, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study, subjects demonstrating at least 90 % compliance with MF/F during the screening period received twice daily MF/F MDI 100 / 10  μg with the integrated dose counter for 4 weeks. Accuracy and ruggedness of the dose counter were assessed by the overall discrepancy rate of subject-recorded actuations versus subject-recorded dose counter readings. Discrepancy rates for Counterstrip™, a manual counting method, were evaluated for reference. Compliance and ergonomic safety were also assessed. ResultsThe 233 subjects who used ≥ 90 % of labeled actuations were included in the primary analysis. Of 26, 317 total actuations, 33 dose counter discrepancies occurred (rate =  0. 13 / 100 actuations), of which 13 were due to undercounting. In comparison, the <b>Counterstrip</b> discrepancy rate was 10 -fold higher (1. 34 / 100 actuations). Compliance with medication use, <b>Counterstrip</b> use, and e-diary recordings were all high (> 98 %). No new repetitive strain injuries or exacerbations of preexisting ergonomic injuries of the finger, hand, or arm were reported. ConclusionsThe MF/F MDI dose counter was accurate and rugged in subjects with asthma or COPD. No new repetitive strain injuries or exacerbations of existing ergonomic injuries were associated with inhaler use.
