25|$|The vital {{information}} {{included in the}} short biographies, the criminal's birthday, his birthplace and age, can be confirmed by the Proceedings and parish registers and there is external evidence regarding other miscellaneous facts like his religion, aliases used and potential reputation as {{a particular type of}} criminal as well. Finding corroboration of the criminal's work history is more difficult: since in the 18th century work relations underwent fundamental changes and much work was casual, seasonal or conducted outside of traditional juridical standards, written documents attesting work transactions are hard to come by. Still, where we <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> external evidence it confirms the condemned account.|$|E
500|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, it is {{time for}} the {{ceremony}} for the [...] "Worker of the Week" [...] award and Homer, the only employee who has never won the award, is confident he will win. However, Mr. Burns gives the award to an [...] "inanimate carbon rod". The dejected Homer, feeling that no one respects him, turns to TV for solace and comes across a live space shuttle launch, which he finds dull. Meanwhile, NASA, frustrated over its drop in the Nielsen ratings, decides to send an [...] "average shmoe" [...] into space as the solution. At that moment, Homer telephones NASA to complain about their [...] "boring space launches", as well as asking if they know where he <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> Tang, and NASA chiefs realize they have found their man. When they arrive at Moe's Tavern in search of Homer, who is currently calling Bill Clinton to ask about Tang, he believes he is in trouble for making a prank call to NASA and blames Barney for the incident. The NASA employees ask Barney to be an astronaut, and when Homer realizes what the proposal entails, he steps in and takes credit for the call.|$|E
500|$|Since late 2006, Romm {{has been}} a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, {{founding}} their climate blog, Climate Progress, which focuses on climate science, policy and reporting. In 2008, Time magazine named his blog one of the [...] "Top 15 Green Websites", writing that it [...] "counters bad science and inane rhetoric with original analysis delivered sharply. ... Romm occupies the intersection of climate science, economics and policy. [...] Resist temptation to lump him in with knee-jerk enviros.

[...] In 2010, Time magazine wrote, [...] "Viewing climate change {{through the prism of}} national security, Romm analyzes breaking energy news and the relevant research, but most important, he challenges the beliefs and conclusions of the mainstream media on climate-change issues." [...] As of 2016, Romm continues to contribute to the site. Romm also writes for other top internet energy and news sites, including The Huffington Post, Grist, Slate, CNN, and Salon.com.

2500|$|.....there surely is {{some common}} ground when both {{those who believe}} in choice and those who are opposed to {{abortion}} can come together and say, 'We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby'. Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform {{for the first time this}} year, and I think that's where we <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation. We should try to reduce these circumstances." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
