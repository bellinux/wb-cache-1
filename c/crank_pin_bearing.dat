5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{redesigned}} the crankshaft to a [...] "split-pin" [...] configuration {{to create}} an [...] "even-firing" [...] version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a 3.0 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from [...] "walking" [...] off the <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> journal and interfering with the adjacent big end. The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> journals, the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the piston pin ends by 1.5 mm. The engine in this configuration became known to have [...] "off-centre bore spacing".|$|E
40|$|Connecting rod and <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> are {{important}} components of automotive diesel engine. If these components failed, all of engine {{system would be}} shut down. In this research, these components failed during operation. Detail analysis of the failed surface showed that the failure in connecting rod and <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> was caused by improper lubrication system. Evidence of improper lubrication system was proved by the existence of black scratch and chipping on <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> which formed by high friction during operation. High friction affects performance of other pistons and therefore bolts of connecting rod experienced dynamic tension load. With repeated load during operation, crack initiated on the bolts and propagated until the bolt could not withstand the load anymore before they are finally broken...|$|E

The film pressure and thickness for three clearances and three lubricant temperatures are calculated. The {{results show that the}} lubricant temperature has a higher effect on film thickness than clearance. In terms of the film parameter, the operating condition that can result in solid–solid contact is investigated. We also suggest the desirable operating conditions of clearance and lubricant temperature to prevent the solid–solid contact.|$|E
50|$|From 1991 to 1998 the {{connecting}} rods were forged steel with standard type <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bearings.</b> SOHC engines, for 1991-1998, used a dished piston design whereas the twin cam engines used a flat top piston with 2 recesses for the intake valves. Twin cam pistons received several re-designs from 1991-2002 {{aimed at reducing}} oil consumption issues. These included reducing the clearance between {{the top of the}} piston and the first compression ring, redesigning the skirts on the pistons and the oiling ports {{on the bottom of the}} pistons. For the 1999 model year all pistons were totally redesigned. Both engines used the flat top pistons with 2 valve recesses and featured a new hypereutectic design with coated skirts. Also for 1999 all connecting rods switched to a powder forged design and cracked bearing caps. The piston pins floated in {{the connecting}} rod bushings. The pistons were cast aluminum alloy with the piston pins being retained with snap rings.|$|R

These have {{feed pipes}} to the bearing surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a loose-fitting pin, {{so that only}} when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice the cups are closed with simple corks, but these {{have a piece of}} porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in the bearing metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.|$|R

The main objective for installing such a system is {{to reduce the risk of}} high cost damage and, thus, increase the overall operational level of safety. However, both the hostile environment inside such large machines and the need for a highly flexible system that easily can be installed and adjusted to different mechanical tolerances have kept exiting solutions form being reliable methods of temperature monitoring on these rotating and orbiting bearings. As an introduction to the main topic of the paper, some selected information on engine damage and causes for such failures - in particular, damage following a detected crosshead and/or <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> failure situation - have been reviewed. Both indirect and direct methods of bearing temperature measurement are discussed. The main section of the paper describe the applied technical solution for real-time temperature monitoring.

40|$|Abstract:The {{crankshaft}} accidents due to vibration become severe {{with increasing}} number of rows of reciprocating compressors. The crankshaft vibration needs to be studied thoroughly to promote development of the reciprocating compressor. Early calculations of crankshaft torsional vibration was mainly with discretization method, the crankshaft is discretized {{into a series of}} lumped inertia and lumped stiffness,then calculate the swing angle of crankshaft in the gas force and inertia force,but because of the simplified calculation,which has low precision. The currently calculation method of crankshaft torsional vibration is simplified into an equivalent system model,the model is composed of a lumped mass disc,massless elastic shaft and a damping. In calculation the torsional natural frequency and forced vibration usually adopt the Holzer method and transfer matrix method,due to this method only calculation the crankshaft torsional direction, so it can only obtained the crankshaft natural frequency and vibration characteristics in the direction. To make the crankshaft torsional vibration calculation more accurately,we proposed a new calculation model based on the flexible multibody dynamics theory. The process of the model establishment and solving by ADAMS was introduced. The torsional vibration of a crankshaft, which often suffers from the crankpin fracture,was calculated before and after the structure change. Results show that before the structure change,the crankshaft natural frequency was closed to the excitation frequency,so that the tortional vibration amplitude of the crankshaft is very large. The stress of piston pins in the first and second row increase so rapidly along the directionof the cylinder center line that the impact factor ofthe <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bearing</b> reache the upper limit,thus the oil film of it is damaged. After the structure change,the natural frequency of crankshaft is away from the excitation frequency,the vibration amplitude of the crankshaft torsional vibration decrease substantially,and the crankpin fracture does not happen anymore. This is a successful validation of the proposed calculation method...|$|E

50|$|V6 engines with un-split shared <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> {{can have}} equally spaced firing when the V-angle is at 120° (60° or 120° for 2-stroke). However, the 120° bank angle makes the engine rather wide, so {{production}} V6 {{tend to use}} 60° angle with a <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> that is offset 60° for the opposing cylinders. As offsetting the <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> {{for as much as}} 60° no longer provides overlap in the diameter of the <b>crank</b> <b>pin,</b> the actual pin is not really an offset 'split' pin, but normally is completely separate in two parts with a thin crank web connecting the two individual pins. This makes the crankshaft structurally weaker, much more so than in the crankshaft with slight offset seen on the Lancia Fulvia V4 with 10.5° to 13° offset, so racing V6 engines from Carlo Chiti-designed 1961 Ferrari 156 engine to Cosworth GBA for Formula One often used the 120° bank angle to avoid this weakness, unless required by the formula as in all the 2014 - 2015 Formula One 1.6 Liter turbo V6 engines that has 90° bank angle according to the regulation.|$|R
50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. The motors drove large cogwheels via {{spring-loaded}} sprockets on each side, and the cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> of the jackshafts drove - via a coupling rod - the <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> {{of the two}} outer drive axles of the bogie. The inner side of this coupling rod contained a pin, which drove the <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> of the two inner drive axles via a second coupling rod. Because {{of the position of}} the motors, and therefore also the jackshaft, the coupling rods were offset slightly relative to the drive axles. From a maintenance point of view this kind of drive was cheaper than a complex split coupling rod, but during service it was considerably more bumpy. For this reason primarily, the locomotive was not used for high speed operation.|$|R

40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade flange, blade carrier bearings and crank disk. In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. spindle arm, 2) geometry gap between blade flange and blade carrier bearings and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and blade carrier bearings, crank disk and blade carrier bearings. Results show that different forces on <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> are obtained from FE simulations when applying same spindle arm close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade flange, blade carrier bearings and crank disk, the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on <b>crank</b> <b>pin.</b> However, the tendency of force on <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|R

According to the {{tangential}} force of <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> approximately for radial force four times, between the radial gas force Fr and tangential gas force Ft {{acting on the}} orbiting scroll, the radial force is invariableness with the spindle rotation angle, but {{tangential force}} Ft with the spindle rotation angle changes, and in the discharge angle θ * at maximum.

50|$|The {{reason for}} the piston's higher speed during the 180° {{rotation}} from mid-stroke through top-dead-centre, and back to mid-stroke, is that the minor contribution to the piston's up/down movement from the connecting rod's change of angle here has {{the same direction as}} the major contribution to the piston's up/down movement from the up/down movement of the <b>crank</b> <b>pin.</b> By contrast, during the 180° rotation from mid-stroke through bottom-dead-centre and back to mid-stroke, the minor contribution to the piston's up/down movement from the connecting rod's change of angle has the opposite direction of the major contribution to the piston's up/down movement from the up/down movement of the <b>crank</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R

50|$|In general, all {{railroad}} vehicles have spring suspension; without springs, {{irregularities in}} the track could lift wheels off {{the rail and}} cause impact damage to both rails and vehicles.
