5|$|A Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) was {{installed}} in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations, and provide real-time information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information. WMATA also provides current train and related information to <b>customers</b> <b>with</b> conventional web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices. In 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside software developers, for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices. Free apps are {{available to the public}} on major mobile device software platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Palm). WMATA also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>Customers</b> <b>with</b> {{their own}} {{installations}} include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes {{data from the}} Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes a breach of the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E

The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change {{of the behavior of}} the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new <b>customers</b> <b>with</b> a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan.

5|$|MetroAccess is a {{paratransit}} service which WMATA provides {{through private}} contractors. It began operation in May 1994 {{and since that}} time annual ridership has grown from 200,000 to more than 2.4 million passengers. MetroAccess operates 365 days a year, providing door-to-door, shared rides reserved from one to seven days in advance. It is now the sixth largest paratransit service in the United States with a fleet of more than 600 vehicles and more than 1,000 employees. WMATA staff determines eligibility to use the service in response to written applications. The cost per passenger for MetroAccess is significantly higher than its fixed-route counterparts, and Metro has worked to provide as many opportunities to encourage and facilitate the use of fixed-route transit by its <b>customers</b> <b>with</b> disabilities.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and {{corporate}} identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and tone down the Norwegian national symbols that had been on the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare <b>customers,</b> <b>with</b> whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E

Allegheny Power restored power to about 20% of its customers by two days after the storm. Most power outages for the company were restored by five days after the hurricane, with all power completely restored by a week after Isabel.|$|E

As a result of the system outage, RBS also announced that they would work with credit rating agencies directly to ensure no customer's credit file was permanently impacted. They also announced that no customer will be permanently out of pocket because of the system outage, and launched a dedicated new freephone helpline for the incident, as well as an online help point to guide and advise <b>customers</b> <b>with</b> any queries they had during the outage.|$|E
5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate <b>customers</b> <b>with</b> SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the <b>customers</b> <b>with</b> a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Resident Evil 1.5, with which Mikami planned {{to end the}} series, was criticized by {{supervisor}} Yoshiki Okamoto, who {{found it to be}} too conclusive to allow for future installments. Instead, Okamoto proposed the creation of a fictional universe that would turn Resident Evil into a metaseries– similar to the Gundam and James Bond franchises– in which self-contained stories with common elements could be told. During a period in which the team made no progress rewriting the scenario, Okamoto was introduced to professional screenwriter Noboru Sugimura, who was enthusiastic about the first game's story. Sugimura was initially consulted on a trial basis, but Okamoto was impressed by the ease with which the writer came up with solutions to the problems that plagued the script, and soon asked him to compose the entire scenario for Resident Evil 2. One fundamental modification to the story was the reworking of Elza Walker into Claire Redfield, in order to introduce a connection to the plot of the first game. To fulfill Capcom's sales plan of two million copies, director Kamiya tried to attract new <b>customers</b> <b>with</b> a more ostentatious and Hollywood-like story presentation. As Okamoto did not want to simply enforce the new direction, he had Sugimura discuss the plot revisions with Mikami and the development staff. The planners redesigned the game from the ground up to fit the changes, and the programmers and other remaining members of the team were sent to work on Resident Evil Director's Cut, which was shipped with a playable preview disc of the new Resident Evil 2 version in order to promote the sequel and to apologize to the players for its belated release.|$|E
