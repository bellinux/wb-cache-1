5|$|The Scots names picktarnie, tarrock {{and their}} many {{variants}} are also {{believed to be}} onomatopoeic, derived from the distinctive call. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species, all the informal common names are shared with the <b>common</b> <b>tern.</b>|$|E
5|$|Otters, grey seals, {{killer whales}} and harbour {{porpoises}} are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour. Atlantic puffin, Arctic and <b>common</b> <b>tern,</b> bonxie and Arctic skua, northern fulmar, common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the <b>common</b> <b>tern),</b> and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
40|$|Machias Seal Island (MSI) is a 9. 5 ha, {{treeless}} island {{located at}} the mouth of the Bay of Fundy, 20 km south of Grand Manan. It is designated a Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) Migratory Bird Sanctuary and managed by CWS because it is the breeding grounds of a large number of seabirds, including both arctic and <b>common</b> <b>terns.</b> The Atlantic Cooperative Wildlife Research Network (ACWERN) has been conducting long-term studies on MSI since 1995. One research goal is to assess the ecological differences between Arctic and <b>Common</b> <b>Terns.</b> As a part of this project, we are radio tracking Arctic and <b>Common</b> <b>Terns</b> to determine where they feed around MSI. Preliminary data sug-gests that <b>common</b> <b>terns</b> feed both inshore and far offshore, whereas arctic terns seem to feed solely offshore. The next step is to relate feeding areas to characteristics of the marine environment, and to investigate whether Arctic and <b>Common</b> <b>Terns</b> which nest together also forage together...|$|R

The banks of the Detroit River near the Trenton Channel Power Plant are one of the only places in the region where <b>common</b> <b>terns</b> regularly nest and breed. Other birds, such as bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and great blue herons also use the grounds for habitat.|$|R

5|$|Both sexes {{agree on}} a site for a nest, and both will defend the site. During this time, the male {{continues}} to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the <b>common</b> <b>tern.</b> It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.|$|E
5|$|While the Arctic tern {{is similar}} to the common and roseate terns, its colouring, profile, and call are {{slightly}} different. Compared to the <b>common</b> <b>tern,</b> it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the roseate.|$|E
5|$|External parasites include chewing lice of {{the genus}} Saemundssonia, feather lice and fleas such as Ceratophyllus borealis. Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite {{different}} species. Internal parasites include the crustacean Reighardia sternae, and tapeworms such as Ligula intestinalis {{and members of the}} genera Diphyllobothrium and Schistocephalus. Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry Haemoproteus species. An exception is the brown noddy, which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus. In 1961 the <b>common</b> <b>tern</b> was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West Nile virus.|$|E

40|$|Multivariate {{techniques}} {{were used to}} examine overall characteristics of colonies, and detailed characteristics of nest sites within colonies, of Roseate and <b>Common</b> <b>terns</b> in the Azores archipelago. The characteristics of the nest sites were compared (1) with the available habitat and (2) between colonies, species and early and late nesting birds (Roseateterns only). Larger colonies occured far from the mainland, human setlements and other tern colonies, which reveals the importance of islets situated relatively far from sources of disturbance, predation and potencial competition for feeding resources. Both species showed markedly different nest site preferences: Roseate terns nested at areas with high relief and/or tall vegetation and <b>Common</b> <b>terns</b> selected open areas. Roseate terns nested within higher densities and their nestswere less visible from above {{than those of the}} Commons. Differences between the characteristics of early and late Roseate tern nests were attributed to seasonal changes in the vegetation structure of the habitat. Discriminant analysis indicated that the characteristics of Roseate tern nests differed more from the available habitat than those of <b>Common</b> <b>terns,</b> suggesting a more specialised nesting preference by Roseates. It is suggested that these nesting differences are primarily a result of preferences developed during allopatric speciation. Evidence of competition for nest sites between Roseate and <b>Common</b> <b>terns</b> was not found with this observational approach. It is speculated that <b>Common</b> <b>terns</b> might prevent younger Roseates from nesting in the open areas of mixed colonies. This idea is formulated in a model. The need to maintain optimal areas for nesting Roseate terns is stressed...|$|R
5|$|Terns {{have a wide}} {{repertoire}} of vocalisations. For example, the <b>common</b> <b>tern</b> has a distinctive alarm, kee-yah, also used {{as a warning to}} intruders, and a shorter kyar, given as an individual takes flight in response to a more serious threat; this quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. Other calls include a down-slurred keeur given when an adult is approaching the nest with a fish, and a kip uttered during social contact. Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and siblings also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.|$|E
25|$|The lagoon {{is noted}} {{for the large}} {{population}} of <b>common</b> <b>tern</b> and sandwich tern in summer, and a very large flock of avocets in winter, when over 50% of British birds (over 1500) can be present.|$|E

25|$|The colours and {{distributions}} of retinal oil droplets vary considerably among species, {{and is more}} dependent on the ecological niche utilised (hunter, fisher, herbivore) than genetic relationships. As examples, diurnal hunters like the barn swallow and birds of prey have few coloured droplets, whereas the surface fishing <b>common</b> <b>tern</b> has {{a large number of}} red and yellow droplets in the dorsal retina. The evidence suggests that oil droplets respond to natural selection faster than the cone's visual pigments. Even within the range of wavelengths that are visible to humans, passerine birds can detect colour differences that humans do not register. This finer discrimination, together with the ability to see ultraviolet light, means that many species show sexual dichromatism that is visible to birds but not humans.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the plants}} that exist at Fajã dos Cubres the {{predominant}} species include, the sharp-pointed rush (Juncus acutus), along the lagoon, Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota) and the Azorean spurge (Euphorbia azorica). The presence of estuary grasses (Ruppia maritima) within the lagoon is of great importance, since they were exceptional within the Azores (and only at this site). The fajã {{has a variety of}} typical marine flora and fauna, and its lagoon has become a natural refuge for diverse marine and migratory birds. Nesting birds include the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), yellow-legged gull (Larus cachinnans atlantis) and the <b>common</b> <b>tern</b> (Sterna hirundo). In addition, annually, farmers bring cattle down to the fajã to graze. Although prohibited now, at one time fishing occurred in the lagoon, mostly mullet and anchovies, using netting techniques.|$|E

500|$|There {{are eight}} main pools in the reserve, {{some of which}} are {{maintained}} to support specific flora or fauna. [...] At the centre of the reserve is East Marsh Pool, the largest of the pools, which contains two islands. Tern Island is composed of gravel and pebbles which attracts certain species to breed here, notably <b>common</b> <b>tern</b> and little ringed plover. [...] There are also a number of artificial rafts on the pool, again to induce <b>common</b> <b>tern</b> to breed; eight pairs did so in 2008. Willow Island is much larger and more grassy, providing suitable areas for lapwing, common redshank and green sandpiper. The existence of the islands helps to prevent the nests of species such as these being predated by foxes. There are three hides overlooking the pool. [...] An artificial structure alongside the pool is designed to attract sand martins to breed, as they did when the gravel quarry was operational; this was successful {{for the first time in}} 2009, with eight nestholes occupied and over 40 young fledged.|$|E
500|$|Terns have a {{worldwide}} distribution, breeding on all continents including Antarctica. The northernmost and southernmost breeders are the Arctic tern and Antarctic tern respectively.

500|$|... {{with dark}} splotches, {{so they are}} {{difficult}} for predators to spot on the beach. The precocial chicks fledge in about four weeks after hatching. Tropical species take longer because of the poorer food supply. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female does more incubating and less fishing than her partner. Young birds migrate with the adults. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with individuals typically returning for 7–10 breeding seasons. Maximum known ages include 34 for an Arctic tern and 32 for a sooty. Although several other species are known to live in captivity for up to 20 years, their greatest recorded ages are underestimates because the birds can outlive their rings. Interbreeding between tern species is rare, and involves closely related species when it occurs. Hybrids recorded include <b>common</b> <b>tern</b> with roseate, Sandwich with lesser-crested, and black with white-winged.|$|E
50|$|While {{sometimes}} {{detrimental to}} seabird habitat, management of tree mallow (both planting and thinning) {{has been successfully}} employed to shelter nesting sites of the threatened roseate tern, which requires more coverage than <b>common</b> <b>terns</b> to impede predation.|$|R
50|$|There is a bird {{observation}} hide at {{the east}} end of Breydon Water, on the north shore, looking out towards a breeding platform used mainly by <b>common</b> <b>terns.</b> Other breeding species include shelduck, shovelers, oystercatchers and yellow wagtails.|$|R
