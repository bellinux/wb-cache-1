A comparison is made, between calculated emissions using either product flow data from Statistics Sweden or from other domestic floor branch sources. At Statistics Sweden, existing databases, published statistics and available methods were used for identifying and illustrating the possible methods and barriers for extraction and combination of product flow data. For calculations of emissions a combined material flow and diffusive mass transfer model was developed and used. This case study shows that the data categories and the methods needed for estimating the accumulated product area exist at Statistics Sweden, in principle, but the data is sometimes too aggregated or too protected to make the calculations on a detailed product category level, as in this case for <b>PVC</b> <b>flooring.</b> Using product flow data from the least aggregated level of the Combined Nomenclature, for <b>PVC</b> <b>flooring,</b> generates calculated emissions three {{times higher than the}} emissions calculated from the more specific product flow data from The Swedish Flooring Trade Association. The <b>PVC</b> <b>flooring</b> case study boils down to the facing of a trade off when it comes to national emission assessment of several product categories; using data from Statistics Sweden generates emissions within a reasonable period of time, but with aggregated and in this case, too high values – using branch product flow data generates more accurate emission values but is not a plausible option due to the steep increase in resource demands...|$|R

40|$|Children are {{constantly}} exposed to many chemicals via the products {{they come in}} contactwith in their everyday life. One chemical group is phthalates, the most commonly usedplasticisers in the world. Phthalates are used mainly in PVC plastic products like floors, toys,food containers and wallpaper {{but they are also}} used in rubber, glue, paint, cables etc. Sincethese chemicals are weakly chemically bound to the PVC they can leak and migrate to the air,food, water and skin. Children are exposed to phthalates mainly through food, but because ofthe hand to mouth behaviour they are also exposed via dust inhalation and dust ingestion. About ten years ago regulations of the most toxic phthalates in toys and child care productswere implemented in the EU and from February 2015 it is a general prohibition for the use ofDEHP (diethylhexyl phthalate), DnBP (di-n-butyl phthalate), DiBP (diisobutyl phthalate) andBBzP (butyl benzyl phthalate). DiNP (diisononyl phthalate) is a relatively new phthalate andit has replaced DEHP to some extent in floors and toys. In phthalate free products DINCH(1, 2 -cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester) is one of the plasticizer replacingphthalates. The banned phthalates have been shown to cause adverse effects on reproductionand recent research also investigates links between phthalate exposure and asthma and allergysymptoms in children. More experimental animal studies are needed to further investigate theasthma and allergy correlation. In the present project dust samples were collected from 30 preschool indoor environments inthe Stockholm city area to evaluate the levels of the six substances mentioned and thephthalate DEP (diethyl phthalate). The main aim of this thesis project was to search forrelations and links between the phthalate concentrations in dust and parameters from theindoor environment in preschools. Studied parameters are e. g. construction year, floor type,cleaning routines and quantity of toys and furniture made of plastic or foam. The project wascommissioned by the Swedish EPA and performed at the Institute of Environmental Medicine(IMM) at Karolinska Institutet. A negative relation was found between dust phthalate (DEHP and DnBP) concentrationand construction year. Also rooms with old <b>PVC</b> <b>floors</b> had higher concentrations of DEHPand DnBP in dust than rooms with new <b>PVC</b> <b>floors.</b> There was also a trend that dust frompreschools with <b>PVC</b> <b>floors</b> had higher DiNP concentration than dust from preschools withother floor types. The preschools that used foam mattresses for resting had higher DiNPconcentrations than those with no foam mattresses. Most preschools had new foammattresses, which could indicate a more common use of DiNP in new mattresses or mattress 2 covers compared to old mattresses that contains more DEHP. The four Waldorf preschoolsthat participated had lower DiNP dust concentrations than the other preschools, which wasexpected since Waldorf orientation includes using as little plastic material as possible. Norelation was found between the phthalate dust concentrations and the quantity of toys made ofsoft plastic in the sampled area. Many preschools had made a plastic inventory where they removed old and soft plastic toysand material. Also many preschools recently replaced old foam mattresses used for resting. This could be due to the big chemical focus in the media and authorities and the brochuresthat have been sent out {{the last couple of years}} about what preschool can do to decrease thechemical exposure of children. This interest and awareness seen in the preschools waspositive and hopefully the trend spreads to more preschools.

The results were used to establish a mechanistic model to improve assessment of dermal contact exposure. Four types of <b>PVC</b> <b>flooring,</b> 10 types of textiles and one type of inkjet printed paper were used to establish the mechanisms and model. Kinetic extraction studies in methanol demonstrated existence of matrix diffusion and indicated {{the presence of a}} substance surface layer on some articles. Consequently, the proposed substance transfer model considers mechanical transport from a surface film and matrix diffusion in an article with a known initial total substance concentration. The estimated chemical substance transfer values to cotton wipes were comparable to the literature data (relative transfer ∼ 2 %), whereas relative transfer efficiencies from spiked substrates were high (∼ 50 %). For consumer articles, high correlation (r 2 = 0. 92) was observed between predicted and measured transfer efficiencies, but concentrations were overpredicted by a factor of 10. Adjusting the relative transfer from about 50 % used in the model to about 2. 5 % removed overprediction.

These flooring products are produced by calendering compounds based on vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer filled with calcium carbonate, essentially with plasticizers and other additives. Plasticizers have become matter of concern from indoor air quality (IAQ) point of view as they are suspected to be the one of the sources of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, considered harmful to human health. In the research work reported here, polyolefin elastomers (POE) filled with calcium carbonate filler are prepared and their mechanical properties are evaluated as an alternative to poly(vinyl chloride), <b>PVC</b> matrix for <b>flooring</b> products. POEs are olefin copolymers synthesized using metallocene technology and does not require plasticizers for processing, yet can provide similar flexibility to the finished product as that of plasticized PVC.

Dust was collected from two portions of the living area: floor dust from the entire floor surface, and multi-surface dust from objects more than 35 cm above the floor. The levels of seven phthalates were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in selective ion monitoring mode. Phthalate levels were higher in multi-surface dust than in floor dust Among floor dust samples, those from dwellings with compressed wooden flooring had significantly higher levels of di-iso-butyl phthalate compared to those with other floor materials, while polyvinyl chloride (<b>PVC)</b> <b>flooring</b> was associated with higher di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) levels. Among multi-surface dust samples, higher levels of DEHP and di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DINP) were found in samples from homes with PVC wallpaper than without The number of PVC interior materials was significantly positively correlated with the levels of DEHP and DINP in multi-surface dust.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aim is to}} develop alternative cost-effective poly (vinyl chloride) PVC formulation that possesses good mechanical properties, resistant to microbial attack, with low volatile organic compounds (VOC's) emission, {{as well as to}} explore a market for lignin, an abundant natural polymer, obtained as a by-product of paper making. One of the main applications of plasticized PVC for building industry is the production of flooring. Normally in the manufacture industry of the <b>PVC</b> <b>flooring</b> di-ethyl-hexyl-phthalate (DEHP), commercially known as DOP is used as a plasticizer to facilitate the processing of PVC. DOP is environmental pollutant due to its biodegradability that consequently releases VOC's; considering this hazard, the introduction of other biopolymers and other additives in PVC formulation could contribute to a safer and healthier environment. DOP has been used in this research for comparative purpose only. Series of plasticized PVC formulations were prepared with different types of plasticizers namely: Di-octyl phthalate (DOP), Diethylene glycol dibenzoate (Benzoflex 2 - 45), Tricresyl phosphate (Lindol) and Alkyl sulfonic acid phenyl ester (Mesamoll). Meanwhile, the role of lignin within the mixtures was evaluated, as part of the PVC was replaced with different lignins namely Organosolv, Indulin and Tomlinite (20 phr of PVC). The new proposed alternative flooring material was prepared by melt mixing and compression molding, and tested to evaluate its processibility, thermal properties, mechanical properties (i. e., Young's modulus, tensile strength at break and yield, elongation at break) as well as its morphology. In addition, the different formulations resistance to fungi attack was studied {{as a function of the}} samples weight loss, and their fungal growth was evaluated visually. Also, the impact of this growth on the mechanical and thermal properties of the different presented formulations was studied to evaluate their bio-deterioration. Moreover, considering the introduction of new formulations, their ageing behavior due to inherent instability of the amorphous glassy state, known as volume recovery or structural relaxation is studied. Finally, the primary emissions (i. e., free non-bound VOC's, which generally have low molecular weight) of VOC's are identified and quantifie...|$|R
40|$|Congreso celebrado en la Escuela de Arquitectura de la Universidad de Sevilla desde el 24 hasta el 26 de junio de 2015. Civil {{engineering}} {{structures such as}} office floors and singular footbridges may present vibration modes locally spatially distributed with closely spaced natural frequencies. A set of tuned mass dampers (TMDs) may control several vibration modes {{at the same time}} and make the control system more robust. However, under these circumstances, Den Hartog’s theory may not be applicable. In this paper, an optimum algorithm to design a set of TMDs is proposed to cancel effectively human-induced vibrations for floor structures. A comparative study is carried out in terms of the same performance indicator to find the optimum system, considering different configurations by Den Hartog’s classical approach and this optimal algorithm. This proposed algorithm will contribute to motivate future researches on passive vibration control (<b>PVC)</b> for <b>floor</b> vibrations with closely spaced natural frequencies...|$|R

The same study found that DEHP, BBzP, and DnOP were in significantly higher concentrations in dust samples collected in homes where polishing agents were used.

40|$|There {{were two}} {{principal}} objectives for this thesis. The first {{was to develop}} a methodology and evaluation model of moisture redistribution {{in order to make the}} future relative humidity in a screeded concrete slab predictable. The second objective {{was to develop a}} method to determine the critical humidity for ion transport in concrete. Residual moisture in screeded concrete slabs may be redistributed to the top screed surface under a semi-permeable flooring, thus elevating the relative humidity, RH, and possibly exceeding the critical humidity level. Passing the critical humidity level may result in material damage to the flooring and adhesive. In order to avoid such damage there is a need of a methodology to estimate the maximum humidity obtained underneath flooring. The redistribution of residual moisture may increase the concentration of alkali at the contact area between the adhesive and concrete. This alkali increase may initiate and sustain adhesive deterioration, which is a common moisture related damage. Several screeded concrete slabs with <b>PVC</b> <b>flooring</b> were prepared to reproduce and monitor moisture distribution and the subsequent redistribution. The moisture distribution before flooring and after a certain period of redistribution is presented. In addition, sorption isotherms including scanning curves were determined in a sorption balance for materials used in the floor constructions, viz, w/c 0. 65 concrete, w/c 0. 4 concrete, w/c 0. 55 cement mortar, and Floor 4310 Fibre Flow, a self levelling flooring compound. Repeated absorption and desorption scanning curves starting from the desorption isotherm were also investigated. The measurements performed made it possible to develop both a qualitative and quantitative model of moisture redistribution and to quantify the humidity achieved under the flooring. The hysteresis phenomenon of the sorption isotherm is considered in the model. The model is well suited for estimations of the future RH underneath flooring in a screeded concrete slab and may also be used on homogeneous slabs. Results from previous research suggested that early drying of the concrete slab can mitigate the increase in relative humidity that occurs when an impermeable floor covering is installed. A study was conducted to verify these results. The results of this new study of the effects of early drying could not demonstrate any significant difference between an early and late dehydration. The redistribution of ions under different moisture conditions was investigated with a newly developed method. The method is divided into a preconditioning of test specimens and also a method to determine the redistribution of potassium ions. This preconditioning provides a well defined moisture condition of the specimen, which is important for determining the critical humidity for the transport of ions. The redistribution is detected by examining the ion content distribution before and after the preconditioning of ion species already present in the concrete. Previous research in this area has been conducted through adding chloride ions to the specimens. However, redistribution of chloride ions is impeded in that they bind to the inner pore surfaces, which poses a risk that the critical moisture level may be affected/misjudged...|$|R
40|$|For {{flooring}} applications, calcium carbonate-filled poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, {{has long}} been the material of choice for both flexible sheeting and tile products. However, PVC-based formulations must be processed with plasticizers, which have recently raised some concerns from a sustainability point of view. In the research work reported here, calcium carbonate-filled formulations based on polyolefin plastomers, POP, are prepared in a laboratory-scale mixer, and their mechanical properties are studied for flooring applications. Plastomers are olefin copolymers synthesized using new metallocene catalyst technologies. The POP plastomer used in this research is Affinity 1140 a copolymer of ethylene and octene, and does not require any plasticizers for processing. The key mechanical properties of the calcium carbonate-filled POP, which include tensile strength, elongation and impact strength, are found to compare very favourably to those of PVC formulations at filler loadings of 200 phr. In addition, the filled POP formulations are able to incorporate a significant amount of post-consumer polyethylene(PC-PE) while maintaining adequate physical properties. Two types of PC-PE are tested in this research work: the first one is a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and the second is a high density polyethylene (HDPE). The DSC analysis technique is used to study the difference in behavior between the two recycled resins. Dimensional stability tests are also reported, indicating that POP composites contract slightly more than the PVC-based ones. Overall, this study shows that calcium carbonate-filled POP should be studied further as a more sustainable alternative to filled <b>PVC</b> for <b>flooring</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{compounds}} in indoor air can adversely affect our comfort and health. However, {{in most cases}} {{there is only a}} limited amount of information available {{that can be used to}} assess their health risk. Instead the precautionary principle is often applied, i. e. efforts are made to ensure that the concentrations of pollutants are kept at a minimum when constructing new buildings or conducting renovations by using low-emitting building materials. Today, when investigating buildings in order to solve indoor air quality problems, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are sampled in the air within rooms. The chemical composition of indoor air is complex and there are many sources for the chemicals present. The potential for emissions from sources in hidden spaces such as wall cavities is poorly understood and little information exists on the toxic potential of chemical releases resulting from moisture-related degradation of building materials. Most of the non-reactive VOCs that have been detected in indoor air in field studies and from building products are not believed to cause health problems. However, reactive compounds and chemical reaction products have the potential to negatively influence our comfort and health even at low concentrations. Even though the impact of chemical compounds on health is unclear in many cases, they can be used to identify technical problems in buildings. When a building is investigated, the air inside building structures could be sampled. This method would eliminate emissions from sources other than the construction materials and the samples would contain higher levels of individual compounds. The aims of this work was to identify emissions profiles for different types of building structures, to see if the emission profiles for moisture damaged and undamaged structures differed, and to determine whether any of the emissions profiles for specific structures also could be found in indoor air. Technical investigations and VOC sampling were performed in 21 different buildings with and without previous moisture damage. Seven of the buildings were investigated in the years 2005 - 2006 (study 1) and fourteen in the years 2009 - 2010 (study 2). In study 1, sixty samples were analyzed by PCA at the chemical group level (18 chemical groups, i. e. aldehydes, ketones etc). 41 % of all identified chemical compounds belonged to the hydrocarbon chemical group. The second largest chemical groups, each of which accounted for 5 - 10 % of all identified compounds, were alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and terpenes. The results indicated that one of the main factors that determined the emissions profile of a building structure was the materials used in its construction. Notably, concrete and wooden structures were found to have different emissions profiles. The sum of VOC (TVOC) concentrations for all 241 samples from both study 1 and study 2 was used to compare total emissions between different building elements (ground and higher floors, external walls and roof spaces). Most building elements exhibited relatively low emissions compared to concrete ground floors, which generally had higher TVOC emissions. Emissions from both polystyrene insulation and <b>PVC</b> <b>flooring</b> could be identified in concrete ground floors and were the main cause for the higher emissions found in these structures. Profiles for wood preservatives such as creosote and pentachlorophenol were also identified in external walls. The emission profiles found in the structures could not be identified in the indoor air in the adjacent rooms, although individual compounds were sometimes detected at low concentrations. Our results showed that the main factors influencing emissions in building structures were the construction materials and the nature of the building element in question. Because of difficulties with finding active water damage at the times of sampling and because of sampling inside closed building structures with old dried-out moisture damages, the field method used in this work was unsuitable for identifying differences in emission profiles between moisture damaged and undamaged structures. It will thus be necessary to investigate this difference in a laboratory where the precise composition of all tested structures is known, a range of RH values can be tested and the accumulation of emissions can be followed.
