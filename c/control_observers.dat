40|$|A local {{reconfiguration}} algorithm (INP) for reliable routing in wireless sensor {{networks that}} consist of many static (fixed) energy-constrained nodes is introduced in the dissertation. For routing around crash fault nodes, a communication tree structure connecting sensor nodes to the base station (sink or root) is dynamically reconfigured during information dissemination. Unlike other location based routing approaches, INP does not take any support from a high costing system that gives position information such as GPS. For reconfigurations, INP uses only local relational information in the tree structure among nearby nodes by collaboration between the nodes that does not need global maintenance, so that INP is energy efficient and it scales to large sensor networks. The performance of the algorithm is compared to the single path with repair routing scheme (SWR) that uses a global metric and the modified GRAdient broadcast scheme (GRAB-F) that uses interleaving multiple paths by computation and by simulations. The comparisons demonstrate that using local relative information is mostly enough for reconfigurations, and it consumes less energy and mostly better delivery rates than other algorithms especially in dense environments. For the <b>control</b> <b>observer</b> to know the network health status, two new diagnosis algorithms (Repre and Local) that deal with crash faults for {{wireless sensor networks}} are also introduced in the dissertation. The <b>control</b> <b>observer</b> knows not only the static faults found by periodic testing but also the dynamic faults found by a path reconfiguration algorithm like INP that is invoked from evidence during information dissemination. With based on this information, the <b>control</b> <b>observer</b> properly treats the network without lateness. Local algorithm is introduced for providing scalability to reduce communication energy consumption when the network size grows. The performance of these algorithms is computationally compared with other crash faults identification algorithm (WSNDiag). The comparisons demonstrate that maintaining the communication tree with local reconfigurations in Repre and Local needs less energy than making a tree per each diagnosis procedure in WSNDiag. They also demonstrate that providing scalability in Local needs less energy than other approaches...|$|R

The suppressive flank effect in amblyopes might be explained by abnormal pooling of second-order contrast across visual space. In this study, we investigate whether amblyopes show abnormal second-order spatial summation by measuring contrast detection thresholds for 1 c/deg modulations of random noise (stimuli 1 – 12 cycles) in amblyopic observers, strabismic observers with no visual acuity loss, and normal (<b>control)</b> <b>observers.</b> Non-control observers showed substantial bilateral loss of sensitivity relative to the <b>control</b> <b>observers,</b> as expected. However, all observers showed essentially equal second-order spatial summation: contrast detection threshold decreased with approximately the square root {{of the number of}} cycles, and then became independent of size at 6 – 8 cycles (similar asymptotes).

We {{evaluated}} how {{the performance}} of recognizing familiar face images depends on the internal (eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth) and external face features (chin, outline of face, hairline) in individuals with central vision loss. Methods. In experiment 1, we measured eye movements for four observers with central vision loss {{to determine whether they}} fixated more often on the internal or the external features of face images while attempting to recognize the images. We then measured the accuracy for recognizing face images that contained only the internal, only the external, or both internal and external features (experiment 2) and for hybrid images where the internal and external features came from two different source images (experiment 3) for five observers with central vision loss and four age-matched <b>control</b> <b>observers.</b> Results. When recognizing familiar face images, approximately 40 % of the fixations of observers with central vision loss was centered on the external features of faces. The recognition accuracy was higher for images containing only external features (66. 8 +/- 3. 3 % correct) than for images containing only internal features (35. 8 +/- 15. 0 %), a finding contradicting that of <b>control</b> <b>observers.</b> For hybrid face images, observers with central vision loss responded more accurately to the external features (50. 4 +/- 17. 8 %) than to the internal features (9. 3 +/- 4. 9 %), whereas <b>control</b> <b>observers</b> did not show the same bias toward responding to the external features. Conclusions. Contrary to people with normal vision who rely more on the internal features of face images for recognizing familiar faces, individuals with central vision loss show a higher dependence on using external features of face images...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that unilaterally enucleated observers demonstrate better luminance-defined form perception compared to monocularly viewing controls, and similar performance to <b>control</b> <b>observers</b> viewing binocularly (Vision Res. 37 (17) (1997) 2465). In Experiment 1 we asked whether the perception of form, where form is defined by other attributes than luminance, is also improved compared to monocularly viewing controls. We tested 16 enucleated observers and 25 controls viewing monocularly and binocularly for their ability to detect and recognize form from texture (texture-defined (TD) form) and form from motion (motion-defined (MD) form). There was no difference between the three groups for TD form perception. However, enucleated observers had significantly poorer MD form perception than did binocularly viewing controls. In Experiment 2 we asked whether poor performance on the perception of MD form might be due to a general reduction in motion processing abilities. To examine this possibility, we used a motion coherence task. We tested eight unilaterally enucleated and 14 monocularly and binocularly viewing <b>control</b> <b>observers</b> on a horizontal coherent motion discrimination task. The monocularly viewing controls showed no naso-temporal asymmetry in direction discrimination for coherent motion. In contrast, the enucleated group showed an asymmetry in direction discrimination where temporalward motion coherence thresholds were significantly higher than those for nasalward motion. These latter findings are discussed in terms of the absence of binocular competition during the development of motion processing path...|$|E

In contrast, she performed relatively normally on many face categorization tasks. D.

F. can use configural information for categorizing faces when they are presented in an upright but not a sideways orientation and given that she also cannot discriminate half-faces she may rely on a spatially symmetric feature arrangement. Faces appear to be a unique category, which she can classify even when she has no advance knowledge that she will be shown face images. Together, these imaging and behavioral data support the importance of the integrity of a complex network of regions for face identification, including more than just the FFA—in particular the OFA, a region believed to be associated with low-level processing...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSpatial {{uncertainty}} and undersampling {{are two of}} the major hypotheses for the losses of amblyopic spatial vision. To test these two hypotheses, equivalent spatial {{uncertainty and}} spatial integration efficiency in spatial position judgments were quantified with a spatial perturbation paradigm. Specifically, three-line bisection thresholds were measured for the amblyopic eyes of two strabismic and two anisometropic amblyopes, and for normal controls. The horizontal stimulus lines comprised discrete dark dots distributed randomly around the mean line position according to a gaussian function. Line separation, the number of dots on each line (N), stimulus contrast (C), and the vertical standard deviation (σe) of the dot distribution were varied. An ideal observer analysis quantified the magnitude of equivalent spatial uncertainty (σs), the effective number of dots used (k), and spatial integration efficiency (kN). At the optimal separation, equivalent spatial uncertainty (σs) is approximately ten-fold higher in both types of amblyopic visual systems than in <b>control</b> <b>observers,</b> even when stimulus visibility is accounted for. This apparent increase in σs is largely due to a shift in spatial scale of analysis in the amblyopic eye. Integration efficiency (kN) increases in proportion to stimulus contrast or visibility (in units of detection threshold). Unlike σs, kN is different between the two types of amblyopia. For the anisometropic observers, kN is quantitatively similar to that of <b>control</b> <b>observers.</b> For the strabismic observers, on the other hand, kN is reduced even after taking stimulus visibility into account. The decreased spatial integration efficiency in the strabismic visual system suggests that spatial undersampling may occur at a secondary stage of visual processing, beyond the detection stage...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Asperger Autism is {{a lifelong}} {{psychiatric}} condition with highly circumscribed interests and routines, problems in social cognition, verbal and nonverbal communication, and also perceptual abnormalities with sensory hypersensitivity. To objectify both lower-level visual and cognitive alterations we looked for differences in visual event-related potentials (EEG) between Asperger observers and matched controls while they observed simple checkerboard stimuli. METHODS: In a balanced oddball paradigm checkerboards of two checksizes (0. 6 ° and 1. 2 °) were presented with different frequencies. Participants counted the occurrence times of the rare fine or rare coarse checkerboards in different experimental conditions. We focused on early visual ERP differences {{as a function of}} checkerboard size and the classical P 3 b ERP component as an indicator of cognitive processing. RESULTS: We found an early (100 - 200 ms after stimulus onset) occipital ERP effect of checkerboard size (dominant spatial frequency). This effect was weaker in the Asperger than in the <b>control</b> <b>observers.</b> Further a typical parietal/central oddball-P 3 b occurred at 500 ms with the rare checkerboards. The P 3 b showed a right-hemispheric lateralization, which was more prominent in Asperger than in <b>control</b> <b>observers.</b> DISCUSSION: The difference in the early occipital ERP effect between the two groups may be a physiological marker of differences in the processing of small visual details in Asperger observers compared to normal controls. The stronger lateralization of the P 3 b in Asperger observers may indicate a stronger involvement of the right-hemispheric network of bottom-up attention. The lateralization of the P 3 b signal might be a compensatory consequence of the compromised early checksize effect. Higher-level analytical information processing units may need to compensate for difficulties in low-level signal analysis...|$|E

The sensorless control scheme {{is based on a}} high-order sliding mode (HOSM) observer to estimate the DFIG rotational speed. Indeed, high-order sliding mode observers provide theoretically finite time exact state observation and estimation of absolutely continuous unknown inputs. The proposed global control strategy combines an MPPT using a high-order sliding mode speed observer and a high-order sliding mode for the DFIG control. This strategy presents attractive features such as chattering-free behavior, finite reaching time, robustness and unmodeled dynamics (generator and turbine).
