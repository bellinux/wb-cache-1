40|$|Clinical {{mastitis}} {{caused by}} E. coli accounts for significant production losses and animal welfare concerns on dairy farms worldwide. The benefits of therapeutic intervention in {{mild to moderate}} cases are incompletely understood. We investigated the effect of intramammary treatment with <b>cefapirin</b> alone or in combination with prednisolone on gene expression profiles in experimentally-induced E. coli mastitis in six mid-lactating Holstein Friesian cows. Cows were challenged with E. coli in 3 quarters and received 4 doses of 300 mg <b>cefapirin</b> in one quarter and 4 doses of 300 mg <b>cefapirin</b> together with 20 mg prednisolone in another quarter. At 24 h (n =  3) or 48 h (n =  3) post-challenge, tissue samples from control and treated quarters were collected for microarray analysis. Gene expression analysis of challenged, un-treated quarters revealed an up-regulation of transcripts associated with immune response functions compared to un-challenged quarters. Both treatments resulted in down-regulation of these transcripts compared to challenged, un-treated quarters most prominently for genes representing Chemokine and TLR-signaling pathways. Gene expression of Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein (LBP), CCL 2 and CXCL 2 were only significantly down-regulated in cefapirin-prednisolone-treated quarters compared to un-treated controls. Down-regulation of chemokines was further confirmed {{on the basis of}} protein levels in milk whey for CXCL 1, CXCL 2 and CXCL 8 in both treatments with a greater decrease in cefapirin-prednisolone-treated quarters. The data reveal a significant effect of treatment on cell recruitment with a more pronounced effect in cefapirin-prednisolone treated quarters. Provided a rapid bacteriological clearance, combination therapy may prevent neutrophil-induced tissue damage and promote recovery of the gland...|$|E
40|$|Peracetic acid (PAA) is a {{disinfection}} oxidant {{used in many}} industries including wastewater treatment. beta-Lactams, a {{group of}} widely prescribed antibiotics, are frequently detected in wastewater effluents and surface waters. The reaction kinetics and transformation of seven beta-lactams (cefalexin (CFX), cefadroxil (CFR), <b>cefapirin</b> (CFP), cephalothin (CFT), ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin (AMX) and penicillin G (PG)) toward PM were investigated to elucidate the behavior of beta-lactams during PAA oxidation processes. The reaction follows second-order kinetics and is much faster at pH 5 and 7 than at pH 9 due to speciation of PM. Reactivity to PAA follows the order of CFR similar to CFX > AMP similar to AMX > CFT CFP similar to PG and is related to beta-lactam's nucleophilicity. The thioether sulfur of beta-lactams is attacked by PAA to generate sulfoxide products. Presence of the phenylglycinyl amino group on beta-lactams can significantly influence electron distribution and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) location and energy in ways that enhance the reactivity to PM. Reaction rate constants obtained in clean water matrix {{can be used to}} accurately model the decay of beta-lactams by PM in surface water matrix and only slightly overestimate the decay in wastewater matrix. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the oxidative transformation of beta-lactams by PM can be expected under appropriate wastewater treatment conditions. 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
