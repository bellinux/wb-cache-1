40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} novel strategies for generating rate-compatible (RC) irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with short/moderate block lengths. We propose three puncturing and two extension schemes, which {{are designed to}} determine the puncturing positions that minimize the performance degradation and the extension that maximize the performance. The first puncturing scheme employs a <b>counting</b> <b>cycle</b> algorithm and a grouping strategy for variable nodes having short cycles of equal length in the Tanner Graph (TG). The second scheme relies on a metric called Extrinsic Message Degree (EMD) and the third scheme is a simulation-based exhaustive search {{to find the best}} puncturing pattern among several random ones. In addition, we devise two layer-structured extension schemes based on a <b>counting</b> <b>cycle</b> algorithm and an EMD metric which are applied to design RC-LDPC codes.

40|$|The wind-excited {{vibrations}} {{of structures}} induce fluctuating stresses {{that lead to}} fatigue damage accumulation and may determine structural failure without exceeding ultimate strength. This paper proposes a mathematical model aimed at deriving the histogram of the stress cycles, the accumulated damage, and the fatigue life of slender vertical structures exposed to simultaneous alongwind and crosswind vibrations. Wind climate is modeled by the joint density function of the mean wind velocity and direction. Wind-induced actions consist of aerodynamic forces on the stationary structure and of aeroelastic forces due to the structural motion. Aerodynamic actions on the stationary structure are caused by the turbulence of the oncoming flow, dealt with through quasisteady theory, and by the vortex wake, considered as independent from turbulence. Aeroelastic forces are aimed at reproducing the lock-in phenomenon. The static and the quasistatic parts of the structural response are evaluated by the influence function technique, taking all modes of vibrations into consideration. The resonant part of the response {{is related to the}} fundamental alongwind and crosswind modes only. The probabilistic accumulation of damage due to aerodynamic actions on stationary structures is estimated by a <b>counting</b> <b>cycle</b> method inspired by narrow band processes. The damage in lock-in conditions is superimposed by counting stress cycles deterministically. The examples illustrate the application and the effectiveness of the proposed procedure, focusing attention on the role of upper modes and wind directionality...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel methodology {{for evaluation of}} in service loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions. It also {{presents a}} novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals {{as an alternative to}} the cycle counting methods. Current durability testing of automatic transmission output shafts uses 50 000 stall torque cycles from zero to wide open throttle. In the majority of cases, these requirements lead to an over design that can result in an unnecessarily bulky transmission system. As a solution to this problem a novel methodology for evaluation of loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions was developed. The methodology is based on real world loading conditions and therefore leads to a more realistic estimation of the fatigue life of shafts. The methodology can be used as a tool for shaft optimisation in different drive conditions. Using the developed methodology the effects of different road conditions on the fatigue life of a transmission output shaft were compared. Four routes having differing driving conditions were investigated and of those routes, the route with most stop-start events resulted in the greatest reduction in fatigue life. A novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals was also developed. The methodology is based on knowledge of the bandwidth and dynamic range of the expected in-service load signal. This novel methodology allows significant reduction of the volume of data to be acquired. It preserves the time sequence of peaks and valleys of the signal, which is vital in the case of fatigue analysis. This is in contrast to current methods based on cycle <b>counting.</b> <b>Cycle</b> counting methods achieve high data reduction but do not preserve the time sequence of the signal. The developed novel methodology has been validated on the newly developed data acquisition system capable of real time data acquisition and compression of shaft torque signal.
