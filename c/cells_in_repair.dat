40|$|Background: Despite {{increasing}} {{attention on}} the role of bone marrow derived stem <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>repair</b> or rejuvenation of tissues and organs, cellular mechanisms of such cell-based therapy remain poorly understood. Methods: We reconstituted hematopoiesis in recipient C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by transplanting syngeneic GFP+ bone marrow (BM) cells. Subsequently, the recipients received subcutaneous injection of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and were subjected to acute renal ischemic injury. Flow cytometry and immunostaining were performed at various time points to assess engraftment and phenotype of BM derived stem cells. Results: Administration of G-CSF increased the release of BM derived stem cells into circulation and enhanced the ensuing recruitment of BM derived stem cells into injured kidney. During the second month post injury, migrated BM derived stem cells lost hematopoietic phenotype (CD 45) but maintained the expression of other markers (Sca- 1, CD 133 and CD 44), suggesting their potential of transdifferentiation into renal stem cells. Moreover, G-CSF treatment enhanced the phenotypic conversion. Conclusion: Our work depicted a time-course dependent transition of phenotypic characteristics of BM derived stem cells, demonstrated the existence of BM derived stem cells in damaged kidney and revealed the effects of G-CSF on cell transdifferentiation...|$|E
40|$|In the UK, the {{two main}} {{treatments}} of invasive bladder cancer are radiotherapy or cystectomy. However, approximately 50 % of patients undergoing radiotherapy fail to respond. If tumour radiosensitivity could be predicted in advance, {{it may be possible}} to improve control rates significantly by selecting for radiotherapy those patients whose tumours are radiosensitive. Additionally, patients who would benefit from surgery would be identified earlier. The alkaline comet assay (ACA) is a sensitive method for the detection of DNA strand break damage in cells. In the present study, using six bladder cancer cell lines of differing radiosensitivities, cell survival was compared to the manifestation of radiogenic DNA damage as assessed by ACA. For all the cell lines, the extent of comet formation strongly correlates with cell killing (R 2 > 0. 96), with a greater response being noted in radiosensitive <b>cells.</b> <b>In</b> <b>repair</b> studies, measures of residual damage correlate with survival fraction at 2 Gy (R 2 > 0. 96), but for only five of the cell lines. Finally, cells from human bladder tumour biopsies reveal a wide range of predicted radiosensitivies as determined by ACA. Overall, these studies demonstrate ACA to be a good predictive measure of bladder cancer cell radiosensitivity at low dose, with potential clinical application.

40|$|Nasal chondrocytes (NC) were {{previously}} demonstrated to remain viable {{and to participate}} in the repair of articular cartilage defects in goats. Here, we investigated critical features of tissue-engineered grafts generated by NC in this large animal model, namely cell retention at the implantation site, architecture and integration with adjacent tissues, and effects on subchondral bone changes. In this study, isolated autologous goat NC (gNC) and goat articular chondrocytes (gAC, as control) were expanded, green fluorescent protein-labelled and seeded on a type I/III collagen membrane. After chondrogenic differentiation, tissue-engineered grafts were implanted into chondral defects (6 [*]mm in diameter) in the stifle joint for 3 or 6 months. At the time of explantation, surrounding tissues showed no or very low (only in the infrapatellar fat pad < 0. 32 %) migration of the grafted <b>cells.</b> <b>In</b> <b>repair</b> tissue, gNC formed typical structures of articular cartilage, such as flattened cells at the surface and column-like clusters in the middle layers. Semi-quantitative histological evaluation revealed efficient integration of the grafted tissues with the adjacent native cartilage and underlying subchondral bone. A significantly increased subchondral bone area, as a sign for the onset of osteoarthritis, was observed following treatment of cartilage defects with gAC-, but not with gNC-grafts. Our results reinforce the use of NC-based engineered tissue for articular cartilage repair and preliminarily indicate their potential for the treatment of early osteoarthritic defects...|$|E

Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) {{have been shown to}} be an important determinant of resolution in an experimental model of lung injury. We demonstrate that intratracheal delivery of endotoxin (LPS) elicits alveolar epithelial damage from which the epithelium undergoes proliferation and repair. Epithelial proliferation coincided with an increase in Foxp 3 + Treg cells in the lung during the course of resolution. To dissect the role that Foxp 3 + Treg cells exert on epithelial proliferation, we depleted Foxp 3 + Treg cells which led to decreased alveolar epithelial proliferation and delayed lung injury recovery. Furthermore, antibody-mediated blockade of CD 103, an integrin, which binds to epithelial expressed E-cadherin decreased Foxp 3 + Treg numbers and decreased rates of epithelial proliferation after injury. In a non-inflammatory model of regenerative alveologenesis, left lung pneumonectomy (PNX), we found that Foxp 3 + Treg cells enhanced epithelial proliferation. Moreover, Foxp 3 + Treg cells co-cultured with primary type II alveolar cells (AT 2) directly increased AT 2 cell proliferation in a CD 103 -dependent manner.

The two significant features represented for stem cells, leading to distinguish them from other cell types are addressed as below: they can renew themselves besides the ability to differentiate into cells with special function as their potency. Researches about the role of stem <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>repair</b> of damaged tissues in different organs like myocardium, lung, wound healing, and others are developing. In addition, the use of stem cells in the treatment and improving symptoms of neurological diseases such as autism are known.

The role of these cells in the secretion of hormones and growth factors in the niche, induction of cell division and differentiation in local cells and differentiation of stem cells in damaged tissue is the samples of effects of tissue repair by stem cells.

40|$|Zhicheng Zhang, Fang Li, Tiansheng Sun, Dajiang Ren, Xiumei Liu PLA Institute of Orthopedics, Beijing Army General Hospital, Beijing, People&# 39;s Republic of China Background: Many {{previous}} {{studies have focused on}} the effects of IN- 1, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes Nogo (a neurite growth inhibitory protein), on neurologic regeneration in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, safety problems and the short half-life of the exogenous antibody are still problematic. In the present study, the NogoA polypeptide was used as an antigen to make a therapeutic NogoA vaccine. Rats were immunized with this vaccine and were able to secrete the polyclonal antibody before SCI. The antibody can block NogoA within the injured spinal cord when the antibody gains access to the spinal cord due to a compromised blood–spinal cord barrier. Olfactory ensheathing glial cell transplantation has been used in a spinal cord contusion model to promote the recovery of SCI. The present study was designed to verify the efficacy and safety of NogoA polypeptide vaccine, the effects of immunotherapy with this vaccine, and the synergistic effects of the vaccine and olfactory ensheathing glial <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>repair</b> of SCI. Methods: A 13 -polypeptide fragment of NogoA was synthesized. This fragment was then coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin to improve the immunogenicity of the polypeptide vaccine. Immunization via injection into the abdominal cavity was performed in rats before SCI. The serum antibody level and ability of the vaccine to bind with Nogo were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The safety of the vaccine was evaluated according to the incidence and severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Olfactory ensheathing glia cells were obtained, purified, and subsequently implanted into a Wistar rat model of thoracic spinal cord contusion injury. The rats were divided into four groups, ie, an SCI model group, an olfactory ensheathing glia group, a vaccine group, and a combined treatment group. Animal behavior, histopathology, and axonal regeneration were compared between the four treatment groups. Results: The antibody against the polypeptide was detected in rat serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was not found in the immunized rats. Three months after injury, Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores and nerve fiber counts in biotinylated dextran amine nerve tracing studies were significantly better in the combined treatment group than in the other groups. Conclusion: The polypeptide NogoA vaccine can stimulate the humoral immune system to produce antibodies against the NogoA polypeptide. The binding reaction between the antibody and antigen was shown in ex vivo experiments. No evidence was found to suggest a relationship between NogoA vaccination and increased risk of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The combined strategy of olfactory ensheathing glial cell implantation and NogoA vaccination may promote regeneration of axons and functional recovery in the spinal cord contusion injury model. This study may provide a new strategy for combining modalities to enhance axonal regeneration and a better balance of the CNS microenvironment after SCI.

40|$|The role of {{bone marrow}} <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>repairing</b> {{ectodermal}} tissue, such as skin epidermis, is not clear.
