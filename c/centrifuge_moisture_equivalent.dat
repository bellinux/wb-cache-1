Our objectives were to assess the potential of open-pollinated COPOP 1 semi-dwarf corn for grain and forage production, estimate genetic variances and heritability in COPOP 1, and develop COPOP 1 subpopulations that exhibit heterosis. In 2005 and 2006, we evaluated COPOP 1 with four commercial, non-dwarf hybrids at three plant population densities. Grain yield of open-pollinated COPOP 1 was {{about half of the}} mean yield of the conventional hybrids. However, COPOP 1 had lower grain <b>moisture</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to 62 days RM) and better forage quality than the commercial hybrids. In 2007, COPOP 1 was evaluated for performance when crossed to two divergent inbred testers, LH 227 and LH 295.

Dark color, heavy clay texture, granular mulch, and slickensides on the surfaces of parallelepipeds were characteristic of most of the profiles. Hence, they are similar to other Black Earths in morphology. The silt contents and bulk density values shown by the profiles were lower than other Black Earths. The clay contents and, subsequently, the moisture retention at saturation, at <b>moisture</b> <b>equivalent,</b> and at 15 atmospheres were higher. The pH values of the Hawaii Black Earths were similar to those from other countries but the ΔpH values were much higher. Calcium and magnesium status was high.

An immediate application is to Rocky Flats (RF) materials derived from highgrade metal hydriding separations subsequently treated by multiple calcination cycles. Specifically evaluated are weight changes due to oxidatiodreduction of multivalent impurity oxides that could mask true <b>moisture</b> <b>equivalent</b> content measurement. Process knowledge and characterization of materials representing complex-wide materials to be stabilized and packaged according to STD- 3013, and particularly for the immediate RF target stream, indicate that oxides of uranium, iron and gallium are the only potential multivalent constituents expected to be present above 0. 5 wt. %. The evaluation shows that of these constituents, with few exceptions, only uranium oxides can be present at a sufficient level to produce weight gain biases significant {{with respect to the}} LO 1 stability test. In general, these formerly high-value, high-actinide content materials are reliably identifiable by process knowledge and measurement. Si&icant bias also requires that UO 1 components remain largely unoxidized after calcination and are largely converted to U 30 s clsning LO 1 testing at only slightly higher temperatures. Based on wellestablished literature, it is judged unlikely that this set of conditions will be realized in practice. We conclude that it is very likely that LO 1 weight gain bias will be small for the immediate target RF oxide materials containing greater than 80 wt. % plutonium plus a much smaller uranium content. Recommended tests are in progress to confum these expectations and to provide a more authoritative basis for bounding LO 1 oxidatiodreduction biases. LO 1 bias evaluation is more difficult for lower purity materials and for fuel-type uranium-plutonium oxides. However, even in these cases testing may show that bias effects are manageable...|$|R

It has been shown that water {{competition}} from the shade trees during the dry season is the factor responsible for the failure in growing coffee under shade in São Paulo. In all cases where the coffee plants were not thriving well under shade, the soil moisture after two to three months of drought was at the wilting point at the depths most utilised by the root systems of shade trees and coffee plants. In open plantations this was never observed. All commercial coffee plantations of Central America are shaded. Most of them are located in areas with a dry season as long as in São Paulo and some times even longer. A comparative study of the climatological factors, methods of cultivation and most common species of shade trees was made. No one of these factors explained the different behavior of the coffee plant under shade in Central America and in São Paulo. The available soil water was measured in many coffee plantations in Costa Rica and El Salvador after four months without apreeiable rainfall. In all cases it was' found that, the actual moisture percentage was considerably higher than the wilting point. The amount of available water held by soils in São Paulo and Central America {{does not seem to be}} significantly different, although this was not carefully determined. It is suggested that a comparative study of the moisture-tension curves of soils of São Paulo and Central America might explain the different behavior of the coffee plant with shade under these two different conditions. It is possible that, as a consequence of a much steeper moisture-tension curve, the plants in São Paulo soils transpire freely until the soil moisture reaches the wilting point. This would result in a rapid soil water consumption. If the Central American soils have a smoother moisture-tension curve, the Avater absorption and transpiration rate by plants may be slower and as a consequence the available water may last longer in the soil. The ratio of the <b>moisture</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the wilting point was found to be around 1. 29 for the soils studied in the Meseta Central of Costa Rica, around 1. 44 for those in El Salvador and 1. 94 for the ashy soils in the vicinity of San Salvador volcano...|$|R

A Reddish Brown (Waikaloa), two Reddish Prairie (Mahoelua and Waikii), and a Latosolic Brown Forest soil (Hanipoe) were included in this study. The degree of weathering of the soil material increased in the order, Waikaloa < Mahoelua < Waikii <Hanipoe and decreased with depth for each profile. Soil properties were found to vary with the degree of weathering. The following relations among these soils were found: 1. Organic carbon content increased in the order given above. It decreased with depth in the first three soils, but varied irregularly with depth in the Hanipoe soil. Nitrogen was highly correlated with carbon in the four soils. 2. Within a given soil profile, phosphorus was highly correlated with carbon. The soil phosphorus was found to be mainly in the inorganic form. The phosphorus content of the surface soils was related to the rate of organic matter production, while the carbon content was related to the ratio of the rate of production and decomposition of organic matter. Based on these assumptions, it was shown that the organic matter production was lowest in the Waikaloa soil, highest in the Mahoelua, and decreased in the order, Mahoelua, Waikii, and Hanipoe. Decomposition rates decreased in the order, Waika 10 a, Mahoelua, Waikii, and Hanipoe soils. 3. There was a significant correlation between <b>moisture</b> <b>equivalent</b> and 15 atmosphere percentage of the Waikaloa, M 3. hoelua, and Waikii soils.

Comparison of exchange curves of some synthetic silica, aluminosilicate and alumina gels to those of soils and clays suggested that (a) the functional groups which gave inflection points near pH 8 were due to surface silanol groups; (b) functional groups which were effective in cation exchange in the acid range were probably due to internal charges which were attributable to tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum atom's; and (c) silanol groups of discrete silica units were present in these soils. 5.

Obteve-se dados de equilíbrio de adsorção de umidade a 15 °C e 35 °C, através de um método estático, onde recipientes de 500 mL, contendo soluções saturadas de sais, foram utilizados como ambientes geradores de umidades relativas constantes, na faixa de 11 % a 97 %, aos quais foram submetidas amostras do produto. A partir dos dados de equilíbrio foram construídas isotermas de adsorção de umidade, sendo observadas isotermas do tipo III e, ainda, que a umidade de equilíbrio diminui com o aumento da temperatura. Determinou-se o calor isostérico de adsorção para diferentes níveis de umidade de equilíbrio e a umidade equivalente à monocamada, observando-se valores inferiores a 5 g H 2 O/ 100 g s. s. Verificou-se a aplicabilidade do modelo GAB na predição de dados de equilíbrio do produto. De acordo com os resultados obtidos, a farinha de pupunha apresenta baixa higroscopicidade, ou seja, baixa afinidade por moléculas de água. It was {{studied the}} {{hygroscopic}} {{behavior of the}} pupunha flour obtained by drying in the oven at 70 °C. It was collected data of moisture adsorption for two temperatures (15 °C and 35 °C), using the static method, where the recipients with the capacity of 500 mL, having saturated salt solutions, it was used as environment generators of constant relative humidity, ranging from 11 % to 97 %, which were submitted the samples of the product. From the equilibrium data, it was built isotherms of moisture adsorption, being observed type III isotherms, but even that the equilibrium moisture for the product decreases with the temperature increase. It was determined the isosteric heat of adsorption for different levels of equilibrium <b>moisture</b> and the <b>equivalent</b> <b>moisture</b> to the monolayer, which were inferior of 5 g H 2 O/ 100 g s. s. It was verified {{the application of the}} GAB model in the equilibrium data prediction for the product. According to the results obtained, the pupunha flour shows low hygroscopicity, low affinity for water molecule...|$|R
