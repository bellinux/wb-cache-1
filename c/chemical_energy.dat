5|$|Highly {{concentrated}} {{sources of}} oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, {{is needed to}} trigger combustion.

5|$|Once {{growth and}} {{development}} are completed, vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs {{that make up a}} multicellular organism; they also enable a multicellular life form to efficiently use <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> provided by food it eats, and to help process the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} plants is vital because they {{underpin}} almost all animal life on Earth by generating {{a large proportion}} of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> they need to exist. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a source of <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.|$|E

5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Phototrophic archaea use {{light to}} produce <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> {{in the form}} of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like {{bacteriorhodopsin}} and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the structure of a retinol cofactor buried {{in the center of the}} protein.|$|E

5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as <b>chemical</b> <b>energy.</b> However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E

25|$|A {{fuel cell}} is an {{electrochemical}} cell that converts the <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> from a fuel into electricity through an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen fuel with oxygen or another oxidizing agent.

Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously {{for as long as}} fuel and oxygen are supplied.|$|E

25|$|Metabolism, {{including}} {{taking in}} raw materials, building cell components, converting energy, molecules and releasing by-products.

25|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of any entity {{depends on the}} {{reference}} frame {{in which it is}} measured. However the total energy of an isolated system, i.e. one in which energy can neither enter nor leave, does not change over time in the reference frame in which it is measured. Thus, the <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> converted to kinetic energy by a rocket engine is divided differently between the rocket ship and its exhaust stream depending upon the chosen reference frame. This is called the Oberth effect. But the total energy of the system, including kinetic energy, fuel <b>chemical</b> <b>energy,</b> heat, etc., is conserved over time, regardless of the choice of reference frame. Different observers moving with different reference frames would however disagree on the value of this conserved energy.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{the law of}} {{conservation}} of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system in a given frame of reference remains constant — {{it is said to}} be conserved over time. In other words, this law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed from one form to another. For instance, <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes. If one adds up all the <b>chemical</b> <b>energy</b> that is expended in the explosion, one will get the exact amount of kinetic energy that is generated. Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass; however, special relativity showed that mass could be converted to energy and vice versa by E = mc2, and science now takes the view that mass–energy is conserved.|$|E
