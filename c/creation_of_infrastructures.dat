Using both quantitative and qualitative data on high schools in New York City, we examine the organizational structures that allow a sustained focus on student learning while the leadership is undergoing a transition. As the management literature shows “high levels of employee turnover {{are found to be}} both the cause and effect of problematic conditions, and low performance in organizations ” (Ingersoll, 1999, pg 7). This is relevant for schools as well since research on school reform shows that organizational stability is an important component of a healthy school (Tesh, 1991; Hanushek & Rivkin, 2000; Purkey & Degen, 1985). Leadership transitions, particularly, {{in the early years of}} development, can be especially problematic as many organizations, including schools, begin as innovative entities that are dependent on the energy of a charismatic leader and an enthusiastic staff. New York State has seen a surge of new school development in recent years in the form of small high schools and charter schools.

A legal framework has been created, and resources have increased enormously, particularly over the last decade, including a 407 % increase in funding for libraries. In 2003 there were 275 public library authorities and 389 public libraries. The majority of the network is conformed by small community libraries, managed by local authorities. Buildings, staff, opening hours, collections, and other standard indicators show average figures that fall below international recommendations. 50 % of all libraries have less than 100 m 2, and 87 % less than 230 m 2. The ratio of library staff per 1, 000 residents is 0. 17. Opening hours in 2003 averaged 26. 30 per week. The current figure of items per resident is 1. 024 and acquisitions 0. 063 items per capita.

40|$|Objectives: This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a critical overview of the development of nursing research capacity in academic departments. It examines the major barriers to developing research capacity, the capacity building strategies adopted (or proposed) within the literature, and considers the wider context within which such endeavours take place. Design: The literature review forms part of a longitudinal project utilising case study methodology. A key word search was used to locate relevant journal articles for the period 1999 – 2004, derived from the project's research question and an earlier literature review. A number of manual ‘shelf searches’ were conducted. Data Sources: Bibliographic data were retrieved from The Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health literature, The Social Science Citation Index, and Medline. Review Methods: Approximately 150 articles were retrieved, of which 47 were included in the study. Given the paucity of work in this area papers were not excluded on the grounds of methodological weakness. Major themes were identified in each paper and an analytical framework was developed. Results: Two main challenges affecting research capacity development were identified—material constraints and organisational contexts, and the changing roles and expectations of nurse educators. The importance of developing an overall strategic approach, clearly communicated, and accompanied by effective leadership was a point of common agreement. Debate existed on how research support should be managed, particularly the merits of inclusivity and the reconcilement of individual and organisational needs. Specific capacity strategies identified in the literature were the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> the fostering of research cultures and environments, and the facilitation of training and collaboration. Conclusions: The literature offers many examples of capacity building strategies. However, more empirical studies are needed to understand the situated process of implementing and evaluating capacity building in individual academic departments, and how this process differs between geographical settings...|$|E
40|$|What is malaria? Ackerknecht wrote malaria was “fundamentally social” (1945); anthropologists Kelly and Beisel believe malaria’s “historical, sociological and {{political}} life... exceeds {{the moment of}} the parasitological exchange” (2011). In this dissertation, I argue malaria’s complexities make it impossible to divorce the ontological question (What is malaria?) from the epistemological question of How do we know what we know about malaria? To address these questions, I analyze malaria control efforts in British India and in the Allies’ Pacific campaign of World War II, tracking the creation and institutionalization of knowledge production and control practices, as well as the infrastructures that were created or adapted to control malaria in ways that became natural and common sense. I focus on the articulations and practices of coordination between humans, landscapes, and non-human agents (parasites, mosquitoes, maps, surveys, DDT, etc.) in the resistances and successes of human malaria control practices. 	 I begin in British India and trace the stabilization of knowledge around the mosquito as the malaria vector and the development of mapping practices central to creating and standardizing understandings and articulations of malaria, as well as in shaping official control policies. Engaging a neglected era in malaria’s history, the rest of the dissertation focuses on the Allies’ Pacific malaria control efforts, analyzing the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and implementation of practices that helped to articulate malaria as a local, multi-species disease, and significantly lowered malaria infection rates. I follow the work of malariologists, entomologists, parasitologists, engineers, cartographers, cartoonists, and enlisted men through their practices of creating reports, catching and dissecting mosquitoes, conducting and analyzing surveys and blood smears, making maps, creating public health campaigns, and engineering projects that relocated populations of people and reduced or eliminated populations of mosquitoes. These practices and objects required coordination and translation to articulate malaria as a legible object across specializations as well as up and down command hierarchies. 	Using civilian and military archival sources, and theories from critical geography, science and technology studies, and communication, this dissertation attends to the complex practices, multi-species coordinations, and work of translation needed for effective malaria control strategies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how {{the expansion of}} a steam-powered Royal Navy from {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century had wider ramifications across the British Empire. In particular, it considers how steam propulsion made vessels utterly dependent on a particular resource – coal – and its distribution around the world. In doing so, it shows that the ‘coal question’, almost totally ignored in previous histories, was central to questions of imperial and trade defence, required the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that spanned the globe, and connected British sailors with a plethora of different imperial, maritime, and foreign peoples. Although a limited number of studies have highlighted the importance of coal to imperial defence, this thesis considers the wider context of the period 1870 − 1914 in order to understand the significant place of coal in these discussions. In doing so, it shows coal’s place within wider changes to political ideologies, imperial defence schemes, popular imperialism and navalism, knowledge collection, and the growth of the state apparatus. A robust coaling infrastructure was required to ensure quality naval coal was available globally on a huge geographical scale. This involved a large number of bodies, but this has never been examined by scholars for this period. Although naval coaling relied heavily on the coal export industry, the Admiralty had a key role in ensuring that the infrastructure, particularly after 1880, could cope with increases in ship size and number and competition from its rivals. The thesis also shows how these processes worked on the ground, from testing and purchasing coal to the methods and labour used to load in on warships. The thesis also shows that the necessity of coaling in foreign stations fostered new interactions between naval personnel and the wider world. Although naval visits to these places are prime examples of British encounters beyond its own shores at the zenith of empire, these are largely absent from existing studies. Thus, it explores how the interactions with local populations, other maritime visitors, and the stations themselves shaped the experience of sailors abroad, and created a maritime community spanning large oceanic spaces...|$|E

40|$|Medical students’ {{access to}} {{clinical}} supervision when rotating through hospital workplaces {{and the quality}} of that supervision are and have been an area of growing professional and societal concern. Increased training measures targeted at supervising physicians have been suggested to address this issue. Traditionally, such training has focused on offering physicians opportunities to develop as supervisors in off-site courses. This thesis applies the insights of social practice theory to investigate and discuss the implications of adopting a practice-centred, workplace learning approach to faculty development among clinical supervisors in a Swedish medical education and healthcare context. In cycles of mixed methods and action research, I construct a model for faculty development and implement it in collaboration with physicians and students in different hospital settings. Workplace learning (practice) theory is applied to analyse and frame the findings from investigations of different stakeholders’ experiences of the model. This includes an analysis of the environmental and individual factors that influence the learning- and implementation process. Assessment instruments are developed and incorporated into the model to trigger collective analyses of the students’ learning climate and supervision approaches. The validity and reliability of instruments scores are examined. The educational developer’s experiences are documented and critically reflected on. Based on the findings, I propose a model for faculty development– the On-Site Model. The model is underpinned by principles that place value on learning that is: workplace-situated; practice-based; collaborative & co-regulated; student-focused; and autonomy-conducive (guided by appreciative inquiry). The model centers on collaborative development of the learning environment and supervision practice. Together {{and with the help of}} students, supervisors analyse the possibilities and barriers for a desired state (an ideal student learning environment) and determine their own intermediate steps and means to develop in this direction. The analysis of factors influencing the model shows that interrelated structural and sociocultural variables and variables related to individual and relational agency define the workplace learning environment and condition the type of developmental learning afforded by the principles. For instance, segmented care processes, the organizational logic of production, and the length and structure of student rotations influence opportunities for continuity of relationships and collaborations. At the same time, clinical department managers and faculty members challenged structural impediments and supported the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to enable collaborations, developmental learning and innovations. A salient finding was how clinical supervisors developed a sense of togetherness that empowered them to challenge cultures and structural barriers and achieve desired changes in practice. The instruments proved to have a high degree of construct validity. However, the thesis problematises how methods are used to evaluate construct validity and the usability of instrument scores. It suggests the use of instruments as part of an open, multidirectional feedback system. In conclusion, the thesis findings indicate that attention to students’ perceptions of the learning environment can contribute to an increased focus on the workplace as a learning environment for physician learners at all levels. It illuminates several strategic implications of an On-Site model. Among other things, I suggest further exploration of the ways in which the model may be integrated as one of many activities into a system for continuing professional development constructed in cooperation between the higher education and the healthcare organizations. I argue that the On-Site model is an important supplement to continuing professional development based on individual physicians’ needs for competencies, as it focuses on collaborative practice development and collective competence-building. In extension, this may include the interprofessional collaborative learning and building of collective competence necessary to address current and future needs of healthcare...|$|E
40|$|Depois de consolidado o seu território continental, Portugal desde o século XIV procurou expandir o seu território além-fronteiras. Foram inúmeros e de várias áreas os portugueses que divulgaram o nome de Portugal lá fora, por muitos cabos e tormentas que tivessem de dobrar. Esta dissertação versará sobre um deles, não com o objetivo de ser um estudo monográfico, mas sim uma forma diferente de dar a conhecer a pessoa e a sua obra. Com obras construídas em Lisboa, Funchal, Goa e Macau, o arquiteto Manuel Vicente é um “aluno do oriente”, que desde cedo desenvolveu uma intensa atividade em Macau, principalmente a partir dos anos 60, onde em conjunto com outros arquitetos como por exemplo Chorão Ramalho ou mais tarde Natália Gomes desenvolveu projetos notáveis, com características fortes e de linguagem pessoal. Manuel Vicente era um arquiteto vanguardista. Com facilidade respondia às necessidades do projeto, preocupando-se com o enquadramento com a cidade, com a estética ou até mesmo com os destinatários do projeto e suas problemáticas, trouxe com ele e para a arquitetura uma nova forma de pensar, quebrou com os modelos arquitetónicos da altura, demarcando-se em relação a outros arquitetos. A incidência em Macau é uma constante, pois é lá que grande parte de sua obra foi construída, juntando-se assim a um dos legados mais significativos da cultura portuguesa além-fronteiras, que atualmente se encontra a desaparecer. As décadas de 60, 70 e 80 do século passado, são os anos mais marcantes da obra de Manuel Vicente em Macau. É nos anos 60 que se assiste ao grande crescimento e expansão urbanística, {{territorial}} e de equipamentos, a cujos programas Manuel Vicente deu forma. Os anos 80 ficaram ainda marcados, para além da criação de infraestruturas, pela recuperação de património, como é o caso do edifício TDM – Televisão de Macau. Já nos anos 90 verifica-se uma dimensão mais ampla na criação de projetos. After having strengthened its continental territory, {{from the}} 14 th century on, Portugal successfully managed {{to expand its}} territory beyond its borders. There were endless Portuguese remarkable people with different academic skills and qualifications, who did take, spread and made the name of Portugal become known abroad, no matter which or how many hardships they had to face and overcome. This dissertation of mine is {{going to focus on}} one of these men, not in order to be a monographic study, but having in mind and aiming at making both the man and his work known, in a different approach. With works built in Lisbon, Funchal, Goa and Macau, the architect Manuel Vicente is a so-called “learner of the East”, who soon played a very important and prominent role in his area in Macau, mainly from the 60 s on, where together with other architects like Chorão Ramalho or even later Natália Gomes, developed remarkable projects depicting strong features pointing out a very personal and unique architectural language. Manuel Vicente was undoubtedly an avant-garde architect. He could easily find an answer to all needs of a project always taking into account and concerned with its frame in society, never forgetting the aesthetics or even the citizens and their problems as well, he was able to bring a new way of thinking to architecture, he managed to break with the architectural models at the time, this way standing out and imposing himself in the architectural scene. The focus on Macau is a constant, once it’s there that most of his work was built, thus joining {{one of the most striking}} legacies of the Portuguese culture overseas, which is nowadays disappearing. The 60 s, 70 s and 80 s of the last century are undoubtedly the most remarkable years of Manuel Vicente’s work in Macau. It’s in the 60 s that there is a “boom” in growth, urban expansion, land, equipments, whose projects Manuel Vicente was responsible for. The 80 ’s were still marked, besides the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> by recovery of patrimony, such the TDM building – Television of Macau.
