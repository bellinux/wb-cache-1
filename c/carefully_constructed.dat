5|$|In 1955, Fisher, {{exhausted}} by the constant pressure, returned to Moscow for six months of rest and recuperation, leaving Häyhänen in charge. While in Moscow, Fisher informed his superiors of his dissatisfaction with Häyhänen. Upon his return to New York in 1956, he found that his <b>carefully</b> <b>constructed</b> network had been left to disintegrate in his absence. Fisher checked his drop points only to find messages several months old, while Häyhänen's radio transmissions had routinely been sent from the same location using incorrect radio frequencies. The money Häyhänen received from the KGB to support the network was instead spent on alcohol and prostitutes.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the <b>carefully</b> <b>constructed</b> clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} hand it over to someone who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is <b>carefully</b> <b>constructed,</b> the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} make the above example {{completely}} rigorous, one would have to <b>carefully</b> <b>construct</b> a Turing Machine, or λ-function, or carefully invoke recursion axioms, or at best, cleverly invoke various theorems of computability theory. But because the computability theorist believes that Turing computability correctly captures what can be computed effectively, and because an effective procedure is spelled out in English for deciding the set B, the computability theorist accepts this as proof that the set is indeed recursive.|$|R

25|$|Gitton's design {{relies on}} gravity {{powering}} multiple siphons {{in the same}} principle as the Pythagorean cup; for example, after the water level in the minute or hour display tubes is reached, an overflow tube starts {{to act as a}} siphon and thus empties the display tube. Actual time keeping is done by a calibrated pendulum powered by a water stream piped from the clock's reservoir. The pendulum has a <b>carefully</b> <b>constructed</b> container attached to it; this measures the water that is then poured into the display system. There are other modern designs of water clocks, including the Royal Gorge water clock in Colorado, the Woodgrove Mall in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and the Hornsby Water Clock in Sydney, Australia.|$|E

5000|$|Survey {{researchers}} should <b>carefully</b> <b>construct</b> {{the order of}} questions in a questionnaire. For questionnaires that are self-administered, the most interesting questions {{should be at the}} beginning of the questionnaire to catch the respondent’s attention, while demographic questions should be near the end. Contrastingly, if a survey is being administered over the telephone or in person, demographic questions should be administered {{at the beginning of the}} interview to boost the respondent’s confidence. Another reason to be mindful of question order may cause a survey response effect in which one question may affect how people respond to subsequent questions as a result of priming.|$|R
25|$|Another {{approach}} for measuring mRNA abundance is RT-qPCR. In this technique, reverse transcription {{is followed by}} quantitative PCR. Reverse transcription first generates a DNA template from the mRNA; this single-stranded template is called cDNA. The cDNA template is then amplified in the quantitative step, during which the fluorescence emitted by labeled hybridization probes or intercalating dyes changes as the DNA amplification process progresses. With a <b>carefully</b> <b>constructed</b> standard curve, qPCR can produce an absolute measurement {{of the number of}} copies of original mRNA, typically in units of copies per nanolitre of homogenized tissue or copies per cell. qPCR is very sensitive (detection of a single mRNA molecule is theoretically possible), but can be expensive {{depending on the type of}} reporter used; fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes are more expensive than non-specific intercalating fluorescent dyes.|$|E
25|$|Although {{no single}} biblical passage {{contains}} a complete definition of idolatry, {{the subject is}} addressed in numerous passages, so that idolatry may be summarized as the worship of idols (or images); the worship of polytheistic gods by use of idols (or images); the worship of created things (trees, rocks, animals, astronomical bodies, or another human being); {{and the use of}} idols in the worship of God (YHWH Elohim, the God of Israel). In the New Testament covetousness (greed) is defined as idolatry. When the commandment was given, opportunities to participate in the honor or worship of idols abounded, and the religions of Canaanite tribes neighboring the Israelites often centered on a <b>carefully</b> <b>constructed</b> and maintained cult idol. However, according to the book of Deuteronomy the Israelites were strictly warned to neither adopt nor adapt any of the religious practices of the peoples around them.|$|E
25|$|Dickens's {{literary}} success {{began with}} the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features. His plots were <b>carefully</b> <b>constructed,</b> and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring {{a new class of}} readers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{recently}} introduced TREC Contextual Suggestion track proposes {{the problem of}} suggesting contextually relevant places to a user visiting a new city based on his/her preferences {{and the location of}} the new city.

Based on the track evaluations we demonstrate that our system not only significantly out-performs a baseline method but also performs very well in comparison to other runs submitted to the track, managing to achieve the best results in nearly half of all test contexts. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} linear movies, {{the author}} can <b>carefully</b> <b>construct</b> the plot, roles, and characters {{to achieve a}} specific effect on the audience. Interactivity, however, introduces non-linearity into the movie, such that the author no longer has complete control over the story, but must now share control with the viewer. There is an inevitable trade-off between {{the desire of the}} viewer for freedom to experience the movie in different ways, and the desire of the author to employ specialized techniques to control the presentation of the story. Computer technology is required to create the illusion of freedom for the viewer, while providing familiar, as well as, new cinematic techniques to the author.|$|R

Over the past year, we have developed a new generation module for conversational systems developed at MIT using the Galaxy architecture. In this thesis, we discuss how our system, Genesis-II, bridges non-linguistic and linguistic generation with an original framework that is simple, yet pow-erful.
