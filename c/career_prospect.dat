500|$|Following an {{appearance}} in the moderately successful drama Imtihaan (1994), Khan starred in and earned public recognition with his next two releases opposite Akshay Kumar: Yash Raj Films' hit romantic drama Yeh Dillagi and the action film Main Khiladi Tu Anari. Yeh Dillagi was an unofficial remake of the 1954 Hollywood film Sabrina, and narrated {{the story of a}} chauffeur's daughter (played by Kajol) who becomes a model and engages in a love triangle between two brothers (played by Kumar and Khan). Main Khiladi Tu Anari (the second film in the Khiladi series) featured Khan as an aspiring actor and emerged as the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of both films proved a breakthrough for Khan, and his performance in Main Khiladi Tu Anari fetched him his first Best Supporting Actor nomination at the annual Filmfare Awards. Khan found no success in his next two releases of the year: the dramas Yaar Gaddar and Aao Pyaar Karen, and his <b>career</b> <b>prospect</b> declined through much of the 1990s.

We con-duct a survey among postdocs in Germany to analyze the {{perceptions}} and attitudes of postdocs regarding their research incentives, their working conditions, and their <b>career</b> <b>prospects.</b> We conceptualize the <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> of a postdoc in a life-cycle perspective of transitions from academic training to academic or non-academic jobs. Only {{about half of the}} postdocs sees strong incentives for academic research, but there is quite a strong confidence to succeed in an academic career. Furthermore, postdocs who attended a PhD program show better <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> and higher research incentives compared to others. Academic <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> and motivation are strongest for assistant professors. Apart from this small group, however, postdocs report only a small impact of the university reforms of the last decade. Female postdocs show significantly higher research incentives but otherwise we find little gender differences. Finally, good prospects in non-academic jobs are not associated with a reduction in the motivation for research...|$|R

He {{played the role}} of Ved Sahni, a man who desires a career in the arts but settles for a life of monotony as an engineer. As with his {{previous}} three releases, the film failed commercially and received mixed reviews from critics. Kapoor's performance, however, was praised; Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Kapoor is beautifully cast, his trademark mix of assertive theatricality and subtle emotion well suited to the role of a man who seemingly has it all under control, until he doesn’t." [...] Kapoor's <b>career</b> <b>prospect</b> improved in 2016 when he took on the leading role of an aspiring musician in Karan Johar's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016). The romantic drama, co-starring Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai, tells the story of unrequited love, and proved {{to be one of the}} highest-grossing Bollywood films of the year. Critical reception for the film, however, was mixed; Joe Leydon of Variety thought that [...] "Kapoor is often erring on the side of annoying while trying to balance vulnerability and self-centeredness". Both Tamasha and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil earned Kapoor Best Actor nominations at Filmfare.|$|E

In the case of CSR factors, though the results show low percentages relative to the employment benefit factors, the mean scores which are above five (5) indicate that CSR factors also influence prospective employees, thus, largely confirming previous studies (Goltz & Giannantonio, 1995; Turban & Greening 1996; Turban et al., 1998; Jones et al., 2014).|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} in quantifying {{the effects of}} the widely popular Business Week graduate business school ranking on its users and stakeholders were not comprehensive in encompassing the programs that are not ranked in the top tier and in examining the different aspects of its influences. This paper adopts a more thorough approach in studying {{the effects of the}} changes in rankings on 22 variables related to admission outcomes, student quality, school demography, pricing policies and placement success. While {{it is not surprising that}} the Business Week ranking affects people’s perception and behavior, the analyses here uncover effects of substantial magnitude on some variables, especially when the ranking of an institution moves across the three different tiers. Falling ranking may put a school under serious financial distress due to shrinking enrollment and reduction in tuition income. While the school only increases the indirect price discount such as grant and scholarship aid when its ranking drops within the 1 st tier, it has to be much more aggressive in attracting additional students from its declining applicant pool through direct tuition cut when it plummets to the 2 nd or 3 rd tiers. Besides, the resulting entering class is of slightly lower quality, as measured by its mean values of GMAT scores, undergraduate GPA, work experience and pre-MBA salary. Surprisingly, the <b>career</b> <b>prospect</b> of recent graduates is only adversely affected when a program plunges to a lower tier in the rankings; it appears that falling in the rankings within the 1 st tier is actually favorable to their career placement. In addition, the cost of a program not being ranked in the media rankings are heavily borne by its recent graduates as their <b>career</b> <b>prospect</b> will be greatly impaired...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{gender differences}} {{with regard to}} the self- and reciprocal estimation of career expectations. Firstly, the theoretical background and the literature are identified. Within this frame, the instance of self-under-estimated <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> of female workers and statistical discrimination in the labor market are described. Both aspects are jointly assessed as a self-fulfilling prophecy-phenomenon redounded to women's disadvantage on the labor market. Secondly, the empirical part analysis the respective self- and reciprocal estimation of female and male <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> for public sector workers in Germany. The results display obvious discrepancies between self- and reciprocally estimated career expectations that constitute a gender-career estimation gap. As the German public sector contains specific devices to equalising career chances of male and female employees, the findings even underpin the insistency of under-estimated <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> of female workers despite the existing public sector regime of equality. Finally, approaches of how to equalize male and female career chances are critically reviewed...|$|R

40|$|A lack {{of career}} {{opportunities}} and long spells of temporary employment {{are seen as}} major problems in science, and are thought to decrease the attractiveness of the scientific profession.

The research described in the dissertation shows how <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> and employment conditions have changed in Germany since {{the emergence of the}} research university, and how publications careers of PhD graduates have changed in the United States since the 1950 s. Furthermore, the dissertation describes how <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> and employment conditions affect the job choice of recent PhD graduates. Women are more negative about <b>career</b> <b>prospects</b> and employment conditions in science and are therefore more affected by these issues when choosing a job. In addition, the dissertation describes how student status of PhD candidates limits the availability of material research infrastructure.
