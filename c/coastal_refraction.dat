5000|$|A {{non-directional}} (radio) beacon (NDB) is a {{radio transmitter}} at a known location, {{used as an}} aviation or marine navigational aid. As the name implies, the signal transmitted does not include [...] directional information, in contrast to other navigational aids such as low frequency radio range, VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and TACAN. NDB signals follow the curvature of the Earth, {{so they can be}} received at much greater distances at lower altitudes, a major advantage over VOR. However, NDB signals are also affected more by atmospheric conditions, mountainous terrain, <b>coastal</b> <b>refraction</b> and electrical storms, particularly at long range.|$|E
40|$|Presentation of {{the results}} from the study of four {{representative}} beaches focusing on sedimentary processes, hydrodynamics and modelling. The sample beaches studied were Santa Margherita (Pula) and Solanas (Sinnai), located respectively in the east and west sections of the Gulf of Cagliari, southern Sardinia. Cala di Trana and La Sciumara were also studied, located in the north of Sardinia (Palau – OT) in the Straits of Boniface area. The study was carried out using methods indicated in the European project Interreg IIIA GERER (AA. VV., 2008), {{for the first time on}} Sardinian beaches. A digital system of topographic-bathymetric data acquisition was used and seasonally repeated. The digital data, and sedimentological data, were used to calculate the basis on which the wave motion and hydrodynamic simulations were applied. The results identified the phenomena of <b>coastal</b> <b>refraction,</b> the corresponding hydrodynamic scenarios and the surfzone structures that are generated according to the marine event simulated...|$|E

40|$|For seven tsunamis {{which reached}} {{the coast of}} Japan, from Iturup, Kamchatka, Aleutian, Alaska and Chile, the {{distribution}} of tsunami energy are shown along the isobathymetric line of 200 m. As compared with the distribution, given by R. Takahasi(1951), for tsunamis originated in the sea adjacent to Japan, the patterns of energy distribution are approximately similar to each other. The regions in Sanriku and Kishu receive high {{percentage of the total}} energy of the tsunami. The ratio between heights of the initial wave and the maximum wave seems to increase with decreasing seiche period of the bay. Along the Sanriku coast, the tsunami is always high because of particular geographical conditions, concentrated wave energy by refraction, and amplifying by <b>coastal</b> effects. <b>Refraction</b> diagrams in the adjacent sea of Japan are drawn with the aid of arrival times of the wave fronts observed by the tide-gauge stations. 日本に伝播した 7 個の遠地津波(浪源:Iturup, Kamchatka, Aleutian, AlaskaおよびChile) について,日本太平洋沿岸に沿つた 200 m等深線上に津波エネルギー分布を求め,高橋(1951) が示した近地津波の総エネルギー分布と比較したとき,かなり傾向が相似し,三陸および紀州地域が受ける津波エネルギーの割合が他地域に比して大きい. 湾の周期特性と,湾口と湾奥の波高増幅度との関係について,渡辺(1964) は 1933 年の三陸津波と 1960 年のチリ津波との相沢を理論的に説明したが,概して遠地津波の場合,一観測点における最高波と第 1 波の波高比,すなわち波高の増幅度は,短周期のセイシュを持つ湾程,大きい...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some examples}} of imaging radar oceanographic observations and discusses physical phenomena on the surface that may cause the radar image. The different ocean scattering theories are briefly discussed, including the tangent plane model, the Bragg-Rice model, and the Rayleigh scattering model. All {{but one of the}} images presented were obtained with an L-band HH-polarized radar; they include deep-ocean swells, <b>coastal</b> swells, wave <b>refractions,</b> internal waves, ship wakes, abrupt transitions in open-ocean surface roughness, surface slicks, island wind shadowing, and currents. Analyses are shown to suggest that the primary source of the L-band imagery of ocean surface patterns is the variation of small-scale surface roughness and local tilt angle. It is also noted that surface irregularities behave as isotropic scatterers for a radar wavelength of 25 cm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{transformation}} of waves {{is one of}} the important subjects in <b>coastal</b> engineering studies. <b>Refraction,</b> diffraction, shoaling, reflection can be analysed with the mild slope equation over mild sloped topographies. But the extended mild slope equation {{can be applied to the}} rapidly varying topographies since it includes higher order bottom effects such as square of bottom slope and bottom curvature. In this study, extended mild slope equation has been solved with finite difference method using Mac Cormack and Point Gauss Seidel Methods together. The nonlinear wave celerity and group velocity have been used. The numerical model has been tested on elliptic shoaling area and compared with the physical experiment measurements given in literature. The predictions are in consistency with the measurements. As a result of error analysis, it is decided that the numerical can be used for the simulation of wave propagation. Numerical model has been applied to a coastal area in the Kocaeli Bay in the Marmara Sea in Turkey...|$|R
40|$|Studies about ocean waves {{have been}} {{evolving}} {{over a period}} of time. Re¬cently, there has been renewed interest in problems of refraction, diﬀraction and radiation of ocean waves around structures. In this thesis, the analytic solutions for linear waves propagating in an ocean with variable bottom to¬pography and their applications in renewable wave energy are presented. In the ﬁrst part, we present an analytic solution to the shallow water wave equa¬tion for long waves propagating over a circular hump. As a useful tool in coastal engineering, the solution may be used to study the refraction of long waves around a circular hump. It may also be used as a validation tool for any numerical model developed for <b>coastal</b> wave <b>refraction.</b> To validate the new analytic solution, we have compared our new analytical solution with a numerical solution obtained by using the ﬁnite diﬀerence method. The agreement between these two solutions is excellent. By using the analytic solution, the eﬀect of the hump dimensions on wave refraction over the circular hump are examined. In the second part of this thesis, based on the mild-slope equation derived by Smith and Sprinks [1] and the extended refraction-diﬀraction equation developed by Massel [2], we have constructed a two-layer mild-slope equation for interfacial waves propagating on the interface of a two-layer ocean model. First, we follow Smith and Sprinks’s [1] approach to derive the mild-slope equation for the propagation of interfacial waves, with the higher-order terms proportional to the bottom slope and bottom curvature all being neglected. We then derived the extended version of the mild-slope equation with the higher-order terms included. While we were able to solve the ﬁrst equation analytically, we presented a numerical solution for the second equation. As a part of the veriﬁcation process, both solutions were compared with each other and also with the single-layer mild-slope equation when the density of the upper layer goes to zero. We then used the new solution to study the eﬀect of the hump dimensions on the refraction of the interfacial waves over a circular hump. Finally, in the ﬁnal section of this thesis, we have used what we have developed before to construct the two-layer mild-slope equation with free surface on top. By utilizing this equation, we then derived an analytic solu¬tion for long waves propagating over a circular hump with a hollow circular cylinder ﬂoating in the free surface. In order to validate our new analytic solution, we have compared our problem with Mac Camy and Fuchs [3] solu¬tion, because our solution has reduced to their solution when the lower water depth, h 2, goes to zero. We have also compared our solution with the ﬂat bottom case in order to further veriﬁed our solution. Finally, by using the new solution, both diﬀraction and refraction eﬀects from the hollow cylinder and hump dimensions are examined and discussed...|$|R
