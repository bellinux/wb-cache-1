40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{determine}} the degree of interdependence of <b>stock</b> markets <b>in</b> separate countries of the European Union, namely: France, Germany, Great Britain, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary on the basis of studying the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> indexes, as well as determining the existence of tendencies of approximating the dynamics of the national stock index «PFTS Index» to the corresponding dynamics of <b>stock</b> indexes <b>in</b> surveyed countries. The article analyzes the dynamics of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> indices <b>in</b> the UK (FTSE), Germany (DAX 30), France (CAC 40) and pan-European ones (EURO STOXX 50), as well as <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> indices <b>in</b> Poland (WIG 20), Czech Republic (PX), Hungary (BUX). Calculations of the coefficients of pair correlation between <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> indices <b>in</b> the studied countries have been performed.

The author calculated the coefficient of pair correlation between the indicators of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the national <b>stock</b> index «PFTS Index» and the stock indices of the «old» and «new» EU countries.

[...] The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the Kaksy lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> price of the targeted company. The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event. Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, {{there does seem to be}} a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.|$|E

The day of the robbery, a meeting of the American company {{directors}} was to take place at noon. At half-past 10:00 am, a tin box containing $25,000 in government bonds and negotiable securities was brought to the firm's office from the Merchants' Bank. Although deposited and kept in its vaults for safekeeping, it was customary at these meetings for the board of directors to use or inspect the box for any <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock.</b> The box was placed in the vault opening from the back room of the office of company agent Anthony B.

At around 11:20 am, two well-dressed men respectable looking men entered the building expressing an interest in life insurance and were shown into McDonnell's office. One of the men, described as [...] "a young man about 30 years of age and having the appearance of an able commercial traveler on a fine salary", took a seat on the opposite side of the table of McDonald and immediately began speaking to him about terms of life insurance policies. He then explained that he and several others were preparing to go down the Mississippi River to New Orleans on business for their respective companies and were interested on obtaining life insurance during their extended trip to the South. The young man continued further by stating that he and his group were as yet undecided whether they should take a [...] "traveler's risk" [...] or purchase insurance. He himself was in favor of getting life insurance as he claimed to be a married man. His companion also commented occasionally and supported his claim that the young man had been appointed the group's spokesman and would negotiate the terms of the policies. While the young man and the agent continued speaking, the second man excused himself and left the room for a few moments.|$|E
40|$|In the {{literature}} of comprehensive national accounts, national net investments are used to indicate dynamic welfare improvement in an economy. A well-known approach associates national net investments with the shadow value of <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> of capital assets in an economy. Following this capital stock approach, sectoral net investments {{can be defined as}} the shadow value of <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> of capital assets owned by a sector in an economy. An alternative approach is based on future commodity flows to a sector. This commodity flow approach associates sectoral net investments with the present value of changes in future commodity flows to a sector. In the present paper, I compare these two approaches and prove that they coincide with each other only if the future commodity flows to the sector can be attributed to current stock of capital assets in the sector alone. In empirical studies, commodity flow approach can be a better alternative if the purpose is to estimate the contributions to national net investments of a recipient of future cash flows...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{determinants}} of capital inflows is essential to designing an effective policy framework to manage volatile capital flows and their disruptive potential. This paper aims to identify factors that explain the size and volatility of various types of capital flows to developing Asia with regard to other emerging market economies. The estimates for a panel dataset show that per capita income growth, trade openness, and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> market capitalization are important {{determinants of}} capital inflows to developing Asia. Trade openness increases the volatility {{of all types of}} capital inflows, while <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> market capitalization, global liquidity growth, and institutional quality lowers the volatility.

Forewarning of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> price, {{can be made by}} the early detection of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the distributions of <b>stock</b> order numbers. <b>In</b> this paper, we address the change detection problem for streams of stock order numbers and propose a novel incremental detection algorithm.
