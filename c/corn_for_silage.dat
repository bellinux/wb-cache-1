40|$|In the July 2005 {{issue of}} the Michigan Dairy Review, I {{explained}} why I do not recommend using “Milk per Acre ” as a method <b>for</b> selecting <b>corn</b> hybrids <b>for</b> <b>silage.</b> Instead, I suggested using a partial budget method {{to determine the best}} hybrid for an individual dairy farm because several factors that affect profitability related to corn hybrid selection vary across farms. For instance, the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration of corn silage has a great effect on the land required <b>for</b> <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> <b>for</b> all farms. However, its effect on farm profits depends on many factors that vary from farm to farm such as the cost to grow, harvest and storage corn silage, and the price of corn grain used in rations.

40|$|Corn is a {{versatile}} crop {{that can be}} planted from early to late spring. In the fall, producers {{have the option of}} harvesting <b>corn</b> <b>for</b> either <b>silage</b> or grain. Corn silage is an important source of forage, and many producers are reevaluating cropping systems and increasing use of corn silage. Corn can produce high dry matter yields with one harvest. Corn is a good crop to recycle nutrients from manure and maintain water quality. Corn silage is easily ensiled and generally results in palatable forage with relatively consistent quality and higher energy content than other forages. Corn silage production requires less labor and machinery time than other harvested forages. Thus, the cost per ton of dry matter produced tends to be lower <b>for</b> <b>corn</b> <b>silage</b> than <b>for</b> other forages. Offsetting these benefits of corn silage are some disadvantages relative to other forages. There are few established markets and transportation costs are high, so the crop must be fed on or near the farm where it is produced. In some locations, where corn is not well adapted, production costs may be too high to warrant silage production. On erodible soils, corn silage production may be limited because of soil residue requirements for conservation compliance...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{elaborate}} on the analysis of wheat growing in the Czech Republic and to evaluate the influence of variant methods of soil processing winter wheat crops (that are grown after three forecrops: alfalfa, <b>corn</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> and pea plants) on winter wheat yield and economics of growing it. Monitoring was done during the time period 1989 - 2014 using a longterm stationary field experiment that was conducted on clayish muck soil in a beet-growing region, (Ivanovice na Hané). After all three forecrops were planted, they were separated into four different methods of soil processing: ploughing on 0, 22 m, ploughing on 0, 15 m, direct sowing, and loosening on depth of 0, 10 m. The highest yield of winter wheat was achieved by growing it after pea crops, followed by <b>corn</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> and the lowest yield was achieved after alfalfa. The influence of different soil processing on yield of winter wheat was statistically insignificant. The highest average yield of winter wheat was recorded after ploughing on 0, 15 m, followed by ploughing on 0, 22 m, and direct seeding. The lowest yield was achieved after soil loosening {{at a depth of}} 0, 10 m. During the course of the experiment, the highest yield of winter wheat was recorded after the direct seeding into unprocessed soil after the pea plant forecrop. The lowest yield was recorded for direct seeding after alfalfa. In the calculation of the economic evaluation, after all three forecrops, the higher contribution to payment was made by the minimalization methods of soil processing (variants 3, 4) and lower by the methods of ploughing (variants 1, 2). On average, the highest contributions to payment were recorded as winter wheat growing after pea plants and the lowest contributions recorded after alfalfa plants. Overall, the results point to the possibility of reducing the intensity of soil processing for winter wheat grown on clayish muck soil in beet-growing region...|$|E
