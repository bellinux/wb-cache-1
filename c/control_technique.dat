500|$|Although she was {{initially}} criticised for being inconsistent {{at the beginning}} of career, and for losing possession too easily, Lloyd later developed into one of {{the best players in the}} world, and is highly regarded in particular for her outstanding determination, mental strength, and work-ethic. A tenacious, energetic, and hard-working player, she also is known for her <b>control,</b> <b>technique,</b> and passing accuracy, and is capable of aiding her team both defensively and offensively, due to her stamina, strength, and tackling, as well as her ability to get into good attacking positions, and either score goals or create chances for teammates. These abilities, coupled with her tactical versatility, enable her to be deployed in several midfield positions; although she began her career in the centre, as a defensive midfielder, she is most comfortable when moved to a more advanced role, as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards. Lloyd has also earned a reputation as a [...] "clutch player", due to her tendency to score decisive goals; a powerful striker of the ball, she is capable of scoring from any position on the pitch, and can finish well both with her head and with her feet inside the area.|$|E

Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are Model Predictive Control (MPC) and linear-quadratic-Gaussian control (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the [...] "optimal control" [...] structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system.

2500|$|In situ {{ellipsometry}} {{refers to}} dynamic measurements during the modification process of a sample. This {{process can be}} used to study, for instance, the growth of a thin film, including calcium phosphate mineralization at the air-liquid interface, etching or cleaning of a sample. By in situ ellipsometry measurements it is possible to determine fundamental process parameters, such as, growth or etch rates, [...] variation of optical properties with time. In situ ellipsometry measurements require a number of additional considerations: The sample spot is usually not as easily accessible as for ex situ measurements outside the process chamber. Therefore, the mechanical setup has to be adjusted, which can include additional optical elements (mirrors, prisms, or lenses) for redirecting or focusing the light beam. Because the environmental conditions during the process can be harsh, the sensitive optical elements of the ellipsometry setup must be separated from the hot zone. In the simplest case this is done by optical view ports, though strain induced birefringence of the (glass-) windows has {{to be taken into account}} or minimized. Furthermore, the samples can be at elevated temperatures, which implies different optical properties compared to samples at room temperature. Despite all these problems, in situ ellipsometry becomes more and more important as process <b>control</b> <b>technique</b> for [...] thin film deposition and modification tools. In situ ellipsometers can be of single-wavelength or spectroscopic type. Spectroscopic in situ ellipsometers use multichannel detectors, for instance CCD detectors, which measure the ellipsometric parameters for all wavelengths in the studied spectral range simultaneously.|$|E
