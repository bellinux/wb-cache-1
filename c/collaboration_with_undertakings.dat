This {{is the problem of}} routing and scheduling trains in case of perturbation, aiming at the minimization of delay propagation. In this paper, we show how RECIFE-MILP has been successfully applied to different case-studies, in <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> European railway <b>undertakings</b> and infrastructure managers. Indeed, despite the positive results achieved in these applications, several open questions remain on how to actually deploy a tool as RECIFE-MILP in the practice. In the final part of this work, we focus on some of these questions and we describe our experience with respect to them...|$|R

40|$|We examine firms’ {{propensity}} to adapt their R&D collaboration portfolio by establishing {{new types of}} R&D <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> different kinds of partners (suppliers, customers, competitors and universities & public research institutions). We argue that existing R&D <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> {{one of the two}} value chain partners (suppliers or customers) is associated with the formation of new R&D <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> the other value chain partner to ensure temporal alignment in innovation within the value chain. In contrast, issues related to governance and unintended knowledge spillovers suggest that ‘horizontal’ R&D <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> competitors only spurs R&D <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> other partner types if such competitor R&D collaboration has been discontinued earlier (‘delayed temporal alignment’). We posit that persistent prior R&D <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> institutional partners is an antecedent to the establishment of new R&D <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> industrial partners, and that discontinuation of a particular type of R&D collaboration is likely to lead to a restart of such R&D collaborative effort. Strong prior innovative performance is expected to increase the probability that firms establish R&D <b>collaborations</b> <b>with</b> new partner types, except for R&D <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> competitors, since the most innovative firms may fear leakage of proprietary knowledge to rivals. We find broad support for these predictions in a large panel of Spanish innovating firms (2004 - 2011). Our findings highlight that {{it is not just the}} configuration of R&D <b>collaborations</b> <b>with</b> existing partner types that predicts tie formation with new partner types, but also the intertemporal pattern of prior R&D collaboration and managerial discretion provided by past innovation success. nrpages: 54 status: publishe...|$|R
