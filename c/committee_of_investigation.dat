5|$|In an earlier, more celebrated case, Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1968), a {{group of}} farmers pressed the Milk Marketing Board to {{increase}} the prices for milk payable to them, but the Board refused. The farmers complained to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under section 19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Under the section, the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> {{but he refused to}} exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal. The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and objects of the Act.|$|E
25|$|Law and Justice's leader Jaroslaw Kaczyński and {{the head}} of the {{parliamentary}} <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> Antoni Macierewicz have been described as long time supporters of the assassination theory, and have repeatedly accused the then prime minister Donald Tusk of being involved in a cover-up. Macierewicz repeated these accusations as newly appointed minister of defence in 2016, causing a significant controversy in Polish, Russian and international media.|$|E
25|$|A {{prototype}} of the design was built in 1925, and was probably the only unit ever manufactured. It {{was sent to the}} British <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> of Small Arms for trials in 1927, but did not receive approval. The British showed limited interest in the weapon from the outset, decided against procuring 6.5×55mm ammunition, and thus limited their testing to examination of the prototype without test firing. Eriksen patented his inventions in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Germany {{paid the}} British {{government}} £1 million as reparation for the illegal transfer of British POWs to Theresienstadt. Britain made {{no provision for}} dominion troops. For many years, the governments of Australia and New Zealand denied that any of their servicemen had been held at the camp. In 1987, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke established a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation.</b> It confirmed that POWs were held at Theresienstadt. The government then authorised payments of A$10,000 each to the Australian survivors of the camp. The New Zealand government also arranged for compensation for the New Zealand survivors.|$|E
25|$|Following Law and Justice's {{victory at}} the 2015 Polish {{parliamentary}} elections, the new conservative government appointed {{the chair of the}} Polish Parliamentary <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Investigation,</b> Antoni Macierewicz, as defence minister, and the question of the Smolensk crash was brought back into the government's agenda. New foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski announced that Poland would sue Russia in a human rights court over Moscow's withholding of the wreckage. The Consul of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly designated a special investigation rapporteur who will carry out an inquiry on whether holding back the wreckage and other evidence material by the Russians is justified.|$|E

Pole also had the specific task of advising to improve stations and the railway route to improve links between Jaffa, Tel-Aviv and Haifa. The other members of Pole's committee were C.M. Jenkin-Jones of Britain's London and North Eastern Railway and the accountant Sir Laurence Halsey, who was a partner in Price Waterhouse. Jenkin-Jones' specific task was to advise how to develop traffic facilities, traffic organisation and what rates to charge. Halsey was to advise on the accounting system {{and the establishment of}} an adequate renewals fund.|$|E

Franklin had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position. He {{had just returned from}} England and was appointed chairman of a <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> to establish a postal system. The report of the Committee, providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies, was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26. On July 26, 1775, Franklin was appointed Postmaster General, the first appointed under the Continental Congress. It established a postal system that became the United States Post Office, a system that continues to operate today.|$|E
25|$|After Botnica {{had been}} {{purchased}} by the Port of Tallinn, the Estonian state-owned company {{became the center of}} a bribery scandal involving the company's top executives. In February 2016, the parliamentary <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> decided to open a criminal case after suspecting that the evaluation of the Finnish icebreaker prior to acquisition had been incorrect and biased, and as a result the Port of Tallinn purchased the vessel for 50 million euro while a more realistic price for the 14-year-old icebreaker would have been 30 to 35 million euro. However, until now no evidence has been shown that anyone had obtained any illegal benefit from the mentioned deal whatsoever, and it still appears that the price of the icebreaker was correspondent to the healthy market conditions of the year 2012.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1713, Nehemiah Chiya Chayun {{arrived at}} Amsterdam and {{requested}} {{permission of the}} Portuguese congregation to circulate his writings, which had been published at Berlin. Ashkenazi thought Chayun was an old enemy of his from Sarajevo and Salonica, and at once requested Solomon Ayllon, Chacham of the Portuguese congregation, not to accord patronage to the stranger, who was unfavorably known to him. Ashkenazi believed himself justified in making this demand, as the Portuguese congregation and its rabbi had, from the beginning, treated him most courteously, and had already, during his term at Altona, repeatedly sent {{to him from the}} Sephardim of Hamburg, Amsterdam, and London religio-legal questions for his decision. Chayun thereupon called on Ashkenazi personally and made an explanation; whereupon the rabbi retracted his accusation, stating that {{it was a case of}} mistaken identity. Meanwhile, several members of the Portuguese congregation had submitted Chayun's writings to the judgment of Moses Hagiz, a messenger from Jerusalem then sojourning at Amsterdam, who immediately discovered their Sabbatian principles and tendencies and gave the alarm. He also called the attention of Ashkenazi to the dangerous doctrines published in Chayun's book, whereupon the rabbi again warned the directorate of the Sephardim congregation not to support the author. Ashkenazi rejected a proposition to designate the objectionable passages, and declined to act as member of a <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> because he did not regard Ayllon, the rabbi of the Sephardim, as a competent authority on such questions. Thereupon a fierce contention ensued, during the progress of which Hagiz fought valiantly beside Ashkenazi.|$|E

She {{remained}} an active Fabian, and after the Fabian Research Department became the Labour Research Department in 1917, served on the new body's executive committee. Through these connections she {{became a member of}} the National Guilds League (NGL), an organisation that promoted industrial democracy, workers' control and producer associations in a national system of guilds. She maintained her connection with the WIL, whose 1919 conference adopted a non-pacifist stance that justified armed struggle as a means of defeating capitalism. After visiting Ireland for the WIL in 1920 she became an outspoken critic of the British government's actions there, in particular its use of the [...] "Black and Tans" [...] as a paramilitary force. She gave evidence about the conduct of British forces in Ireland at the Congressional <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Investigation</b> in Washington in December of that year.
