5|$|The second issue, ironically, {{came about}} due to {{concerns}} about a Soviet ABM system. The US's existing SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan both used re-entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed the warheads {{as they entered}} the lower atmosphere and made them relatively easy to attack. The new LGM-30 Minuteman missile used sharp-nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds, and included a number of decoy systems that were expected to make interception very difficult for the Soviet ABMs. This would guarantee the US's deterrent. If there was a budget <b>choice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made, McNamara supported Minuteman, although he tried not to say this.|$|E

25|$|Despite these {{seemingly}} paradoxical facts, most mathematicians accept the {{axiom of choice}} as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics. The debate is interesting enough, however, that it is considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is logically equivalent (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of <b>choice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the axiom of <b>choice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true.|$|E

25|$|Pre-eminent {{among the}} saints is the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.

Accordingly, the Orthodox consider Mary to be the Ark of the New Covenant and give her the respect and reverence as such.

25|$|With {{the widely}} used {{alternative}} of penal transportation halted in the 1770s, the immediate {{need for additional}} penal accommodations emerged.

While conditions on these ships were generally appalling, their use and the labor thus provided set a precedent which persuaded many people that mass incarceration and labour were viable methods of crime prevention and punishment. The turn of the 19th century would see the first movement toward Prison reform, and by the 1810s, the first state prisons and correctional facilities were built, thereby inaugurating the modern prison facilities available today.|$|E
25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aÅ¡a, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aÅ¡a or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator.

40|$|It {{has long}} been assumed that {{homelessness}} is a personal choice. As a choice, homelessness is embedded within debates about deviant behaviours and problematic pathologies. The "homeless person" is either making calculated and immoral <b>choices</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> homeless, or they <b>are</b> perceived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> powerless agents who lack the capacity <b>to</b> exercise <b>choices.</b> Rarely has it been adequately explained, however, what choosing homelessness means and how people who are homeless {{make sense of their}} choices.

Drawing on ethnographic research with people sleeping rough, this article unpacks and illuminates some of the hidden complexities that underpin <b>choices</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> homeless.

Hewett was a logical <b>choice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> its first director, and was installed in the position. The enabling legislation mandated that the Museum be managed by the SAR, helping to solidify Hewett's grasp on both positions. Hewett staffed the Museum's administrative functions with several {{of his friends and}} supporters from the Normal School days, and persuaded Alice Fletcher to take a key advisory role as well. This of course exposed him to complaints from his critics about cronyism, but ensured that he at least had a stable power base within the institution. The Museum was empowered by the legislature to acquire land containing some key archaeological sites in the state that were not yet protected by the Antiquities Act, and under Hewett, it did so.|$|E
25|$|In late 2001 the BBC {{decided to}} {{reposition}} and rebrand their two digital channels {{so that they}} could be more closely linked to the well established BBC One and BBC Two. Their plan was for BBC Knowledge to be replaced with BBC Fourâ€”which took place in 2002â€”and for BBC <b>Choice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced with BBC Three. However, questions were raised over the proposed format of the new BBC Three, as some thought the new format would be too similar to the BBC's commercial rivals, namely ITV2 and E4, and would be unnecessary competition. The channel was eventually given the go ahead, eleven months after the original launch date, and launched on 9 February 2003. The channel was launched by Stuart Murphy, who previously ran BBC Choice, and before that UK Play, the now-discontinued UKTV music and comedy channel. At 33, Murphy was still the youngest channel controller in the country, a title he had held since launching UK Play at the age of 26; although on 20 October 2005 it was announced that Murphy was soon to leave the channel to work in commercial television.|$|E
25|$|On 23 April 1942, Colonel Caleb V.

Scott, a pursuit pilot awaiting an assignment in China, was assigned as his operations officer and a month later as executive officer. Haynes was a fortuitous <b>choice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the airlift's first commander, as he had just completed an assignment as a key subordinate of Brig. Gen. Robert Olds. Olds and his staff had founded the Air Corps Ferrying Command in June 1941 and pioneered overseas military air transport, including use of the South Atlantic air route by which aircraft, personnel, and cargo would reach India from the United States. However, {{at the time the}} India-China Ferry was conceived, the ABC Ferry Command was not prepared to plan, control, or execute such an operation. Its formal organization was minimal, it had no units of its own, and its few aircraft were committed to establishing air transport routes. By June, however, the ABC Ferry Command had begun a greatly expanded wartime restructuring and would become the Air Transport Command on 1 July.|$|E
