50|$|A <b>crosshead</b> <b>die</b> {{splits the}} melt flow in {{two at the}} {{manifold}} inlet, recombining them at {{the opposite side of}} a cylindrical center mandrel. This relatively simple design results in non-symmetrical flow, as molecules take longer to reach the opposite side than the close side of the mandrel. As such, the resulting film will not be of uniform thickness. To reduce this nonuniformity, inlet diameters can be varied, and various inserts can be added to minimize stagnant regions.|$|E

Die {{designed to}} be attached to commercially available extrusion machine capable of extruding high-performance thermoplastics. Simple attachment to commercial extruder enables developers of composites to begin experimenting {{with large numbers of}} proprietary resins, fibers, and hybrid composite structures. With device, almost any possible fiber/resin combination fabricated...|$|E
40|$|The instant {{invention}} {{involves a}} process for use in preparing tapes or rovings, which are formed from a thermoplastic material used to impregnate longitudinally extended bundles of carbon fibers. The process involves the steps of (a) gas spreading a tow of carbon fibers; (b) feeding the spread tow into a crosshead die; (c) impregnating the tow in the die with a thermoplastic polymer; (d) withdrawing the impregnated tow from the die; and (e) gas cooling the impregnated tow with a jet of air. The <b>crosshead</b> <b>die</b> useful in the instant invention includes a horizontally extended, carbon fiber bundle inlet channel, means for providing melted polymer under pressure to the die, means for dividing the polymeric material flowing into the die into an upper flow channel and a lower flow channel disposed {{above and below the}} moving carbon fiber bundle, means for applying the thermoplastic material from both the upper and lower channels to the fiber bundle, and means for withdrawing the resulting tape from the die...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{efficiency}} of different melt impregnation methods for producing continuous glass fiber–polypropylene tapes has been evaluated. The selected methods were the common pin assisted method, a <b>crosshead</b> impregnation <b>die</b> including different vibration techniques and a slit die. The degree of melt impregnation was studied qualitatively with optical microscopy and determined quantitatively by opacity measurements. Excellent results were obtained using the radial slit die, {{followed by the}} pin chamber impregnation method. The <b>crosshead</b> impregnation <b>die</b> gave poor impregnation. With the radial slit die {{it was possible to}} achieve high fiber volume fraction and it was easy to control the fiber–matrix content. The haul off speed ranged from 1 – 10 m/min.

5000|$|The {{manufacture}} of plastic film for {{products such as}} shopping bags and continuous sheeting is achieved using a blown film line. [...] Polymer melt from an extruder is fed through an upright die with an annular opening. There are several types of dies that can be used, depending on final requirements of film quality and characteristics of the polymer melt: spider, <b>crosshead,</b> and spiral <b>dies.</b>|$|R
