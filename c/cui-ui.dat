25|$|Lake Tahoe is a {{tributary}} watershed drainage element {{within the}} Truckee River Basin, and its sole outlet is the Truckee River, which continues on to discharge to Pyramid Lake. Because of {{the sensitivity of}} Truckee River water quality (involving two protected species, the <b>cui-ui</b> sucker fish and the Lahontan cutthroat trout), this drainage basin has been studied extensively. The primary investigations were stimulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, who funded {{the development of the}} DSSAM model to analyze water quality below Lake Tahoe.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cui-ui</b> (Chasmistes cujus) {{is a large}} sucker fish {{endemic to}} Pyramid Lake and, prior to its {{desiccation}} in the 20th century, Winnemucca Lake in northwestern Nevada. [...] It feeds primarily on zooplankton and possibly on nanoplankton (such as algae and diatoms). The maximum size of male <b>cui-ui</b> is approximately 53 cm and 1.6 kg, while females reach approximately 64 cm and 2.7 kg. The life span of <b>cui-ui</b> is typically about forty years, but the fish do not reach sexual maturity until at least age eight. The <b>cui-ui</b> is an endangered species, {{and one of the}} few surviving members of its genus.|$|E

50|$|The <b>cui-ui</b> is potamodromous, {{and will}} attempt to ascend the Truckee River to spawn in mid-April. If inflow is {{insufficient}} to permit this, the <b>cui-ui</b> may attempt to spawn in Pyramid Lake, but generally with little success due to the salinity of that lake. Water releases from the Boca reservoir and Stampede reservoirs are currently (as of 2004) timed to assist the spawning run, although in drought years this water is reserved for the Reno metropolitan area. These releases are critical to successful spawning since low warm flows at the Truckee River delta are inhospitable to upstream migration of adults. Several hatcheries are maintained by the Paiute nation to ensure that such a situation does not impact the long term viability of the <b>cui-ui.</b> These measures have greatly increased <b>cui-ui</b> populations, although it is still listed as an endangered species.|$|E
5000|$|The Pyramid Lake band of Northern Paiute called {{themselves}} the [...] "Cuiyui Ticutta", which means <b>cui-ui</b> eaters. Together with the Lahontan cutthroat trout the <b>cui-ui</b> {{was an important}} food supply for the Cuiyui Tikutta and neighboring Paiute bands who would travel to Pyramid Lake {{to share in the}} harvest during the spring spawning runs.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent to European American {{settlement}} of western Nevada in the 1860s many Cuiyui Ticutta {{made a living}} by selling fish, although the European Americans generally preferred trout to <b>cui-ui.</b> <b>Cui-ui</b> were also still important for subsistence, despite Bureau of Indian Affairs attempts to encourage farming and discourage fishing. Following the construction of Derby Dam in 1905 and diversion {{of much of the}} Truckee River's flow, the Pyramid Lake fishery declined and by 1930 it was no longer capable of supplying even subsistence food. Although conditions have improved recently, the <b>cui-ui</b> are now managed for symbolic and ecological purposes, and are not a food source.|$|E

50|$|The Lahontan cutthroats of Pyramid and Walker Lakes were of {{considerable}} {{importance to the}} Paiute tribe. These trout, as well as <b>cui-ui,</b> a sucker found only in Pyramid Lake, were dietary mainstays and were used by other tribes in the area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cui-ui</b> {{population}} is generally improving in numbers, having attained an estimated population exceeding one million in 1993, {{thanks to the}} efforts of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in analysis of the Truckee River spawning grounds and of the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection and EPA in following up on protection measures. The reason the <b>cui-ui</b> remains endangered (though upgraded from critically endangered in 2014) is the recent history of recruitment variation, illustrating that in many years of the 1970s and 1980s there was virtually no recruitment whatsoever due to unsuccessful spawning in an unfavorable water quality and water flow environment of the Truckee River. The species' outlook is somewhat sanguine, since there is a published recovery plan based on an enhanced understanding of Pyramid Lake and Truckee River water quality, and the adoption of a protection plan by the U.S. Congress.|$|E
50|$|Pyramid Lake, {{the second}} largest natural lake in the western U.S. prior to {{construction}} of the Derby Dam, {{has been the focus}} of several water quality investigations, the most detailed starting in the mid-1980s. Under direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a comprehensive dynamic hydrology transport model was developed by Earth Metrics Inc.; the model's name was subsequently changed to DSSAM, and it was applied to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and wastewater management decisions throughout the 3120 sq mi Truckee River Basin. Analytes addressed included nitrogen, reactive phosphate, dissolved oxygen and ten other parameters. Based upon use of the model, some decisions have been influenced to enhance Pyramid Lake water quality and aid the viability of Pyramid Lake biota, including the <b>cui-ui.</b> The dynamic river model was particularly useful for analyzing Truckee River temperature variations, since the <b>cui-ui</b> often swim upstream to spawn, and their fry are vulnerable to elevations in river temperature.|$|E
50|$|The earthen and rock-filled dam was {{constructed}} in 1970, at 239 feet high and 1,511 feet long at the crest. It was a project of the United States Bureau of Reclamation, not primarily for flood control or irrigation storage as usual, but for fishery enhancement, primarily to facilitate the spawning of the critically endangered species <b>cui-ui</b> fish downstream. The dam is {{owned and operated by}} the Bureau.|$|E
50|$|No {{boats are}} allowed within 1000 {{feet of the}} refuge. Refuge staff and volunteers visit the island {{to keep track of}} birds and band {{juvenile}} pelicans. An estimated 8-10,000 pelicans used to return to Anaho Island each spring from their winter homes in Southern California and Baja California, Mexico. In recent years the number of pelican nests have dropped dramatically, due to water diversions affecting the fish runs of the endangered <b>cui-ui,</b> a staple food of the pelican.|$|E

5000|$|Nevada has 48 {{species of}} fish living in its 600 rivers and more than 200 lakes. Large lakes with several {{species of fish}} include for {{instance}} Pyramid Lake, Lake Tahoe, Lake Mead, Lake Mohave, Franklin Lake and Walker Lake. At least 12 of Nevada’s fishes are endemic to Nevada waters - they occur here and exist nowhere else in the world. Examples of endemic Nevadan fish are Devil's Hole pupfish in Devils Hole, moapa dace in Muddy River and the <b>Cui-ui</b> in Pyramid Lake and Truckee River.|$|E
50|$|The Truckee River has {{a length}} of over 115 mi and drains an area of {{approximately}} 3120 square miles, not counting the extent of its Lake Tahoe sub-basin. The DSSAM model establishes numerous stations along the entire river extent {{as well as a}} considerable number of monitoring points inside the Great Basin's Pyramid Lake, the receiving waters of this closed hydrological system. Although the region is sparsely populated, it is important because Lake Tahoe is visited by 20 million persons per annum and Truckee River water quality affects at least two endangered species: the <b>Cui-ui</b> sucker fish and the Lahontan cutthroat trout.|$|E
50|$|The DSSAM Model is {{constructed}} to allow dynamic decay of most pollutants; for example, total {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} are allowed to be consumed by benthic algae in each time step, and the algal communities are given a separate population dynamic in each river reach (e.g. based upon river temperature). Regarding stormwater runoff in Washoe County, the specific elements within a new xeriscape ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model. For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in-river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two endangered species found in the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake: the <b>Cui-ui</b> sucker fish (endangered 1967) and the Lahontan cutthroat trout (threatened 1970).|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{different}} uses of {{the model}} have been made including (a)analysis of public policies for urban stormwater runoff, (b) researching agricultural methods for surface runoff minimization, (c) innovative solutions for non-point source control and d)engineering aspects of treated wastewater discharge. Regarding stormwater runoff in Washoe County, the specific elements within a new xeriscape ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model. For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of adverse impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two endangered species found in the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake: the <b>Cui-ui</b> sucker fish (endangered 1967) and the Lahontan cutthroat trout (threatened 1970). When the model is used for surface runoff reaching a stream, this pollutant input {{can be viewed as}} a line source (e.g., a continuous linear source of pollution entering the waterway).|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} rivers {{in the western}} United States, the Truckee's flow is highly {{regulated}} with most river flow fully allocated through a system of water rights. This system over-allocates available water during low flow periods. Disputes occur among those asserting rights to the water. In the early 20th century, the Newlands Reclamation Act instituted a diversion that removed river flows from the Truckee River watershed and transferred them to the Carson River watershed. Currently the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District supervises the diversion of approximately one-third of the river flow at the Derby Dam to the Lahontan Valley to irrigate alfalfa and pastures. Truckee River water is also supplied to the resort communities surrounding Lake Tahoe, the greater metropolitan area of Reno and Sparks, and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Indian Reservation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses some of the water to induce spawning of the endangered fish <b>cui-ui</b> and to provide drought relief.|$|E
5000|$|Major {{fish species}} include the <b>Cui-ui</b> lakesucker, which is endemic to Pyramid Lake, the Tui chub and Lahontan {{cutthroat}} trout (the world record cutthroat trout {{was caught in}} Pyramid Lake). The former is endangered, and the latter is threatened. Both species were of critical importance to the Paiute people in pre-contact times. [...] As they are both obligate freshwater spawners, they rely on sufficient inflow {{to allow them to}} run up the Truckee River to spawn, otherwise their eggs will not hatch. Diversion of the Truckee for irrigation since the early 20th century has reduced inflow such that it is now rarely sufficient for spawning. Due to the construction of Derby Dam in 1903 to divert water to croplands in Fallon, which lowered water levels in the lake and blocked upstream spawning runs {{due to a lack of}} fish ladders, by 1939 the Lahontan cutthroat trout (the [...] "salmon-trout" [...] as described by Frémont) became extinct in Pyramid Lake and its tributaries. They were replaced with hatchery trout from outside the watershed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-In the {{economics}} of biodiversity, the relevant policy question {{is the level of}} certainty of species survival, rather than the simplistic binary problem of species preservation or extinction. In this study models of <b>cui-ui</b> survival probability and economic cost of water transfer are developed to estimate the cost of an endangered species preservation: the Northwestern Nevada <b>cui-ui</b> fish. There is a cost of over 160 million dollars to increase the likelihood of <b>cui-ui</b> survival by 2 percent, from 53 to 55. The cost increases to over 2 billion dollars to increase the likelihood of <b>cui-ui</b> survival by 22 percent, from 63 to 85. These findings highlight the economic trade-offs associated with modifying the survival likelihood of an endangered species. These results also confirm quantitatively the biological fact that the survival uncertainty must explicitly enter any discussion of species preservation. · I...|$|E
40|$|Pyramid Lake is {{the site}} of some of the Earth’s most {{spectacular}} tufa deposits. Tufa is a rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) that forms at the mouth of a spring, from lake water, or from a mixture of spring and lake water. The explorer John C. Fremont (1845) wrote about the tufas during his 1843 - 44 expedition and named the lake after the pyramidal-shaped island that lies along the east shore of the lake (fig. 1). The Paiute name for the island is Wono, meaning cone-shaped basket. The Paiute name for the lake is <b>Cui-Ui</b> Panunadu, meaning fish in standing water. The U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, has obtained radiocarbon ages of many of the tufa deposits that border Pyramid Lake in order to obtain a record of lake level change for the past 35, 000 years (Benson, 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|Pyramid Lake is {{situated}} on {{the western end of}} the Great Basin Desert, in Northern Nevada. This alkaline lake has no outlet; it is fed by the end point of the Truckee River 2 ̆ 7 s descent from Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Both the lake and the river once contained a flourishing native fishery which included the Lahontan cutthroat trout, and the <b>Cui-ui</b> Sucker. Unfortunately, one hundred years after white settlement in the area, one of North America 2 ̆ 7 s largest trout had become nearly extinct mainly due to the construction of diversion dams, pollution, and overfishing. In an attempt to rebuild the lost fisheries and provide recreation for sports anglers, the Nevada State Fish Commission introduced what they deemed to be favorable non-native gamefish. Acting with an incomplete understanding of watershed ecology, the commision experimented by planting fish raised in hatcheries across Nevada and the West. Some species quickly multiplied in their new environment, while others struggled to survive. At Pyramid Lake, the introduction of rainbow trout and land-locked salmon was largely a failure, and fisheries biologists realized they needed to restore cutthroat trout to the lake. However, in the Truckee River, stable populations of wild rainbow and brown trout replaced the native cutthroat. This paper uses primary sources to examine the cultural context and motivations behind the introduction of non-native fish in Pyramid Lake and the Truckee River. Over time, non-native introductions constructed the fishery that Northern Nevada residents and visitors are now familiar with. This process of change continues even in the present day...|$|E
40|$|The current U. S. {{government}} policy of Indian Self-Determination {{is determined by}} the principle of tribal sovereignty, which defines how issues identified in Indian Country are addressed. However, tribal sovereignty represents an ideal that has regularly been ignored or contested by private and corporate entities, as well as state and federal government agencies. My research explores this case study of the successful assertion of tribal sovereignty by the Pyramid Lake Paiute tribe as they worked to save Pyramid Lake, the spiritual and economic heart of their reservation. The Pyramid Lake Tribe employed several strategies to secure water for Pyramid Lake and to save the endangered endemic species of fish, the <b>cui-ui</b> and Lahonton cutthroat trout, from extinction. They were opposed by an iron triangle composed of the Nevada Group, an interest group of Nevada water users, the Bureau of Reclamation, and Nevada’s congressional delegation which tried to monopolize the waters of the Truckee River. Through numerous court cases and lobbying Congress, the Pyramid Lake Tribe was able to establish that no water issues could be settled without their input. With this nearly all stake holders entered into negotiations to reach an agreement that would serve the needs of every group: the Truckee-Carson-Pyramid Lake Negotiated Settlement Agreement, or PL 101 - 618. The Truckee River Operating agreement was then worked out over the next eighteen years to operationalize PL 101 - 618. I also explore the question of “where sovereignty lies,” which has important implications for legitimacy of government. For the U. S. government, sovereignty on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Indian reservation lies with the enrolled members of the tribe; however, there is evidence that for some of the people at Pyramid Lake, sovereignty lies with the families. I suggest this disconnect may drive factional conflict within the Pyramid Lake Tribe, which interferes with tribal governance. The members of the Pyramid Lake Tribe and their council are actively working to find solutions to issues created by the limitations of tribal sovereignty and resolutions to the internal conflict that creates animosity among the tribal members. They favor solutions that do not limit their sovereignty. EthnologyDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico. Dept. of AnthropologyField, LesSinger, BeverlyWatkins, JoeWilds, Lea...|$|E
