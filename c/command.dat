5|$|The power {{contest between}} the allied Military Committee and the Regionalists against the National <b>Command</b> was fought out {{within the party}} {{structure}}. However, the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure on its head. At the 2nd Regional Congress (held in March 1965), {{it was decided to}} endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional <b>Command</b> would be the ex officio head of state, and the Regional <b>Command</b> acquired the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff, and the top military commanders. This change curtailed the powers of the National <b>Command,</b> who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs. In response, at the 8th National Congress (April 1965) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists, but was persuaded not to by fellow National <b>Command</b> members – most notably by a Lebanese member, Jibran Majdalani, and a Saudi member, Ali Ghannam – because it could lead to the removal of the party's civilian leadership, as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch. Because of this decision, Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General, to be succeeded by fellow National <b>Command</b> member Munif al-Razzaz. Razzaz was a Syrian-born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis, even if under his <b>command</b> several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place. Not longer after Aflaq's loss of office, Hafiz, the Secretary of the Regional <b>Command,</b> changed his allegiance to support the National <b>Command.</b> While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria (he held the offices of Regional <b>Command</b> secretary, Chairman of the Presidential Council, prime minister and commander-in-chief), it was Jadid, the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional <b>Command,</b> who was the de facto leader of Syria.|$|E
