50|$|In {{recent years}} a 1969 memo written by Jaffe {{has been a}} source of {{controversy}} on the Internet. The memo, written to Bernard Berelson, head of the Population Council, included a table that summarized many proposals from various sources regarding population control. This memo has been cited to accuse Jaffe and Planned Parenthood of supporting such measures as <b>compulsory</b> <b>abortions</b> and sterilizations, which were among the proposals referenced. In fact the table was a listing of current proposals, with sources documented, not the policies of Planned Parenthood.|$|R
50|$|In October 2012 the {{magazine}} was guest-edited by Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei and, for the first time, published simultaneously in Mandarin (in digital form) and English. To evade China's internet censors, the New Statesman uploaded the issue to file-sharing sites such as BitTorrent. As well as writing that week's editorial, Ai Weiwei interviewed the Chinese civil rights activist Chen Guangcheng, who fled to the United States after exposing the use of <b>compulsory</b> <b>abortions</b> and sterilisations. The issue was launched on 19 October 2012 at The Lisson Gallery in London, where speakers including artist Anish Kapoor and lawyer Mark Stephens paid tribute to Ai Weiwei.|$|R

50|$|Some abortions are {{undergone}} as {{the result}} of societal pressures. These might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race, disapproval of single or early motherhood, stigmatization of people with disabilities, insufficient economic support for families, lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward population control (such as China's one-child policy). These factors can sometimes result in <b>compulsory</b> <b>abortion</b> or sex-selective abortion.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent years}} a 1969 memo written by Frederick S. Jaffe {{has been a}} source of controversy. The memo, written to Berelson while he was head of the Population Council, {{included}} a table that summarized many proposals from various sources regarding population control. This table contained proposals such as <b>compulsory</b> <b>abortions</b> and sterilizations, encouraging homosexuality, forcing women to work, and other notions that no one would imagine an organization like Planned Parenthood would be associated with. In point of fact, however, Jaffe's table was included in a report by a Planned Parenthood official that worked for Jaffe, that said [...] "The report was prepared in behalf of Planned Parenthood's Population Education Staff Committee as a basis for discussion of and action on the U.S. population problem by the Planned Parenthood national organization." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a social}} movement, {{eugenics}} reached its greatest {{popularity in the}} early decades of the 20th century, when it was practiced around the world and promoted by governments, institutions, and influential individuals. Many countries enacted various eugenics policies, including: genetic screenings, birth control, promoting differential birth rates, marriage restrictions, segregation (both racial segregation and sequestering the mentally ill), <b>compulsory</b> sterilization, forced <b>abortions</b> or forced pregnancies, ultimately culminating in genocide.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} how African American doctors {{interpreted}} eugenic {{thought in the}} early twentieth century. African American doctors embraced eugenics for its potential to improve the health of their race, thus bringing about a kind of "biological racial uplift. " African American doctors thus drew on their discipline to pursue a form of eugenic activism that had internal and external ramifications for the race.. Even though African Americans faced medical injustice, they were not simply the victims of eugenics and scientific racism. They were also critics and proponents of eugenics. The first chapter will address how eugenics shaped African American discussions of public health, and how eugenic ideas about sex and sexuality influenced their discourse and understanding of venereal disease. The second chapter will examine how African American doctors discussed birth control, <b>compulsory</b> sterilization, and <b>abortion</b> within the context of racial uplift...|$|R
50|$|Black Bolt would {{eventually}} become {{the king of}} the Inhumans upon the death of his parents. Medusa oversaw the moving of Attilan to the Blue Area of the Moon. Alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, she battled the Avengers under Maximus's mind control. Medusa and Black Bolt were then married and Medusa was made queen, becoming both royal consort and royal interpreter. When Medusa became pregnant, Attilan's Genetics Council argued that the pregnancy should be terminated due to the possibility of the child inheriting Maximus' insanity coupled with Black Bolt's immense and destructive power. Medusa defied the Council and fled to Earth to avoid the <b>compulsory</b> <b>abortion</b> and live anonymously in the desert until the child was born, a son named Ahura. Black Bolt reconciled with Medusa and the pair returned to Attilan and turned their infant son over to the Genetics Council. Following these events Ahura was not mentioned or seen in the Marvel Universe for several years.|$|E
