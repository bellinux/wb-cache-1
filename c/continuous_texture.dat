50|$|In vision, {{filling-in}} phenomena {{are those}} responsible for the completion of missing information across the physiological blind spot, and across natural and artificial scotomata. There is also evidence for similar mechanisms of completion in normal visual analysis. Classical demonstrations of perceptual filling-in involve filling in at the blind spot in monocular vision, and images stabilized on the retina either by means of special lenses, or under certain conditions of steady fixation. For example, naturally in monocular vision at the physiological blind spot, the percept is not a hole in the visual field, but the content is “filled-in” based on information from the surrounding visual field. When a textured stimulus is presented centered on but extending beyond the region of the blind spot, a <b>continuous</b> <b>texture</b> is perceived. This partially inferred percept is paradoxically considered more reliable than a percept based on external input. (Ehinger et al. 2017).|$|E

Approaching sound mass {{from the perspective of}} auditory scene analysis, we define it as a type of auditory grouping that retains an impression of multiplicity even as it is perceived as a perceptual unit. Sound mass requires all markers of the individual identities of sounds to be deemphasized to prevent them from splitting off into separate streams. Seeking to determine how consistent listeners are in their perception of sound mass, and whether it is possible to determine sound parameters and threshold values that predict sound mass perception, we conducted two perceptual studies on Ligeti’s Continuum. This piece consists of an extremely rapid, steady stream of eighth-note dyads with no tempo changes. We addressed the claim by Ligeti and others that the fusion into a <b>continuous</b> <b>texture</b> or sound mass occurs at ca. 20 attacks/s, hypothesizing that other factors such as pitch organization, emergent rhythm, timbre, and register would affect this value. A variety of factors were found to affect sound mass perception, suggesting that the threshold value is not absolute but varies according to principles of auditory scene analysis...|$|E
40|$|To {{provide a}} {{realistic}} haptic sensation, cutaneous, thermal, and kinaesthetic sensation should be simultaneously conveyed to a user. While many research {{efforts have been}} conducted to develop separate haptic modules, it is quite challenging to construct an integrated haptic device which is sufficiently small to be incorporated into a computer mouse interface. In an effort to achieve this goal, this study proposes the new design of a compact combined haptic device with cutaneous, thermal, and kinaesthetic modules. To convey realistic tactile sensations despite the limited size of the interface, the cutaneous module includes a 3 × 3 miniature pin-array display and an amplitude-modulated (AM) vibration generator. The pin-array display is intended to mimic both small-scale shapes and rough surfaces. The AM vibration generator creates a variety of amplitude-modulated vibrations to replicate the <b>continuous</b> <b>texture</b> of a virtual object. To further convey the temperature and thermophysical properties of an object, the thermal module including a peltier element and a cooling jacket is integrated to the cutaneous module. Since the kinaesthetic information is equally important while perceiving objects, two kinaesthetic actuators operated by MR fluids are located on the control circuit board while supporting the cutaneous and thermal modules.

40|$|When texture is {{incorporated}} in the finite element simulation of a metal forming process. much computer time can be saved by replacing <b>continuous</b> <b>texture</b> and corresponding yield locus updates by intermittent updates after strain intervals of e. g. 20 %. The hypothesis that {{the evolution of the}} anisotropic properties of a polycrystalline material during such finite interval of plastic deformation can be modelled by just rotating the initial texture instead of continuously updating it by means of a polycrystal deformation model is tested in this work. Two spins for rotating the frame have been assessed. the classical rigid body spin and a crystal plasticity based "Mandel spin" (calculated from the rotated initial texture) which is the average of the spins of all the crystal lattices of the polycrystal. Each of these methods was used to study the evolution of the yield locus and the r-value distribution during the 20 % strain interval. The results were compared to those obtained by simulating the texture evolution continuously using a polycrystal deformation model. When the texture was nor updated during deformation, it was found that for most initial textures the Mandel spin does not perform better than the rigid body spin, except For some special initial textures for which the Mandel spin is much better. The latter ones are textures which are almost stable for the corresponding strain mode. When the texture was updated after each strain interval of e. g. 20 % the Mandel spin performed much better than the rigid body spin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Texture is an {{essential}} component of computer generated models. For a texture mapping procedure to be effective it has to generate <b>continuous</b> <b>textures</b> and cause only small mapping distortion. The Angle Based Flattening (ABF) parameterization method is guaranteed to provide a continuous (no foldovers) mapping. It also minimizes the angular distortion of the parameterization, including locating the optimal planar domain boundary. However, since it concentrates on minimizing the angular distortion of the mapping, it can introduce relatively large linear distortion. In this paper we introduce a new procedure for reducing length distortion of an existing parameterization and apply it to ABF results. The linear distortion reduction is added as a second step in a texture mapping computation. The new method is based on computing a mapping from the plane to itself which has length distortion very {{similar to that of the}} ABF parameterization. By applying the inverse mapping to the result of the initial parameterization, we obtain a new parameterization with low length distortion. We notice that the procedure for computing the inverse mapping can be applied to any other (convenient) mapping from the three-dimensional surface to the plane in order to improve it. The mapping in the plane is computed by applying weighted Laplacian smoothing to a Cartesian grid covering the planar domain of the initial mapping. Both the mapping and its inverse are provably continuous. Since angle preserving (conformal) mappings, such as ABF, locally preserve distances as well, the planar mapping has small local deformation. As a result, the inverse mapping does not significantly increase the angular distortion...|$|R

Considering the rapid growth of the population over the last three decades, the city’s development area has been extended, significantly. This significant expansion has impacted natural lands on suburb and even some parts e. g. rangelands and agricultural area have been transited to urban land uses. The study was aimed at analyzing and simulating land use changes in Mashhad, Iran. The work needs a model to simulate land use changes among multiple categories and combine spatial and temporal changes during the projection period. Thus, Cellular Automata-Markov model was chosen to meet this target. In this work, the projected time period corresponded to the final 20 -year vision period of all-round development of Iran for the target point of   2025 based on a long-term plan. Multi criteria evaluation approach integrated along with analytic hierarchy process were employed for preparing suitability maps for the five land uses, i. e. urban continuous patches, urban discontinuous patches, rural patches, agricultural lands, and range lands. Having applied the matrices utilized in model calibration, the best kappa coefficient proved {{to be associated with the}} land use maps dated 1996 and 2002. The Kappa index of quantity and allocation agreement was determined to be 0. 9189 and 0. 9529, respectively, which established an almost perfect agreement between simulated and observed land uses {{according to}} the year 2015.

SEM revealed a change from a <b>continuous</b> lamellar <b>texture</b> at low temperatures to one based upon isolated sheaf-like objects at 124 degrees C.

Hot deformation {{and associated}} structural changes were studied in compression of a magnesium alloy AZ 31 with initial grain sizes (D 0) of 22 µm and 90 µm at {{a temperature of}} 573 K. D 0 influences significantly the flow curve and the kinetics of grain refinement during hot deformation. For D 0 = 22 µm, grain fragmentation takes place due to frequent formation of kink bands initially at corrugated grain boundaries and then in grain interiors in low strain, followed by full development of new fine grains in high strain. For D 0 = 90 µm, in contrast, twinning takes place in coarser original grains, and then kink bands and new fine grains are formed mainly in finer ones at low strains. Then new grains are formed in necklace along the boundaries of coarse original grains, followed by their development into the grain interiors.

Five pavement test sections, including two diamond-ground concrete pavements, one diamond-ground concrete bridge deck, one diamond-ground asphalt pavement, and one transversely tined concrete pavement, were selected for evaluation. Laser scanner testing was performed to capture both macro and microtexture profiles. Locked wheel testing was performed to measure the friction numbers.
