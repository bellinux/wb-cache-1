5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the <b>cribriform</b> plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
25|$|The {{nasal septum}} is {{composed}} of the quadrangular cartilage, the vomer bone (the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), aspects of the premaxilla, and the palatine bones. Each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of turbinates (nasal conchae), which are small, thin, shell-form bones: (i) the superior concha, (ii) the middle concha, and (iii) the inferior concha, which are the bony framework of the turbinates. Lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. Inferior to the nasal conchae (turbinates) is the meatus space, with names that correspond to the turbinates, e.g. superior turbinate, superior meatus, et alii. The internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal, perforated <b>cribriform</b> plate (of the ethmoid bone) through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve (Cranial nerve I); finally, below and behind (posteroinferior) the <b>cribriform</b> plate, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.|$|E
25|$|When the {{internal}} carotid artery enters the canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, it first ascends a short distance, then curves anteriorly and medially. The artery lies at first {{in front of the}} cochlea and tympanic cavity; from the latter cavity it is separated by a thin, bony lamella, which is <b>cribriform</b> in the young subject, and often partly absorbed in old age. Farther forward it is separated from the trigeminal ganglion by a thin plate of bone, which forms the floor of the fossa for the ganglion and the roof of the horizontal portion of the canal. Frequently this bony plate is more or less deficient, and then the ganglion is separated from the artery by fibrous membrane. The artery is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of dura mater, and is surrounded by a number of small veins and by filaments of the carotid plexus, derived from the ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.|$|E

The present study documents the histological, radiological and clinical features of seven cases treated at the Policlinico Umberto I of Rome from 1999 to 2010. There were five males and two females. Most of the cases were located in the supratentorial space, especially the convexity. Surgical gross total resection was achieved in four cases. Of the remaining three cases, two relapsed and underwent further surgeries and adjuvant treatment. The MIB- 1 index had a mean value of 7. 5 (range 0. 3 - 25. 8). Tumors were composed of epithelioid cells or plump to spindle cells, forming cords, <b>cribriforms</b> or nests, in a mucoid matrix. All tumors showed diffuse positive immunoreactivity to vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen. Surgery is {{the first line of}} treatment for this kind of lesion. Gross total resection guaranteed a survival free from recurrences in our series. On the other hand, radiation therapy must be considered in patients submitted to a subtotal resection...|$|R

The studies of histopathology on diseases in EGs, however, are scarce. In the present study, we systematically investigated EGs in 36 resection cases of gastric cardiac carcinomas involving the esophagus (GCE) in Chinese patients. All cases showed chronic inflammation in EGs and 14 (39 %) with Helicobacter pylori infection. Hyperplasia, atrophy, and dysplasia were common in EGs and observed in 21 (58 %), 14 (39 %), and 28 (78 %) cases, respectively. These changes were associated with various types of metaplasia, including intestinal (6, 17 %), oncocytic (26, 72 %), pancreatic acinar (11, 30 %), and squamoid metaplasia (8, 22 %). Oncocytic metaplasia was patchy, frequently replaced the entire lobule with dysplastic features. Pancreatic acinar metaplasia was present in superficial EGs as small acinar patches. Squamoid metaplasia {{was limited to the}} EG drainage ductile epithelium without keratin pearls or intercellular bridges; however, cytoplasmic vesicles and secretory vacuoles were common, suggesting dual differentiation. Dysplastic EGs featured architectural disarray with fused acini, <b>cribriforming,</b> abortive growth, and nuclear hyperchromasia, enlargement, and overlapping. The results demonstrate a spectrum of histopathologic changes in EGs and ductile epithelium, which is similar to those observed in GCE in Chinese patients.

The whole skin is studded with minute glass anchors, some hanging freely from the surface, but most imbedded in the skin. Each of these anchors is jointed at its root into one end of a curious <b>cribriform</b> plate, - in plain English, one pierced like a sieve, which lies under the skin, and reminds one of the similar plates in the skin of the White Cucumaria, which I will show you presently; and both of these we must regard as the first rudiments of an Echinoderm's outside skeleton, such as in the Sea-urchins covers the whole body of the animal.

5000|$|The {{olfactory}} foramina, {{also known}} as the <b>cribriform</b> foramina (cribr- is [...] "a sieve" [...] in Greek), is the grouping of holes located on the <b>cribriform</b> plate. The <b>cribriform</b> plate forms the roof of the nasal cavity, and the olfactory foramina are in the two depressions lateral to the median blade of the <b>cribriform</b> plate called the crista galli. There is a pair of olfactory bulbs of the brain that rest in these two depressions. These holes that make up the olfactory foramina allow passage for about 20 bundles of nerve fibers that make up the olfactory nerve, {{also known as}} Cranial Nerve I (CNI), from the nasal cavity to meet with the olfactory bulbs. Therefore, the olfactory foramina are necessary for the human sense of [...] smell. These foramina vary in size and number with age.|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{with high}} levels of {{microsatellite}} instability (MSI-H) is the hallmark of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, and MSI-H occurs in ∼ 15 % of sporadic colorectal carcinomas that have improved prognosis. We examined the utility of histopathology for the identification of MSI-H cancers by evaluating the features of 323 sporadic carcinomas using specified criteria and comparing the results to MSI-H status. Coded hematoxylin and eosin sections were evaluated for tumor features (signet ring cells; mucinous histology; <b>cribriforming,</b> poor differentiation, and medullary-type pattern; sponge-like mucinous growth; pushing invasive margin) and features of host immune response (Crohn’s-like lymphoid reaction, intratumoral lymphocytic infiltrate, and intraepithelial T cells by immunohistochemistry for CD 3 with morphometry). Interobserver variation among five pathologists was determined. Subjective interpretation of histopathology as an indication for MSI testing was recorded. We found that medullary carcinoma, intraepithelial lymphocytosis, and poor differentiation were the best discriminators between MSI-H and microsatellite-stable cancers (odds ratio: 37. 8, 9. 8, and 4. 0, respectively; P = 0. 000003 to < 0. 000001) with high specificity (99 to 87 %). The sensitivities, however, were very low (14 to 38 %), and interobserver agreement was good only for evaluation of poor differentiation (kappa, 0. 69). Mucinous histopathological type and presence of signet ring cells had low odds ratios of 3. 3 and 2. 7 (P = 0. 005 and P = 0. 02) with specificities of 95 % but sensitivities of only 15 and 13 %. Subjective interpretation of the overall histopathology as suggesting MSI-H performed better than any individual feature; the odds ratio was 7. 5 (P < 0. 000001) with sensitivity of 49 %, specificity of 89 %, and moderate interobserver agreement (kappa, 0. 52). Forty intraepithelial CD 3 -positive lymphocytes/ 0. 94 mm 2, as established by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, resulted in an odds ratio of 6. 0 (P < 0. 000001) with sensitivity of 75 % and specificity of 67 %. Our findings indicate that histopathological evaluation can be used to prioritize sporadic colon cancers for MSI studies, but morphological prediction of MSI-H has low sensitivity, requiring molecular analysis for therapeutic decisions...|$|R
