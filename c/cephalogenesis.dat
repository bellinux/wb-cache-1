50|$|In 1810 Spix {{came back}} to Munich where he sorted the zoological {{collection}} and wrote his first publication on starfish and other marine animals. After this first fundamental publication, {{a book about the}} history of zoological classification, published in 1811, he was appointed member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Spix was also appointed the first conservator, now inline with the title director, of the Bavarian zoological collection, considered as the foundation of the Zoologische Staatssammlung München. He published several further works, the most important being a comparative morphology of the skulls of many different animals, including men, apes, reptiles, birds and others. This book, the <b>Cephalogenesis,</b> published in 1815, was written in Latin and illustrated with beautiful lithographs.|$|E
5000|$|All of Oken's {{writings}} are deductive {{illustrations of}} an assumed principle, which, with other philosophers of the transcendental school, he deemed {{equal to the}} explanation of all the mysteries of nature. According to him, the head was a repetition of the trunk—a kind of second trunk, with its limbs and other appendages; this sum of his observations and comparisons—few of which he ever gave in detail—ought always to be borne in mind in comparing the share taken by Oken in homological anatomy with the progress made by other cultivators of that philosophical branch of the science. The idea of the analogy between the skull, or parts of the skull, and the vertebral column had been previously propounded and ventilated in their lectures by Johann von Autenrieth (1772-1835) and Carl Kielmeyer (1765-1844), and {{in the writings of}} Johann Frank (1745-1821). By Oken it was applied chiefly in illustration of the mystical system of Schelling—the [...] "all-in-all" [...] and [...] "all-in-every-part." [...] From the earliest to the latest of Oken's writings on the subject, [...] "the head is a repetition of the whole trunk with all its systems: the brain is the spinal cord; the cranium is the vertebral column; the mouth is intestine and abdomen; the nose is the lungs and thorax; the jaws are the limbs; and the teeth the claws or nails." [...] Johann von Spix (1781-1826) in his folio <b>Cephalogenesis</b> (1818), richly illustrated comparative craniology, but presented the facts under the same transcendental guise; and Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) availed himself of the extravagances of these disciples of Schelling to cast ridicule on the whole inquiry into those higher relations of parts to the archetype which Sir Richard Owen (1804-1892) called [...] "general homologies." ...|$|E
40|$|En las teorías embriogénicas de las malformaciones del macizo craneofacial es frecuente encontrar explicaciones simplistas, que no aluden a la biología celular, ni {{molecular}} de sus fisiopatologías. El propósito de esta investigación fue describir las teorías de la cefalogénesis y sus malformaciones craneofaciales, como requisito para proponerteorías integradoras que favorezcan su mejor comprensión. Se realizó una revisión biobliográfica sobre el tema de la cefalogénesis y las concepciones científicas actuales concernientes a las teorías de las malformaciones congénitas craneofaciales. Se realizó una revisión en Internet, en el periodo comprendido entre diciembre de 2011 y enero de 2012. Se analizaron los artículos de revistas de la Web of Sciences que trataron este tema desde el año 2006 hasta el 2012 en los buscadores Google academico, Hinari, Scopus, Scielo y Medline. Como resultado se obtuvieron 131 artículos que fueron tamizados; pero el estudio se ciñó solo a 43 artículos que enfocaron estas temáticas de manera más integral. Se consideraron reduccionitas o incompletas las teorías hasta ahora expuestas. Por tal motivo se propusieron teorías holístico-sinérgicas de la cefalogénesis y sus malformaciones. Frequently {{is possible}} to find simplistic explanations regarding the embriogenics theories of craniofacial malformations, without any explanation about cellular or molecular biology of this physiopathology process. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to provide elements to allow the understanding of <b>cephalogenesis</b> as to value theories of <b>cephalogenesis</b> and craniofacial malformations and to suggest an integrative theory. A bibliographic study was carried out about <b>cephalogenesis,</b> and current scientific conceptions on theories of craniofacial congenital malformations. An Internet exploring was made during December of 2011 to January of 2012. Was evaluated the Web of Sciences reports related those topics published since 2006 to 2012 in searching as: Academic Google, Hinari, Scopus, Scielo and Medline. Was obtained 131 reports as result they wich were sifted and bounded to 43 papers focused this topic in an integral way. As conclusion was brought up to date <b>cephalogenesis,</b> and their alterations since the knowledge of differents biological levels that participate in cranial grown. It was considered simplistic or incomplete the theories used until now and intended holistic-sinergic theories of <b>cephalogenesis</b> and their malformations...|$|E
40|$|The binding {{sites of}} several lectins (Con-A, SBA, WGA, PNA, RCA-I, UEA-I, DBA) were {{studied in the}} {{different}} tissues involved in mouse visceral <b>cephalogenesis.</b> As compared to various other lectins which have only a weak affinity for precartilaginous rudiments, PNA preceded by neuraminidase treatment shows a very strong fixation in the precartilaginous blastemata and their immediate environment. PNA receptors exist also on the enamel epithelium and mesenchymal sac. RCA affinity for blood vessels has also enabled detailed observations on the vascularization of the palatal shelves, particularly in area 3. Various other localizations have been described and correlated with other histochemical data. Comparative StudyJournal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Apoptosis is an {{essential}} common final pathway in numerous pathological conditions such as malignant tumors, HIV-related CD 4 lymphocytes degeneration, neurodegenerative disorders, and in programmed cell death events during normal embryogenesis. Some teratogenic substances for man and laboratory mammals induce an increase of the apoptotic phenomenon, responsible for the occurrence of some precise cranio-maxillo-facial malformations. The study of cell death during normal or teratogenic embryonic development allows to analyse the cellular mechanisms implied in {{the control of the}} apoptotic phenomenon, together with its dysregulation ending in pathological processes. We review the cell death phenomenon during <b>cephalogenesis,</b> both during normal embryogenesis, or in teratogenic conditions known to induce cranio-maxillo-facial malformations.

40|$|The {{fixation}} {{sites of}} two antibodies, HNK- 1 -anti-leu 7 and anti- HNK- 1 /N-CAM, were studied during visceral <b>cephalogenesis</b> in the rat. The labelling patterns of both antibodies were different. Anti-leu 7 staining {{was restricted to}} trunk neural crest cells, the peripheral nervous system, myotomes and premuscular cells, the eye rudiment and the olfactory vesicle. On the other hand, anti- HNK- 1 /N-CAM extended to the otocyst, several epithelia (including tooth germs) and precartilages. Anti-HNK- 1 /N-CAM staining of somites and cranial nerve ganglia was more precocious than anti-leu 7 labelling. We conclude that both antibodies, despite several common sites labelling, display quite different immunological properties, and that the expression "HNK- 1 " positive has no absolute significance.

40|$|A bilaterally {{symmetrical}} convex dodecahedron {{consisting of}} twelve quadrilateral faces {{is derived from}} the icosahedron via a process akin to Fuller&# 8217;s Jitterbug Transformation. The unusual zygomorphic dodecahedron so obtained is shown to harbor a bilaterally symmetrical jazz/blues harmonic code on its twelve faces that is related to such fundamental music theoretical constructs as the Circle of Fifths and Euler&# 8217;s tonnetz. Curiously, the patterning within the aforementioned zygo-dodecahedron is discernibly similar to that observed in a ventral view of the human brain. Moreover, this same pattern is arguably evident during development of the embryonic pharynx. A possible role for the featured zygo-dodecahedron in <b>cephalogenesis</b> is considered. Recent studies concerning type II cadherins, an important class of proteins that promote cell adhesion, have generated data that is demonstrated to conform to this zygo-dodecahedral brain model in a substantially congruous manner...|$|E
40|$|The Dumbo rat is {{characterized}} by a short snout, low ears and relative hypoplasia of maxillar and zygomatic bones. It corresponds to an autosomal recessive genotype. Previous study demonstrated a global deficit of Dlx 1 and Msx 1 genes expression in comparison to Wistar embryos as considered as control animals. We performed a histological study of cephalic development of Dumbo rats compared to Wistar embryos and an immunohistochemical analysis of Dlx 1 and Msx 1 protein expression during <b>cephalogenesis.</b> Our data indicate that the pattern of expression of both genes is similar in both strains, but that quantitative differences in gene expression can be the result of delayed organogenesis in Dumbo rat in comparison to Wistar. Some data about gene expressions are discussed at the light of the postulated function of Dlx 1 and Msx 1 in cephalic development.
