40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>covering</b> an input graph H with graphs from a fixed <b>covering</b> class G. The classical <b>covering</b> number of H with respect to G is the minimum number of graphs from G needed to cover the edges of H without <b>covering</b> non-edges of H. We introduce a unifying notion of three <b>covering</b> parameters with respect to G, {{two of which are}} novel concepts only considered in special cases before: the local and the folded <b>covering</b> number. Each parameter measures " how far " H is from G in a different way. Whereas the folded <b>covering</b> number has been investigated thoroughly for some <b>covering</b> classes, e. g., interval graphs and planar graphs, the local <b>covering</b> number has received little attention. We provide new bounds on each <b>covering</b> number with respect to the following <b>covering</b> classes: linear forests, star forests, caterpillar forests, and interval graphs. The classical graph parameters that result this way are interval number, track number, linear arboricity, star arboricity, and caterpillar arboricity. As input graphs we consider graphs of bounded degeneracy, bounded degree, bounded tree-width or bounded simple tree-width, as well as outerplanar, planar bipartite, and planar graphs. For several pairs of an input class and a <b>covering</b> class we determine exactly the maximum ordinary, local, and folded <b>covering</b> number of an input graph with respect to that <b>covering</b> class...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Covering {{approximation}} spaces is a {{class of}} important generalization of approximation spaces. For a subset X of a <b>covering</b> approximation space (U, C), is X definable or rough?

Note {{that there are many}} various <b>covering</b> approximation operators, which can be endowed on <b>covering</b> approximation spaces. This paper investigates <b>covering</b> approximation spaces endowed ten <b>covering</b> approximation operators respectively, and establishes some relations among definable subsets, inner definable subsets and outer definable subsets in <b>covering</b> approximation spaces, which deepens some results on definable subsets in approximation spaces.
