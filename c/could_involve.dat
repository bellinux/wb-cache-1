5|$|Lynching was {{a terrifying}} and {{relatively}} uncommon spectacle. It <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> victims being hanged furtively by a mob at night, or {{in front of}} hundreds or even thousands of witnesses during the day. An audience of 10,000, including the mayor and chief of police, {{was said to have}} attended the lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco, Texas, in 1916. As well as being hanged, victims were sometimes burned alive and tortured, and body parts were removed and kept as souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Tribunes {{could use}} their sacrosanctity {{to order the}} use of capital {{punishment}} against any person who interfered with their duties. Tribunes could also use their sacrosanctity as protection when physically manhandling an individual, such as when arresting someone. On a couple of rare occasions (such as during the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus), a tribune might use a form of blanket obstruction, which <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> a broad veto over all governmental functions. While a tribune could veto any act of the senate, the assemblies, or the magistrates, he could only veto the act, and not the actual measure. Therefore, he had to physically be present when the act was occurring. As soon as that tribune was no longer present, the act could be completed as if {{there had never been}} a veto.|$|E
5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far {{out of step with the}} astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E

25|$|While Harvey Friedman's grand {{conjecture}} {{implies that}} any provable theorem (including Fermat's last theorem) can be proved using only 'elementary function arithmetic', such a proof need be ‘elementary’ {{only in a}} technical sense and <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> millions of steps, and thus be far too long to have been Fermat’s proof.|$|E

A new set of idents followed these up, revolving around scenes including each of the 4 letters before coming together at the end. These scenes <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> cartoon figures, or stars of current CBBC programmes. In 2010 the logo was updated to look more 3D.|$|E

25|$|Transmission {{can also}} be indirect, via another organism, either a vector (e.g. a {{mosquito}} or fly) or an intermediate host (e.g. tapeworm in pigs can be transmitted to humans who ingest improperly cooked pork). Indirect transmission <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> zoonoses or, more typically, larger pathogens like macroparasites with more complex life cycles. Transmissions can be autochthonous (i.e. between two individuals in the same place) or may involve travel of the microorganism or the affected hosts.|$|E
25|$|If organisms {{purposely}} {{limit their}} lifespans via ageing or semelparous behaviour, the associated evolved mechanisms {{could be very}} complex, just as mechanisms that provide for mentation, vision, digestion, or other biological function are typically very complex. Such a mechanism <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> hormones, signalling, sensing of external conditions, and other complex functions typical of evolved mechanisms. Such complex mechanisms could explain all of the observations of ageing and semelparous behaviours as described below.|$|E
25|$|To {{encourage}} {{investment in}} wind power, families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity {{within their own}} or an adjoining municipality. While this <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> purchasing a turbine outright, more often families purchased shares in wind turbine cooperatives which in turn invested in community wind turbines. By 1996 there were around 2,100 such cooperatives in the country. Opinion polls show that this direct involvement has helped the popularity of wind turbines, with some 86% of Danes supporting wind energy when compared with existing fuel sources.|$|E

Selection for the fellowship is through a competitive annual process, with about 20–25 fellows selected annually. It has a selection rate below 1%.|$|E
25|$|Revenues {{have been}} {{affected}} by the introduction of new products with higher margins; however, these innovations are often copied quickly by competing banks, pushing down trading margins. For example, brokerages commissions for bond and equity trading is a commodity business but structuring and trading derivatives has higher margins because each over-the-counter contract has to be uniquely structured and <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> complex pay-off and risk profiles. One growth area is private investment in public equity (PIPEs, otherwise known as Regulation D or Regulation S). Such transactions are privately negotiated between companies and accredited investors.|$|E
25|$|Both {{boys and}} girls could {{experience}} sexual harassment although girls experienced it more frequently. Members of the school community sexually harassed girls in and around school. Jobless men, unmarried men looking for partners or sex, and married men looking for sex, sexually harassed girls {{on their way to}} and from school. In some cases, this <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> sexual assault and rape. Girls in the 10 to 19 year age group were most affected. Rape perpetrators could be diverse men in the community or men passing through the community. When rape occurred at home, perpetrators included uncles, cousins, fathers and stepfathers. Girls could be abducted for marriage which meant the man did not have to pay a bride price. Some compensation might be paid to the girl's parents so they would acknowledge the marriage. Parents could arrange an early or forced marriage against the girl's wishes to continue her education.|$|E

25|$|Plans of {{extending}} the Red Line to the Eastside {{have been set}} aside with opening of the Metro Gold Line East extension to the neighborhoods of Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles in 2009. Although {{there are no plans}} to do such, it is conceivable that plans for a future eastward extension <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> the San Gabriel Valley rather than the Eastside. Some citizen proposals have included the conversion of the El Monte Busway to heavy rail, although this would disrupt the existing bus and Metrolink service along that corridor. Other rights-of-way that could host a Red Line extension, whether subway or at-grade, include the Union Pacific's Alhambra Trench, the former Pacific Electric two-track right of way extending through the City Terrace area to El Monte and Covina, and the median of Huntington Drive, which also held a two-track Pacific Electric line extending as far as Azusa & Glendora, until 1951, when it was removed.|$|E
500|$|FitzRoy {{knew that}} {{commanding}} a ship <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> stress and loneliness; he was {{fully aware of}} the suicide of Captain Stokes, and his own uncle Viscount Castlereagh had committed suicide under stress of overwork. For the first time he would be fully in charge with no commanding officer or second captain to consult, and {{it has been suggested that}} he felt the need for a gentleman companion who shared his scientific interests and could dine with him as an equal. There is no direct evidence to support this. Henslow described the position [...] "more as a companion than a mere collector", but this was an assurance that FitzRoy would treat his guest as a gentleman naturalist. Several other ships at this period carried unpaid civilians as naturalists.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{development}} of the DU spectrophotometer, analysis of a test sample to determine its components was a long, costly, and often inaccurate process. [...] A classical wet laboratory contained a wide variety of complicated apparatus. Test samples were run through a series of awkward and time-consuming qualitative processes to separate out and identify their components. Determining quantitative concentrations of those components in the sample involved further steps. [...] Processes <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> techniques for chemical reactions, precipitations, filtrations and dissolutions. Determination of the concentrations of known impurities in a known inorganic substance such as molten iron could be done in under thirty minutes. The determination of complex organic structures such as chlorophyll using wet and dry methods could take decades.|$|E

500|$|Various {{systems are}} under {{development}} at present aimed at harnessing the enormous potential available for wave power off Scotland's coasts. Pelamis Wave Power (previously Ocean Power Delivery) are an Edinburgh-based company whose Pelamis {{system has been}} tested off Orkney and Portugal. Their second generation P2 Pelamis machines are [...] long and [...] diameter. Five tubes joined together by hinged joints float semi-submerged {{on the surface of}} the ocean and move relative to each other as waves pass down the length of the machine. This motion is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which drive generators inside the machine to produce electricity. Future wave farm projects around Scotland <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> an arrangement of interlinked 1 MW machines connected to shore by a subsea transmission cable.|$|E
500|$|The {{chemical}} structure of proteins {{was still under}} debate at that time. [...] The most accepted (and ultimately correct) hypothesis was that proteins are linear polypeptides, i.e., unbranched polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. [...] However, a typical protein is remarkably long—hundreds of amino-acid residues—and several distinguished scientists were unsure whether such long, linear macromolecules could be stable in solution. [...] Further doubts about the polypeptide nature of proteins arose because some enzymes were observed to cleave proteins but not peptides, whereas other enzymes cleave peptides but not folded proteins. [...] Attempts to synthesize proteins in the test tube were unsuccessful, mainly due to the chirality of amino acids; naturally occurring proteins are composed of only left-handed amino acids. Hence, alternative chemical models of proteins were considered, such as the diketopiperazine hypothesis of Emil Abderhalden. However, no alternative model had yet explained why proteins yield only amino acids and peptides upon hydrolysis and proteolysis. [...] As clarified by Linderstrøm-Lang, these proteolysis data showed that denatured proteins were polypeptides, but no data had yet been obtained about the structure of folded proteins; thus, denaturation <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> a chemical change that converted folded proteins into polypeptides.|$|E
500|$|The Avenue Range Station {{massacre}} {{involved the}} shooting murders of nine Aboriginal people by white settlers on the Avenue Range pastoral {{station in the}} southeast of the colony of South Australia in late 1848, part of the Australian frontier wars. Those killed were a blind old man, three female adults, two teenage girls, and three female children including a baby. The pastoralist James Brown and his overseer were suspected of committing the murders, and Brown was charged {{with the murder of}} [...] "unknown aboriginal natives" [...] on 1 March 1849. The magistrate who committed him for trial observed to a friend that there was [...] "little question of the butchery or the butcher". Listed for trial at the Supreme Court in the colonial capital of Adelaide on 11 June 1849, further investigation was ordered, but by the November 1849 sittings of that court the case had been dropped. One of the major complications involved in the case was that there were significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict <b>could</b> <b>involve</b> capital punishment. These legal hurdles combined with settler solidarity to ensure the case did not go to trial.|$|E
