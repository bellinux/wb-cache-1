25|$|A September 2006 Wall Street Journal article {{detailed}} {{that some}} of Gee's problems at Vanderbilt—including his wife's actions (such as smoking marijuana in the chancellor's official residence), criticism of {{the high cost of}} renovating his home, and the couple's lavish spending—had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> him. Additionally, Gee's 2002 announcement that the administration was going to rename Confederate Memorial Hall without the word Confederate provoked a series of lawsuits. While Vanderbilt's board expressed some concern about Gee's spending, they also strongly endorsed his successful leadership. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, he received a total compensation of over $1.8 million in 2005/6, the highest of any continuing university president in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In 1979 {{the crash}} of American Airlines Flight 191 led to a global {{grounding}} of all DC-10s, stranding hundreds of passengers {{on both sides of}} Air New Zealand's Los Angeles–Auckland route. The airline chartered a Pan Am Boeing 747 to transport stranded passengers and to keep a shuttle service open. The airline's two remaining DC-8s maintained a trans-tasman shuttle service along with its single international standard equipped 737-200, ZK-NAR. The decision not to take up NAC's purchase rights of the trans-tasman capable Boeing 727-200 had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the airline. With no DC-8 replacement in sight Air New Zealand began looking for a mid-sized wide bodied jet and ordered the Boeing 767-200ER in 1983.|$|E
25|$|During archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012 {{the remains}} of a skeleton pierced with an iron bar in the heart were found. It is believed that those are {{the remains of}} the local nobleman Krivich (or Krivitsa), ruler of the fortress of Sozopol (castrofilax). Believed to be a very cruel person, the locals made sure that he would not <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the city after his death by piercing him with an iron bar in the chest. There are more than 100 medieval funerals similar to that of Krivitsa found all over Bulgaria. The remains were pierced with either an iron or a wooden bar through the chest {{to make sure that the}} dead will not rise from the grave as a vampire.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} Cuba was {{organized}} in 1510 by the recently restored Viceroy of the Indies, Diego Colón, {{under the command}} of Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, who became Cuba's first governor until his death in 1524. The new settlers did not wish to be under the personal authority of Colón, so Velázquez founded the city of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Baracoa in 1511 and convoked a general cabildo (a local government council), which was duly authorized to deal directly with Spain. This legal move removed Velázquez and the settlers from under the authority of Colón, their nominal superior. It was a precedent that would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> Velázquez during Hernán Cortés's conquest of Mexico. Other cities were later founded under Velázquez: Bayamo in 1513; Santísima Trinidad, Sancti Spíritus and San Cristóbal de La Habana in 1514; Puerto Príncipe and Santiago de Cuba in 1515. After the conquest of Mexico, Cuba experienced an exodus of settlers, and its population remained small for the next two centuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{role and}} {{authority}} of the ulema declined after the rise of King Faisal {{even though they had}} helped bring him to the throne in 1964. Despite his piety and biological relationship through his mother to the AlasShaykh family, and his support for the pan-Islamic movement in his struggle against pan-Arabism, he decreased the ulema's power and influence. Unlike his successor, King Faisal attempted to ensure that the most radical clerics did not hold society's most powerful religious posts. He tried to block extremist clerics from gaining dominion over religious institutions such as the Council of Senior Ulema, the kingdom's highest religious body, or rising to high religious positions such as Grand Mufti, a politically recognized senior expert charged with maintaining the entire system of Islamic law. Still, {{at least some of the}} king's advisers warned early on that, once religious zealots were encouraged, they would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the kingdom. King Faisal rejected the ulema's opposition to aspects of his accelerated modernization attempts, sometimes even in matters considered by them to be major issues.|$|E
25|$|During this time, the Anglican Church assumed {{de facto}} {{administrative}} {{responsibility in the}} far-flung wilderness of Canada and British North America. The church contracted with colonial officials and later the federal Crown to administer residential schools for the indigenous peoples of the First Nations – a decision which would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> it much later. Such schools removed children from their home communities in an attempt to, among other things, assimilate them into the dominant European culture and language: the merits and demerits of that system in a broad sense, such as they were, have latterly been entirely overwhelmed by {{the issue of the}} wholly reprehensible abuse of some of its child wards by sexually disordered mission personnel. At the same time, Anglican missionaries were involved in advocating for First Nations rights and land claims on behalf of those people to whom they were ministering (for example, the Nisga'a of northern British Columbia). One of the earliest First Nations students to be educated at Red River in the 1830s was Henry Budd. He was ordained in 1850 and was the first First Nations priest and became the missionary at Fort Cumberland on the Saskatchewan River and then to the post of The Pas. The Anglican Church of Canada's Prayer Book commemorates Henry Budd on 2 April.|$|E

However, on July 3, 1950, Truman did give Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas a draft resolution titled [...] "Joint Resolution Expressing Approval of the Action Taken in Korea". Lucas said that Congress supported the use of force, that the formal resolution would pass but was unnecessary, and that the consensus in Congress was to acquiesce. Truman responded {{that he did not}} want [...] "to appear to be trying to get around Congress and use extra-Constitutional powers," [...] and added that it was [...] "up to Congress whether such a resolution should be introduced." ...|$|E

[...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy {{to fall into the}} trap of doing something because you {{think people are going to}} love it. You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it.

500|$|On December 21, 2008, LenDale White and Keith Bulluck of the Tennessee Titans {{stepped on}} a Terrible Towel after the Titans's 31–14 victory.

[...] While Hines Ward said, [...] " [...] did kind {{of the same thing}} and you see where they went." [...] Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher, by this point working for CBS as an analyst on The NFL Today, mentioned on the program that such antics can <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> teams. Tennessee was the top seed in the playoffs, however following the incident the Titans proceeded to lose eight consecutive games, including an '08 divisional playoff game and their '09 Week 1 game against the Steelers, 13-10. After the Titans' 8th consecutive loss—a 59-0 blowout to the New England Patriots, the Titans worst loss ever—Titans coach Jeff Fisher expressed regret for his team's behavior towards the Towel, and a number of Titans players autographed a Terrible Towel and mailed it to Allegheny Valley School – the Pittsburgh charity that now owns the trademark.

500|$|This {{editorial}} {{position would}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> Stone. Also in 1870, Elizabeth Roberts Tilton {{told her husband}} Theodore Tilton {{that she had been}} carrying on an adulterous relation with his good friend Henry Ward Beecher. Theodore Tilton published an editorial saying that Beecher [...] "has at a most unseemly time of life been detected in improper intimacies with certain ladies of his congregation." [...] Tilton also informed Stanton about the alleged affair, and Stanton passed the information to Victoria Woodhull. Woodhull, a free love advocate, printed innuendo about Beecher, and began to woo Tilton, convincing him to write a book of her life story from imaginative material that she supplied. In 1871, Stone wrote to a friend [...] "my one wish in regard to Mrs. Woodhull is, that [...] she nor her ideas, may be so much as heard of at our meeting." [...] Woodhull's self-serving activities were attracting disapproval from both centrist AWSA and radical NWSA. To divert criticism from herself, Woodhull published a denunciation of Beecher in 1872 saying that he practiced free love in private while speaking out against it from the pulpit. This caused a sensation in the press, and resulted in an inconclusive legal suit and a subsequent formal inquiry lasting well into 1875. The furor over adultery and the friction between various camps of women's rights activists took focus away from legitimate political aims. Harry Blackwell wrote to Stone from Michigan where he was working toward putting woman suffrage into the state constitution, saying [...] "This Beecher-Tilton affair is playing the deuce with [...] in Michigan. No chance of success this year I fancy." ...|$|E
500|$|The Winter Dance Party tour {{began in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel created {{logistical}} problems, as {{the distance between}} venues had not been considered when scheduling each performance. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer Carl Bunch suffered frostbite to his toes (while aboard the bus) and was hospitalized, so Buddy Holly {{made the decision to}} find another means of transportation. Before their performance at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered a four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane at Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, Iowa, for himself, Jennings, and Tommy Allsup, to avoid the long bus trip to their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Following the Clear Lake show (which ended around midnight), Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the charter plane to Ritchie Valens, while Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson, who was suffering from the flu and complaining about how cold and uncomfortable the tour bus was for a man of his size. When Holly learned that his bandmates had given up their seats on the plane and had chosen to take the bus rather than fly, a friendly banter between Holly and Jennings ensued, and it would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> Jennings for decades to follow: Holly jokingly told Jennings, [...] "Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up!" [...] Jennings jokingly replied, [...] "Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes!" [...] Less than {{an hour and a half}} later, shortly after 1:00am on February 3, 1959 (later known as The Day the Music Died), Holly's charter plane crashed at full throttle into a cornfield outside Mason City, Iowa, instantly killing all on board.|$|E
