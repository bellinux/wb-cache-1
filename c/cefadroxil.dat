50|$|First {{generation}} cephalosporins {{were the}} first cephalosporins on the market. They have good antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria but limited activity against gram-negative species. The chemical structures {{of the first generation}} cephalosporins are fairly simple. As an example three drugs from this class (Cephalexin, Cephradine and <b>Cefadroxil)</b> all have a single methyl group at position C-3. The common side groups at C-3 for first class cephalosporins are small uncharged groups like methyl. The methyl group at position C-3 gives low affinity for common PBP which can in part explain the relatively low activity of these first drugs. Cefaclor however has a Cl group at position C-3 which gives it better binding to PBP and thus better antimicrobial activity. There is not an agreement on classifying Cefaclor as a first generation cephalosporin because of the Cl group at the C-3 position and therefore its improved activity, but it is often classified as such because of its C-7 side chain which is more related to the first generation than the second. All of the first generation cephalosporins have an α-amino group at position C-7. This structure makes them vulnerable to hydrolysis by β-lactamases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Cefadroxil,</b> a {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic, is a substrate {{for several}} membrane transporters including peptide transporter 2 (PEPT 2), organic anion transporters (OATs), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), and organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs). These transporters are expressed at the blood–brain barrier (BBB), blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), and/or brain cells. The {{effect of these}} transporters on <b>cefadroxil</b> distribution in brain is unknown, especially in the extracellular and intracellular fluids within brain. Methods Intracerebral microdialysis {{was used to measure}} unbound concentrations of <b>cefadroxil</b> in rat blood, striatum extracellular fluid (ECF) and lateral ventricle cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The distribution of <b>cefadroxil</b> in brain was compared in the absence and presence of probenecid, an inhibitor of OATs, MRPs and OATPs, where both drugs were administered intravenously. The effect of PEPT 2 inhibition by intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of Ala-Ala, a substrate of PEPT 2, on <b>cefadroxil</b> levels in brain was also evaluated. In addition, using an in vitro brain slice method, the distribution of <b>cefadroxil</b> in brain intracellular fluid (ICF) was studied in the absence and presence of transport inhibitors (probenecid for OATs, MRPs and OATPs; Ala-Ala and glycylsarcosine for PEPT 2). Results The ratio of unbound <b>cefadroxil</b> AUC in brain ECF to blood (Kp,uu,ECF) was ~ 2. 5 -fold greater during probenecid treatment. In contrast, the ratio of <b>cefadroxil</b> AUC in CSF to blood (Kp,uu,CSF) did not change significantly during probenecid infusion. Icv infusion of Ala-Ala did not change <b>cefadroxil</b> levels in brain ECF, CSF or blood. In the brain slice study, Ala-Ala and glycylsarcosine decreased the unbound volume of distribution of <b>cefadroxil</b> in brain (Vu,brain), indicating a reduction in <b>cefadroxil</b> accumulation in brain cells. In contrast, probenecid increased <b>cefadroxil</b> accumulation in brain cells, as indicated by a greater value for Vu,brain. Conclusions Transporters (OATs, MRPs, and perhaps OATPs) that can be inhibited by probenecid {{play an important role in}} mediating the brain-to-blood efflux of <b>cefadroxil</b> at the BBB. The uptake of <b>cefadroxil</b> in brain cells involves both the influx transporter PEPT 2 and efflux transporters (probenecid-inhibitable).

40|$|Pharmacological and {{antimicrobial}} {{properties of}} <b>cefadroxil,</b> a new cephalosporin antibiotic, {{were compared with}} cephalexin. Absorption and excretion were studied in 20 healthy men. Peak concentrations of the drugs in serum were similar after ingestion of single 500 -mg tablets. The concentration of <b>cefadroxil</b> in serum was more sustained than that of cephalexin. Levels of <b>cefadroxil</b> in serum after a dose of 1, 000 mg were approximately twice those after a 500 -mg dose through 6 h.

This excellent in vivo bactericidal activity of <b>cefadroxil</b> in lung tissue and bronchial secretions was reflected in the 50 % protective dose (PD 50) after single or multiple oral treatments.

Six hours after LPS or saline treatment, mice received 1 nmol/g <b>cefadroxil</b> intravenously along with inulin for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) determination. Serial blood samples, along with tissue and urine samples, were collected at predetermined time points. In order to determine inflammation-induced changes in GFR, renal tubular secretion, and reabsorption, it was necessary to coadminister 70 mg/kg probenecid. Changes in the expres-sion of the mRNA of transporters involved in <b>cefadroxil</b> disposition in the kidneys and choroid plexus were also investigated 6 h after LPS treatment. The results demonstrated marked increases in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue <b>cefadroxil</b> concentra-tions with LPS treatment. Tissue-to-blood concentration ratios were decreased by 4. 6 -fold in the choroid plexus and by 2. 5 -fold in the kidneys during LPS-induced inflammation. Renal, but not choroid plexus, mRNA expression of peptide transporter 2, organic-anion transporter 1 (OAT 1), OAT 3, andmultidrug resistance-associated protein 4 was mildly reduced in LPS-treated mice.

An Inertsil ODS, 4. 60 x 250 mm 2, 5 &#x 00 B 5; m analytical column was used with an eluting system consisting of a mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5) -methanol 78 - 32 &#x 0025; (v/v) at a flow-rate 1. 5 ml/min. Detection was performed by UV-Vis detector at 210 nm, resulting in limit of detection of 0. 06 ppm for <b>cefadroxil</b> per 20 - &#x 00 B 5; l injection. A linear relationship was observed up to 0. 2 ppm for <b>cefadroxil.</b> Analysis time was less than 10 min. The statistical evaluation of the method was examined by means of within-day repeatability (n = 6) and day-to-day precision (n = 7) and {{was found to be}} satisfactory with high accuracy and precision. The method may be applied for the determination of the <b>cefadroxil</b> in bulk formulation in future...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the role of PEPT 2, a proton-coupled {{oligopeptide}} transporter of the SLC 15 family, on the dis-position of the antibiotic <b>cefadroxil</b> in the body, particularly the kidney and brain. Pharmacokinetic, tissue distribution, and renal clearance studies were performed in wild-type and PEPT 2 null mice after intravenous bolus administration of [3 H]cefadroxil at 1, 12. 5, 50, and 100 nmol/g body weight. Studies were also performed in the absence and presence of probenecid and quinine. <b>Cefadroxil</b> disposition kinetics was clearly nonlinear over the dose range studied (1 – 100 nmol/g), which was attributed to both saturable renal tubular secretion and reabsorption of the antibiotic. After an intravenous bolus dose of 1 nmol/g <b>cefadroxil,</b> PEPT 2 null mice exhibited a 3 -fold greater total clearance and 3 -fold lower systemic concentrations of drug compared with wild-type animals. Renal clearance studies fur-ther demonstrated that the renal reabsorption of <b>cefadroxil</b> was al...|$|E
