5|$|William Wailes {{produced}} a {{design for the}} seven-light east window following a competition launched in 1846; however, delays in raising the money caused delays in its installation. Controversy over the design meant that it was replaced with the current depiction of the Crucifixion by Clayton and Bell in 1904. The tree design {{in the window of}} the south transept was also by Wailes and was installed in 1854. In the north transept is a memorial window to Samuel Lucas who died in 1853, designed and installed by the St Helens <b>Crown</b> <b>Glass</b> Company which later became Pilkington. Another Wailes design depicting the Offering of the Wise Men was installed in the Lady Chapel, alongside one designed by Arthur O'Connor. The windows in the choir aisles are by Clayton and Bell who also designed the memorial to Edward Colston which is in the north wall of the north transept.|$|E
25|$|In 1765 Peter Dollond (son of John Dollond) {{introduced}} the triple objective, {{which consisted of}} a combination of two convex lenses of <b>crown</b> <b>glass</b> with a concave flint lens between them. He made many telescopes of this kind.|$|E
5000|$|Abbe {{numbers are}} used to {{classify}} glass and other optical materials {{in terms of their}} chromaticity. For example, the higher dispersion flint glasses have V < 55 whereas the lower dispersion <b>crown</b> <b>glasses</b> have larger Abbe numbers. Values of V range from below 25 for very dense flint glasses, around 34 for polycarbonate plastics, up to 65 for common <b>crown</b> <b>glasses,</b> and 75 to 85 for some fluorite and phosphate <b>crown</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} type of optical glass is <b>crown</b> <b>glass,</b> which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a <b>crown</b> <b>glass</b> surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} that old windows are sometimes {{found to be}} thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation {{is that in the}} past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the <b>crown</b> <b>glass</b> process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames {{at the bottom of the}} window. Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.|$|E
500|$|Virginia House is a large, asymmetrical, two-story long {{rectangular}} stone {{building with}} massive sandstone walls, small medieval windows, characterized by two high Dutch gables that {{date to the}} 1620 remodeling of the Thomas Hawkins-era Priory in Warwickshire, England. [...] The adjacent cross-gable roofs and crenelated balustrade over the carriage entrance provide a horizontal cross-axis {{on either side of}} the gabled central bays. Two rear ells of the house project into the garden terrace, one of them containing the two-story cathedral-ceilinged library, and the other a drawing room and the master bedroom wing. Polygonal bays and oriel windows project from the north and south sides with heavy perimeter walls constructed of recycled sandstone. Over a window on the west side of the north elevation of Virginia house is a copy of a coat of arms commemorating the visit of Queen Elizabeth I to the Priory in England in 1572. The original coat of arms is currently on display inside. The leaded-glass, quarrel-paned casement windows widely used in Virginia House also feature authentic <b>crown</b> <b>glass</b> dating from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century salvaged from the English priory. The interior of the property is richly embellished with oak furnishings.|$|E
50|$|Higher-quality optical-grade glass {{materials}} exist (e.g. Borosilicate <b>crown</b> <b>glasses</b> such as BK7 (nd=1.51680 / Vd=64.17 / D=2.51 g/cm³), {{which is}} commonly used in telescopes and binoculars, and fluorite <b>crown</b> <b>glasses</b> such as Schott N-FK51A (nd=1.48656 / Vd=84.47 / D=3.675 g/cm³), which is 16.2 times {{the price of a}} comparable amount of BK7, and are commonly used in high-end camera lenses). However, one would be very hard pressed to find a laboratory that would be willing to acquire or shape custom eyeglass lenses, considering that the order would most likely consist of just two different lenses, out of these materials. Generally, Vd values above 60 are of dubious value, except in combinations of extreme prescriptions, large lens sizes, a high wearer sensitivity to dispersion, and occupations that involve work with high contrast elements (e.g. reading dark print on very bright white paper, construction involving contrast of building elements against a cloudy white sky, a workplace with recessed can or other concentrated small area lighting, etc.).|$|R

50|$|Although the {{refractive}} index {{is dependent on}} the wavelength in every material, some materials have a much more powerful wavelength dependence (are much more dispersive) than others. <b>Crown</b> <b>glasses</b> such as BK7 have a relatively small dispersion, while flint glasses have a much stronger dispersion (for visible light) and hence are more suitable for use in dispersive prisms. Fused quartz is used in the ultraviolet as normal glasses lose their transparency there.|$|R
2500|$|Creep {{deformation}} {{is important}} not only in systems where high temperatures are endured such as nuclear power plants, jet engines and heat exchangers, {{but also in the}} design of many everyday objects. For example, metal paper clips are stronger than plastic ones because plastics creep at room temperatures. Aging glass windows are often erroneously used as an example of this phenomenon: measurable creep would only occur at temperatures above the glass transition temperature around [...] While glass does exhibit creep under the right conditions, apparent sagging in old windows may instead be a consequence of obsolete manufacturing processes, such as that used to create <b>crown</b> <b>glass,</b> which resulted in inconsistent thickness.|$|E
2500|$|Glass has {{the ability}} to refract, reflect, and {{transmit}} light following geometrical optics, without scattering it (due to the absence of grain boundaries). It is used in the manufacture of lenses and windows. Common glass has a refraction index around 1.5. This may be modified by adding low-density materials such as boron, which lowers the index of refraction (see <b>crown</b> <b>glass),</b> or increased (to as much as 1.8) with high-density materials such as (classically) lead oxide (see flint glass and lead glass), or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of zirconium, titanium, or barium. These high-index glasses (inaccurately known as [...] "crystal" [...] when used in glass vessels) cause more chromatic dispersion of light, and are prized for their diamond-like optical properties.|$|E
