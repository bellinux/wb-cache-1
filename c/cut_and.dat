5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both <b>Cut</b> <b>and</b> Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in <b>Cut,</b> <b>and</b> completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at <b>Cut</b> <b>and</b> Stack.|$|E

5|$|Alright, Still is {{the debut}} studio album by English singer and {{songwriter}} Lily Allen, released on 13 July 2006 by Regal Recordings.

Recording for the album began in 2004 with sessions between Allen and Future <b>Cut,</b> <b>and</b> Allen's work garnered publicity on the Internet as she posted demos to her Myspace account before they were officially released.
