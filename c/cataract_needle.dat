Bronze oral suction {{instruments}} have been unearthed {{that seem to have}} been used for this method of cataract extraction during the 2nd century AD.

The procedure [...] "required a large incision in the eye, a hollow needle, and an assistant with an extraordinary lung capacity." [...] This suction procedure was also described by the Iraqi ophthalmologist Ammar ibn Ali of Mosul, in his Choice of Eye Diseases, also written in the 10th century. [...] He presented case histories of its use, claiming to have had success with it on a number of patients. Extracting the lens has the benefit of removing the possibility of the lens migrating back into the field of vision. [...] A later variant of the <b>cataract</b> <b>needle</b> in 14th-century Egypt, reported by the oculist Al-Shadhili, used a screw to produce suction.
