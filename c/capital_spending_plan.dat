40|$|This {{paper will}} analyze the {{relationships}} between corporate and management activities and the product architecture of products manufactured by companies using the integral architecture indicator of products assembled or processed. This theory was developed in a joint discussion paper of the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (" Empirical Analyses of Product Architecture Theory and International Trade Theory " (2006 revised version) written by Takashi Oshika and Takahiro Fujimoto; "RIETI Discussion Paper Series 06 -J- 015 " (March 2006)). Specifically, the paper shows {{the results of a}} regression analysis of the estimated operating income rate by company and by product and the integral architecture indicator, based on surveys implemented jointly with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry with 33 companies on 254 products. The results of this empirical analysis show that the higher the integral architecture indicator (or the higher the integral rate of a product), the higher the operating income rate. Further regression analysis of assembled or processed products, to which the investment-related indicator (investments in research and development and <b>capital</b> <b>spending)</b> is added as an explanatory variable, in addition to the explanatory variable of the integral architecture indicator, also shows statistically significant results. These results reveal that, with assembled products, the higher the integral rate, investments in research and development (R&D), and <b>capital</b> <b>spending,</b> the higher the operating income rate. In processed products, the higher the integral rate, investment in R&D, depreciation and amortization, the higher the operating income rate. In terms of policy implications, these results show that, first, investment in R&D plays {{a significant role in the}} above two products and, second, <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> is very important for assembled products in bolstering the operating income rate of a company by product. This means that it is important to secure sales and profits by rapidly understanding the needs of users, carrying out <b>capital</b> <b>spending,</b> and developing, producing, and supplying products. <b>Capital</b> <b>spending</b> in processed products tends to be far larger than it is in assembled products. Consequently, the above results indicate that the development, production, and supply of products based on accumulated <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> that differentiate competitors by executing the <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> in a <b>planned</b> and phased manner (achieving depreciation and amortization as a result of accumulated <b>capital</b> <b>spending)</b> are key factors for companies in achieving long-term sales and profits. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic determinants of public <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> in Nigeria. It reveals the daunting challenge of poverty (poor roads and portable water, poor {{health care delivery}} system, inadequate power supply, low quality of education, unhygienic environment and unreliable security system for life and property) that Nigeria exhibits simultaneously with the declining trend and unstable pattern of public <b>capital</b> <b>spending.</b> Although, the nominal values of public <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> over the years reveal huge allocations; the real values mirror an overwhelming decline, as four-fifths of Nigeria’s spending is on consumption. Public <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> plays an undeniable {{significant role in the}} growth and development of any nation since it spurs private investment and invariably the general productivity level. The need to reverse this persistent decline in public <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> in Nigeria necessitates this study.

50|$|These changes {{did little}} to improve the parks and {{recreation}} system in the city. Mayor Williams pledged in 1999 to turn the department around, but little had changed a year later. The department expended its entire $33.3 million operating budget with three months left in the fiscal year, but had barely spent any of its $18 million capital budget. The department struggled to execute maintenance contracts, leaving grass unmowed and trash uncollected. DPR Director Robert P. Newman {{was forced to resign}} in July 2000 after growing criticism, revelations that he had misused federal funds, and accusations that the department had not paid hundreds of teenage workers after missing payroll deadlines. DPR's Deputy Director, Neil O. Albert, was named Newman's replacement three months later. Albert's first years as DPR director markedly improved the agency's performance. More than $45 million in capital improvement projects were begun, leading to rapid improvement in existing facilities and construction on new ones. With Williams' permission, Albert ceased to submit construction contracts to the city's dysfunctional Office of Property Management and instead went to the District of Columbia Financial Control Board for contract approval. Albert also won approval from the Control Board for a six-year, $140 million <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> <b>plan.</b> Many of DPR's programs improved rapidly during this period. By 2003, DPR and the D.C. public school system were the two biggest providers of subsidized meals to impoverished children in the city. (As of July 1, 2010, DPR was projected to supply 1,142,993 meals to city children in fiscal 2010.) In 2005, DPR began crafting its first five-year master plan in two decades. In 2006, the chief of the department's Operations and Maintenance division was accused of sexually harassing a number of employees for years, and Albert resigned from the department after Mayor Williams announced he would not seek election to a third term. DPR deputy director Wanda Durden served as interim director for seven months.|$|E

40|$|The author {{examines}} {{the effect of}} fiscal adjustment on the real exchange rate. The argument is made that the direction and extent of that effect depends on the way fiscal adjustment is carried out. If a fiscal deficit is reduced mainly by reducing total government spending, {{the effect on the}} real exchange rate depends on whether the adjustment is achieved through proportionate cuts in both <b>capital</b> and current <b>spending</b> or through disproportionately greater cuts in <b>capital</b> <b>spending.</b> A disproportionately high cut in <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> affects the composition of government spending between tradables and nontradables. Econometric estimates of the model for Bangladesh show that the propensity to spend on nontradables is greater for government spending than for private, and greater for the government's current spending than for its <b>capital</b> <b>spending.</b> The author emphasizes two important implications of fiscal adjustment for developing countries like Bangladesh : a) when fiscal adjustment involves unsustainably heavy cuts in <b>capital</b> <b>spending,</b> appreciation of the real exchange rate misaligns that rate, causing misallocation of resources and b) when disproportionate cuts in <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> occur {{at the same time as}} trade liberalization, appreciation of the real exchange rate undermines the effectiveness of trade.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of fiscal decentralization gives local governments a broader financial assignment. However, limited local government’s own revenue sources bring a {{result in a}} fiscal dependency over the central government funding, i. e. through the fiscal equalization grants. The later are {{in the form of}} general allocation transfers (DAU) and specific allocation transfers (DAK) and revenue sharing (DBH). Today, one and half decade since the decentralization was began, Indonesia faces a classical yet unsolvable development challenge. The alternative mechanisms to finance <b>capital</b> <b>spending</b> are through grant and social transfer. This study aims {{to assess the impact of}} central government transfers and <b>capital</b> <b>spending,</b> on income distribution in regency/municipality level in West Java Province. Observing West Java is interesting as the province is the most unequal one in terms of income distribution, and its inequality rate is above the national’s amount. Particularly, this study tries to answer three questions, i. e. : (1) what is the effect of DAU and DAK on local capital spending?; (2) Does <b>capital</b> <b>spending,</b> DAU, DAK, grant and social transfer each affect local economy’s welfare?; (3) Does <b>capital</b> <b>spending,</b> DAU, DAK, grant and social spending have effect on income distribution?. We use 3 regression model implemented in local government level. Local economy’s welfare is measured by per capita GDRP. While, income distribution is represented by Gini index. Our preliminary results are: (1) transfers fund, e. g.
