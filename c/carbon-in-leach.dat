A pre-feasibility study for the Passendro Gold Project was completed by GBM Gold Ltd. of the United Kingdom in early 2006. It {{was followed by a}} feasibility study conducted by Senet (pty) Ltd. of South Africa, commissioned during the third quarter of 2006. The pre-feasibility study had envisioned an open pit operation with a gravity <b>carbon-in-leach</b> processing plant that would process about 3 million metric tons per year (Mt/yr) of ore with production estimated to be about 6,200 kilograms per year (kg/yr) of gold (reported as 200,000 troy ounces).|$|E
50|$|In 2005 gold {{production}} at the Bibiani Mine came from the processing of ore from the mine’s remaining pits, stockpiled ore, and tailings. Satellite pits were depleted in December 2005, and AngloGold Ashanti expected stockpiled ore to be depleted by January 2006. Beginning in February, the mill was to process only old tailings. The Bibiani Mine, which had operated between 1903 and 1968 as an underground mine, was reopened in 1998 as an open pit mine with a <b>carbon-in-leach</b> (CIL) plant. The mine included old tailings dumps, which were reclaimed in December 2004. These tailings were expected to yield about 3.9 million metric tons (Mt) of ore at an estimated recovery grade of 0.60 gram per metric ton (g/t) gold {{during a period of}} 18 months.

40|$|<b>Carbon-in-leach</b> and carbon-in-pulp are {{continuous}} {{processes that}} use activated carbon {{in a cascade}} of large agitated tanks, which {{have been widely used}} to recover or concentrate precious metals in gold extraction plants. In the carbon-in-pulp process adsorption occurs after the leaching cascade section of the plant, and in the <b>carbon-in-leach</b> process leaching and adsorption occur simultaneously. In both processes the activated carbon is moved from one tank to another in countercurrent with the ore pulp until the recovery of the loaded carbon in the first tank. This paper presents a dynamic model that describes, with minor changes, the <b>carbon-in-leach,</b> the carbon-in-pulp, and the gold leaching processes. The model is numerically solved and calibrated with experimental data from a plant and used to perform a study of the effect of the activated carbon transfer strategy on the performance of the adsorption section of the plant. Based on the calculated values of the gold loss in the liquid and of the gold recovered in the loaded activated carbon that leaves the circuit, the results indicate that strategies in which a significant amount of activated carbon is held in the first tank and the contact time between the carbon and the pulp is longer are the best carbon transfer strategies for these processes...|$|E

Experimental investigations have in fact demonstrated that while the ores contained in the upper parts of the deposit are amenable to conventional cyanidation, the gold contained in the refractory ores in the lower portions needs to be recovered by means of flotation, combined with leaching where necessary.

40|$|The {{regression}} network {{provides a}} connectionist {{framework in which}} both parametric and non-parametric modelling can be implemented. It is shown how mechanistic knowledge can be built directly within the connectionist structure that results in a semi-empirical network model. In doing so the inherent freedom of a specific model is restricted so that the generalisation performance of such a model improves accordingly. It is described how a semi-empirical regression network kinetic model is developed for the dynamic modelling of the <b>carbon-in-leach</b> (CIL) process for gold recovery. By providing for mechanistic knowledge in the connectionist structure and catering for poorly understood aspects of the process by use of non-parametric regions within {{the structure of the}} semi-empirical regression network, the regression network kinetic model displayed significant superiority in generalisation properties over other non-parametric regression models if evaluated during dynamic simulation runs. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of the}} CIL (<b>Carbon-in-Leach)</b> circuit at Telfer, a copper-gold plant treating porphyry copper deposits containing gold associated with both copper and iron sulphides, with an objective to identify factors normally limiting the gold recovery in the CIL circuit {{in the presence of a}} small amount of copper after copper flotation, and then propose a means to improve it. Diagnostic leaching assessment and mineralogical analysis by MLA revealed that the occlusion of gold by other minerals and the fine grain size of gold associated with them may be the contributing factors to the low gold recovery in the CIL circuit. Fine grinding of the CIL feed increased gold recovery significantly from the leaching process. However, it is interesting to find that fine grinding increased the amount of released copper ions which complex with cyanide resulting in significantly higher cyanide consumption. It is therefore proposed that regrinding of the CIL feed followed by copper flotation is an appropriate pre-treatment method for the CIL circuit...|$|E

40|$|This paper porposes a new {{methodology}} {{to model}} ill-defined processing operations using neural nets (NNs). A process with many variables (large dimensionality) cannot be modelled adequately if limited process data are available. This problem of multidimensionality is addressed and an approach suggested {{to reduce the}} dimensionality using NNs. An NN is trained on process data for the global variable space, whereafter the first-order partial derivatives of the process are estimated with the NN and used to perform perturbation analyses. As a result, the variable space can be subdivided into subspaces with reduced dimensionality. The final product of this modelling methodology is a combined model of phenomenological expressions and NNs. The model can be incorporated successfully in a dynamic simulator of the process. A new approach to conduct modelling {{on the basis of}} continuous data collected directly from an industrial processing unit is also proposed.

40|$|AngloGold, the {{operating}} {{partner in a}} joint venture with Randgold Resources and the Government of Mali, own and operate the Morila Gold Mine. The open pit gold mining operation is located in Southern Mali, approximately 280 kilometres by road south-east of Bamako, the capital of Mali, West Africa. The mined ore is processed through a conventional semi-autogenous grinding and ball milling, including a recycle crusher, (SABC) comminution and <b>carbon-in-leach</b> (CIL) circuit together with a gravity gold recovery step with final residue reporting to a tailings storage facility by way of cyclone deposition. Pit-to-Plant (p 2 p) is a concept incorporating the various disciplines of geology, mining, metallurgy and engineering, to optimise the entire comminution circuit. At Morila, comminution commences in the pit with the fragmentation of ore through blasting and continues at the metallurgical facility with primary crushing, SAG and ball milling including a recycle pebble crusher. The primary objective of the p 2 p programme is to increase mill throughput, but it must be stressed that this must not be at the expense of grade control, thus it is imperative that ore body dilution be minimised. This paper takes the reader through the various project phases, including the cost of the p 2 p project at Morila where the mill throughput was substantially increased from 365 tph to approximately 400 tp...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Degree(Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2008 ABSTRACT Carbon-in-pulp (CIP) {{technology}} is firmly {{entrenched in the}} mining sector due to numerous advances {{in the last few}} decades. CIP technology recovers complexed gold in solution from slurry streams by contacting the pulp with carbon and separating the two by screening. The <b>carbon-in-leach</b> (CIL) process, where the pulp contains free cyanide, is closely related to CIP. Both these processes, especially CIL, are complex and are governed by a number of interacting unit processes. The overall process efficiency is dependant on a large number of variables, making the process difficult to optimize. This study uses simple adsorption and leaching rate equations in order to predict dynamic CIL/CIP plant performance under varying operating conditions. This will assist plant metallurgists to achieve optimum efficiency, highlight plant sensitivity to certain variables and will ultimately result in proactive process control. Various assumptions were made {{in order to keep the}} modeling considerations as simple and realistic as possible. The process was assumed to have linear kinetic and equilibrium operation. The process was simulated using Simulink in Matlab. Variables are solved on a time step basis by Matlab’s built in optimization algorithms. Simulation results illustrated that the use of simple leaching and adsorption rate expressions are effective for investigating dynamic plant behavior under changing operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Carbon-in-Leach</b> (CIL) circuit {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economics of a gold refinery. The circuit uses multiphase stirred tanks in series, in which problems such as dead zones, short-circuiting, and presence of unsuspended solids are detrimental to its efficiency. Therefore, the hydrodynamics of such a system is critical for improving the performance. The hydrodynamics of stirred tanks can be resolved using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). While the flow generated by the impellers in the CIL tanks is complex and modelling it in the presence of high solid concentration is challenging, advances in CFD models, such as turbulence and particle-fluid interactions, have made modelling of such flows feasible. In the present study, the hydrodynamics of CIL tanks was investigated by modelling it using CFD. The models used in the simulations were validated using experimental data at high solid loading of 40 wt. % in a lab scale tank. The models were further used for examining the flow generated by pitched blade turbine and HA- 715 Mixtec impellers in lab scale CIL tanks with 50 wt. % solids. The effect of design and operating parameters such as off-bottom clearance, impeller separation, impeller speed, scale-up, and multiple-impeller configuration on flow field and solid concentrations profiles was examined. For a given impeller speed, better solids suspension is observed with dual impeller and triple impeller configurations. The results presented in the paper are useful for understanding the hydrodynamics and influence of design and operating parameters on industrial CIL tanks...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} facing the gold industry in the 21 st century is the continuing need to identify new reserves of economically treatable ores. Discoveries of large, metallurgically simple orebodies are becoming increasingly rarer, forcing companies to investigate options for the processing of ores which may present recovery, economic and/or environmental issues, requiring innovative approaches to their treatment. Ores which contain naturally occurring carbonaceous material (‘preg-robbing ores’) are {{an example of one}} such ore type. Newmont’s Jundee operation contains zones of carbonaceous ore within the oxidised orebody. A program consisting of detailed laboratory work and extensive plant trials has been undertaken to assess the options of the processing of this material. Laboratory tests demonstrated the advantage of <b>carbon-in-leach</b> (CIL) over direct cyanide leaching and carbon-in-pulp (CIP) for treatment of these ores. The laboratory program identified several factors which would enhance overall gold recoveries where preg-robbing ore was being processed, including: keeping preg-robbing ore separate from non-graphitic ore; maximising gravity recovery; and ensuring the plant operates in ‘pure’ CIL mode, ie no leaching prior to first adsorption tank. Several plant trials were undertaken to assess the economic sustainability of treating moderate preg-robbing ores through a modified gravity/leach/adsorption circuit. Results indicated that where good operational control of the circuit was maintained to ensure high gravity recovery, minimal leaching prior to carbon contact, and maintenance of good, active carbon inventory, then acceptable and sustainable overall gold recoveries could be obtained. Using these relatively simple plant modifications potentially allows a plant to treat ores with preg-robbing index (PRI) values up to one. When PRI values rise to 1. 3 - 1. 6, leach recoveries can drop from > 85 per cent to < 40 per cent, indicating a more intensive approach may be required, including kerosene addition and higher carbon inventories and activities...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1999 Carbon-in-pulp (CIP) and <b>carbon-in-leach</b> (CIL) {{remain the}} most effective, and widely used {{processes}} for gold recovery from cyanided pulps. The {{extensive use of}} carbon in such processes have prompted many researchers to investigate the mechanism of metal cyanide adsorption. Not only has this provided many viable theories {{in the understanding of}} the mechanism, but it has also led to an improved understanding {{of the effects of the}} various operating conditions on the CIP circuit. However, the declining gold price has made gold producers aware of the need to either further optimise existing circuits or find alternative means of operation so as to improve efficiency. It is therefore the aim of this study to investigate the factors which influence the metal extraction circuit. In this study the effects of parameters such as gold and carbon concentrations, slurry density and stirring speed on the adsorption process were investigated. It was found that the effects of gold and carbon concentrations could be determined directly, that is, a definite linear relationship exists between these two parameters and adsorption rate. However, slurry density and stirring speed (power input) have a twofold effect on the process. For this reason two distinct terms called the "blinding" and "mixing" numbers have been identified. It has been shown that all the parameters investigated influences the rate of adsorption during the constant rate adsorption period. However, only solution concentration, carbon concentration and carbon loading influence the process during the diminishing rate of adsorption. This confirmed the belief that intraparticle diffusion is the rate controlling factor during the diminishing rate period. Furthermore, the point at which constant rate adsorption is replaced by the diminishing rate of adsorption is mainly a function of solution concentration...|$|E
