He is considerably more good-natured than Ralph, but nonetheless trades insults {{with him on}} a regular basis. Ed (typically called [...] "Norton" [...] by Ralph and sometimes by his own wife, Trixie) often gets mixed up in Ralph's schemes. His carefree and rather dimwitted nature usually results in raising Ralph's ire, while Ralph often showers him with verbal abuse and throws him out of the apartment when Ed irritates him. In most episodes, Ed is shown to be better-read, better-liked, more worldly and more even-tempered than Ralph, despite his unassuming manner {{and the fact that he}} usually lets Ralph take the lead in their escapades. Ed and Ralph both are members of the fictional Raccoon Lodge. ("An Emergency Meeting is an emergency meeting—never a poker game. An Executive Meeting, that's a poker game.") According to Entertainment Weekly, Norton is one of the [...] "greatest sidekicks."

[...] He served in the U. S. Navy, and used his G.I. Bill money to pay for typing school, but felt he was unable to work in an office because he hated working in confined spaces. The relatively few scenes set in the Norton apartment showed it to have the same layout as the Kramdens' but is much more nicely furnished. Though Norton makes the same weekly $62 salary as Ralph (about $555 in 2016 dollars), their higher standard of living might be explained by Norton's freer use of credit; at one point he admits to having 19 <b>charge</b> <b>accounts.</b> Like Ralph, Ed enjoys and is good at bowling and playing pool.

50|$|In 1914, Western Union {{opened the}} first charge account for its {{customers}} and {{provided them with}} a paper identification. There were many larger department stores which opened store <b>charge</b> <b>accounts</b> for their customers with paper identification, enabling the customer to make purchases on credit provided by the store. However, these accounts could be used only within the store which issued them. In 1950, Diners Club began opening <b>charge</b> <b>accounts</b> with paper identification cards, directed at the travel and entertainment markets. The novel feature of these cards was that the charge card {{could be used in}} a large number of stores. These stores had to enter an agreement with Diners Club, and pay a fee to the company. For the fee, Diners Club carried the cost of setting up accounts, authorizing each transaction, processing transactions and collections, bore the financing costs and assumed the risk of cardholders defaulting. The new system was especially appealing to smaller stores in competition with the larger stores but who could not justify setting up their own charge account facilities. Eventually the larger stores began accepting these cards, testifying that the fees charged by the card operator were lower than the store's cost in running their own store accounts. In 1957, American Express also entered the field, and in 1959 was the first company to issue embossed plastic charge cards to ISO/IEC 7810 standards.|$|E

The task of collecting money for letter after letter greatly slowed the postman on his route.

Only occasionally did a sender pay delivery costs in advance, an arrangement that usually required a personal visit to the Post Office.

50|$|The {{runway and}} taxiway {{resurfacing}} and improvement projects were funded with FAA Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants covering 95% of project costs.

The Terminal and ramp expansion projects are not AIP eligible as they are revenue generating facilities for the airport. The Port of Bellingham issues Revenue Bonds for $31,719,550 to pay for the terminal expansion. The debt service for the bonds also comes from BLI PFC accounts. In this way, the users of the airport facilities are the ones actually paying for the facility.|$|E
