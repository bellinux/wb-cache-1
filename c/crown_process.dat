40|$|This MBA {{dissertation}} is {{the result}} of investigations conducted into flexible manufacturing approaches for Crown Holdings Inc. The objective of the dissertation was to define manufacturing flexibility and its associated paradigms in relation to <b>Crown</b> <b>processes</b> by piloting value stream mapping techniques within the European Aerosols Division. A secondary objective was subsequently established to produce a process or learning to see mapping model and evaluate its effectiveness as a future tool for Crown to use. The dissertation contains a number of sections. Firstly an environmental analysis was conducted into Crown and the European Aerosols Division. This was important to the project in aiding the understanding of <b>Crown</b> existing <b>processes</b> and markets, but of critical importance for understanding what the environmental drivers are behind Crown need to become more flexible. Secondly a literature review was conducted which extended the areas of research from flexibility and agility to lean manufacturing and the evolution of value stream mapping, with a suite of twelve separate mapping tools being explained. The methodology of value stream mapping as a potential tool was examined by studying five separate value streams within the European Aerosols Division, using the model constructed for this purpose. The results of the study were clear. Whilst the value streams were not considered accurate in every last detail, they gave good indications as to where waste and, in particular, inventory would detract from Crown enhancing its response flexibility to its customers. In conclusion it is recommended that rather than pursuing increased flexibility directly as an operational strategy, Crown should consistently implement the general first principles of lean manufacturing specified within this dissertation rather than using individual lean manufacturing tools as it has in the past. It is concluded that Crown could make marked improvements in its response flexibility in relation to its customers and environment, and thus gain competitive advantage...|$|R

Methods: In a clinical trial study, 100 low risk primiparous pregnant women were randomly assigned to two hands-on and hand-poised (hands-off) groups. In the hands-on group, this method was used to control fetal head in the second stage of labor. It means that the fingers of one hand supported fetal occiput and the other hand applied slight pressure on the head to control the delivery of the head during the <b>crowning</b> <b>process.</b> In the hands-poised group, midwife observed the parturient woman and do not touch perineum during the second labor stage while fetal head was delivering. Then, the two groups were compared in terms of perineal trauma, as well as neonatal and delivery outcome. Results: Demographic characteristics of all studied women were similar in two groups. The rate of episiotomy was higher in hands-on group (84 % vs. 40 %, p = 0. 001). The rate of postpartum hemorrhage (4 th stage) was higher in hands-on group (12 % vs. 4 %, p = 0. 04). The rate of mild and moderate postpartum pain in hands-on group was higher than hands-off group (70 % vs. 58 % and 29 % vs. 10 %, p < 0. 001) but sever pain was not different in two groups. Conclusions: It seems that hands-poised method is associated with less perineal trauma, particularly regarding the lower need for episiotomy and postpartum hemorrhage...|$|R

50|$|The {{issue is}} {{exacerbated}} by the <b>Crown</b> Referral <b>Process,</b> {{the process by which}} consultation is solicited when it is required pursuant to a Crown project. Once a planning decision is made in a Crown department to propose a project or make a decision that may impact Aboriginal or treaty rights, the Crown sends a referral package or letters to those communities it thinks will be affected which describe the proposed project or decision, and describes the intended use of land lying within Aboriginal territory. The recipient has a prescribed time in which to respond. Failure to respond allows the Crown to proceed on its own initiative, while a response engages the consultation process. The issue is that this process can bury Aboriginal groups in letters from the potentially numerous, unrelated government departments involved in the project. Creating complete and careful responses to each package would be time consuming and require more resources than most bands can spare.|$|R

25|$|The {{observation}} that old windows are sometimes {{found to be}} thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation {{is that in the}} past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the <b>crown</b> glass <b>process,</b> described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames {{at the bottom of the}} window. Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.|$|R

The first objective examines the advantages of OBIA over per-pixel methods for mapping land cover. A comparison found object-based {{image analysis}} to be statistically superior (z= 2. 285 (p= 0. 01), McNemar’s χ 2 = 8. 966 (p= 0. 0028)). The second objective developed a rule-set for land cover classification of QuickBird data. For {{a subset of the}} study area the overall accuracy was 94 % and K^ = 0. 92. Applied to the entire area, accuracies were lower with error associated with burnt vegetation. The third objective investigated mapping vegetation structural attributes using OBIA. A tree <b>crown</b> extraction <b>process</b> was developed for QuickBird data. Accuracies over 75 % were obtained, despite savanna Eucalypts exhibiting canopy characteristics hindering delineation. The fourth objective compared canopy cover estimates from extracted tree crowns to pixel-based and manually derived methods. Tree crown cover shows relationships (p= 0. 001) with vegetation indices from QuickBird (r 2 = 0. 93) and ASTER (r 2 = 0. 22) imagery, and manually interpreted estimates from aerial photographs (r 2 = 0. 43). The final objective implemented area-based measures quantifying the spatial and thematic accuracy of OBIA. Results show these measures provide valuable thematic and geometric accuracy information provided appropriate reference data are available. This study has demonstrated OBIA is suitable for mapping land cover in spectrally variable landscapes at multiple scales. More specifically, OBIA has better accuracy over per-pixel methods, transferrable rule sets can be used to map land cover from high spatial resolution data, and OBIA methods can extract dominant vegetation structures. Finally, limitations of site-specific accuracy assessments can be addressed through area-based accuracy measures...|$|R

Prior to the proclamation of the state of Israël in 1948, the Roman hostility to the settling of the Jews in Palestine stemmed from the conviction that Catholic interests in the holy places and the protection of the Christians in the Middle East should take precedence over the recognition of the Jewish people. The so-called Roman neutrality over the beginning of the state of Israël turned to hostility when confronted with the Palestinian cause. The 1993 turning point was partially due to the failure of the Roman policy in the Middle-East, a failure confirmed by the Gulf War. Rome had to rethink its positions very hastily, considering the development of the regional situation. But the December agreement included some ethical clauses that are also part of the ongoing theological dialogue between Jews and Christians. Yerly Frédéric.

40|$|Bearing Chambers in Aero-Engines {{are located}} near the rolling-element type of {{bearings}} which support the shafts and accomodate the resulting thrust loads. One of the main task of the bearing chambers is, beside an efficient scavenging of the lubricating oil, the cooling of the hot compartments. A very complex two-phase air-oil flow takes usually place in these bearing chambers consisting of oil droplet-laden air flows and shear-driven liquid wall films. The interaction of the droplets with the wall films is significantly influencing the wall heat transfer and the cooling performance of these systems. For this reason, a detailed characterization and modelling of the mass and momentum exchange between droplets and wall films for the unique impingement parameter range in bearing chambers is inevitable. This scientific report investigates the oil droplet impact dynamics for typical impingement regimes relevant to aero-engine bearing chambers. The application of a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) technique based on the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method and coupled with a gradient-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique allowed to characterize the drop impact dynamics during various single micro- and millimeter drop impacts onto thin and thick films. With {{the help of a}} special numerical treatment, a self-perturbing mechanism is installed that leads to the correct resolution of the <b>crown</b> disintegration <b>process.</b> The numerical methodology was thoroughly validated using the experimental results of millimeter sized drop impacts onto deep liquid pools. These results were developed with an enhanced back-illuminated high-speed imaging and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) technique. New insights into the cavity penetration, the crown’s breakup dynamics and the secondary droplet characteristics following a single drop impact have been developed {{with the help of the}} isolated variation of different parameters of influence. Particularly the influence of the Froude number, the impingement angle, and the cavity-wall interaction delivered results to date not reported in scientific literature. Beside the advances in fundamental physics describing the drop impact dynamics with the help of the numerical and experimental results, a set of correlations could also be derived. From these correlations, a drop-film interaction model was formulated that is suitable for the parameter range found in bearing chambers...|$|R
