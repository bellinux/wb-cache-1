50|$|The first inter-metallic {{compound}} discovered {{with typical}} A3B composition was <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide</b> Cr3Si, discovered in 1933. Several other compounds with A15 structure {{were discovered in}} following years. No large interest existed in research on those compounds. This changed with the discovery that vanadium silicide V3Si showed superconductivity at around 17 K in 1953. In following years, several other A3B superconductors were found. Niobium-germanium held {{the record for the}} highest temperature of 23.2 K from 1973 until the discovery of the cuprate superconductors in 1986. It took time for the method to produce wires from the very brittle A15 phase materials to be established. This method is still complicated. Though some A15 phase materials can withstand higher magnetic field intensity and have higher critical temperatures than the NbZr and NbTi alloys, NbTi is still used for most applications due to easier manufacturing.Nb3Sn is used for some high field applications, for example high-end MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers.|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} of simultaneous grinding {{of the components}} of a SiC-Cr-Si mixture and further temperature treatment in the temperature range 1073 - 1793 K were studied by X-ray phase analysis, IR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and X-ray microanalysis. It was established that, during grinding of the mixture, <b>chromium</b> <b>silicides</b> form. A temperature treatment completes the process. Silicide formation proceeds {{within the framework of the}} diffusion of silicon into chromium. In the presence of SiO 2 in the mixture, silicide formation occurs also as a result of the reduction of silica by silicon and silicon carbide. The sintering of synthesized composite SiC-chromium silicides powders at a high temperature under a high pressure (T = 2073 K, P = 5 GPa) is accompanied by the destruction of cc-SiC particles, the cc/ 3 transition in silicon carbide and deformation distortions of the lattices of <b>chromium</b> <b>silicides...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the performances of}} amorphous silicon n-i-p solar cell, we investigate the possibility to enhance the built-in potential inserting thin high-conductivity <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide</b> layers at interfaces between metal electrodes and doped regions. We found that <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide,</b> formed on top of amorphous doped layer during chromium film evaporation, allows a reduction of activation energy of about 0. 225 eV for n- and p-doped amorphous films. The activation energy reduction contributes to both built-in and open-circuit voltage enhancements, as demonstrated by comparing simulated and measured photovoltaic performances of n-i-p amorphous silicon solar cell with and without the <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide</b> layers...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the compositional, optical and electrical properties of a <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide</b> layer grown at room temperature on top of doped amorphous silicon films is presented. The formation of the layer is promoted only when phosphorous atoms {{are present in the}} film. The deposition of a very thin n-type doped layer (around 5 nm) on top of a p-type doped film has allowed us to achieve the <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide</b> formation also on p-type material without changing its doping properties. Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the presence of chromium-oxide, <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide</b> and metallic chromium in similar percentages for both p- and n-type doped layers: From the ellipsometric analysis, the refractive index spectra have been extracted, and the layer thickness has been estimated to be 5 nm for both p- and n-type doped layers. From planar conductivity measurements, we have found that the <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide</b> promotes an activation energy reduction from 0. 24 eV down to 0. 017 eV for the n-type layer and from 0. 36 eV down to 0. 14 eV for the p-type film.

Compound formation occurs in both <b>chromium</b> and niobium <b>silicides</b> but only in niobium containing borides, whilst chromium containing borides never form up to 80 h milling time. In all cases, partial amorphization was observed after 60 h milling indicating that the amorphization process is independent of the different paths followed by the different systems.

40|$|The adherence, friction, {{and wear}} {{properties}} of thin hard refractory compound coatings applied to 440 C bearing steel by radiofrequency sputtering were investigated. Friction and wear tests {{were done with}} nonconforming pin on disk specimens. The compounds examined were <b>chromium</b> carbide, molybdenum <b>silicide,</b> and titanium carbide. The adherence, friction, and wear were markedly improved by {{the application of a}} bias voltage to the bearing steel substrate during coating deposition. Analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the improvement may be due to a reduction in impurities in bias deposited coatings. A fivefold reduction in oxygen concentration in MoSi 2 coating by biasing was noted. Chromium carbide was not effective as an antiwear coating. Molybdenum silicide provided some reduction in both friction and wear. Titanium carbide exhibited excellent friction and antiwear properties at light loads. Plastic flow and transfer of the coating material onto the pin specimen appears to be important in achieving low friction and wear...|$|R
40|$|The main factors {{affecting}} solid-phase Si-metal interactions {{are reported in}} this work. The influence of {{the orientation of the}} Si substrates and the presence of impurities in metal films and at the Si-metal interface on the formation of nickel and <b>chromium</b> <b>silicides</b> have been demonstrated. We have observed that the formation and kinetic rate of growth of nickel silicides is strongly dependent on the orientation and crystallinity of the Si substrates; a fact which, up to date, has never been seriously investigated in silicide formation. Impurity contaminations in the Cr film and at the Si-Cr interface are the most dominant influencing factors in the formation and kinetic rate of growth of CrSi 2. The potentiality and use of silicides as a diffusion barrier in metallization on silicon devices were also investigated. Two phases, Ni 2 Si and NiSi, form simultaneously in two distinct sublayers in the reaction of Ni with amorphous Si, while only the former phase was observed on other substrates. On (111) oriented Si substrates the growth rate is about 2 to 3 times less than that on &# 60; 100 &# 62; or polycrystalline Si. Transmission electron micrographs establish-·that silicide layers grown on different substrates have different microcrystalline structures. The concept of grain-boundary diffusion is speculated to be an important factor in silicide formation. The composition and kinetic rate of CrSi 2 formation are not influenced by the underlying Si substrate. While the orientation of the Si substrate does not affect the formation of CrSi 2, the purity of the Cr film and the state of Si-Cr interface become the predominant factors in the reaction process. With an interposed layer of Pd 2 Si between the Cr film and the Si substrate, CrSi 2 starts to form at a much lower temperature (400 °C) relative to the Si-Cr system. However, the growth rate of CrSi 2 is observed to be independent of the thickness of the Pd 2 Si layer. For both Si-Cr and Si-Pd 2 Si-Cr samples, the growth rate is linear with time with an activation energy of 1. 7 ± 0. 1 ev. A tracer technique using radioactive 31 Si (T 1 / 2 = 2. 26 h) was used to study the formation of CrSi 2 on Pd 2 Si. It is established from this experiment that the growth of CrSi 2 takes place partly by transport of Si directly from the Si substrate and partly by breaking Pd 2 Si bonds, making free Si atoms available for the growth process. The role of CrSi 2 in Pd-Al metallization on Si was studied. It is established that a thin CrSi 2 layer {{can be used as a}} diffusion barrier to prevent Al from interacting with Pd 2 Si in the Pd-Al metallization on Si. As a generalization of what has been observed for polycrystalline-Si-Al interaction, the reactions between polycrystalline Si (poly Si) and other metals were studied. The metals investigated include Ni, Cr, Pd, Ag and Au. For Ni, Cr and Pd, annealing results in silicide formation, at temperatures similar to those observed on single crystal Si substrates. For Al, Ag and Au, which form simple eutectics with Si annealing results in erosion of the poly Si layer and growth of Si crystallites in the metal films. Backscattering spectrometry with 2. 0 and 2. 3 MeV 4 He ions was the main analytical tool used in all our investigations. Other experimental techniques include the Read camera glancing angle x-ray diffraction, scanning electron, optical and transmission electron microscopy. Details of these analytical techniques are given in Chapter II. ...|$|R

In this thesis, we {{present the results}} of two groups of investigations of deep level defects in semiconductor material systems. Chapter 1 consists of {{an overview of the}} thesis, background information on semiconductor impurities, and a description of deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). Chapter 2 contains discussions of the experiments performed on transition metal silicide-silicon Schottky barrier structures to probe for the existence of deep levels. We investigated platinum, palladium, and nickel silicides on n-type silicon which were annealed at temperatures from 300 to 800 °C. The primary techniques used were DLTS, current-voltage (IV), and capacitance-voltage (C-Y) measurements for electronic characterizations, and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) to determine the silicide phase and film condition. For our samples, 700 °C was the maximum temperature below which no significant degradation of the barrier or contamination of the underlying silicon were observed in platinum and palladium silicide structures. Nickel silicide structures could only withstand temperatures up to 500 °C. Cobalt, <b>chromium,</b> and erbium <b>silicides</b> were also studied using DLTS. These measurements constitute the first series of studies of deep level contamination of the silicon underlying a transition metal suicide thin film.

Furthermore, the CrSi layer leads to a stable device because it hides the effect of the p-doped layer resistivity variation under UV radiation.

40|$|Silicon nitride {{has been}} {{successfully}} bonded to itself using magnesium-aluminosilicate glass and glass-ceramic. For some samples, bonding was achieved using a diffusion bonder, but in other instances, following an initial degassing hold, higher temperatures were used {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} with no applied load. For diffusion bonding, a small applied pressure at a temperature below which crystallisation occurs resulted in intimate contact. At slightly higher temperatures, the extent of the reaction at the interface and the microstructure of the glass-ceramic joint was highly sensitive to the bonding temperature. Bonding in a nitrogen atmosphere resulted in a solution-reprecipitation reaction. A thin layer of glass produced a ''dry'', glass-free joint, whilst a thicker layer resulted in a continuous glassy join across the interface. The <b>chromium</b> <b>silicide</b> impurities within the silicon nitride react with the nucleating agent in the glass ceramic, which may lead to difficulty in producing a fine glass-ceramic microstructure.
