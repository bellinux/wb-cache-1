25|$|When using {{fuel and}} oxygen tanks {{they should be}} {{fastened}} securely upright to a wall or a post or a portable cart. An oxygen tank is especially dangerous {{for the reason that}} the oxygen is at a pressure of 21 MPa (3000lbf/in² = 200 atmospheres) when full, and if the tank falls over and its valve strikes something and is knocked off, the tank will effectively become an extremely deadly flying missile propelled by the <b>compressed</b> <b>oxygen,</b> capable of even breaking through a brick wall.|$|E

25|$|Robotic {{oxy-fuel}} cutters sometimes use {{a high-speed}} divergent nozzle. This uses an oxygen jet that opens slightly along its passage.

These are not used for cutting by hand since they need very accurate positioning above the work. Their ability to produce almost any shape from large steel plates gives them a secure future in shipbuilding and in many other industries.|$|E
25|$|In August {{the balloon}} was {{commissioned}} to fly despite known technical flaws. The commissioners {{emphasized that the}} crew, although equipped with personal parachutes, had few chances of bailing out in case of emergency: the sole airtight hatch was held in place with twelve wing nuts. Opening it, even on solid ground, required minutes. The crew did not wear pressure suits (they simply did not exist at that time) or individual breathing sets, relying on stored supplies of <b>compressed</b> <b>oxygen</b> and carbon dioxide absorber cartridges. Crew survival depended on the gondola's integrity; bailing out without breathing sets was feasible only at altitudes below 8,000 metres.|$|E

40|$|PaperPg. 1 - 6. Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{have been}} used to <b>compress</b> <b>oxygen</b> for at least 25 years. Until ten years ago, the flows were relatively small and discharge pressures were relatively low. In the mid 1960 's the size of single train oxygen plants increased dramatically, and this allowed discharge pressures from the centrifugal machine in the 28 to 41 bar range. Change in the design and installation of centrifugal oxygen compressors evolved in the late 1960 's {{as a result of the}} increase in both size and discharge pressure. It also made consideration of 69 bar discharges possible after experience was gained with the 41 bar discharge level. The rapid change in the state of the art of application of centrifugal compressors to oxygen service in conjunction with the known hazards of the gas has prompted this discourse. Consideration will be given to the application including safety features, materials of construction, cleanliness required, desirable installation and maintenance features and the present and projected design limits for these centrifugal compressors...|$|R

40|$|Mean {{inspired}} oxygen levels, {{delivered by}} the Bennett PR 1 and Bird Mark 7 ventilators, were measured at various cycling pressures. Using the Bird ventilator, oxygen levels varied from 51. 5 to 96. 8 %, being highest at low flows and at high cycling pressures. The Bennett PR 1 delivers more constant percentages of oxygen, in the range 61. 5 to 72. 3 %. With both makes of machine, each ventilator provides different inspired oxygen levels under comparable circumstances.

50|$|In a hospital, {{long-term}} {{mechanical ventilation}} {{is provided by}} using a more complex, automated ventilator.

50|$|The {{hot-bulb}} engine {{is a type}} of internal combustion engine in which fuel ignites by coming in contact with a red-hot metal surface inside a bulb, followed by the introduction of air (<b>oxygen)</b> <b>compressed</b> into the hot-bulb chamber by the rising piston.

50|$|Tarkhanov was {{interested}} in different fields of physiology. His greatest interest was in electrophysiology, which was a direct continuation {{of the work of}} I. M. Sechenov, of whom Tarkhanov {{was one of the first}} disciples. Tarkhanov engaged in experimental studies on the phenomena of summation in the nervous system (1869). He also studied the influence of <b>compressed</b> air, <b>oxygen,</b> and carbonic acid on nervous irritability (1876). He described the formation of bile pigments in animals and humans (1874) and was one of the first to show (1871) the restoration of fading functions in anemic animals by infusing saline in the body. He dominated work in the field of the physiology of aging (1891) and many other topics. Tarkhanov was one of the first to investigate hypnotic suggestion. Tarkhanov’s books, Hypnotism, Suggestion and Mind-reading (1886; translated into French in 1891) and Suggestion and Hypnotism (1905) aroused wide public interest.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{plasma cutting}} process {{involves}} creating an electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas i.e. plasma from the plasma cutter itself, {{through the work}} piece to be cut, thus forming a completed electric circuit back to the plasma cutter via a grounding clamp. This is accomplished by a <b>compressed</b> gas (<b>oxygen,</b> air, inert and others depending on material being cut) which is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward the work piece. An electrical arc is then formed within the gas, between an electrode near or integrated into the gas nozzle and the work piece itself. The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the work piece. At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating i.e. cutting through the work piece.|$|R
40|$|Extravehicular {{activities}} (EVAs) require high-pressure, high-purity oxygen. Shuttle EVAs use oxygen that {{is stored}} and transported as a cryogenic fluid. EVAs on the International Space Station (ISS) presently use the Shuttle cryo O 2, which is {{transported to the}} ISS using a transfer hose. The fluid is compressed to elevated pressures and stored as a high-pressure gas. With the retirement of the shuttle, NASA has been searching for ways to deliver oxygen to fill the highpressure oxygen tanks on the ISS. A method was developed using low-pressure oxygen generated onboard the ISS and released into ISS cabin air, filtering the oxygen from ISS cabin air using a pressure swing absorber to generate a low-pressure (high-purity) <b>oxygen</b> stream, <b>compressing</b> the <b>oxygen</b> with a mechanical compressor, and transferring the high-pressure, high-purity oxygen to ISS storage tanks. The pressure swing absorber (PSA) can be either a two-stage device, or a single-stage device, {{depending on the type}} of sorbent used. The key is to produce a stream with oxygen purity greater than 99. 5 percent. The separator can be a PSA device, or a VPSA device (that uses both vacuum and pressure for the gas separation). The compressor is a multi-stage mechanical compressor. If the gas flow rates are on the order of 5 to 10 lb (. 2. 3 to 4. 6 kg) per day, the compressor can be relatively small [3 ~ 16 ~ 16 in. (. 8 ~ 41 ~ 41 cm) ]. Any spacecraft system, or other remote location that has a supply of lowpressure oxygen, a method of separating oxygen from cabin air, and a method of <b>compressing</b> the enriched <b>oxygen</b> stream, has the possibility of having a regenerable supply of highpressure, high-purity oxygen that is compact, simple, and safe. If cabin air is modified so there is very little argon, the separator can be smaller, simpler, and use less power...|$|R
