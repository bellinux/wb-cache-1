50|$|Against {{the falling}} trend of {{land set aside}} for allotments is an {{increasing}} {{awareness of the need}} for cities to <b>counter</b> <b>issues</b> of food security and climate change through greater self-sufficiency. This drive to expand allotments is also a response to food price inflation, a desire to reduce food miles and surplus provision of land in post-industrial towns and cities in the developed world. Some of these themes were taken up in a recent urban agriculture project in Middlesbrough in the Tees Valley.|$|R

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{reflection}} upon four aspects of methodology {{in the context}} of the author's doctoral research in Northern Ireland: managing identity and research relationships, the ethics of dissemination and the reception of potentially polemic research in the academy. It argues that identity influences research in sensitive contexts in ways that are often hard to anticipate, that more inclusive approaches to dissemination can help <b>counter</b> <b>issues</b> related to research relationships, and that responses to work in controversial contexts highlight ambiguities within the academy regarding the nature and function of social science research, presenting particular challenges for early-career researchers. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Creativity {{is a part}} of most {{theories}} of intelligence—sometimes a small part and sometimes a large part. Yet even IQ tests that assess aspects of intelligence that supposedly reflect creative abilities do not actually measure creativity. Recent work has argued that intelligence and creativity are more conceptually related than we have thought. In addition, creativity offers a potential way to <b>counter</b> <b>issues</b> of test bias from several different angles. That said, inherent difficulties in measuring creativity and inherent sluggishness in the test industry mean the odds are small that creativity will find its way into IQ tests as currently defined. However, there remain other potential possibilities in related fields...|$|R

5000|$|In 2013 New Zealand's Film and Literature Board of Review, or appeal from New Zealand's {{classification}} office (which {{had given}} the book an unrestricted M rating) restricted Into the River to readers aged 14 years and over. This {{was the first time}} in New Zealand's history this classification was used. Auckland Libraries applied to have this decision reconsidered in 2015. One of the reasons given for the appeal was [...] "the impact that the restriction has had on the value of the book as a teaching resource, and the significance of the book as an aid to <b>countering</b> <b>issues</b> in New Zealand about bullying". The conservative Christian lobby group Family First appealed this decision, and applied for an interim restriction order, which was granted by the President of the Board of Review. The interim restriction order under New Zealand's Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act 1993, bans it completely from being sold or supplied in New Zealand.|$|R

40|$|Hazard {{assessment}} and runout analysis for an unstable rock slope above an industrial {{site in the}} Riviera valley, Switzerland Abstract This paper presents a detailed field investigation and hazard assessment for an unstable rock slope above an industrial site in the Riviera valley in the Canton of Ticino in southern Switzerland. An integrated framework was used to <b>counter</b> <b>issues</b> of geological complexity and uncertainty, linking geological mapping and numerical modeling to {{develop an understanding of}} the acting instability mechanism to 2 -D and 3 -D dynamic runout simulations to predict the travel path and reach {{in the event of a}} large volume rockslide. The results from the numerical stability analysis provided a means to constrain failure volume estimates, whereas a series of calibration simulations were used to constrain the input parameters required by the rheological model used for the runout analysis. Results from this assessment suggest that current protection measures in place may not be sufficient, helping local authorities to define hazard zones and aid further develop-ment plans for the region...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{agent-based}} modeling is rarely used in social psychology, {{but has the}} potential to complement and improve traditional research practices. An agent-based model (ABM) consists of a number of virtual individuals – the “agents” – interacting in an arti cial, experimenter-controlled environment. In this article, we discuss several characteristics of ABMs that could prove particularly useful with respect to recent recommendations aimed at <b>countering</b> <b>issues</b> related to the current “replication crisis”. We address the potential synergies between planning and implementing an ABM on the one hand, and the endeavor of pre-registration on the other. We introduce ABMs as tools for both the generation and the improvement of theory, testing of hypotheses, and for extending traditional experimental approaches by facilitating the investigation of social processes from the intra-individual {{all the way up to}} the societal level. We describe examples of ABMs in social psychology, including a detailed description of the CollAct model of social learning. Finally, limitations and drawbacks of agent-based modeling are discussed. In annex 1 and 2, we provide literature and tool recommendations for getting started with an ABM. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|Lambie-Nairn's {{solution}} is the BBC logo {{that has been}} used on-screen since 4 October 1997. By straightening up the boxes and letters, it removed all the problems associated with diagonals and those associated with disappearing lines. This kept the boxes' shape, so that it would still be familiar with what people know about the BBC. The typeface used is Gill Sans, made by Eric Gill. It was chosen because, it was elegant, robust and has a timeless appeal: the typeface had been created 60 years before and so avoided the typeface looking outdated at a later date. This typeface also eliminated the disappearing <b>counters</b> <b>issue,</b> as the <b>counters</b> of the Bs were much larger. Appropriately, some of Gill's statues adorn the exterior of Broadcasting House. The logo was also designed so that anything could be added after the BBC logo, be it department, corporate, brand, TV, radio, etc. Also, by using this system, everything looked like it came from the same organisation, and it was also easy to add new logos. This system also only used black and white letterheads, meaning a big cost saving to the BBC and the licence fee payer.|$|R
