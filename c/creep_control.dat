It is untrue that British Rail refused to tender, but withdrew having conceded that they had nothing which was of the required combination of power and reliability. Foster Yeoman had already operated an EMD SW1001 shunter in the Merehead Quarry with good results, so approached General Motors, {{who were able to}} demonstrate the required long-term 95% availability. Derived from the EMD SD40-2, the cab layout was based on the British Rail Class 58 for easier driver assimilation. To meet the British loading gauge, an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 man-hours of design work was carried out by EMD. Some compromises were required; the large exhaust silencer required to meet BR noise levels left no room for Dynamic Braking equipment. However, it was possible to retain the all-important Super Series wheel <b>creep</b> <b>control</b> which, because of its superior traction, can eliminate the need for double heading. Foster Yeoman therefore reduced their original requirement from six to four locomotives, ordering four in November 1984, and a fifth in 1988.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present an}} {{integrated}} two-step approach, which combines feedback and feedforward control, {{to compensate for}} the effects of hysteresis, creep, and vibration in piezoactuators. In this approach, the control of hysteresis and creep is decoupled from the control of vibrational dynamics. First, high-gain feedback control is used to minimize positioning error caused by hysteresis and creep. Second, an inversion-based feedforward approach, which can achieve exact tracking for general output trajectories, is used to compensate for error due to vibration at high scan rates. The feedforward approach is applicable to minimum (collocated sensor and actuator) and nonminimum phase (noncollocated sensor and actuator) positioning systems. The decoupling of hysteresis and <b>creep</b> <b>control</b> from vibration control simplifies the inversion-based approach, and the use of feedback provides robustness.

30|$|In {{order to}} resolve the {{problems}} of conventional wheelset, many efforts have been made. For example, the semi-active and active actuation systems have been adopted to enhance the dynamic performance of railway vehicles [10, 11]. The independently rotating wheel (IRW) that decouples the wheelset is proposed to eliminate the hunting motion of the conventional wheelset and reduce the wheel/rail wear in sharp curves. The IRWs for railway vehicles have been investigated for many years. However, the use of IRW would also eliminate the guidance capability of the railway vehicles in large radius curves and tangent lines. Consequently, a compromise should be achieved between the curving performance in sharp curves and that in large radius curves and tangent lines by use of active controls like yaw control, <b>creep</b> <b>control</b> of damping, and stiff control. IRWs with profiled tread, with partial coupling, and with a superimposition gearbox have been proposed by Kaplan et al. [12], Dukkipati [13], and Jaschinski et al. [14], respectively.

30|$|The <b>creep</b> {{equations}} <b>controlled</b> by microstructure deformation {{mechanisms are}} the foundation of modeling rock salt creep properties under long-term conditions, and they are useful for salt tectonics modeling and salt mining engineering. In this paper, we summarized the research findings on <b>creep</b> <b>controlled</b> by two deformation mechanisms (dislocation creep and solution-precipitation creep) and built a database for rock salt rheology at 20 – 200  °C. Various rock salt has different water contents in the pore and grain boundaries, which strongly affects the rheological behavior. The temperature also {{plays an important role}} in rock salt deformation. Moreover, we modeled creep behavior of rock samples at various strain rates under the control of two deformation mechanisms. The numerical model in the Abaqus package can simulate the real triaxial experiment and can be used for salt tectonics modeling. The numerical simulation can also evaluate the effect of boundary conditions on the creep property. Finally, both deformation mechanisms lead to a similar strain rate during salt tectonics, and the pressure solution creep is inactive at a low stress after salt tectonics. Combined with experimental results in laboratories and microstructure research as the reliable exploration of experimental results, we conclude that rock salt rheology can be simplified to dislocation creep corresponding to power law creep (n =  5) with the appropriate material parameters in the salt tectonic modeling.|$|R

40|$|Numerical and {{analytical}} methods for predicting uniaxial damage have largely {{depended on the}} constituent components of the stress/strain measured data which have inherent scatter. Models developed for this purpose have also attempted, {{with some degree of}} success, to address the fundamental issues of failure mechanisms within a multiaxial stress state context. This paper presents a new analytical/empirical/a postpriori unifying approach to predict creep damage and rupture under uniaxial/multiaxial and crack growth conditions by deriving a multiscale based constraint criterion. Essentially, the model links the global constraint due to geometry in a globally isotropic material with a microstructural constraint arising from creep diffusional processes occurring in a sub-grain locally anisotropic microstructure. Furthermore, it is shown that the model is consistent with the established NSW crack growth model (Nikbin et al., 1984, 1986; Tan et al., 2001) which is routinely used to determine the plane stress/strain bounds for cracking rates in fracture mechanics geometries and cracked components. The concept assumes that at very short times an initial upper shelf material tensile strength and global plasticity and power law <b>creep</b> <b>control</b> creep damage failure and sub grain multiaxial axial stress state dependent failure strain dominates the long term diffusion/dislocation controlled creep response. It is established that the material yield strength in the short term and a measure of creep failure strain at the creep secondary/tertiary transition region described at the limits by the Monkman-Grant failure strain (Monkman and Grant, 1963), are the important variables in both the uniaxial and multiaxial failure processes.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that all creep data in metals {{ascribed}} to the Nabarro-Herring (N-H) diffusional creep mechanism cannot in fact be definitively described by the N-H creep theory. Rather, the creep mechanism is associated with either Harper-Dorn (H-D) dislocation creep or grain boundary sliding (GBS). Specific responses are presented to work by Fiala and Langdon (F-L) who have presented opposing views to the above conclusions. Creep data for copper used by F-L to support N-H creep are shown to be incompatible with the theory, since the experimental creep rates are about three orders of magnitude higher than predicted.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the creep strengthening of aluminum due to the addition of Mg atoms in solid solution and the variation of the stress exponent, n, with the stress (from ≈ 5 to n ≈ 3) {{is due to a}} unique microstructural feature, that is, the stress variation of the total to mobile dislocation density ratio. To support this idea, creep data recorded from the literature of pure Al¿Mg alloys and of pure aluminum have been analyzed in the frame of the strength difference method, SDM. A strengthening proportional to the applied stress is found. On this basis, a model which considers a change of the dislocation density/ velocity due to the presence of the Mg atoms in solid solution and the solute drag and climb forces for dislocation motion was assumed. The new model, which also takes into account published data of the dislocation density measured at different applied stress, describes naturally the curvature of experimental Al-Mg creep data, associated traditionally with the change in deformation mechanism from dislocation glide controlled (n = 3) to dislocation climb controlled (n = 3) mechanism.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} study of cavitation damage and fracture of a superplastic copper alloy, Coronze 638, has been made. Cavities {{are found to}} nucleate at large particles present {{in the form of}} stringers. The size and shape of cavities, as well as the level of damage up to fracture are essentially independent of strain rate over regions I and II of the σ-ε{lunate} curve, as are the true strain to fracture and the development of t instabilities. As the strain rate increases into region III, the level of damage to failure decreases, while the true failure strain increases and necks become sharper. Extensive cavity coalescence is observed up to strains of about 1. 5, producing a number of large (> 100 μm) cavities which exhibit a high stability, and little tendency to coalescence. This allows the sample to sustain a very high level of cavitation without failure. The mechanism of cavity growth for small isolated cavities (< 10 μm) is thought to be diffusive growth constrained by matrix creep at low strain rates, with a transition to plasticity controlled growth at large strain rates. For larger cavities growth appears to be entirely <b>creep</b> <b>controlled.</b> Final fracture occurs by the material exhaustion in the ligaments between voids once the reduction in the cross section exceeds about 30 %.
