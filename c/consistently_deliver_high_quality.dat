40|$|In 1995, the Australian Medical Association {{launched}} its Safe Working Hours campaign. By 1998, {{this had been}} developed into a National Code of Conduct that continues to resonate in the Australian public health system. However, and particularly in respect of Doctors in Training (DITs) who continue to work long hours, there are levels of resistance to proposals that seek to re-organise work or change prevailing professional and cultural expectations. Long working hours have substantial impacts on a DIT's capacity to <b>consistently</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> patient care, dilute {{the effectiveness of their}} training regime and have negative consequences on their health, social life and family responsibilities. While public hospitals often maintain the view that minimal budget flexibility restricts their capacity to affect change in a positive way, in fact devisable productivity and efficiency gains can be achieved by reducing working hours. Further, the medical profession needs to consider whether long hours provide an optimal environment for quality learning and performance. Key concepts The general thesis argued in this paper is that the sometimes extreme working hours of doctors in training (DIT), the negative health consequences that follow, and the workplace culture that allows such work practices, have a direct correlation to the quality standards of patient care, productivity of medical training and efficien...|$|E
40|$|Schools {{and school}} leaders are {{experiencing}} a growing pressure to <b>consistently</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education. Religious Education Coordinators (RECs) aim {{to encourage and}} support religion teachers within the school context to deliver this goal. As a means of achieving improved quality, the importance of continuous teacher learning {{and the influence of}} teaching on student outcomes has become increasingly apparent. An investment in the ongoing professional learning of religious educators is gaining prominence as a necessary vehicle for enhancing student outcomes, however it has not proved to be a panacea. Whilst continuous professional learning should be at the core of religious education teacher professionalism, in some instances this is not so. At a time when accountability has never been higher, there is growing recognition that new kinds of leadership must be centred on successful student and teacher learning. This has prompted my exploration into how RECs can lead professional learning to enhance staff and student learning. This research seeks to better understand the potential of the leadership role of the REC in professional learning. The proposed study is located within a constructivist paradigm and is informed by the theoretical perspective of symbolic interactionism. It draws on grounded theory to explore the perceptions, expectations and experiences of leading professional learning and the opportunities for this in the context of Catholic primary schools. Through surveys, focus groups and unstructured interviews with key stakeholders in religious education, this study seeks to provide deeper understandings of the leadership role of the REC in professional learning and to generate theory to support leadership of religious educators in student learning. Although the genre of professional learning and leadership is well established in educational literature, there has been limited empirical research in this field which focuses {{on the role of the}} REC. This investigation may have implications for what is provided as professional learning for religious educators, how it is provided and how it is supported. The findings may be particularly useful for all key stakeholders concerned with the quality of religious education who seek to implement and evaluate religious education professional learning and thus continue to improve the quality of the subject in the Catholic primary school...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of Disability Care and the heightened attention {{for the social}} inclusion and needs of people with a disability within Australia will have profound long term positive impacts, but the unfortunate truth is the ‘host of problems’ in group homes described in The Age on 29 July 2013 are all too common across the sector – not just at the featured home run by Yooralla. Half of all disability expenditure is on accommodation and most of this is on group homes. In Victoria alone {{there are more than}} 900 group homes that each support 4 - 6 residents with intellectual disability.   As it rolls out Disability Care will enable a more diverse range of options but some form of group home is likely to remain the dominant model for some time, particularly for people with more severe and profound intellectual disability. It is this group who are likely to have to continue to pool support funds and share accommodation with others. Undoubtedly quality of life outcome for residents in group homes, in terms of social connections, engagement and participation, are better than cluster type housing or traditional institutions. But not all group homes <b>consistently</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> support. Outcomes vary enormously within and between services; in some group homes outcomes are so compromised by poor staff practices that they are similar to those found in better small institutions. A La Trobe study published last year in a leading US journal (Bigby et al., 2012) found for example, the culture of some group homes meant residents were regarded as ‘other’ ‘childlike’ and ‘not quite human’; routines and decisions were centred around staff needs rather than residents, and staff were focussed on doing things for residents rather than with them. Looking after the house and simple presence in the community are prioritised rather than engaging residents in domestic tasks, or supporting them to be known, or to participate in activities the community.   Other research from overseas, and a recent La Trobe study of ‘good group homes’ in Victoria demonstrates however what is possible - {{that it is not the}} model but importantly, the implementation that is flawed. There are a few good examples in Victoria of a higher quality of life, where people with intellectual disability are regarded with respect and dignity, are engaged in everyday tasks, known in the community and play valued roles as volunteers or run micro businesses. People with more severe intellectual disability need support to exercise their rights. For this group, the exercise of rights and quality of life outcomes are inextricably connected to staff practices and particularly nuanced, manifesting in different ways from those for people with mild intellectual disability. People with severe and profound intellectual disability find it difficult to act independently. They are reliant on staff to facilitate and interpret their communication, identify their preferences, generate opportunities for new experiences and participation, and support them to successfully engage in meaningful activities and relationships. Unequivocally good staff support is linked to good outcomes for residents in group homes. The ‘moment of truth’ in terms of residents quality of life lies in staff practices – how staff communicate, interact and provide assistance. There is particularly strong evidence about a person centred approach called Active Support developed by Jim Mansell and Julie Beadle-Brown. It is an evidence-based practice whereby staff provide just the right amount of assistance to enable service users to successfully take part in meaningful activities and social relationships, irrespective of their degree of intellectual disability or physical impairments. Staff who use Active Support see that every moment has potential for a person to be engaged; provide little amounts of assistance often; provide graded assistance that is just enough of the right kind to enable a person to succeed in doing all or part of a task; provide opportunities for residents to exercise choice and control over many aspects of their lives including all those little everyday things that are so important to everyone. Active support is also the foundation for more specialist strategies to support people with challenging behaviour. Active Support has been adopted by many disability services across Australia, and sits in policy manuals. But it has been hard to implement and embed in services (Mansell et al., 2013). Many things that influence the practice of staff are behind the scenes. These include: an organisation’s values, procedures and practices, the commitment of senior managers, the method of monitoring staff practice, arrangements for practice leadership, regularity and focus of supervision and team meetings, job descriptions, recruitment processes, induction and processes for translating high level values into expectations and guidance for practice. Current ARC funded research at La Trobe with nine industry partners from three states is tracking staff practices and the implementation of Active Support over five years to uncover the organisational factors that make a difference to staff practice; to test the proposition that the more coherent and focused on resident quality of life outcomes these organisational aspects are, the better staff practices will be. Our pilot findings have demonstrated a relationship between practice leadership and Active Support. Yooralla is one of the partners in this research, who in collaboration with researchers and eight other organisations are investing in finding systematic solutions to poor quality services. If the Disability Care promise of more inclusive lives for people with disability is to be realized additional funding alone will not do it – attention must be paid to the quality of staff support and practice leadership across the entire sector.   This is complex and difficult work which can be informed by rigorous research evidence. There are no quick fix solutions but building the expectation of demonstrated use of Active Support into service standards is a critical way of focusing attention on what will make a difference to resident outcomes.

40|$|Achieving good {{regulatory}} outcomes normally requires <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> design, {{implementation and}} review of the regulatory regime. Major regulatory theories focus on concepts such as the public interest, the role of interest groups, and regulatory capture to explain why regulations come into existence. Regulatory design, however, exists at two levels. Downstream design involves creating a regime to give the appropriate incentives to firms and consumers. Upstream design seeks to incentivise regulators themselves to create and operate <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> regulatory regimes. This paper focuses on the latter. The OECD has undertaken a major programme on regulatory governance to ensure quality {{in the design and}} implementation of regulations. Such measures are now widespread. New Zealand has gradually implemented these approaches including Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in its decision- making processes. These measures are supported, and to some degree required, by increased interaction with Australian practices through institutions such as the Council of Australian Governments and the obligations of Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Arrangement. Achieving full integration of best practice that creates an environment for <b>consistently</b> <b>delivering</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> regulation requires a broad and sustained focus on design, capability, incentives and follow-up. New Zealand has attempted over the last decade to improve regulatory outcomes by focusing on the incentives on regulators. There is still scope for further improvement. Sustained progress on a number of mutually supporting initiatives, with continued reinforcement of the underlying messages and careful building of the necessary institutions and practices is required for continued improvement.

Using airborne lasers, it has become possible to quickly "see" more of the world in many more dimensions. The resulting enormous point clouds serve as data sources for applications far beyond the original mapping purposes ranging from flooding protection and forestry to threat mitigation. In order to process these large quantities of data, novel methods are required. In this contribution, we develop models to automatically classify ground cover and soil types. Using the logic of machine learning, we critically review the advantages of supervised and unsupervised methods. Focusing on decision trees, we improve accuracy by including beam vector components and using a genetic algorithm.

40|$|Storage systems {{today are}} {{expected}} to <b>deliver</b> <b>consistently</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> of service, despite facing constant demands to store increasingly large quantities of data. The technology pull to massive storage systems {{has led to the}} development and widespread adoption of virtualised storage infrastructures that incorporate intelligent storage fabrics. The physical resources underlying such systems are organised into storage tiers, each of which delivers a different cost per capacity ratio. An effective performance model is vital to ensure performance and reliability demands of these systems can be fulfilled. Such a model should abstract the physical features of the underlying disk drives and disk arrays, reflecting faithfully the structure of a virtualised storage system. Typically, a storage tier will consist of multiple RAID subsystems. Our approach is to initially develop a performance model for an individual disk drive. This can be extended to a RAID model, for various RAID levels, using existing or enhanced techniques. We are specifically looking at RAID levels 0, 0 - 1, 5 and 6, which are most commonly used. Our goal is to develop a hierarchical, multi-clas...|$|R

For this purpose, a methodology called UNICOS (UNIfied Industrial COntrols Systems) has been implemented to standardize the design of process control applications. To further accelerate {{the development of these}} applications, we migrated our existing UNICOS tooling suite toward a software factory in charge of assembling project, domain and technical information seamlessly into deployable PLC (Programmable logic Controller) - SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems.

40|$|Fresh meat quality {{including}} meat {{tenderness and}} {{water holding capacity}} are important for consumer acceptance and industry profitability in the US. Exploring the basic mechanism that regulates the development of meat quality attributes is critical for <b>delivering</b> <b>consistently</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> fresh meat to consumers. The overall hypothesis {{of this study was}} that biochemical factors that influence proteolysis during the antemortem or the early postmortem period can contribute to variations in fresh meat quality. The objective was {{to determine the extent to}} which protein modifications including protein degradation, protein nitrosylation and calpain autolysis affect the development of fresh meat quality. The first experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that protein degradation and calpain activation could influence water holding capacity of fresh pork. Intensity of intact desmin was positively correlated with moisture loss, while intensity of intact integrin was negatively correlated with moisture loss during postmortem storage. Significant correlations were found between different calpain autolysis products and intensity of intact desmin and moisture loss. These results support the hypothesis that proteolysis of desmin contributes to greater water holding capacity. The second experiment hypothesized that the properties of calpains could be regulated by a nitric oxide donor S-nitrosoglutathione. S-Nitrosoglutathione could further nitrosylate y-calpain in both the absence and the presence of calcium especially at pH 6. 5. The combination of S-nitrosoglutathione and calcium affected the activity of m- and y-calpain and regulated the rate of y-calpain autolysis. In the third experiment, the hypothesis that the muscle fiber type could be related to the levels of protein nitrosylation in postmortem beef was tested. Beef longissimus dorsi muscle showed higher percentage of type IIA/X and lower percentage of type I myosin heavy chain isoforms than psoas major muscle. The intensity of protein nitrosylation in longissimus dorsi muscle was greater compared to psoas major muscle in samples prepared 1 d postmortem. In conclusion, biochemical and biophysical reactions during preslaughter and postmortem storage can mediate the development of fresh meat quality during postmortem aging...|$|R
