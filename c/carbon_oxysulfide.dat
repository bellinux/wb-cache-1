40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>oxysulfide</b> (COS) was reinvestigated as an {{inhibitor}} {{of active}} inorganic carbon transport in cells of Synechococcus PCC 7942 adapted to growth at low inorganic carbon. COS inhibited both CO 2 and HCO 3 − transport processes in a reversible (in the short term) and mixed competitive manner. The inhibition of COS was established using both silicone oil centrifugation experiments and O 2 -evolution studies. The Ki for COS inhibition was 29 micromolar for CO 2 transport and 110 micromolar for HCO 3 − transport. These results support {{a model of}} inorganic carbon transport with a central CO 2 pump and an inducible HCO 3 − utilizing accessory protein which supplies CO 2 to the primary pump...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>oxysulfide</b> (carbonyl sulfide, COS) {{is a close}} {{structural}} analog of CO 2. Although hydrolysis of COS (to CO 2 and H 2 S) {{does occur}} at alkaline pH (> 9), at pH 8. 0 the rate of hydrolysis is slow enough to allow investigation of COS as a possible substrate and inhibitor of the active CO 2 transport system of Synechococcus UTEX 625. A light-dependent uptake of COS was observed that was inhibited by CO 2 and the ATPase inhibitor diethylstilbestrol. The COS {{taken up by the}} cells could not be recovered when the lights were turned off or when acid was added. It was concluded that most of the COS taken up was hydrolyzed by intracellular carbonic anhydrase. The production of H 2 S was observed and COS removal from the medium was inhibited by ethoxyzolamide. Bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase catalysed the stoichiometric hydrolysis of COS to H 2 S. The active transport of CO 2 was inhibited by COS in an apparently competitive manner. When Na+-dependent HCO 3 − transport was allowed in the presence of COS, the extracellular [CO 2] rose considerably above the equilibrium level. This CO 2 appearing in the medium was derived from the dehydration of transported HCO 3 − and was leaked from the cells. In the presence of COS the return to the cells of this leaked CO 2 was inhibited. These results showed that the Na+-dependent HCO 3 − transport was not inhibited by COS, whereas active CO 2 transport was inhibited. When COS was removed by gassing with N 2, a normal pattern of CO 2 uptake was observed. The silicone fluid centrifugation method showed that COS (100 micromolar) had little effect upon the initial rate of HCO 3 − transport or CO 2 fixation. The steady state rate of CO 2 fixation was, however, inhibited about 50 % in the presence of COS. This inhibition can be at least partially explained by the significant leakage of CO 2 from the cells that occurred when CO 2 uptake was inhibited by COS. Neither CS 2 nor N 2 O acted like COS. It is concluded that COS is an effective and selective inhibitor of active CO 2 transport...|$|E
40|$|This seventh {{annual report}} {{outlines}} our continued progress {{on each of}} six objectives. Improved fumigants: We continue to evaluate previously established field tests, which inlicate that chioropicrin continues to protect Douglas-fir poles after 17 years and piling after 12 years. Vorlex treated poles are being gradually recolonized by decay fungi, while the Vapam treated poles appear to have little resistance to decay fungi. The latter poles were retreated last summer and {{will be used to}} determine the effectiveness of fumigant retreatment. Solid methylisothiocyanate (NIT) continues to protect Douglasfir poles, although the 20 percent NIT treatment has experienced slightly higher levels of colonization after 9 years. Additional tests {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} gelatin encapsulated MIT or chioropicrin indicate that both chemicals continue to remain effective. In addition, there now appears to be little difference between the levels of control exhibited following addition of varying amounts of water to the poles along with gelatin encapsulated NIT. Closed tube bioassays indicate the chioropicrin remains at fungitoxic levels after 17 years, while no volatile fungitoxins appear to be present in Vapam or Vorlex treated wood. The evaluation of untreated Douglas-fir posts treated with NIT, chloropicrin, or Vapam indicate that fumigants can not ccatletely protect untreated wood in ground contact unless there is sane other type of preservative treated barrier present. Although the NIT treatment provided the best protection, all of the posts experienced some surface decay and termite attack after 10 years. These results appear similar to those found with more recent tests of posts treated with various coLthinations of preservative containing wraps and fuinigants. Evaluation of Mylone and tridipain, two solid chemicals that degrade to produce NIT, initcates that NIT production and fungal control are enhanced by the addition of basic pH buffers; however, only the pH 12 buffer resulted in rapid fungal control. These results Jnitcate that the rate of fumigant release can be tailored to control specific decay problems. We have also investigated the decomposition of Vapam in wood. As previously reported, there are over 14 potential deccmposition products from this chemical. This past year we developed methods for assaying these chemicals, evaluated the long-term stability of each, and prepared test blocks for evaluating decc*,osjtion in wood. In addition, we have studied the migration of volatile compounds from Vapam and NIT treated blocks under controlled aeration. After 5, 000 hours, detectable levesis of NIT, carbon disulfide, and <b>carbon</b> <b>oxysulfide</b> are still present in air surrounding the Douglas-fir blocks. These tests indicate that low levels of volatile chemicals are continuously eninitted from fumigant treated wood. While this poses little difficulty for utility poles, it may pose some hazard for wood in closed spaces. Evaluations will continue until the emission levels decline below detectable limits. In addition to Vapam deccmposition studies, we have also evaluated the decoxrosition, movement and fungitoxicity of NIT under a variety of environmental conditions. In general, wet wood held less NIT, but the degree of control produced was more rapid. These results suggest that dry wood will act as a reseivoir of NIT, which will be released as moisture enters and swells the wood. This effect may provide an excellent long-term decay control strategy. The information from these studies will be used to develop more 111 ecific recaimrndations for fumigant treatment. Cedar Saood Decay Control: This past year we reestablished the field test of promising nei pentachiorophenol replacements, incorporating 26 chemicals into these tests. These saitles will be evaluated after 1 and 2 years to determine efficacy. In addition to the field test, we evaluated 13 new formulations or cinations of formulations in our laboratory screening tests. A nuner of chemicals including Isothiazolone, Amical 48 and a nurrer of quaternary aimnonium compounds appear promising and have been included in the field test.
