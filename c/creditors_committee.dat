The two founded American Speedy Printing, which grew through franchising to more than 730 stores in 44 states. Later, Buchanan and American Speedy were defendants in a string of lawsuits during the late 1980s and early 1990s by franchisees and master franchisees, who said they were not making the money that Buchanan had said they could expect. After the bankruptcy, he was accused by a <b>creditors</b> <b>committee</b> of taking excessive compensation and actions that resulted in overstated earnings for American Speedy. In a 1995 deposition, {{he said that he had}} no personal obligation to repay the loan from Merrill Lynch; a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over taxes [...] on the money Buchanan received from Merrill Lynch stretched through the 1990s. Buchanan, his business partner, and Merrill Lynch were sued violating the Michigan Corporation Act. It ended with Buchanan paying $1.5 million.|$|E

2500|$|Luc Despins, the <b>creditors</b> <b>committee</b> counsel, said: [...] "The reason we're not objecting {{is really}} {{based on the}} lack of a viable alternative. We did not support the {{transaction}} because there had not been enough time to properly review it." [...] In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb US$47.4billion in securities and assume US$45.5billion in trading liabilities. Lehman's attorney Harvey R. Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said [...] "the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be US$1.29billion, including US$960million for Lehman's New York headquarters and US$330million for two New Jersey data centres. Lehman's original estimate valued its headquarters at US$1.02billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at US$900million." [...] Further, Barclays will not acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but will have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. Finally, Lehman will retain US$20billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays.

40|$|This paper assesses various crisis {{resolution}} proposals using {{a theoretical}} model of (liquidity and solvency) crisis. The model suggests that payments standstills and last-resort lending are equally efficient means {{of dealing with}} liquidity crises, while coordinated lending through <b>creditor</b> <b>committees</b> is second best. Debt write-downs are preferred to subsidised IMF financing when dealing with solvency crises, because of the negative moral hazard implications of the latter tool. Finally, the model suggests that international bankruptcy court proposals may be superior to existing contractual approaches in securing such write-downs. ...|$|R

Pillsbury was forced to disgorge $10 million in fees for filing a false affidavit and hiding their conflict of interest for the debtor in the bankruptcy case of SONICblue. The federal judge ordered the firm to step down citing the [...] "complete breakdown of creditor confidence" [...] due to the firm's failure to make a required disclosure of a conflict of interest involving a number of hedge funds. Counsel for the official <b>creditors</b> <b>committee</b> gave tacit approval of the conflict as neither law firm brought the matter {{to the attention of the}} court. Sequential conflict disclosure misconduct in the SONICblue bankruptcy case has escalated the possible consequences to Pillsbury. The lawyer representing the successor to SONICblue subsequently learned that in addition to the failure to disclose the conflict, the firm also failed to disclose their own withdrawal of funds from the Debtor during the pre-petition preference period and had petitioned the Federal Judge to refer the firm's responsible lawyers for criminal prosecution and sought $30 million in damages from Pillsbury Winthrop and associated parties on the official <b>creditors</b> <b>committee</b> as well as their counsel.|$|E

The Judge in the Argentine case has, it appears, deftly exploited creditor heterogeneity – between ‘holdouts’ seeking capital gains and institutional investors wanting a settlement – to promote a swap with a supermajority of creditors. Our analysis of Argentine debt litigation reveals a ‘Judge-mediated’ sovereign debt restructuring which resolves key issues of Transition and Aggregation – two of the tasks envisaged for the IMF's stillborn Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism.
