40|$|The article assesses to {{what extent}} various {{components}} of government budgets affected by the macroeconomic situation operate (through influencing domestic demand) to smooth the business cycle 1 in Germany. The {{aim of the research}} is to evaluate government budget sensitivity to economic fluctuations and thereby assess the importance of automatic fiscal stabilisers. Fiscal policies and the analysis of fiscal stabilisers {{have been added to the}} agenda due to the fact that the EMU member countries no longer have national monetary policies at their disposal and therefore fiscal policy has to play a more important role in smoothing shocks, especially if they originate on the demand side. However, in order to avoid the typical pitfalls of fiscal finetuning, the main focus has increasingly been put on the work of automatic stabilisers. This view is codified in the Stability and Growth Pact, whose “fiscal philosophy” implies that countries should set a structural target of close to balance or surplus and simply let automatic stabilisers work, where appropriate, over the whole business cycle without breaching the 3 % reference value for the deficit. To determine the size of <b>budgetary</b> <b>cyclical</b> <b>components,</b> i. e. the size of automatic fiscal stabilisers and the structural balance, the standard two-step procedure (also followed by the OECD, the IMF and the European Commission) was used. The first stage of this method is to measure the GDP gap, which is needed for both, estimating budget sensitivity and extracting a budget cyclical component. In line with the method of the European Commission, the estimate of the GDP gap is based upon a statistical smoothing technique (the Hodrick-Prescott filter). The Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP-filter) has been selected on the basis of pragmatic criteria such as simplicity and transparency. The second stage is to identify the cyclical sensitivity of all budget components (on the revenue and expenditure side 2) - their sensitivity to the GDP gap. Finally, budget’s cyclical component and structural balance are both calculated on the basis of sensitivity estimates and the GDP gap. It is well known that the automatic fiscal stabilisers generally reduced cyclical volatility in the 1990 s, although they were growing weak, while discretionary fiscal policy became more active. However, in Germany the need to undertake fiscal consolidation in order to improve public finances forced governments to take discretionary actions that in effect reduced, or even offset, the effect of automatic fiscal stabilisers. Based on data from 1980 until 1998 and using the two-step method, the cyclical sensitivity of the German budget was found to be only 0, 35. This means that when the GDP diverges from its potential value by 1 %, the budget balance will change accordingly by up to 0, 35 % of the GDP...|$|R

Sustaining this adjustment and making further progress may again prove difficult, as the fiscal correction is similar in nature to the previous consolidation effort.

40|$|The recent {{revision}} (March 2005) of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) {{has confirmed}} the 3 % deficit/GDP ratio as the {{pillar of the}} excessive deficits procedure envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty for member countries of the EMU. Since the deficit/GDP ceiling is still in place, research on its implications for fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stabilization has to be pushed further.

In particular, this paper presents an econometric estimate and simulations of a macroeconomic model of Italy and Germany aimed at addressing three issues. First, monetary and fiscal rules intercations are explictly modelled and examined in dynamic setting.

Our research is based on data extracted from EUROSTAT and our calculation and compilations. Our working hypothesis is that despite huge differences in tax policy among all 27 European countries there are some common trends and Romanian tax policy must adapt and must follow them. Another important element is that trends in fiscal policy may vary due different elements such as: level of development, social policy issues, systems of financing different public expenditures, number and structure of populations, regional and local objectives and many others.

This question is studied with a model in which fiscal rules are imposed on ‘measured’ fiscal variables, which can differ from ‘true’ variables because there is a margin for creative accounting. The probability of detecting creative accounting depends on its size and the transparency of the budget. The model studies the effects on fiscal policy of different rules, separating structural from cyclical effects, and examines how these effects depend on the underlying fiscal distortion and on the degree of transparency of the budget.

Fiscal policy {{will still have}} a moderately expansionary effect, while turning more restrictive next year, when measures aiming at sustained budgetary consolidation will take effect. Demand and output in 2001 may thus advance at a somewhat slower pace (+ 2. 7 percent). In both years, net government borrowing would, on present assumptions, amount to 2 percent of GDP.

40|$|Real‐time {{estimates}} of potential output {{are used for}} the calculation of the cyclically adjusted budget balance, {{one of the main}} indicators in the assessment of the fiscal performance of EU member states. The estimation of potential output involves a decomposition of actual output into a cyclical and a structural component based on arbitrary assumptions about the statistical properties of the two unobserved components. With a very high degree of smoothing, variations in GDP are mostly taken to be temporary, as are the ensuing changes in the budget deficit. Conversely, with a low degree of smoothing, variations in GDP are mostly taken to be permanent, leading to different policy conclusions. Our paper examines whether and how different potential output estimates would have supported different decisions in the EU budgetary surveillance in terms of both timing and substance. The results show that only a very high degree of smoothing of potential output would significantly reduce the reliability of the surveillance indicators. We conclude that a higher degree of smoothing compared with current practice would not be harmful for EU fiscal surveillance, while it could contribute to more cautious policies by signalling larger and longer periods of economic ‘good times’. potential output, <b>cyclical</b> adjustment, EU <b>budgetary</b> surveillance, Stability and Growth Pact, Excessive Deficit Procedure, safety margin, minimum benchmark, fiscal surveillance indicators,...|$|R
