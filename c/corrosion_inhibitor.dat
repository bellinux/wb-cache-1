5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E

30|$|Carbon steel, in {{conjunction}} with <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> {{has been used in}} several wells above 300  °F (150  °C) (Goodfellow and Barr 2001; Place 1992; Smith 1982; Ramachandran et al. 2006). Oil-soluble <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have been developed and used in HT gas wells. In previous work (Ramachandran et al. 2006), we have documented the performance of oil-soluble <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in extremely challenging laboratory corrosion tests. The performance of HT oil-soluble <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in field situations with high bottom hole temperatures, high partial pressures of carbon dioxide, and some hydrogen sulfide and brines of different salinities has also been documented in this work (Ramachandran et al. 2006). <b>Corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> that work in these systems often have large alkyl tail groups that help bind the monolayer or bi-layer film on the surface (Ramachandran et al. 1996; Jovancicevic et al. 1998; Ramachandran and Jovancicevic 1998).|$|R
500|$|When {{steel is}} {{immersed}} in water, adding a small concentration (55ppm) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) {{to the water}} protects the steel from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to [...] For this reason, pertechnetate {{has been used as}} an anodic <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> for steel, although technetium's radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self-contained systems. While (for example) [...] can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20years and was still uncorroded. The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer (passivation). One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. (Activated carbon can also be used for the same purpose.) The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.|$|E

2500|$|Corrosion inhibitors, such as calcium nitrite , {{can also}} {{be added to the}} water mix before pouring concrete.

The nitrite anion is a mild oxidizer that oxidizes the soluble and mobile ferrous ions (Fe2+) present at the surface of the corroding steel and causes them to precipitate as an insoluble ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). This causes the passivation of steel at the anodic oxidation sites. Nitrite is a much more active <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> than nitrate, which is a less powerful oxidizer of the divalent iron.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use of <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{is the one}} {{the most}} {{economical}} and practical means of controlling metallic corrosion in different corrosive media. Interest {{on the use of}} eco-friendly organic compounds as <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> has extended to the use of polymers to inhibit metallic corrosion. The use of polymers as <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> has attracted attention and has gained wide acceptance in recent times. This has been attributed to a number of factors namely: (i) they are low cost and stable to metallic materials in acid media, (ii) they possess multiple adsorption sites, (iii) through their functional groups, they form complexes with metal ions and on the metal surface these complexes occupy a large area, thereby blanketing the surface and protecting the metal from corrosive agents present in the solution. A number of synthetic and natural polymers as metallic <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have been investigated and reported. As an update to previous review work on the use of polymers as <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> the present review presents most of the contributions made to the literature on the use of polymers as <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> of diverse metals in different corrosive media in the last four (2010 - 2013) years...|$|R
25|$|In {{the absence}} of leaks, {{antifreeze}} chemicals such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol may retain their basic properties indefinitely. By contrast, <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are gradually used up, and must be replenished from time to time. Larger systems (such as HVAC systems) are often monitored by specialist firms which take responsibility for adding <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and regulating coolant composition. For simplicity, most automotive manufacturers recommend periodic complete replacement of engine coolant, to simultaneously renew <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and remove accumulated contaminants.|$|R
50|$|In other cases, such as {{mixed metals}} in piping (for example, copper, cast iron and other cast metals), {{galvanic}} corrosion {{will contribute to}} accelerated corrosion of parts of the system. <b>Corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> such as sodium nitrite or sodium molybdate can be injected into these systems to reduce the galvanic potential. However, the application of these <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> must be monitored closely. If the application of <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> increases the conductivity of the water within the system, the galvanic corrosion potential can be greatly increased.|$|R
2500|$|Draw-off or Blow-down — The {{portion of}} the {{circulating}} water flow that is removed (usually discharged to a drain) {{in order to maintain}} the amount of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and other impurities at an acceptably low level. [...] Higher TDS concentration in solution may result from greater cooling tower efficiency. However the higher the TDS concentration, the greater the risk of scale, biological growth and corrosion. The amount of blow-down is primarily designated by measuring by the electrical conductivity of the circulating water. Biological growth, scaling and corrosion can be prevented by chemicals (respectively, biocide, sulfuric acid, <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor).</b> On the other hand, the only practical way to decrease the electrical conductivity is by increasing the amount of blow-down discharge and subsequently increasing the amount of clean make-up water.|$|E
