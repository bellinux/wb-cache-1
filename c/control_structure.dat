By the end of 1974, the North Vietnamese General Staff had created two army corps headquarters, matching South Vietnam's command and <b>control</b> <b>structure</b> in the I and II Corps Tactical Zones. Most independent North Vietnamese infantry regiments in the south were also combined into divisional structures. A U.S. Defense Attaché Office (established in 1973 to replace MACV, the 50 officers and men of the DAO coordinated all military assistance to South Vietnam) report concluded that the PAVN had increased their strategic reserve from two divisions to seven, making 70,000 additional troops available to augment the 200,000 combat and 100,000 support troops already in South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, it doubled police numbers to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police deployed in 12 battalions which adopted principles of military organization. In addition, there were 9,00010,000 regionally-organized reserve police; these were set up in 16 battalions and 10 independent companies, but the units lacked weapons. In May, {{in response to the}} deteriorating situation, the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde - ZNG) by amalgamating the special police battalions into four guards brigades. The guards brigades initially comprised about 8,000 troops, and were subordinated to the Ministry of Defence headed by retired JNA General Martin Špegelj. The regional police, by then expanded to 40,000, was also attached to the ZNG and re-organized into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions. The guards brigades were the only ZNG units that were fully equipped with small arms, while heavier weapons and an effective command and <b>control</b> <b>structure</b> were lacking throughout the ZNG. At the time, Croatian weapon stocks consisted of 30,000 small arms purchased abroad in addition to 15,000 previously owned by the police. A new 10,000-strong special police was established to replace the personnel transferred to the ZNG guards brigades.|$|E

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} is to explore based on internationally {{recognised}} frameworks: 1. how internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> are applied in Sweden among different sectors; 2. how organizational size and environment affect internal control structures; and 3. the impact of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> on organizational performance. Methods A quantitative method was used in the data collection and analysis. The sample consisted of 1117 organizations operating in Sweden. A mean analysis was conducted to measure the level of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> among different industries, organizational sizes, and different choices of listing in the stock exchange market. Person’s correlation analysis was then used to explore possible correlations between external environmental factors and internal <b>control</b> <b>structures,</b> and internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> and organizational performance. Lastly, a structural model was built to measure the impact of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> on organizational performance. The measurements of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> and organizational performance are based on COSO framework’s principles and objectives. Results This study gives an insight on how internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> are applied across industrial sectors in Sweden, with financial institutions and manufacturing organizations having notably higher levels of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures.</b> Additionally, it provides evidence of the impact external environmental factors have on internal <b>control</b> <b>structures.</b> Furthermore, it shows that organizations that are listed in the Swedish stock exchange market have an equivalent level of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> to those registered in the American stock exchange market. In contrast, organisations that are not listed in the stock exchange market have a notably lower level of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures.</b> Lastly, it illustrates the positive impact the presence of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures</b> has on organizational performance. 3 | P a g e Conclusion The results highlight a crucial role the supervisory authority Finansinspektionen (FI) has in regulating the Swedish financial market. They also show that the stability of the Swedish business environment has had a positive impact on the level of internal <b>control</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

The military section of Cassinga was easily partitioned from the non-military sections. The overall commander of PLAN in town was Dimo Amaambo, who responsible for the co-ordination of all PLAN actions in Southern Angola, including incursions into South West Africa/Namibia. A headquarters such as Cassinga was second in importance only to Lubango, which was the overall SWAPO military headquarters in Angola.

25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and <b>control</b> <b>structure</b> is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E
