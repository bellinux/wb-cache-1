The paper shows that cross-border loss offset mitigates both the reactions of a multijurisdictional firm to tax changes {{and the amount of}} tax competition engaged in by governments. However, formulary apportionment (with a <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base)</b> boosts the sensitivity of firms to tax changes and increases the scope for interjurisdictional tax competition as well.

40|$|The {{possible}} ways {{of corporate}} tax base harmonization in the European Union {{are presented in}} the paper. Present situation when there are 27 different taxation systems used in the EU increases compliance costs of taxation to the companies and therefore decreases their competitiveness. It was proved, that there is negative correlation between {{the size of the}} company {{and the size of the}} compliance costs of taxation. Based on that, the European Commission has decided for twin-track strategy – to introduce home state taxation in the short term and common consolidated corporate tax base in the long term. In respect to the fact, that the pilot project in the frame of home state taxation system has not started yet, the attention has been turned to the common consolidated corporate tax base. The paper discusses the possible attitudes and methods of <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> allocation. Based on mentioned arguments the formulary apportionment with factors which generate the taxable income of the group (assets, payroll, turnover, etc.) seems to be the best solution. Factors and their weight should become the subject of further discussion in the European Union.

My dissertation describes the efforts of the European Commission towards full harmonisation of the process of determining the corporate tax base in respect of business entities formed as supranational groups of businesses registered in various EU member states or in combination of members from the EU and the third countries. The pending harmonisation should prevent the said entities from aggressive tax "optimisation" in the course of which they transfer their tax base to countries with the lowest income tax and abuse gaps and incomprehensiveness of tax regulation in individual EU member states. Such practice may, in some cases, result in double non-taxation thus further reducing the income of EU member states' already suffering public budgets. The EU has recognized the need to implement measures to stop this practice and will take action. One of the measures that should lead to an improvement in tax collection is the fastest introduction of a common <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> for corporate income (Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base). The genesis, structure and characterization of CCCTB has become a crucial part of the theoretical background research. Other issues that arise in connection with the introduction of the common <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> and which are addressed in this work are as follows - what similarities and differences are there between the European and national rules on accounting and taxes, which procedures will be used for a transformation of the initial accounting data presented in accordance with the national legislation to the European tax base and what impact will have these transformation processes on the final amount of the tax base...|$|E

40|$|The current {{rules for}} {{corporate}} taxation in Europe do not longer fit the globalized economic activities. Taxing corporate income {{on a national}} level leads to many tax obstacles for European multinationals. European multinationals, for example, face high compliance costs, suffer limitations to cross-border loss compensation and have to deal with transfer pricing issues. In an attempt to provide a comprehensive solution for the underlying tax obstacles that currently harm the international competitiveness of European multinationals, the European Commission (EC) launched a proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base directive (EC, 2011). The proposal includes one set of tax rules, allowing multinationals to calculate a common consolidated corporate tax base on a group level. The <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> would then be reapportioned to the different group members by means of an apportionment formula, which includes the factors active, sales and labour. The Member States preserve the right to apply their own tax rate to their specific share of the <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> This dissertation contributes to the rather limited academic research concerning CCCTB. The core aims are (i) to explore the design of the European apportionment formula, (ii) to investigate the EU apportionment formula regarding the role of intangible assets in Belgium and (iii) to attain insights in the voting behaviour of the Members of the European Parliament (MEP). In the first study we focus on the design of the European apportionment formula, which {{plays a major role in}} Member States’ concern for protecting their tax revenue, as well as for the multinational companies’ tax minimizing opportunities. More specifically, we investigate the effect of changing the number of factors that make up the formula and the weight given to each factor. We used unpublished firm level data from a listed multinational, which enabled us to study the factor definitions in detail. Our simulation results indicate that including more factors and applying more equal weights distributes the <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> more equally, which reduces tax planning opportunities. Moreover, for our multinational, using more simplified factors definitions does not change the allocation of the <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base</b> to a great extent. This advocates the inclusion of simplified factor definitions to reduce the compliance costs for multinationals. In the second study we focus on the factor assets in the apportionment formula. Namely, it is the commission’s intention to only partly and temporarily include intangible assets into this factor. The main reason for this is that the inclusion of intangibles could create tax planning opportunities for multinationals caused by location and valuation issues. However, excluding intangible assets from the apportionment formula could lead to an unfair distribution of the <b>consolidated</b> <b>tax</b> <b>base.</b> Member States that invest highly in a more knowledge-based economy, would lose taxable income they are entitled to. We empirically investigate this issue in a Belgian context. More precisely, using firm specific data from the Belfirst database, we investigate the profit generating capacity of both the proposed allocation factors, i. e. tangible fixed assets, sales and labour, as well as the additional allocation factor, viz intangible assets. Our results show that intangible assets, defined as the sum of ‘capitalized R&D costs’ and ‘concessions, patents and licences’, have a significant and positive impact on the creation of profit. We also include the factor capitalized R&D costs separately and find a positive and significant contribution of this factor to the generation of profit. In addition, our results show both the formula adding intangible assets to the proposed allocations factors, and the formula adding capitalized R&D costs, perform significantly better than the formula only including the proposed factors. Moreover, the formula adding intangible assets is more precise in explaining profit than the formula including capitalized R&D costs. The proposal for a CCCTB directive concerns a decision about direct taxation, meaning that the consultation procedure is applied. This procedure implies that the final decision rests with the Council of the EU and that the European Parliament plays a consultative role. In April 2012, the Member of the European Parliament approved the amended CCCTB proposal (452 votes in favour, 172 against and 36 abstentions). The third study gives insight into the voting behaviour of MEPs concerning the CCCTB directive. We focus on the question whether or not the voting behaviour of MEPs is influenced by the economic impact of CCCTB for their country. The economic impact of CCCTB is measured through the impact of CCCTB for each MS on their corporate income tax revenue. We collected the voting results from the independent organization VoteWatch Europe. Our results show that a higher impact of CCCTB on the corporate income tax revenue, increases the likelihood of a MEP to vote in favour of the proposal. As a robustness check we also measured economic impact by using the impact on employment and GDP. Again, we find that MEPs are significantly and positively influenced in their voting behaviour by the impact of CCCTB on employment and GDP for their country. Finally, we find that political party and country variables also have a significant effect on the voting behaviour of MEPs, whereas the individual characteristics of MEP did not have a significant influence...|$|E
