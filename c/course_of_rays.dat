5000|$|Following the {{retirement}} of Stockton in 1994, Ray relinquished the reins of the women's program {{to take over the}} men's team. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> six years, <b>Ray's</b> teams posted a record of 118-60, a winning percentage <b>of</b> [...]663. <b>Ray's</b> teams averaged nearly 20 wins per season and made two appearances in the NAIA National Tournament and two appearances in the NCAA Division II national tournament.|$|R
40|$|The use of analogies to {{physical}} phenomena {{is an exciting}} paradigm in computer vision that allows unorthodox approaches to feature extraction, creating new techniques with unique properties. A technique known as the "image ray transform" has been developed based upon an analogy to the propagation <b>of</b> light as <b>rays.</b> The transform analogises an image {{to a set of}} glass blocks with refractive index linked to pixel properties and then casts a large number <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> through the image. The <b>course</b> <b>of</b> these <b>rays</b> is accumulated into an output image. The technique can successfully extract tubular and circular features and we show successful circle detection, ear biometrics and retinal vessel extraction. The transform has also been extended through the use <b>of</b> multiple <b>rays</b> arranged as a beam to increase robustness to noise, and we show quantitative results for fully automatic ear recognition, achieving 95. 2 % rank one recognition across 63 subjects...|$|R
5000|$|For Unpainted Sculpture (1997), {{over the}} <b>course</b> <b>of</b> two years, <b>Ray</b> has reconstructed a life-sized crashed Pontiac Grand Am (circa 1991) out of fiberglass, casting and {{assembling}} each piece {{to match the}} bent and twisted forms of the original [...] Despite the work’s misleading title, it is painted a soft dove grey that {{is reminiscent of the}} plastic parts of model car kits.|$|R

The <b>course</b> <b>of</b> the polarized <b>ray</b> was now parallel to the current, or in the direction of its axis (517.); but still no effect, under any circumstances of contact or disunion, could be perceived upon it.|$|R
50|$|By {{opening the}} stop wider, similar {{deviations}} arise for lateral points as have been already discussed for axial points; {{but in this}} case they are much more complicated. The <b>course</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rays</b> in the meridional section is no longer symmetrical to the principal <b>ray</b> <b>of</b> the pencil; and on an intercepting plane there appears, instead of a luminous point, a patch of light, not symmetrical about a point, and often exhibiting a resemblance to a comet having its tail directed towards or away from the axis. From this appearance it takes its name. The unsymmetrical form of the meridional pencil—formerly the only one considered—is coma in the narrower sense only; other errors of coma have been treated by Arthur König and Moritz von Rohr, and later by Allvar Gullstrand.|$|R
5|$|In January 1764 one barge {{experimentally}} carried one load of coal {{from the}} Thames at Oxford up the River Cherwell to Islip and thence {{up the old}} <b>course</b> <b>of</b> the River <b>Ray</b> to Arncott. The coal was landed at Arncott Bridge and delivered thence by wheelbarrows to Sir Edward Turner, 2nd Baronet at Ambrosden House. However, the experiment {{seems not to have}} been repeated and did not establish a regular freight trade on the river.|$|R

50|$|As {{example for}} this model it is assume: a {{rectilinear}} free space with two walls, one upper {{and the other}} lower, from which two vertical bases are positioned at their ends, these are the transmitting and receiving antennas that it’s locate {{in such a way}} that their heights don’t surpass the limits of the top wall; Achieved this the structure acts as free space for its functioning similar to that of a dielectric canyon of signals propagation, since the rays transmitted from the transmitting antenna will collide each side of the upper and lower walls infinity of times (for this example up to 3 reflections) until reaching the receiving antenna. During the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rays</b> for each reflection they suffer, part of the energy of the signal is dissipated in each reflection, normally after the third reflection <b>of</b> said <b>ray</b> its resulting component which is a retro-reflected ray is insignificant with a negligible energy.|$|R
5000|$|Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> his career, <b>Ray</b> {{worked in}} a wide variety of media. In 1968, Ray’s work was {{described}} by Robert A. Ewing, former curator of Fine Arts Museum of Santa Fe, New Mexico in the following words: “There is in his work the magic of a court jeweler working with materials of our time. Whether it be the masterfully controlled intricacy of drawing or the compelling power of sculpture in which one discovers surprises from the natural world in combination with elements as unexpected as shattered glass, there is a delight and timelessness in the Southwestern Odyssey of Robert Ray.” ...|$|R
60|$|Consequently {{the plan}} of reflectors was discarded, and Roland {{determined}} that {{the right thing to}} do was to take Margaret into his confidence and explain to her why he and she should not stand together and look down the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> the Artesian <b>ray.</b> She scolded him for not telling her all this before, and a permanent screen was erected around the spot on which the ray was intended to work, formed of Venetian blinds with fixed slats, so that the person inside could readily talk and consult with others outside without being seen by them.|$|R
40|$|A {{follow-up}} study of over 14, 000 patients {{treated with a}} single <b>course</b> <b>of</b> X <b>rays</b> for ankylosing spondylitis demonstrated a substantial excess risk of developing cancer. Previously the excess risk of leukaemia has been related to the estimated mean radiation dose to the active bone marrow but detailed estimates were not made of the radiation doses to other organs. In the present work, data extracted from the original treatment records of {{a random sample of}} one in 15 patients have been used to make dose estimates, using Monte Carlo methods, for 30 specific organs or regions of the body and 12 bone marrow sites. Estimates of the mean and median organ doses, standard deviations and ranges have been tabulated. Detailed distributions are presented for six organs (lung, bronchi, stomach, oesophagus, active bone marrow and total body). Comparison with the earlier bone marrow estimates and more recent theoretical estimates shows good agreement...|$|R
40|$|A laser {{diffraction}} experiment {{was conducted to}} study light propagation in air. The experiment is easy to reproduce and {{it is based on}} simple optical principles. Two optical sensors (segmented photo-diodes) are used for measuring the position of diffracted light spots with a precision better than 0. 1 micrometer. The goal is to look for signals of anisotropic light propagation as function of the laser beam alignment to the Earth's motion (solar barycenter motion) obtained by COBE. Two raster search techniques have been used. First, a laser beam fixed in the laboratory frame scans in space due to Earth's rotation. Second, a laser beam mounted on a turntable system scans actively in space by turning the table. The results obtained with both methods show that the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> light <b>rays</b> are affected by the motion of the Earth, and a predominant first order quantity describes well the experimental results. This result differs in amount of 21 % from the Special Relativity Theory prediction and that supplies the value of a=- 1 / 2 (isotropy) ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of the robbery, however, Ray {{unexpectedly}} stumbles upon the corpse of the store's owner, Petras Ipolitas. Fiore quickly devises a cover story and coaches Ray on how to keep the homicide detectives from suspecting their involvement. The next day, Fiore announces that he has located a suspect in Ipolitas's killing—Jurgis Ambrozas, a small-time criminal who Fiore seems to have a grudge against. In the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> his interrogation, <b>Ray</b> begins to suspect that Ambrozas has been set up to take the fall for the murder. He brings his suspicions to Detective Sloane Pearson, the homicide officer assigned to the case. Although initially reluctant, Sloane agrees to help Ray investigate the case [...] "off the books". When Fiore learns of this, he accuses <b>Ray</b> <b>of</b> disloyalty, and soon Jed and the other trainees begin pressuring Ray to drop his investigation. Ultimately, Ray is faced with a moral dilemma in which he must choose between adhering to Fiore's [...] "code of silence," [...] or following the example of his father and pursuing the truth, wherever it may lead.|$|R

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{process that}} determines the arrangement <b>of</b> <b>ray</b> sensilla in the Caenorhabditis elegans male tail has been studied. It is {{shown that the}} adult arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> {{is determined by the}} placement <b>of</b> <b>ray</b> cells at specific sites in the epidermis of the last larval (L 4) stage. Placement <b>of</b> <b>ray</b> cells at specific epidermal sites results from the generation of neurons and support cells in the epidermis near to their final positions, and the subsequent refinement of these positions by an active mechanism involving specific cellular associations. Positions <b>of</b> <b>ray</b> cells and adjacent epidermal cells have been studied during ray development by means of indirect immunofluorescence staining with an antibody to a cell junctional antigen. Mutations are described in six genes that alter the adult arrangement <b>of</b> the <b>rays,</b> frequently resulting in fusion <b>of</b> <b>rays.</b> Changes in the adult pattern <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> in mutants appear to result from prior changes in the epidermal positions <b>of</b> <b>ray</b> cells, and for two mutants it is suggested that {{this may be due to}} the inappropriate clustering of processes from neurons and support cells <b>of</b> adjacent <b>rays.</b> Development <b>of</b> the wild-type arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> appears to require the specification of molecular differences between the rays that affect the specificity of their cellular associations...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{restructuring}} of the cellular arrangement, rays in storeyed cambium undergo transformations, that is, uniting and splitting on the borders of storeys, when their height during development exceeds that of the storeys of fusiform cells. The primordial rays on the cambium surface have a non-storeyed arrangement. Prolonged predominance of splitting over uniting {{can lead to a}} situation in which the height <b>of</b> the <b>rays</b> does not exceed that of fusiform cell storeys. A storeyed arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> is thus formed. The maintenance of a given arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> in successive annual growths is the result of the cumulation of several traits, such as: 1) the seriation <b>of</b> <b>rays,</b> 2) the magnitude of grain inclination, 3) the rate of the {{restructuring of}} the cell arrangement. For example, the quicker a storeyed arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> will be formed the less the rays are seriated, the quicker the cells are restructured and the greater the inclination of their arrangement. The magnitude of the inclination of the grain and the rate of cell restructuring are traits connected with the arrangement of fusiform cells. The seriate nature <b>of</b> <b>rays,</b> however, is characteristic <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> and, moreover, it is a characteristic individual trait. It seems that the seriation <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> can play a valuable role in taxonomic analysis...|$|R
