To identify novel <b>chemical</b> <b>scaffolds</b> active on this enzyme, two pharmacophore models for acidic mPGES- 1 inhibitors were developed and theoretically validated using information on mPGES- 1 inhibitors from literature. The models were used to screen chemical databases supplied from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Specs. Out of 29 compounds selected for biological evaluation, nine chemically diverse compounds caused concentration-dependent inhibition of mPGES- 1 activity in a cell-free assay with IC 50 values between 0. 4 and 7. 9 μM, respectively. Further pharmacological characterization revealed that also 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) was inhibited by most of these active compounds in cell-free and cell-based assays with IC 50 values in the low micromolar range.

Their tyrosinase-inhibitory activities were evaluated against mushroom tyrosinase at 50 µM, and five of the PDTM derivatives (PDTM 3, PDTM 7 –PDTM 9, and PDTM 13) were found to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase more than kojic acid or arbutin, the positive controls. Of seventeen PDTMs, PDTM 3 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration 13. 94 ± 1. 76 µM), with a 2, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl moiety, exhibited greatest inhibitory effects (kojic acid half-maximal inhibitory concentration 18. 86 ± 2. 14 µM). Interestingly, PDTM compounds with no hydroxyl group, PDTM 7 –PDTM 9, also had stronger inhibitory activities than kojic acid. In silico studies of interactions between tyrosinase and the five PDTMs suggested their binding affinities were closely related to their tyrosinase-inhibitory activities. Cell-based experiments performed using B 16 F 10 mouse-skin melanoma cells showed that PDTM 3 effectively inhibited melanogenesis and cellular tyrosinase activity. A cell-viability study conducted using B 16 F 10 cells indicated that the antimelanogenic effect of PDTM 3 was not attributable to its cytotoxicity. Kinetic studies showed PDTM 3 competitively inhibited tyrosinase, indicating binding to the tyrosinase-active site.

40|$|In recent years, the {{neglected}} diseases {{drug discovery}} community has elected phenotypic screening {{as the key}} approach for the identification of novel hit compounds. However, when this approach is applied, important questions related to the mode of action for these compounds remain unanswered. One of such questions {{is related to the}} rate of action, a useful piece of information when facing the challenge of prioritising the most promising hit compounds. In the present work, compounds of the "Leishmania donovani box" were evaluated using a rate of action assay adapted from a replicative intracellular high content assay recently developed. The potency of each compound was determined every 24 hours up to 96 hours, and standard drugs amphotericin B and miltefosine were used as references to group these compounds according to their rate of action. Independently of this biological assessment, compounds were also clustered according to their minimal <b>chemical</b> <b>scaffold.</b> Comparison of the results showed a complete correlation between the <b>chemical</b> <b>scaffold</b> and the biological group {{for the vast majority of}} compounds, demonstrating how the assay was able to bring information on the rate of action for each chemical series, a property directly linked to the mode of action.

40|$|Snyder-Robinson Syndrome (SRS) {{is a rare}} mental {{retardation}} disorder which {{is caused by the}} malfunctioning of an enzyme, the spermine synthase (SMS), which functions as a homo-dimer. The malfunctioning of SMS in SRS patients is associated with several identified missense mutations that occur away from the active site. This investigation deals with a particular SRS-causing mutation, the G 56 S mutation, which was shown computationally and experimentally to destabilize the SMS homo-dimer and thus to abolish SMS enzymatic activity. As a proof-of-concept, we explore the possibility to restore the enzymatic activity of the malfunctioning SMS mutant G 56 S by stabilizing the dimer through small molecule binding at the mutant homo-dimer interface. For this purpose, we designed an in silico protocol that couples virtual screening and a free binding energy-based approach to identify potential small-molecule binders on the destabilized G 56 S dimer, with the goal to stabilize it and thus to increase SMS G 56 S mutant activity.
