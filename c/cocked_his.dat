5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.|$|E
500|$|Tecumseh {{launched}} an [...] "impassioned rebuttal", but Harrison {{was unable to}} understand his language. A Shawnee friendly to Harrison <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh's speech was leading to trouble. Some witnesses reported that Tecumseh was encouraging the warriors to kill Harrison. Many of the warriors began to pull their weapons, representing a substantial threat to Harrison and the town, which held a population of only 1,000. Harrison pulled his sword. Tecumseh's warriors backed down after the officers had pulled their firearms in defense of Harrison. Chief Winnemac, who was friendly to Harrison, countered Tecumseh's arguments and told the warriors that since they had come in peace, they should return home in peace. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the treaty were nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British. After the meeting, Tecumseh journeyed to meet {{with many of the}} tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation to battle the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Tecumseh {{launched}} an [...] "impassioned rebuttal", but Harrison {{was unable to}} understand his language. A Shawnee who was friendly to Harrison <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh's speech was leading to trouble. Finally, an army lieutenant who could speak Tecumseh's language warned Harrison that he was encouraging the warriors with him to kill Harrison. Many of the warriors began to pull their weapons and Harrison pulled his sword. The entire town's population was only 1,000 and Tecumseh's men could have easily massacred the town, but once the few officers pulled their guns to defend Harrison, the warriors backed down. Chief Winnemac, who was friendly to Harrison, countered Tecumseh's arguments to the warriors and instructed them that because they had come in peace, they should return in peace and fight another day. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the treaty was nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British.|$|E

2500|$|On November 18, 1933, Michigan played Bernie Bierman's Minnesota Golden Gophers. [...] Like the Illini {{two weeks}} earlier, Minnesota had {{two weeks to}} prepare for the Wolverines {{following}} a bye week. [...] The game ended in a scoreless tie. [...] Each team attempted three passes, and neither team completed any. [...] Two of Michigan's three pass attempts were intercepted by Minnesota. [...] Bierman's Golden Gophers also held Michigan to 58 rushing yards. [...] Michigan's best scoring opportunity was set up by a Statue of Liberty play in which Bill Renner dropped back to pass and <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> arm to throw. [...] Stanley Fay ran behind Renner and took the ball from Renner's extended hand. [...] Fay ran around the end and eluded one tackler before being tackled by Vernal Levoir and Pug Lund at the Gophers' 30-yard line. [...] Michigan was unable to penetrate further. [...] Minnesota gained 132 yards on the ground, mostly by left halfback Pug Lund. [...] In the third quarter, Lund ran for a 42-yard gain, and in the fourth quarter, he ran from kick formation, taking the ball to Michigan's 38-yard line. [...] Two plays later, Minnesota fullback Vernal Levoir took the ball to Michigan's 16-yard line. [...] When Michigan held Minnesota on three plays, Bill Bevan attempted a field goal from the 25-yard line. [...] The kick went wide, and Minnesota's best scoring chance was lost.|$|E
