40|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests are}} among the most frequently requested panels of <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>tests.</b> A liver function panel typically includes the assessment of plasma / serum total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, total protein and albumin. The main pitfall in the interpretation of liver function tests relates to the misconception that the individual test analytes are biologically specific to the hepatobiliary system. Although none of the analytes are absolutely specific for liver tissues, when they are considered collectively as a panel, particular patterns of abnormalities are indeed reflective of certain sub-groups of hepatobiliary pathologies. In this Case Conference, the biochemical profiles forming a series of clinical cases are used to illustrate the principles in the appropriate interpretation of the liver function tests. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Methods for the {{interpretation}} of veterinary clinical biochemistry have not developed as rapidly as biochemical technology. However, the results of <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>tests</b> are only of value when they are interpreted appropriately. A retrospective study was undertaken to investigate the equine biochemistry data which had been stored in a veterinary hospital database. By applying percentile analysis and Bayesian probability methods to the clinical biochemistry and corresponding diagnosis data, a novel method for {{the interpretation}} of clinical biochemistry data has been developed. The method allows clinicians {{to determine whether a}} biochemistry value is abnormal, its degree of abnormality, and the most likely associated diagnoses. The method could be used to investigate a practice-based population and may have significant implications for {{the interpretation of}} clinical biochemistry data in veterinary medicine in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to examine the {{toxicity}} and target organs of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) after repeated oral administration in Sprague-Dawley rats for 6 weeks (3 administrations, once every 2 weeks). OCV is an inactivated oral cholera vaccine that contains Vibrio cholerae and confers protection against cholera caused by V. cholera serogroups O 1 (Inaba and Ogawa serotypes) and O 139 (strain 4260 B). The animals were orally admin-istered either OCV placebo (negative control) or OCV at a dose equivalent to 240 times the anticipated human dose. Throughout the administration period, no significant change was detected in clinical signs, body weight, food or water consumption, urinalysis results, hematological and <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>test</b> results, organ weights, necropsy, or histopathological examination results. Minor changes were found in hematological and clinical bio-chemistry tests; however, these changes were within normal ranges. The above results suggest that oral adminis-tration of OCV in rats did not induce any toxicologically meaningful changes, and the target organs could not be determined. This {{study was conducted in}} accordance with the guidelines established by Good Laboratory Prac...|$|R
40|$|Attempting {{to reduce}} the number of {{unnecessary}} tests requested, we initiated a program providing continuous feedback to clinicians concerning their requesting patterns of <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> laboratory <b>tests.</b> At four-week intervals each medical specialist received data showing the number and costs of tests requested by all members of his team, the number of patients who had tests, and various related information. Comparative summaries, in frequency-histogram format, of the number of specimens submitted and the costs involved allowed each medical specialist to rate his own performance against that of his peers.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for a <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>test</b> request form are reviewed. The {{interaction between the}} configuration of the main analysers and the number of individual tests, or profiles, that are ordered using different request form formats were monitored for three-month periods over a three-year period while the main analysers were being "reconfigured" or replaced. Although there was a significant increase in orders for individual tests (compared to profile requests) required on outpatients this did not occur with the inpatient ordering pattern. Instead, the numbers of discretionary tests dropped and more miniprofiles [...] for example, the electrolyte group, were ordered, although the total number of profiles (per patient day) did not increase because the "electrolyte-urea-creatinine" profile numbers markedly decreased during rhe period of the study. This shift in ordering patterns was assumed to be due to the faster turnaround of "priority" (emergency) test requests which could, due to improved instrumentation, be analysed as quickly as individual test requests. Glucose was dropped from the major profile and the numbers of discretionary glucose requests did not increase. It was concluded that, providing this single test can be performed efficiently, {{there is no need for}} glucose to be included in test profiles...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} costing <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>tests</b> as a {{component}} of the commissioning of a unit management budgeting system based on an International Computers Limited (ICL) minicomputer system was examined. Methods of apportioning consumable and labour costs under direct and indirect cost headings and as test and request charges were investigated, and in this currently operational system it was found that 38 % of consumable costs and 57 % of labour costs were not a direct component of the routine analysis function. Means of assigning test costs to a given request source and the incorporation of such charges into clinical budget statements were looked at. A reduction in laboratory workload did not produce a comparable reduction in laboratory costs. For a theoretical reduction in workload of 20 % only a 3. 8 % laboratory saving in recoverable costs could be expected...|$|E
40|$|A CAJM {{evaluation}} on {{cost per}} test of <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>tests</b> done {{in one of}} Zimbabwe's major referral hospitals. In many countries, including Zimbabwe, there is increasing concern at the high and increasing cost of providing quality healthcare to the community. Pathology services represent about 25 % of this expenditure. However, {{little is known about}} the actual cost to the Pathology Department of performing any individual pathology service or test. The health care market in Zimbabwe is characterised by a dominant public sector in both provision and financing of health services. Hongoro and Kumaranayake estimated that, in 1993, about 92 % of health services in the country were provided by public institutions. In Zimbabwe, the rise in the cost of providing pathology services has been further exacerbated by perennial foreign currency constraints. This has resulted in regular increases in the cost of laboratory consumables since most of these are imported. As pressure on scarce resources mounts, there is need for a greater focus on the use of cost and cost effectiveness information to guide policy formulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{total number}} of routine <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>tests</b> {{requested}} for patients admitted to a coronary care unit with a diagnosis of "query myocardial infarction" were recorded over four to eight months. There were 156 sequential admissions in a British teaching hospital and 163 in a Canadian counterpart; the incidence of confirmed myocardial infarction was 53 % and 50 %, respectively. The pattern of tests ordered was substantially similar in each unit, unlike the rate of testing. For example, total creatine kinase was requested five times less often per patient in the British hospital than in the Canadian unit in cases of confirmed myocardial infarction (2. 17 and 10. 17, respectively; p less than 0. 0001) : the difference was much less, but still significant, {{when there was no}} infarction (2. 01 and 3. 55; p less than 0. 0001). This study suggests a significant international difference in the use of clinical biochemistry services between coronary care units.

40|$|Congenital and {{acquired}} modifications of glycosylation in diseases are {{a rapidly growing}} field that demonstrates the importance of glycosylation in human biology. Unfortu-nately, in <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry,</b> very few <b>tests</b> are available to explore oligosaccharide metabolism on a large scale.

In the present study, we describe a method to analyze qualitative variations of N-glycosylation of human serum proteins. The method is based on direct release of N-linked oligosaccharides from patient serum samples, a sin-gle-step purification, and a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometric analysis.

40|$|Age-specific {{paediatric}} reference intervals {{are used}} in interpretation of laboratory results. However, interpretation may be problematic when a child just crosses an age bracket {{and the difference between}} the original and the subsequent age-specific reference interval is large. Moreover, details about the physiological changes with age may be masked. For the 12 months ending 30 September 2013, results of 16 common <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>tests</b> of ambulatory paediatric patients aged 0 - 19, requested by primary care physicians, were retrospectively collected in a large pathology service, and used to construct smoothed centile charts using a penalised maximum likelihood method. From the developed centile charts, the concentrations of sodium, bicarbonate, creatinine, urate, total protein, and albumin all increased with increasing age of the children. In contrast, the concentrations of potassium, chloride, anion gap, calcium, phosphate and lactate dehydrogenase decreased with increasing age of the children. Changes in the concentrations of urea, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, and total cholesterol varied by age. Generally, the boys and girls shared similar trend patterns until 10 - 15 years of age, when variations in the age of onset of puberty and development caused the trends of some biochemical measures to differ. The paediatric biochemistry centile charts are intuitive tools to use. They complement age-specific reference intervals in the tracking, interpretation and discussion of laboratory results. They also enhance the understanding of underlying physiological changes in biochemistry in children. Tze Ping Loh, Georgia Antoniou, Peter Baghurst, Michael P. Met...|$|E
40|$|Background: Most {{medical school}} {{curricula}} {{have reduced the}} amount of time available for teaching in pathology despite the fact that junior staff {{in the early stages of}} their training were responsible for requesting the majority of pathology tests on acutely ill hospital patients. So, the lack of specific training in this area means that test requesting may be poorly performed and the results ill understood by these staff. This paper describes a questionnaire, which was designed to assist laboratory staff providing targeted teaching in this area. Methods: Doctors in Foundation year 1 (F 1) and Foundation year 2 (F 2) in Sheffield teaching hospitals were given a questionnaire to ascertain how confident they were in requesting and interpreting the results of <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>tests.</b> The doctors were also asked about which areas of laboratory medicine they would like to be taught. Results: Responses were received from 82 doctors, about half those in F 1 and F 2. The survey revealed areas where juniors are less confident in requesting tests and interpreting results. Despite lack of confidence in interpreting the result, 18 % were confident about requesting tests. Doctors were also unsure of the effects of common problems like haemolysis on the interpretation of results. More than 70 % of the doctors requested specific teaching in these areas. Conclusions: Foundation doctors have learning needs in clinical biochemistry, addressing which would assist them in patient care. While better training in medical school may help in future, there are specific needs for those on the wards now that require targeted teaching. Ann Clin Biochem 2008; 45 : 33 – 38.

40|$|A 50 -year-old Omani woman {{presented}} to the Outpatient Clinic, Royal Hospital, Oman with right upper abdominal pain and backache that had lasted 10 days. She had no palpitation, sweating, or hypertension (blood pressure 122 / 78 mmHg). The patient’s history revealed {{that she had a}} similar incidence of abdominal pain two months prior, which was a "dull ache" in nature and somewhat associated with headache. The pain was relieved using a mild analgesic drug. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a right adrenal mass, and both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the adrenal glands confirmed a right adrenal mass consistent with adrenal pheochromocytoma. However, <b>clinical</b> <b>biochemistry</b> <b>tests</b> revealed normal levels of plasma catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and metanephrine, which are unusual findings in adrenal pheochromocytoma. Meanwhile, the patient had markedly raised plasma normetanephrine (10 -fold) which, together with the normal metanephrine, constitutes a metabolic profile that is compatible with extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma. The patient also had markedly raised chromogranin A (16 -fold), consistent with the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor. Laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was done and the adrenal tumor was excised and retrieved in total. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of adrenal pheochromocytoma; the tumor cells being positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S- 100 protein. Following surgery, the patient did well and showed full recovery at follow-up after three months. Molecular genetic testing showed no pathogenic mutation in pheochromocytoma genes: MAX, SDHA, SDHAF 2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, VHL, and PRKAR 1 A. A review of the literature was conducted to identify the pathophysiology and any previous reports of such case. To our knowledge, this is the first report in Oman of the extremely rare entity of pheochromocytoma with an unusual clinical and biochemical scenario...|$|E
