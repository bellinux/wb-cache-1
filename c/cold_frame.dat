25|$|Temperature: Bonsai {{roots in}} pots {{are exposed to}} much greater {{variation}} in temperature than tree roots deep in the soil. For bonsai from native species, local temperatures do not generally harm the tree. But for bonsai from warmer native climates, the grower can {{increase the likelihood of}} successful cultivation either by insulating the tree from local winter conditions, or by actively increasing the bonsai temperature during the cold season. For trees from climates slightly warmer than the local one, bonsai pots can be partially buried in the ground and can be covered with an insulating layer of mulch. For trees from significantly warmer climates, warmer temperatures can be maintained in a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> or greenhouse, so that a relatively tender tree is not exposed to temperatures lower than it can bear. This approach may also artificially extend the bonsai's growing season, affecting watering and fertilization schedules.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{propagated}} by division or by seed growing.The seed is best sown in a <b>cold</b> <b>frame,</b> {{as soon as}} the capsules are ripe. Stored seed {{can also}} be sown in a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> in the Spring. Seedlings should be pricked out into small pots when large enough. They are then grown for another year in a greenhouse or <b>cold</b> <b>frame.</b> The new plants then can be planted into the ground in late spring or early summer of the 3rd year.Division is best carried out after flowering during July or August. Large clumps of plants can then be re-planted in new sites. Smaller clumps should be potted and grown in a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> until there have formed sufficient roots to survive, they then can be planted in the Spring.|$|E

40|$|Hot {{beds and}} <b>cold</b> <b>frames</b> {{are used by}} gardeners for {{propagating}} vegetables, flowers and ornamentals. Hot beds are used for starting the plants and <b>cold</b> <b>frames</b> for tempering or hardening plants to outdoor conditions before transplanting. For most home gardeners the same frame can serve both purposes. The principle {{difference between the two}} is that hot beds have a heat source. Traditionally, hot beds and <b>cold</b> <b>frames</b> were built even with or slightly below ground level and covered by glass sash. Present-day frames are often completely above ground and plastic covered because film is generally available at a reasonable cost...|$|R

50|$|Cold frames {{can be used}} {{to extend}} the growing season for many food and {{ornamental}} crops, primarily by providing increased warmth in early spring. This means that it's possible to harvest vegetable crops ahead of their normal season when they are extremely expensive to buy. Some crops suitable for growing in a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> include lettuces, parsley, salad onions, spinach, radishes and turnips etc. One vegetable crop can occupy the whole of a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> or a combination of crops can be grown so that they mature in rotation {{in order to get a}} wide range of different vegetables throughout the year from a single <b>cold</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> is a transparent-roofed enclosure, built {{low to the}} ground, used to protect plants from adverse weather, primarily excessive cold or wet. The transparent top admits sunlight and prevents heat escape via convection that would otherwise occur, particularly at night. Essentially, a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> functions as a miniature greenhouse to extend the growing season.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} centuries the mannerist garden arrangement was maintained. The symmetrical geometric parterres were enriched {{with rows of}} hornbeam with linden gazebos and dwarf fruit trees were planted (quince, cherries, apples). There were also buildings: orangery, fighouse, two greenhouses, ice house and <b>cold</b> <b>frames</b> for the cultivation of seedling plants.|$|R
50|$|The {{cultivation}} of tobacco usually takes place annually. The tobacco is germinated in <b>cold</b> <b>frames</b> or hotbeds and then transplanted {{to the field}} until it matures. It is grown in warm climates with rich, well-drained soil. About 4.2 million hectares of tobacco were under cultivation worldwide in 2000, yielding over seven million tonnes of tobacco.|$|R
50|$|Because several crops {{grown in}} the United States require {{a long period of}} growth, growing season {{extension}} practices are commonly used as well. These include various row-covering techniques, such as using <b>cold</b> <b>frames</b> and garden fabric over crops. Greenhouses are also a common practice to extend the season, particularly in elevated regions that only enjoy 90-day growing seasons.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "bulb frame" [...] is a {{specialized}} kind of <b>cold</b> <b>frame,</b> designed for growing hardy or almost hardy ornamental bulbous plants, particularly in climates with wet winters. Typically it is raised further {{above ground level}} than a normal <b>cold</b> <b>frame,</b> so that the plants can be seen better when in flower. They are often used for the cultivation of winter-growing bulbs which flower in the autumn or spring. The covers are used in winter to provide some protection from very bad weather, while allowing good ventilation. Then in the summer, the covers provide dry, warm conditions which many such bulbs need.|$|E
50|$|Belt Preheating: For {{wide strip}} casting, a belt {{preheating}} {{system can be}} used to bring the belt up to 150 °C or higher immediately prior to entering the casting mold, reducing the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>framing.</b> Induction heating coils can be used across the width to preheat each belt. In addition to preventing thermal distortion, the high preheat temperature serves to eliminate any moisture present on the belt surface.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the lost}} images are {{mentioned}} in the last episode of Ken Burns' 1990 documentary on the Civil War. Burns claims that glass plate negatives were often sold to gardeners, not for their images, but for the glass itself {{to be used in}} greenhouses and <b>cold</b> <b>frames.</b> In the years that followed the end of the war, the sun slowly burned away their filmy images and they were lost.|$|R
25|$|Most bonsai {{species are}} {{trees and shrubs}} that must by nature grow outdoors. They require temperature, humidity, and {{sunlight}} conditions approximating their native climate year round. The skill of the grower can help bonsai from outside the local hardiness zone survive and even thrive, but doing so takes careful watering, shielding of selected bonsai from excessive sunlight or wind, and possibly protection from winter conditions (e.g., {{through the use of}} <b>cold</b> <b>frames</b> or winter greenhouses).|$|R

50|$|The seed {{requires}} two {{to three}} months cold stratification and is best sown in a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> as early in winter as possible. The seed grows rather slowly and can sometimes take about 18 months to germinate depending on the conditions.|$|E
50|$|They {{can also}} be {{propagated}} by seed. Once the pods are dry on the plant, break them open to collect seeds. Then direct sow outdoors in fall (or Autumn), or winter sow in vented containers, in a <b>cold</b> <b>frame</b> or unheated greenhouse.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco is {{cultivated}} {{similarly to}} other agricultural products. Seeds were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from flea beetles (Epitrix cucumeris or E. pubescens), which caused destruction {{of half the}} tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Today, tobacco is sown in <b>cold</b> <b>frames</b> or hotbeds, as their germination is activated by light.|$|R
50|$|Cultural {{methods are}} {{agriculture}} practices {{used to enhance}} crop and livestock health and prevent weed, pest or disease problems {{without the use of}} chemical substances. Examples include the selection of appropriate varieties and planting sites; selection of appropriate breeds of livestock; providing livestock facilities designed to meet requirements of species or type of livestock; proper timing and density of plantings; irrigation; and extending a growing season by manipulating the microclimate with green houses, <b>cold</b> <b>frames,</b> or wind breaks.|$|R
50|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, row cover is any transparent or semi-transparent, flexible material, like fabric or plastic sheeting, {{used as a}} protective covering to shield plants, usually vegetables, primarily from the undesirable effects of cold and wind, and also from insect damage. In addition to reducing the drying effect of wind, row cover can provide {{a limited amount of}} warming by the same effect that <b>cold</b> <b>frames,</b> greenhouses, and polytunnels produce, creating a microclimate for the plants.|$|R
