5|$|The Miss Gay America is a {{national}} pageant for female impersonators. Established in 1972, the pageant {{is based on the}} Miss America contest and follows a similar format.

5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the newly minted Gang of Seven, railed against what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking scandal and Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 <b>check</b> <b>to</b> the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{remained}} inactive for {{the next}} half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip's Bay. The British quickly occupied the city. On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the fire Nathan Hale was executed for spying. Although American troops delivered an unexpected <b>check</b> <b>to</b> the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington. Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Nightclub hypnotist Ronald Pellar, {{also known}} as Ronald Dante or Dr. Dante (1969–1972). The couple met in 1969 in a Los Angeles discotheque and married that same year. After about six months of marriage, Pellar {{disappeared}} {{a few days after}} Turner had written a $35,000 <b>check</b> <b>to</b> him in order to help him in an investment; he used the money for other purposes. In addition, she later accused Dante of stealing $100,000 worth of jewelry from her. Dante denied that he stole from Turner and no charges were ever filed against him.|$|E

5|$|On 21 October 2013, Grabner was {{suspended}} for two games for an illegal <b>check</b> <b>to</b> the head of Carolina Hurricanes forward Nathan Gerbe. Later that season, on February 27, 2014, Grabner accomplished a rare feat, scoring two short handed goals on the same penalty kill in a 5-4 overtime win over the Toronto Maple Leafs, scoring both goals in a span of 46 seconds; Grabner became {{the first player to}} score two shorthanded goals on the same penalty kill since Ryan O'Reilly did it on February 2, 2010. However, O'Reilly scored two on a four-minute penalty kill, while Grabner did it during a standard two minute penalty.|$|E
5|$|On Burton's first appeal, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} {{his convictions}} because venue and vicinage {{could not be}} proper in the Eastern District of Missouri on the sole ground that Burton's bank sent the <b>check</b> <b>to</b> St. Louis after he cashed it. Further, the Court cited the prejudicial refusal of jury instructions. After Burton was retried and convicted, the Court affirmed, inter alia, {{on the ground that}} the agreement between Burton and Rialto had occurred in St. Louis.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained {{command of the}} battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, {{especially with regard to}} operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not <b>check</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the experiments were authorized, or in some cases, appears not to have been aware that they were being carried out.|$|E

5|$|The {{elimination}} of the paper checks from the clearing process saves the banking and treasury management industries handling, sorting, transporting, storing, safeguarding, and mailing costs. After the financial institution truncates the original paper check and reconverts it to a substitute check, the financial institution can store or archive the paper check, return the paper <b>check</b> <b>to</b> its own customer according to state law, or later destroy the paper check.|$|E
5|$|The twenty-seven story Rand Tower, {{built in}} 1929, {{was the next}} major {{challenger}} to the height limit. The thirty-two story Foshay Tower, also built in 1929, was the highest building in Minneapolis until 1971. Its builder, Wilbur Foshay, wanted a tower built {{along the lines of}} the Washington Monument. He staged a lavish dedication ceremony complete with a march composed by John Philip Sousa. About six weeks later, Foshay lost his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Foshay's $20,000 <b>check</b> <b>to</b> Sousa bounced, and Sousa forbade anyone else to play the march until the debt was repaid.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error <b>check</b> <b>to</b> detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E

5|$|In game one of {{the second}} round of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Kings, Torres {{recorded}} a hit on Jarret Stoll, injuring him. The hit was an illegal <b>check</b> <b>to</b> the head and Torres was a repeat offender; therefore, on May 16, the NHL suspended Torres for the remainder of the second round, which the Sharks lost. On June 20, 2013 the Sharks announced that they had re-signed Torres to a three-year contract. In the second 2013 preseason game against the Anaheim Ducks, Torres collided with Emerson Etem, causing Torres to injure his ACL, and was out until mid-February. Torres returned to the Sharks on February 27 against the Flyers. Torres recorded three points during the Sharks' opening round, seven game loss to the Los Angeles Kings in the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs. He then missed the entire 2014–15 NHL season due to injury.|$|E
5|$|In late 1976, Bakshi {{learned that}} John Boorman was {{contracted}} to direct {{an adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, in which J. R. R. Tolkien's three-volume novel would be condensed into a single film. Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 million that had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. Down the hall from Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a <b>check</b> <b>to</b> cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to <b>check</b> <b>to</b> see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
