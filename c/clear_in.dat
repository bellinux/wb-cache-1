5|$|A Covenant army {{attacks the}} academy causing {{confusion}} and panic. Although not made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> Forward Unto Dawn, the Covenant are a theocratic collection of alien {{species that are}} religiously offended by Humanity and seek to eradicate it.

5|$|As I made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> my {{telegram}} to the FIDE delegates, {{the match}} conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs {{me that the}} rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{modified}} aerosol generator, white mice and calves {{were exposed to}} aerosols of viable Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella haemolytica and the clearance of the inhaled organisms by the lungs of the experimental animals was measured. Fifty-seven percent of inhaled S. aureus were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> two hours by the mouse lungs, 79 % were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> four hours and 93 % were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> eight hours. Fifty-six percent of inhaled P. haemolytica were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> two hours by the mouse lungs, 76 % were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> four hours and 93 % were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> eight hours. Seventy percent of inhaled S. aureus were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> two hours by the calf lungs, 90 % were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> four hours and 95 % were <b>cleared</b> <b>in</b> eight hours.

5000|$|Deanshanger used to {{be called}} Daneshanger, [...] "Shanger" [...] being an old English word, meaning a <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> the woods - hence Daneshanger was a <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> the woods where the Danes lived.|$|R
5|$|Djokovic's {{dominance}} {{contributed to}} an overall control by the Big Four. They all reached the semifinals at two of the year's Grand Slam events, and amongst them won every Masters tournament. Nadal was <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> second place behind Djokovic, winning Roland Garros and losing in both the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open final. Nadal ended {{the season with a}} 0â€“6 losing record against Djokovic: every match they played was a championship final.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{also gave}} credit to Elizabeth Sanders, Phipps' granddaughter and {{literary}} executor, for her skillful {{handling of the}} last two volumes. The purpose of the work becomes even more apparent and direct under her management and editing of the material. The role of the future marshals becomes more <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> the campaigns of 1797, and especially in the Italian campaign; her handling of the material kept it fully focused on the future marshals Massena, Augereau, Berthier, and Brune.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
2500|$|In German {{the word}} Lichtung means a <b>clearing,</b> as <b>in,</b> for example, a <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> the woods. Since its root is the German word for light (Licht), it is {{sometimes}} also translated as [...] "lighting," [...] and in Heidegger's work {{it refers to the}} necessity of a <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> which anything at all can appear, the <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> which some thing or idea can show itself, or be unconcealed. Note the relation that this has to Aletheia (see the main article or the entry above) and disclosure.|$|R

Following her last course of chemotherapy, Ruth returned to work on the farm and was later given the all <b>clear.</b> <b>In</b> 2002, Ruth became pregnant and gave birth to her third child, Ben (Thomas Lester).|$|E
5|$|Under Section 16, the Act {{applies to}} {{servants}} of the crown, while Section 17 repeals all previous common law and statutory offences relating to bribery, {{replacing them with}} provisions of the Act. Section 18 provides that the Act applies to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; while the separate consent of the Scottish Parliament is usually required in such cases, as is made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> Section 19, a Legislative Consent Motion was passed on 11 February 2010, allowing {{for the application of}} the Act within Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{classical}} figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any {{specific set of}} rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular. In comparison with Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> his methodology. Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for {{the primacy of the}} material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s that the library had outgrown its {{existing}} building, the school initially hired an architect who proposed a traditional {{design for the}} new building. Deciding instead to construct a library with a contemporary design, the school gave the commission to Louis Kahn in 1965. The library was opened in 1971. In 1997 the library received the Twenty-five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects, an award that recognizes architecture of enduring significance that is given {{to no more than}} one building per year.|$|E
5|$|William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland made it <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> a {{communication}} with the proprietor of the Dublin Daily Express {{that he would not}} allow an armed expedition of hundreds of men, as the committee was planning, and that 50 unarmed men would be sufficient to harvest the crops. He said that the government would consider it their duty to protect this group. On 10 November 1880, the relief expedition consisting of one contingent from County Cavan and one from County Monaghan left for County Mayo. Additional troops had already arrived in County Mayo to protect the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad had a {{distinctive}} Syrian iconography, which is <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> the seals of the kings that gave prominence to the Syrian gods. Egyptian influence was minimal and {{limited to the}} ankh, which cannot be interpreted as an emulation of Egyptian rituals but rather as merely {{a substitute for the}} cup held by the deity elsewhere. Yamhad had a special pattern of trim called the Yamhad style, which was favored in Mari during the reign of king Zimri-Lim, whose queen Shibtu was the daughter of Yarim-Lim I.|$|E

5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> 1922 {{that he would}} never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made clear that he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis groupâ€“indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. Reddish tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or reddish. There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E

5|$|Although having reached legal {{retirement}} age in 1927, and thus unable {{to be offered}} another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed {{on an annual basis}} each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that she was glad to leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make <b>clear.</b> <b>In</b> 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal, renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al-Ajjul, a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity â€“ this problem was especially <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E
5|$|Code: Veronicas story, setting, {{and artistic}} design strayed {{away from the}} series standard. While {{previous}} games are set in the United States and have a corresponding American feel to them, Code: Veronica {{is set in the}} Southern Ocean and Antarctica and carries a European gothic horror inspired design. This is made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> the environments which features gothic architecture and art in addition to central European carvings and German-style weaponry. In addition, the gothic feel is emphasized through the story. The horror in Code: Veronica is driven by this story which follows a crazed man and the fate of his noble bloodline. The story is told partly through a lullaby, and this method of story telling is intended to bring out European operatic undertones. This contrasts to previous games in the series which were driven by the panic elements from American horror films, such as monsters and zombies. With regards to managing the art staff, Mikami split them up depending on their interests. Those interested in guns worked solely on gun designs while those interested in environments were sent to photograph houses and castles for research.|$|E
