40|$|In city area, {{electromagnetic}} interference caused by buildings {{is a very}} important problem. For example, a well known ghost phenomenon is caused by interaction between incident and reflected waves caused due to the presence of large and tall buildings. The characteristics of the radio waves used in television broad casting absorption have been measured by coaxial-wave-guide unit or curtain wall specimens. But these measurements have some demerits. In this regards, a new measurement technique by panel specimen using parallel wire line was proposed recently. The <b>electric</b> <b>wave</b> absorption characteristics of the reinforcing rod inside the reinforced concrete structures are examined using the recently proposed technique. A reinforcing rod in horizontal direction influences <b>electric</b> <b>wave</b> absorption characteristics of the concrete. In this paper, an equation for calculation of average <b>electric</b> <b>wave</b> absorption of concrete structures in presence of reinforcement is proposed taking care of the effect of the distribution of the reinforcement.

The feedback between antibody and antibody producing cell is done via messenger molecules that are also communicating with help of longitudinal <b>electric</b> <b>waves.</b> These messenger molecules transfer information from antibody arms and are informing cells whether the epitopes are switched on or off.

5000|$|A magnet induces <b>circular</b> <b>electric</b> {{currents}} {{in a metal}} sheet moving past it. See the diagram at right. It shows a metal sheet (C) moving to the right under a stationary magnet. The magnetic field (B, green arrows) of the magnet's north pole N passes down through the sheet. Since the metal is moving, the magnetic flux through the sheet is changing. At {{the part of the}} sheet under {{the leading edge of the}} magnet (left side) the magnetic field through the sheet is increasing as it gets nearer the magnet, [...] From Faraday's law of induction, this creates a <b>circular</b> <b>electric</b> field in the sheet in a counterclockwise direction around the magnetic field lines. This field induces a counterclockwise flow of electric current (I, red), in the sheet. This is the eddy current. At the trailing edge of the magnet (right side) the magnetic field through the sheet is decreasing, , inducing a second eddy current in a clockwise direction in the sheet.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the diraction problem in a transversely isotropic piezoelectric medium by a half-plane. The half-plane obstacle considered here is a semi-innite slit, or a crack; both its surfaces are traction free and electric absorbent screens. In a generalized sense, we are dealing with the Sommerfeld problem in a piezoelectric medium. The coupled diraction elds between acoustic <b>wave</b> and <b>electric</b> <b>wave</b> are excited by both incident acoustic wave as well as incident electric wave; and the sound soft and electric " conditions on the screens are characterized by a system of simultaneous Wiener-Hopf equations. Closed form solutions are sought by employing special techniques. Some interesting results have been obtained, such as mode conversions between acoustic <b>wave</b> and <b>electric</b> <b>wave,</b> novel diraction patterns in the scattering elds, and the eect of electroacoustic head wave, as well as of surface wave|Bleustein-Gulyaev wave. Unlike the classical Sommerfeld problem, in which the only concern is the scattering eld of <b>electric</b> <b>wave,</b> the strength of material, e. g. material toughness, is another concern here. From this perspective, relevant dynamic eld intensity factors at the crack tip are derived explicitly...|$|R

50|$|Macdonald {{worked on}} <b>electric</b> <b>waves</b> and solved {{difficult}} problems regarding diffraction of these waves by summing series of Bessel functions. He corrected his 1903 {{solution to the}} problem of a perfectly conducting sphere embedded in an infinite homogeneous dielectric in 1904 after a subtle error was pointed out by Poincaré. The major problem which he tackled was that of wireless waves. About the time that Macdonald published his prize winning essay on <b>electric</b> <b>waves,</b> Guglielmo Marconi was successful in the transmission of the first wireless signals across the Atlantic. However this posed a major problem at first because wireless signals, like light, should not be capable of being bent round the surface of the earth as apparently Marconi wireless signals were. Macdonald suggested that the wireless waves were being refracted by the atmosphere. It is now known that in fact the waves are reflected by the ionosphere.|$|R
