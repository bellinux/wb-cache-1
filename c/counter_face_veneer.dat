30|$|This {{study used}} a {{vibration}} test method {{to show that}} grain angles of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> have substantial effects on sound velocities and dynamic Young’s moduli of three types of wood-based composites. The sound velocity at 0 ° grain angle of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> was the highest, and it decreased with increasing grain angle {{in the range of}} 0 ° to 90 °. This tendency was similar to that for dynamic Young’s modulus. The relationship between the grain angle of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> and the sound velocity of three types of wood-based composites can be expressed in the form of Hankinson’s equation or a second-order parabolic equation. This study also showed that the application of orthotropic elasticity theory was valid for the three types of wood-based composites. The relationship between the grain angle of the <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> and the Young’s modulus of three types of wood-based composites can be expressed {{in the form of the}} Jenkin equation, Hankinson’s equation, or a second-order parabolic equation.

30|$|The {{effects of}} grain angle of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> on surface wave {{velocity}} and dynamic shear modulus of {{three types of}} wood-based composites were examined using a surface wave propagation method. It was found that grain-angle dependence of surface wave velocity and dynamic shear modulus indeed exists for wood-based composites. Grain angles of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> {{were found to have}} substantial effects on the surface wave velocities and dynamic shear moduli of wood–plastic composite (WP), wood–fiberboard composite (WF), and wood–metal composite (WM). The orthotropic properties of the three composites were defined as the ratio of surface wave velocities at 0 ° and 90 ° grain angles (V 0 /V 90), which were 3.7, 2.2, and 2.0 for WP, WF, and WM, respectively. For WP, WF, and WM, the dynamic shear moduli in the 90 ° grain angle of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> were approximately 7 %, 19 %, and 25 % of that in the 0 ° grain angle, respectively. The relationships between grain angles of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> and the shear moduli of the three types of wood-based composites could be represented by Hankinson’s equation, and their optimal n values were 2.1, 1.2, and 1.3 for WP, WF, and WM, respectively.|$|R

Experimental values were close to the theoretical relationships derived for in-plane bending strength and stiffness, tension strength, and compression strength, and for stiffness bending perpendicular to the plane of the plywood.

25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} <b>face</b> <b>veneers</b> {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|R

40|$|In Calceola sandalina {{the full}} {{complement}} of counter major septa was established very low in the calyx, extending from the counter septum across {{to the edge of}} the <b>counter</b> <b>face.</b> At about mid-height of the calyx, a counter-lateral major septum was generated on either side of and from the counter septum. Serial minor septal insertion was initiated adjacent to the counter-lateral septa at a slightly later stage and continued throughout the subsequent ontogeny of the corallite, with minor septa (schizosepta?) arising on the median side of major septa and bifurcating from them. Alar fossulae are seen in the calyx of mature corallites, on the counter side of a low ridge near the lateral extremity of the inner surface of the <b>counter</b> <b>face.</b> Insertion of major septa in the alar fossula has been observed rarely on the external <b>counter</b> <b>face</b> of worn corallites. The median septum in the operculum of C. sandalina is a compound structure which incorporates adjacent minor septa. In an Emsian(?) corallite of ?Chakeola sp. minor septa are derived from major septa, new minor septa being generated on the outer side of major septa. This corallite also exhibits minor septa adjacent to the K septum, thus casting doubt on Birenheide’s generalisation that the counter-lateral septa of C. sandalina are not separated from the counter septum by minor septa. In the Emsian Chakeola whitehousei minor septa are present adjacent to the counter septum of the operculum. The distal, anteriorly facing, projecting peg of the K septum of the corallite articulated within the large socket in the opercular K septum, and subsidiary grooves and plates on the socket and septum further facilitated interlocking. Knobs and/or small lists are developed along the posterior edge of the operculum, in the shelf inside the counter edge; septal pegs developed by septa in the corallite were accommodated within this shelf. The opercular septal blades interlocked loosely between the anteriorly facing, distal parts of septa of the corallite. Rare opercula show one or more (abortive?) attempts to overcome damage which led to displacement of the operculum relative to the corallite, and rejuvenescence is exhibited to various degrees in many opercula. One operculum was apparently broken (bitten?) in half as a juvenile, but was reconstructed to reach a mature form. Other specimens show epifauna, borings and bioerosion either on the external surface of the operculum or on the external cardinal surface of the corallite. ‘Galls’ on the inner opercular surface are interpreted as stereome deposited to seal off some type of internal parasite. In C. sandalina, tubules containing tabulae are located just inside the <b>counter</b> <b>face,</b> and may have served to house soft parts associated with the operculum.

Experimental results showed that the type of counterface material greatly influences both interface temperature and friction coefficient.
