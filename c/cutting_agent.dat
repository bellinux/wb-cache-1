40|$|Summary/Abstract Street-seized {{crack cocaine}} samples are cut with diverse {{impurities}} {{which may be}} very harmful to health. Harm reduction experts say that interventions are urgently needed to reduce the harmful behaviours associated with drug abuse. In this multidisciplinary approach, a successful intervention, Promoting Inhaled Pleasure Easily and Safely (PIPES), has been designed and tested in pilot studies. PIPES informs crack smokers about the crack sample content, efficiency of crack delivery, and the harms associated with different home-made smoking tools and <b>cutting</b> <b>agents.</b> Crack samples were profiled by spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. In an attempt to track crack sources, PCA of the 1 H NMR spectroscopic data clustered samples of similar contents together. A laboratory crack smoking model was optimised to measure the emitted and recovered doses of cocaine and <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> from common crack smoking devices. Seized samples contained 24 % cocaine base and 32 % phenacetin. A medical inhaler delivered the highest dose of cocaine and phenacetin into the apparatus, then a glass pipe (shooter), and then tin cans. The analytical results and the harms associated with each smoking device and toxic phenacetin were used to design PIPES, an educational intervention that was delivered by harm reduction workers to crack smokers. Users showed: {{a lack of knowledge}} of <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> and the harms associated with different pipes and <b>cutting</b> <b>agents,</b> their reasons for sharing pipes, and their attitudes to share knowledge and receive more information about <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> and pipes. The results of this applied research should be more widely known and used...|$|R

40|$|Forensic {{laboratories}} mainly {{focus on}} the qualification and the quantitation of the illicit drug under analysis as both aspects are used for judiciary purposes. Therefore, information related to <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> (adulterants and diluents) detected in illicit drugs is limited in the forensic literature. This article discusses the type and frequency of adulterants and diluents detected in more than 6000 cocaine specimens and 3000 heroin specimens, confiscated in western Switzerland from 2006 to 2014. The results show a homogeneous and quite unchanging adulteration for heroin, while for cocaine it could be characterised as heterogeneous and relatively dynamic. Furthermore, {{the results indicate that}} dilution affects more cocaine than heroin. Therefore, the results provided by this study tend to reveal differences between the respective structures of production or distribution of cocaine and heroin. This research seeks to promote the systematic analysis of <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> by forensic laboratories. Collecting and processing data related to the presence of <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> in illicit drug specimens produces relevant information to understand and to compare the structure of illicit drug markets...|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} {{analysis of}} illicit {{drugs and the}} associated impurity profiling can contribute to a harm reduction approach. Impurities in illicit drugs represent a complex problem that requires detailed and reproducible analysis, in part because <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> are not often reported by the forensic science community. This research project is focussed on characterising Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and determining their purity/impurity (adulteration) employing {{a wide range of}} spectroscopic and chromatographic methods, mainly NMR spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry. Another aim is to develop a routine, rapid, and quantitative analytical protocol to identify illicit drugs and their impurities (<b>cutting</b> <b>agents)</b> in seized street samples. These two major aims were achieved. A comprehensive, but critical review of the current literature is provided with respect to the analytical chemistry aspects of illicit drugs and especially their <b>cutting</b> <b>agents.</b> This literature review has a focus on the global concern arising from the current and continuing emergence of NPS and their diverse public health effects. Evidence is provided of illegal drugs, mainly so-called “legal highs” (NPS), from detailed analysis of the contents of amnesty bins and their adulterants provided by the Police from a Bristol night club and from the 2013 Glastonbury music festival, besides other samples they had seized. An accurate chemical assignment of flephedrone regioisomers is made and compared with mephedrone. Impurity profiling of street mephedrone and ketamine samples and their adulterants is presented. A possible link between mephedrone samples is investigated by applying PCA and HCA statistical methods to the 1 H NMR data...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis of illicit materials using Raman spectroscopy is of widespread interest {{for law enforcement}} and healthcare applications. One of the difficulties faced when analysing illicit mixtures {{is the fact that}} the narcotic can be mixed with many different <b>cutting</b> <b>agents.</b> This obviously complicates the development of quantitative analytical methods. In this work we demonstrate some preliminary efforts to try and account for the wide variety of potential <b>cutting</b> <b>agents,</b> by discrimination between the target substance and a wide range of excipients. Near-infrared Raman spectroscopy (785 nm excitation) was employed to analyse 217 samples, a number of them consisting of a target analyte (acetaminophen) mixed with excipients of different concentrations by weight. The excipients used were sugars (maltose, glucose, lactose, sorbitol), inorganic materials (talcum powder, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium sulphate), and food products (caffeine, flou). The spectral data collected was subjected to a number of pre-treatment statistical methods including first derivative and normalisation transformations, to make the data more suitable for analysis. Various methods were then used to discriminate the target analytes, these included Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Support Vector Machines...|$|R
40|$|Cocaine {{chemical}} profiling {{can provide}} relevant information {{for law enforcement}} authorities. Since 2006, Brazilian Federal Police {{has been working on}} its own cocaine impurity profiling program (PeQui project). In the effort to establish chemical profiling routines, this work describes major component results (cocaine purity, degree of oxidation and pharmaceutical products used as <b>cutting</b> <b>agents),</b> identified by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) analysis of 210 samples seized in several Brazilian states between 2009 and 2012. The mean purity of cocaine was 71 % (expressed as base) and the degree of oxidation, determined by the relative content between cis/trans-cinnamoylcocaine and cocaine, depends on the location where the seizures were performed. Most of the not oxidized samples were seized on traditional cocaine producer country border states. Cocaine is mainly present in free base form (59 %) and more than 50 % of the analyzed samples did not have any major adulterant. Among the identified <b>cutting</b> <b>agents,</b> phenacetin was the most abundant (30 % of the total samples). Levamisole, caffeine and lidocaine were also identified. The PeQui project has been used on regular basis to provide technical and scientifically based information to law enforcement intelligence analysis and statistical data that might contribute to the better understanding of the cocaine trafficking...|$|R

An analytical methodology enabling through one single GC-MS injection the determination of the added <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> (adulterants and diluents), the cocaine purity and the chemical profile (based on the major and minor alkaloids) for each specimen was thus implemented and validated.

40|$|Apart from routine {{analysis}} of total morphine content {{required by the}} criminal justice system, quantification of other major components in illicit heroin has not been considered by the Malaysian enforcement laboratory. In order to quantify various other <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> in addition to alkaloids, a gas chromatographic (GC) method was developed to facilitate simultaneous quantification of eight target analytes commonly found in illicit heroin seized in Malaysia within a 12 min run time. The validation results demonstrated high selectivity {{with the use of}} an HP Ultra 2 capillary column. Different solvents were studied and methanol:chloroform (1 : 9) proved best for sample dissolution. The method was repeatable and reproducible. The study ranges covering 50 - 150 % of the preferred concentrations of the eight analytes obtained r(2) > 0. 9997. Limits of detection up to 6 μg/mL were also obtained and the method achieved 99 - 102 % recovery.

50|$|Levamisole has {{increasingly}} {{been used as}} a <b>cutting</b> <b>agent</b> in cocaine sold around the globe with the highest incidence being in the USA. In 2008 - 2009, levamisole was found in 69% of cocaine samples seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). By April 2011, the DEA reported the adulterant was found in 82% of seizures.|$|E
50|$|When {{choosing}} a <b>cutting</b> <b>agent,</b> the drug manufacturer or dealer would ideally {{attempt to find}} a chemical that is inexpensive, easy to obtain, relatively non-toxic, and mimics the physical attributes of the drug to be adulterated. For example, if a drug is soluble in water, the preferred adulterant would also be water-soluble. Similar melting and boiling points are also important if the drug is to be smoked.|$|E
50|$|Most {{hard drugs}} are {{adulterated}} to some degree. Some street drugs {{can be as}} low as 10-15% of the active drug, with the other (85-90%) not necessarily being the <b>cutting</b> <b>agent.</b> In fact a heroin sample of only 20% purity may have no cutting agents in it at all. The other 80% may be impurities produced in the manufacturing process and substances created as by products of this process and/or degradation of the drug if improperly stored.|$|E
30|$|The ever-growing {{problem of}} drug abuse is of great concern to the society. The drugs of abuse may be {{encountered}} in forensic practice in either pure form, diluted and/or adulterated forms. The reasons {{for the presence of}} many substances as impurities, diluents or adulterants in illicit drugs are often varied. Sometimes it may be unintentional because of the imperfect and bad manufacturing and laboratory practices. Most of the time these diluents and adulterants could be added as <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> to increase the bulk, dilute, complement or enhance the effects of the drugs and to mimic the taste of a genuine drug. The evidence suggests that illicit drugs are more commonly adulterated with either neutraceuticals such as sucrose, lactose, dextrose, mannitol and vitamins or pharmaceuticals that will mimic the taste of illicit drugs such as quinine, caffeine, paracetamol and aspirin or some innocuous substances such as talc, starch, chalk and magnesium stearate (Behrman 2008) etc. On one hand the identification as well as determination of a controlled substance is important for forensic science laboratories for prosecutorial purposes {{and on the other hand}} profiling of decomposition products, side reaction products, precursors, impurities, solvents, adulterants and diluents are of prime importance to trace the geographical origin of the illicit sample.|$|R
50|$|Drug {{markets have}} changed {{considerably}} since the 1980s; greater competition, and {{a shift from}} highly structured (and thus controlled) to greatly fragmented markets, has generated competition among dealers in terms of purity. Many drugs that reach the street are now only cut at the manufacture/producer stage, {{and this may be}} more a matter of lacing the drug with another substance designed to appeal to the consumer, as opposed to simple diluents that increase the profit for the seller. The extent of cutting can vary significantly over time but for the last 15 years drugs such as heroin and cocaine have often sat at the 50% purity level. Heroin purity sitting at 50% does not mean 50% cutting agents; other adulterants could include other opiate by-products of making heroin from opium. Coomber (1997d), after having street heroin seizures from the UK re-analysed, reported that nearly 50% of the samples had no <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> present at all. This means that 50% of street heroin in the UK in 1995 had worked its way from producer to user without being cut at any stage, although other adulterants may have been present. Other research by Coomber (1997b) outlined how drug dealers have other ways of making profit without having to resort to cutting the drugs they sell.|$|R
30|$|Clandestine {{laboratories}} {{established by}} the criminals are involved in drug markets to synthesize and proliferate the abuse of controlled substances. Clandestine labs are not merely associated with the synthesis of drugs but also the explosives and chemical or biological weapons. These illegal clandestine laboratories have been found throughout the world (urban, rural, and metropolitan cities) to provide drugs of abuse to the illicit market. Some drugs of abuse reach black market by alternate trafficking routes from authentic sources in crude form (i.e., poppy from Afghanistan), while others are processed before the supply (i.e., garda from Cannabis and morphine from poppy resin). There are some other drugs with high potential for abuse and are easy to produce in clandestine laboratories like, cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, and heroin. Easy and cheap production of illicit drugs combined with high-profit margins is {{the main source of}} motivation to establish a clandestine laboratory (Frank and Sobol, 1990; Sobol, 2012). In such premises, not only the illicit drugs are synthesized from precursors, but also street level drugs produced by adding <b>cutting</b> <b>agents</b> (adulterants or diluents) in a highly pure drug to increase the bulk (Sulaiman et al., 2017). Tablets of different shapes and colors are also synthesized in order to change/mask the general appearance of a drug, {{so that it can be}} trafficked easily in disguise and sold in drug market.|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{results of}} chemical profiling by gas chromatography with {{flame ionization detector}} (GC-FID) of the main components (purity, oxidation level, and <b>cutting</b> <b>agents)</b> in 642 street cocaine samples seized in five different Brazilian States between 2011 and 2014. The analysis revealed the presence of cocaine with mean content of 49. 8 %. Freebase samples showed cocaine average content of 66. 0 %, whereas hydrochloride and not determined (n. d.) present cocaine content of 44. 5 % and 11. 8 %, respectively. Cocaine base samples show moderately (16 %) to not oxidized (81 %) levels, whereas cocaine hydrochloride samples exhibit moderate (37 %) to high (22 %) oxidation degrees. Approximately 34 % of all the analyzed samples {{did not have any}} adulterant identified. Base cocaine samples are even less adulterated (42 % uncut) with phenacetin being present in 53 % (average content of 15 %). Caffeine and lidocaine were mostly found in hydrochloride samples, while the n. d. samples show a combination of either phenacetin or a caffeine/lidocaine mixture. A mass balance approach is presented and seizures information can be combined to deliver intelligence and statistical analysis that might contribute to the understanding of street cocaine composition scenario.

40|$|An {{association}} between leukoencephalopathy, {{a disease of}} the white matter of the brain, and smoking heroin is well recognized. This paper describes 27 cases of leukoencephalopathy identified in two cities in British Columbia, Canada 2001 - 2006; {{the largest number of}} geographically and temporally defined reported cases in North America. Twenty cases of leukoencephalopathy were identified in and around Vancouver with onset dates December 2001 to July 2003; seven further cases were identified in Victoria September 2005 -August 2006. Twenty (74 %) of all cases were male, two couples were reported and eleven cases (55 %) had Asian ethnicity. One case reported smoking heroin on a single occasion and developed mild symptoms; all other cases were hospitalized. Thirteen (48 %) cases died; all had smoked heroin for a minimum of 3 years. Testing of one available heroin sample identified no substance other than common <b>cutting</b> <b>agents.</b> Although a specific etiology was not identified our study supports the theory of an intermittent exposure to a toxic agent added to the heroin or a combustion by-product. It also suggests a dose response effect rather than genetic predisposition. Collaboration with public health, health professionals, law enforcement and persons who use illegal drugs, will facilitate the early identification of cases to enable timely and complete follow-up including obtaining samples. Testing of implicated heroin samples may allow identification of the contaminant and therefore prevent further cases.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between microcrystalline tests performed on microscope slides and flat capillary tubes with inner diameters ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 7 mm {{was carried out}} to explore the appropriateness of tubes for rapid testing of suspected drugs of abuse in the laboratory {{as well as in}} the field. Tests for mephedrone, cocaine and phencyclidine were chosen as examples to investigate the handling of the capillary tubes, the influence on crystal habit, size and the effects on the limit of detection. Image stacking software was used to increase the depth of field of micrographs taken from developed microcrystals greatly enhancing the interpretability even months after carrying out the microcrystalline test. Additionally, the potential of seeding capillary tubes with a reagent was studied. Pretreatment of tubes would allow microcrystalline tests to be carried out quicker and anywhere without the necessity of taking along expensive and hazardous reagents. The sealing of capillary tubes containing developed microcrystalline tests in order to preserve results for a long period of time was successfully done by applying paraffin wax to the open ends. Finally, it was concluded that capillary tubes are suitable vessels for performing microcrystalline tests. The increased portability of the improved set-up allows tests to be safely executed outside laboratories without impairing the quality of the result. Findings were applied to six legal high samples purchased online between May and August 2011.
