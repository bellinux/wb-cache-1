25|$|It is this {{commitment}} to man's dignity and relief of humanity that inspires the Ismā'īlī Imāmat's philanthropic institutions. Giving of one's competence, sharing one's time, material or intellectual ability with those among whom one lives, for {{the relief of}} hardship, pain or ignorance is a deeply ingrained tradition which shapes the social <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ismā'īlī Muslim community.|$|E
25|$|Though Hengist and Horsa are not {{referenced}} in {{the medieval}} tales of King Arthur, some modern Arthurian tales do link them. For example, in Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy it is King Arthur who kills Hengist. In Alfred Duggan's <b>Conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King, Hengist {{plays a major role}} in the early career of Cerdic Elesing, legendary founder of the kingdom of Wessex.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{science fiction}} novel is about <b>the</b> ultimate inadequacy <b>of</b> communication {{between humans and}} other species. Tarkovsky's adaptation is a [...] "drama of grief and partial recovery" [...] concentrated upon the thoughts and <b>the</b> <b>consciences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cosmonaut scientists studying Solaris' mysterious ocean. In loyalty to the novel's complex and slow-paced narrative, Tarkovsky wanted to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the genre, viewing most of western science fiction as shallow. The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in Stalker (1979).|$|R

25|$|Initially, Italy was the European country most {{interested}} in incorporating Tunisia into its sphere of influence. Italy's strong motivation derived from the substantial number of expatriate citizens already resident there, with corresponding business investment, due to its close geography. Yet in the emerging national <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly unified (1861) Italian state, {{the establishment of a}} directly ruled colony did not then attract high-priority interest for the political agenda.|$|E
25|$|From the 17th century, {{the idea}} of {{rational}} religion and of the man as rational creature created by a reasonable benevolent and distant creature gradually came to replace the older pessimistic conception of mankind as frail and degenerate and the divinity as a vengeful and interventionist judge. Morality was increasingly internalised in the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rational individual, which {{was seen as the}} natural magistrate in every man's heart.|$|E

The same publication stated of Starr's contribution: [...] "Seeing Ringo Starr drumming and singing on stage has a joy in it that is one of the happiest feelings on earth still." [...] Ravi Shankar's role as concert instigator and the true <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UNICEF shows was also noted. Musically, The Village Voice observed, the pairing of Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan was [...] "almost as unique as the mix of Dylan and Harrison".|$|E

40|$|<b>Of</b> all <b>the</b> freedoms {{articulated}} {{within the}} Canadian Charter, the least defined {{continues to be}} freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> Discussions <b>of</b> this freedom within the secondary literature have been relatively superficial, and, to date, no Supreme Court of Canada decision has rested on freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> This {{is not to say}} that freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> has been entirely ignored. There has been some discussion <b>of</b> it within <b>the</b> case law, and particularly in relation to freedom of religion. This thesis draws upon those cases that reference freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> to construct a clearer image <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> scope and meaning of that freedom might be. In particular, the thesis seeks to define freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> within <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> Canadian law, examine how the courts have operationalized this freedom, and outline the relationship between freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> and freedom <b>of</b> religion. This thesis will also explore the relationships that have been established by the Supreme Court between freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charter – particularly freedom of expression, freedom <b>of</b> association, and <b>the</b> right to life, liberty, and security <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person. These questions are fundamentally important to understanding not only <b>the</b> individual importance <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> within <b>the</b> Charter, but also to understanding the Charter as a whole...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{ultimate}} aim <b>of</b> {{this essay}} is to suggest that conscience {{is a very important}} part of human psychology and of our moral point of view, not something that can be dismissed as merely `a part <b>of</b> Christian theology?. <b>The</b> essay begins with discussions of what might be regarded as the two most influential functional models <b>of</b> <b>conscience,</b> <b>the</b> classical Christian account <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> and <b>the</b> Freudian account <b>of</b> <b>conscience.</b> Then, using some insights from these models, and from some comparatively recent work in psychology and especially psychiatry, the author argues for a quite different model <b>of</b> <b>conscience</b> that might be called the personal integrity account <b>of</b> <b>conscience...</b>|$|R
500|$|After a day's rest, the marchers' {{main event}} on Tuesday {{was a public}} meeting in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street. Among the guest {{speakers}} was the Rev. Canon Dick Sheppard, [...] founder of the Peace Pledge Union. He told the marchers: [...] "You have so aroused the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country that things are bound to happen". Sir John Jarvis, without prior warning, then revealed plans for a steel tubes mill on the Palmers site. The impression that Jarrow's problems could be solved thus, without government action, disconcerted the listening marchers. Wilkinson commented that such plans were in the future, and were no substitute for the town's requirement for immediate government intervention.|$|E
500|$|Although Borah's career bridged two eras of reform, {{according}} to Ashby, [...] "emotionally and intellectually he belonged {{with the older}} prewar [...] America. [...] As New Deal enthusiast Edgar Kemler observed, he 'was overtaken by obsolescence at an early age'." [...] Borah wrote in 1927, {{near the end of}} a decade of tumultuous change, [...] "I cannot think of any views which I now have that I did not have before the war." [...] In 1936, Time magazine noted that though Borah was the most famous senator of the century, and had long been [...] "the great Moral Force of the Senate... the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country has been placed in other pockets".|$|E

[...] In particular, he spoke {{about the possibility of}} forging a new style of novel in Latin America, drawing on the region's indigenous heritage. This new style would make the novel a vehicle of hope and light in what he termed [...] "this night that threatens us now". It would be [...] "the affirmation of the optimism of those writers that defied the Inquisition, opening a breach in the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people for the march of the Liberators".|$|E

40|$|Goodpaster {{identifies}} {{a paradox}} in corporate decision-making where it appears unethical to raise <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> non-owner-stakeholders {{to that of}} shareholders, whereas it is also unethical not to.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> “literary <b>consciences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis”, i. e., forms <b>of</b> opposite <b>consciences</b> {{in times}} <b>of</b> capitalist crises that express themselves {{by means of}} literary works, marked by a profound negativity {{in relation to the}} present. These forms <b>of</b> <b>consciences</b> are engaged in <b>the</b> dual task <b>of</b> describing <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> barbarism settled by the crisis and also <b>of</b> narrating <b>the</b> changes that occurred in the society and <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> life of individuals. Furthermore, they would be charged with utopian energy, {{in such a way that}} <b>the</b> negation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present world opens space to <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> another world. With this notion, I intend to reaffirm the specificity, in the historical present characterized by structural crisis, potentiality and relevance <b>of</b> literature to <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a radical critique of present time.

500|$|It is {{unlawful}} {{to designate}} the Armenian assets as [...] "abandoned goods" [...] for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily {{removed from their}} domiciles and exiled. Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods... Nobody can sell my property if I am unwilling to sell it. Article 21 of the Constitution forbids it. If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can't do this. This is atrocious. Grab my arm, eject me from my village, then sell my goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible. Neither the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans nor the law can allow it.|$|E
500|$|Often this {{derives from}} a spiritual or natural law perspective, that for world peace to be achieved, conscience, {{properly}} understood, should be generally considered as not necessarily linked (often destructively) to fundamentalist religious ideologies, {{but as an}} aspect of universal consciousness, access to which is the common heritage of humanity. Thinking predicated {{on the development of}} world conscience is common to members of the Global Ecovillage Network such as the Findhorn Foundation, international conservation organisations like Fauna and Flora International, as well as performers of world music such as Alan Stivell. Non-government organizations, particularly through their work in agenda-setting, policy-making and implementation of human rights-related policy, have been referred to as the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world ...|$|E
500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on <b>Conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award [...] "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use". Avaaz {{is one of the largest}} global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus [...] "closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want".|$|E

And in contrast to the fear of political upheaval frequently implied by Western writers, their use of [...] "the Arab street" [...] often carries positive and respectful overtones, such as when Al-Ayyam praised [...] "the great Egyptian street, which has always been the heart and <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabs" [...] in 1997.
