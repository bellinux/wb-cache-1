50|$|Accommodations {{depend on}} {{conditions}} {{set out in}} the contract, and the level and status of the group. A guitar tech traveling with a regional-level band may stay in inexpensive motels and receive a modest per diem for restaurant meals. A guitar tech traveling with a major touring band, however, may stay at the same first-class hotels as the star performers and eat catered buffet or restaurant meals. Some bands with substantial road crews may have their own <b>catering</b> <b>crew.</b> Guitar techs for the most famous international guitarists such as Jimmy Page or Tony Iommi can become minor celebrities within the guitar fan community because of their proximity to famous musicians and insider knowledge of how a certain guitarist's unique tone is created.|$|E
50|$|Part one: Director Nick Reve (Steve Buscemi) is {{shooting}} a low-budget independent {{film in the}} middle of New York City. The <b>catering</b> <b>crew</b> are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother (Rica Martens) for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of how the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole (Catherine Keener) berates herself for acting badly, Cora (Rica Martens) reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf (Dermot Mulroney), who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of employees on passenger ferries consist of the catering staff: those who operate in restaurants, shops, {{and in the}} hotel on board. Research on this category is scant. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the catering staff’s experiences and perceptions of safety practice on board passenger ferries. The methods are semi-structured interviews and a qualitative content analysis of official documents and research articles. Results: Increased safety regulations and directives on an international and a national level have taken place after the major ferry disasters of late 1990 s. Changes in the safety organization on the passenger ferries have resulted in more involvement of the <b>catering</b> <b>crew</b> in safety on board. Safety awareness and the way the catering staff think about safety have improved. The risk of terrorism has further reinforced safety awareness. A clear challenge for safety work on ferries is the reduction of <b>catering</b> <b>crew.</b> The transition to job flexibility for <b>catering</b> <b>crew</b> may constitute risk factors regarding safety and security...|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} of writing we entered {{the final stage of}} {{implementing}} the crew rostering system Harmony CDR to facilitate the planning of <b>catering</b> <b>crews</b> on board of the Thalys, the High Speed Train connecting Paris, Cologne, Brussels, Amsterdam, and Geneva. Harmony CDR optimally supports the creation of crew rosters in two ways. Firstly, Harmony CDR contains a powerful algorithm to automatically generate a set of rosters, which is especially developed for this specific situation. As the user has some control over the objectives of the algorithm, several scenarios can be studied before a set of rosters is adopted. An important feature of the automatic roster generator is that it respects requirements, directives, and requests stemming from legal, union, and/or company regulations and/or from individual crew. Secondly, Harmony CDR provides user-interface data manipulation at various levels of detail. The user interface enables the planner to easily obtain many different views on the planning data and to manipulate the planning manually. So again, the planner gets optimal support from the system while he or she is still in control. Also, violating a requirement, directive, or request is detected and displayed, but can be accepted by the planner. In this paper we describe the crew rostering problem for the <b>catering</b> <b>crews</b> of the High Speed Train and the Harmony CDR solution in more detail. decision support systems;railways;crew rostering...|$|R

40|$|A {{project of}} {{provision}} of catering {{services at the}} work place was therefore planned that was {{taken up by the}} PPF SACCOS organization. The project goal was to provide quality catering service to PPF staff at the headquarters so that they can save time and be more effective at their work. The various reviewed catering services literature showed to be successful and provided the staff in concern quality food. In this study, outstanding results in providing catering services were well observed within the six month of the project. The results were associated with the participatory approach modality used in developing project. Further to this the project had fulfilled the need of the community of having quality food supply at their working place. Despite of the limited resources, staff member and other customers outside the PPF staff had commended the move of having such services and the services offered. The quality services has enabled the number of customers to keep on increasing from day to day while the good services uttered by the <b>catering</b> <b>crew</b> has resulted in profitable business. For further research, it was recommended that longer time in evaluating the provision of catering services at working place particularly to the one who should run such a business is important. The effect of having outside members coming in and the location of the canteen is also an area to study as all may {{have an impact on the}} intended goal of improving working environment and efficiency...|$|E

30|$|Food is {{important}} for liner shipping companies (LSCs) {{in their efforts to}} support daily lives and fulfil seafarer demand. Food issues are addressed in the International Labour Organization’s (ILO’s) Food and <b>Catering</b> (Ships’ <b>Crews)</b> Convention 1946 (No. 68), amended 2006. Moreover, the enforcement of the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) Regulations and Code appears to have ensured that seafarers have hygienic conditions and that good quality food and drinking water are provided. The MLC aims to meet all current standards of international maritime labour conventions and recommendations, and comply with the fundamental principles found in other international labour conventions. Yet despite these efforts, food issues require greater attention, as maintaining the food supply chain is a dynamic and difficult task. To identify strategies for improving the procurement of food for ships, this paper illustrates how to facilitate the food supply for shipping lines and further evaluate the associated supply chain. Advanced technology, comprehensive procurement procedures, qualified personnel, extensive outbound logistics (i.e., distribution) networks and sound training programmes on food quality and safety are critical elements in the food supply chain, and will enhance the quality of food for seafarers.|$|R
30|$|The {{maritime}} industry has paid {{greater attention to}} monitoring food and catering for seafarers in the last decade. Such food issues are addressed by the International Labour Organization’s (ILO’s) Food and <b>Catering</b> (Ships’ <b>Crews)</b> Convention 1946 (No. 68) and the Certification of Ships’ Cooks Convention 1946 (No. 69), amended in 2006 in Geneva. The Guidelines on the Training of Ships’ Cooks (2014, pp. 19) presents three main guidelines for the training of ships’ cooks: (An & Noh, 2009) food and drinking water of suitable quantity, nutritional value, quality and variety must be supplied {{with regard to the}} number of seafarers on board, their religious requirements and cultural practices, and the duration and nature of the voyage; (Byran & Brian, 1999) the organisation and equipment of the catering department must permit the provision to the seafarers of adequate, varied and nutritious meals prepared and served in hygienic conditions; and (Campbell et al., 2002) catering staff must be properly trained or instructed for their positions. These guidelines aim to give practical information that can be included in national laws and other measures to implement them (ILO, 2014).|$|R
5000|$|Major, {{successful}} artists {{will usually}} employ a road crew: a semi-permanent touring organization that travels {{with the artist}} during concert series. The road crew is headed by a tour manager. Crew members provides stage lighting, live sound reinforcement, musical instrument tuning and maintenance, bodyguard for the artist and transportation of the equipment and music ensemble members. On large tours, the road crew may also include an accountant, stage manager, hairdressers, makeup artists and <b>catering</b> staff. Local <b>crews</b> are typically hired to help move equipment on and off stage. On a small tour with less financial backing, all of these jobs may be handled by just a few roadies or by the musicians themselves.
