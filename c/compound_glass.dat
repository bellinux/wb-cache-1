Modeling results showed that for Bismuth and lead oxide glasses, which have nonlinearities ~ 10 x that of silica, matching the dispersion profile to the pump wavelength is essential. For chalcogenide glasses, which have much higher nonlinearities, the dispersion profile is less important. The pump pulses have duration of < 1 ps, and energy < 30 nJ. The fiber lengths required for generating continuum were < 40 mm, so the losses of the fibers were not a limiting factor. Compared to planar rib-waveguides or fiber-tapers, microstructured fiber technology has the advantages of greater flexibility for tailoring the dispersion profile over a broad wavelength span, and a much wider possible range of device lengths...|$|E

Among these are current sensors where the {{bandwidth}} is an important criterion, most nonlinear optical devices and rare-earth doped fibre lasers. Here, materials with properties optimized for short lengths of a few metres are favoured. These are typically multicomponent compound glasses. The composition of these glasses can be tailored to the application intended. By use of established glass melting, glass forming and fibre fabrication techniques, all optical devices can be made compatible with conventional monomode silica-based fibres. We have fabricated optical fibres from both commercially available and new component glass melts.

This {{is due to the}} advantages the ball grid array offers with regard to high lead count combined with large pitches, processable with standard SMT equipment. For BGA package encapsulation, epoxy resins are mostly used, either as glob top or molding compound. For cost effective encapsulation of large numbers of BGA packages, the transfer mold process offers various advantages. The process is fully automated with short process times and the molding <b>compound</b> <b>glass</b> transition temperature (Tg) is very high (> 200 degrees C) compared to glob top encapsulants (160 degrees C) offering higher reliability at elevated temperatures. However, BGA packages challenge both material suppliers and packagers as this package type is asymmetric and is thus very sensitive to encapsulant material properties. Properties to consider are reduced encapsulation material shrinkage after molding to provide low warpage, and optimized molding compound adhesion to the materials present in a BGA to avoid delaminations that might cause electrical failures.

40|$|Since {{the first}} microstructured optical fiber {{was made in}} 1996, holey fibers (HFs) have {{attracted}} growing attention. Compared with conventional fibers, they offer a significantly broader range of optical properties such as photonic bandgap guiding, shift of anomalous dispersion into the visible, high nonlinearity in small core fibers and high power delivery in large mode area fibers. Therefore, HFs have {{a wide range of}} potential applications in optical technologies. The vast majority of research and development on HFs has been based on silica glass HFs fabricated by stacking capillary tubes. Very recently, <b>compound</b> <b>glass</b> HFs produced by extrusion technique have gained much attraction. The combination of highly nonlinear glass composition and small core HF geometry allows exceptionally high values of optical nonlinearity in fiber devices, which is of great importance for all-optical processing applications.

In addition, the HF geometry allows substantially more control of the waveguide dispersion than conventional fiber designs. In this paper, we describe the fabrication and properties of small core HFs made from highly nonlinear lead silicate glass. Since the properties of HFs are determined by the air filling fraction of the cladding, the reproducibility of desired geometries during fabrication is crucial. The impact of the process parameters during extrusion and fiber drawing is outlined.

The variation in the Raman spectra indicates that above certain temperatures g-GeS 2 gradually crystallizes, first to the three-dimensional (3 D) phase and then to the layered two-dimensional (2 D) phase, with the latter being maintained up to melting point and upon subsequent cooling to room temperature. There is evidence that the controversial Al companion band of g-GeS 2 evolves to a counterpart band of the 2 D crystalline phase, implying that this band is due to symmetric stretch vibrations of S atoms in bridges of edge-sharing Ge(S- 1 / 2) (4) tetrahedra, in agreement with a previous prediction. Similar two step irreversible crystallization to the 3 D and 2 D phases of GeS 2 have been observed above T-g for the moderately rich in Ge (x= 0. 35) or in S (x= 0. 30) GexS 1 -x glasses, but at lower thresholds of crystallization temperature. In the strongly enriched in S (x= 0. 20) glass, though, crystallization takes place only to the 3 D phase of GeS 2, a process which is reversible after cooling the alloy to room temperature, i. e., the material returns to its initial amorphous phase. This reversible crystallization is explained in terms of the three-dimensional network of S-rich GexS 1 -x glasses which evolves only to the respective 3 D crystalline phase lattice at high temperatures. It is pointed out that all GexS 1 -x glasses studied undergo a first-step transition to the 3 D crystalline phase, which shows that the network of these glasses is, by large, three dimensional...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEvidence from {{summation}} near threshold psychophysical experiments using <b>compound</b> <b>Glass</b> patterns {{is presented}} which supports {{the existence of}} mechanisms in the human visual system tuned for coherence in radial and concentric, and + 45 ° and − 45 ° spiral orientations. It is suggested that sensitivity to + 45 ° and − 45 ° logarithmic spirals serves to disambiguate the sense of spiral form, which would not be uniquely specified by measures {{of the components of}} orientation along the radial and concentric directions alone. A spiral space is introduced within which radial and concentric patterns are diametrically opposed on one axis and spirals of + 45 ° and – 45 ° on an orthogonal axis and it is proposed that these represent cardinal axes for detecting global structure. Comparison of the sensitivity tuning functions of the four mechanisms tuned to these axes with sensitivity to simple spiral Glass patterns shows that weighted combinations of output from adjacent pairs of this set of mechanisms are sufficient to account for absolute sensitivity to logarithmic spiral Glass patterns of all intermediate spiral angles. Control experiments demonstrate that the combinations are labeled for spiral sense (simple spirals of − 22. 5 ° spiral angle can be discriminated from + 22. 5 ° spirals at threshold for detection) and that adaptation transfers across quadrants of spiral space (adaptation to spirals of – 22. 5 ° results in a decrease in sensitivity to orthogonal + 22. 5 ° and – 67. 5 ° spirals). Together these observations suggest that sensitivity to spirals in each of the quadrants of spiral space is due to higher order mechanisms reliant on output from 0 °, 90 °, + 45 ° and – 45 ° cardinal mechanisms...|$|E

Original contributions to the field include the development of a novel fibre drawing tower, which has allowed over three hundred fibre draws to be accomplished, resulting in composite metal-glass fibre and infrared transmitting fibre manufacturing processes being established.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} work {{performed}} {{within the field}} of optical fibre sensors. The topics studied cover three main areas of sensor research; fibre-remoted gas detection, the optical actuation of a resonant quartz device, and the assessment of compound glasses and fibres for current measurement applications. The gas detection techniques described have the common advantage of highly-selective measurement, and are applied to a number of industrial and environmental gases. Selectivity is achieved by effectively monitoring the spectral overlap between the gas sample to be measured, and that of a reference gas. Three techniques were employed to vary the spectral overlap, including Stark, pressure, and frequency modulation. For quantitative gas detection at atmospheric pressure, the modulation techniques are demonstrated {{here for the first time}} with fibre-remoted sampling cells. Practical examples of sensors for detection of methane, ammonia and carbon dioxide were demonstrated, and gas sensitivities down to 50 ppm by volume were achieved. The optical powering and readout of a quartz resonator was demonstrated. An open-ended tuning fork device was used, and a novel interferometric technique was employed to minimise the optical drive power required. Threshold optical power levels of less than 25 µW were achieved. The configuration was capable of operation with only a single fibre link to the sensor head, to carry both optical drive and readout signals, and a single optical source was employed. Optical fibre current monitors employing the Faraday effect can suffer measurement bandwidth restrictions if a long fibre is employed in order to attain good sensitivity. As the Faraday effect in many compound glasses is considerably stronger than for a standard silica fibre, then an equivalent sensitivity can be achieved for a shorter fibre coil by the use of compound glasses. The sensitivity and bandwidth of a typical current monitor configuration are analyzed for a number of compound glasses for the first time.
