40|$|An {{outbreak}} of encephalitis affecting 265 patients (105 fatally) occurred during 1998 – 1999 in Malaysia and {{was linked to}} a new paramyxovirus, Nipah, that infected pigs, humans, dogs, and cats. Most patients were pig farmers. Clinically undetected Nipah infection was noted in 10 (6 %) of 166 community-farm controls (persons from farms without reported encephalitis patients) and 20 (11 %) of 178 case-farm controls (persons from farms with encephalitis patients). Case patients (persons with Nipah infection) {{were more likely than}} community-farm controls to report increased numbers of sick/dying pigs on the farm (59 % vs. 24 %, P=. 001) and were more likely than case-farm controls to perform activities requiring direct <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs (86 % vs. 50 %, P=. 005). Only 8 % of case patients reported no <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs. The <b>outbreak</b> stopped after pigs in the affected areas were slaughtered and buried. Direct, close <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs was the primary source of human Nipah infection, but other sources, such as infected dogs and cats, cannot be excluded. From September 1998 through May 1999, 265 cases of encephalitis (105 fatal) were reported from 3 states—Perak, Negeri Sembilan, and Selangor—of Malaysia [1 – 3]. Most patient...|$|R
40|$|After {{the massive}} <b>outbreak</b> of infections <b>with</b> Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) of {{serotype}} O 104 :H 4 in Germany {{in the summer}} of 2011, post-outbreak surveillance for further infections with this type of STEC was maintained until the end of 2011. This surveillance was based on national mandatory reporting of STEC infections and the associated complication of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), as well as on data obtained from a questionnaire. Between the outbreak’s end (5 July) and 31 December 2011, a total of 33 post-outbreak cases were recorded. Post-outbreak cases occurred with diminishing frequency towards the year’s end and resembled the outbreak cases in many respects, however the proportion of HUS among all post-outbreak cases was smaller than during the outbreak. Two thirds of the post-outbreak cases were likely infected by <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> known <b>outbreak</b> cases. Both laboratory and nosocomial spread was noted in this period. No post-outbreak case recalled sprout consumption as a potential source of infection. The scarcity of information conveyed by the nonculture tests routinely used in Germany to diagnose STEC made linkage of post-outbreak cases to the outbreak difficult. Though post-outbreak surveillance demonstrated the outbreak strain’s potential for lengthy chains of transmission aided by prolonged shedding, our results and continued routine surveillance until the end of 2013 do not support the notion, that the outbreak strain has been able to establish itself in the German environment...|$|R

40|$|In December 1997, 170 hemorrhagic fever-associated {{deaths were}} {{reported}} in Carissa District, Kenya. Laboratory testing identified evidence of acute Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Of the 171 persons enrolled in a cross-sectional study, 31 (18 %) were anti-RVFV immunoglobulin (Ig) M positive. An age-adjusted IgM antibody prevalence of 14 % was estimated for the district. We estimate approximately 27, 500 infections occurred in Garissa District, making this the largest recorded outbreak of RVFV in East Africa. In multivariate analysis, <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> sheep body fluids and sheltering livestock in one’s home were significantly associated <b>with</b> infection.

40|$|The present {{risk profile}} {{describes}} mainly {{the risk of}} introduction and spread of HPAI in Estonia. The release assessment has revealed five main scenarios, which {{may lead to the}} introduction of the HPAI virus. The probability of introduction of HPAI virus into Estonia by means of infected migratory birds is the highest (moderate) as bird migration is very intense in Estonia during the migration seasons. There is also a moderate probability of development of HPAI from circulating LPAI viruses in wild bird populations. The rest factors have a very low probability regarding virus release, provided that HPAI virus is not spreading in the regions surrounding Estonia, and the restrictions on imports of birds and poultry products from risk areas are followed. Exposure assessment shows that the probability of exposure of the local bird population is very high in case of introduction of HPAI by means of introduction of infected domestic birds into poultry farms or migration of infected wild birds (exposure of local wild population), as well as in case of transformation of LPAIV into HPAIV (exposure of wild population). The exposure of poultry flocks through indirect <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> initial <b>outbreaks</b> and the probability of the spread of the infection in the poultry population are moderate. The consequence analysis shows that the outbreak of HPAI of any scale among domestic birds would have at least serious economic consequences for Estonia causing an export ban of live birds and poultry products. In case of the wider spread of the disease in Estonia the economic consequences would be severe. The impact of an outbreak on animal health at the country level would be serious, whereas environmental consequences would be significant as well. Risk estimation. Although the overall probability of the outbreak of HPAI is low, the consequences of the outbreak would be serious or severe. As a result, the risk estimate for HPAI is moderate for Estonia...|$|R
50|$|Avian {{influenza}} A H7 viruses are a {{group of}} influenza viruses that normally circulate among birds. H7 influenza infections in humans are uncommon, but have been confirmed worldwide in people who have direct <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> infected birds. Most infections have been mild involving only conjunctivitis and mild upper respiratory symptoms. The avian influenza A(H7N9) virus is a subgroup among this larger group of H7 viruses. Although some H7 viruses (e.g. H7N2, H7N3 and H7N7) have occasionally been found to infect humans, H7N9 has previously been isolated only in birds, <b>with</b> <b>outbreaks</b> reported in the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States.

In a study of catering businesses in England and Wales, operational practices relating to the supply, preparation, and service of food in 88 businesses associated <b>with</b> <b>outbreaks</b> were compared <b>with</b> those practices at 88 control businesses.

This practice was the only significantly independent operational practice associated <b>with</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of Salmonella infection. Regional egg suppliers also were more likely to be used by businesses associated <b>with</b> <b>outbreaks</b> attributed to food vehicles containing eggs. Businesses associated <b>with</b> egg-associated <b>outbreaks</b> were less likely to use eggs produced under an approved quality assurance scheme, suggesting that the underlying risk associated with using regional suppliers may relate to the use of contaminated eggs...|$|R
