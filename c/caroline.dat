5|$|<b>Caroline</b> Street is {{situated}} along the northwestern {{side of the}} island, in an historic district known as Old Town Key West. Part of the district, roughly defined as the area between <b>Caroline</b> Street and Angela Streets (which run parallel about four blocks apart), harbors many old houses, some of which belonged to famous writers and other influential persons. For example, the Dr. Joseph Y. Porter House at 429 <b>Caroline</b> Street was home to the first public health inspector {{in the state of}} Florida. The Porter House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Many of the houses in the area have been converted into inns; the Curry Mansion Inn at the corner of <b>Caroline</b> and Ann streets was originally built in 1855 for the Currys, a prominent local family. At <b>Caroline</b> Street's southern terminus across from the Presidential Gates is the Airways Building, which served as the original Pan American World Airways office during its formation in 1927.|$|E

5|$|Mac {{returns to}} work after a month's leave. When <b>Caroline</b> meets him she implies that she is engaged to Guy. Mac and Guy are then drunk in a bar, where Mac tells Guy {{he is going to}} die {{in a couple of weeks}} and makes Guy promise he will not tell <b>Caroline.</b> However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, <b>Caroline</b> walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. <b>Caroline</b> confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying it would be better for her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells Mac to propose to <b>Caroline</b> because they love each other. <b>Caroline</b> and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with <b>Caroline</b> floating away into the sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E

Furthermore, Princess Victoria was said to have borne a strong family resemblance to her father and grandfather George III.|$|E

All indications pointed to an American drive toward the Mariana Islands and the <b>Carolines.</b> To counter such an offensive, the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy (I.J.N.) established an inner line of defenses extending generally northward from the <b>Carolines</b> to the Marianas, and thence to Japan via the Volcano Islands, and westward from the Marianas via the <b>Carolines</b> and the Palau Islands to the Philippines.|$|R
