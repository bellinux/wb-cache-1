40|$|A hybrid <b>cell</b> sheet <b>engineering</b> {{approach}} was developed using ultra-thin nanofiber arrays {{to host the}} formation of composite nanofiber/cell sheets. It was found that confluent aligned cell sheets could grow on uniaxially-aligned and crisscrossed nanofiber arrays with extremely low fiber densities. The porosity of the nanofiber sheets was sufficient to allow aligned linear myotube formation from differentiated myoblasts {{on both sides of}} the nanofiber sheets, in spite of single-side cell seeding. The nanofiber content of the composite cell sheets is minimized to reduce the hindrance to cell migration, cell-cell contacts, mass transport, as well as the foreign body response or inflammatory response associated with the biomaterial. Even at extremely low densities, the nanofiber component significantly enhanced the stability and mechanical properties of the composite cell sheets. In addition, the aligned nanofiber arrays imparted excellent handling properties to the composite cell sheets, which allowed easy processing into more complex, thick 3 D structures of higher hierarchy. Aligned nanofiber array-based composite <b>cell</b> sheet <b>engineering</b> combines several advantages of material-free <b>cell</b> sheet <b>engineering</b> and polymer scaffold-based cell sheet engineering; and it represents a new direction in aligned <b>cell</b> sheet <b>engineering</b> for a multitude of tissue engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cell</b> sheet <b>engineering,</b> which fabricates sheet-like tissues without {{biodegradable}} scaffolds, {{has been}} proposed as a novel approach for tissue <b>engineering.</b> <b>Cells</b> have been cultured and proliferate to confluence on a temperature-responsive cell culture surface at 37 C. By decreasing temperature to 20 C, an intact cell sheet can be harvested from the culture surface without enzymatic treatment. This new approach enables cells to keep their cell–cell junction, cell surface proteins and extracellu-lar matrix. Therefore, recovered cell sheet can be easily not only transplanted to host tissue, but also constructed a three-dimensional (3 D) tissue by layering cell sheets. Moreover, cell sheet ma-nipulation technology and bioreactor have been combined with the cell sheet technology to fabri-cate a complex and functional 3 D tissue in vitro.
