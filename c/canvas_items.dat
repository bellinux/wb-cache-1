40|$|Tcl {{supports}} variable traces, which associate arbitrary scripts with variable reads, writes and unsets. We developed OAT (Object Attribute Traces), {{a protocol}} for extending traces to attributes of arbitrary Tcl “objects. ” We wrote several OAT-based extensions including TkOAT, which provides traces on attributes of Tk widgets and <b>canvas</b> <b>items.</b> The OAT protocol and derived extensions bring {{the benefits of}} more expressive constraints to Tcl/Tk applications by providing extended traces. OAT requires no changes to the Tcl core and is implemented as a loadable library; OAT-based extended trace packages introduce minimal changes to the code of existing extensions (Tk, CMT, etc.). The new version of our formula manager, TclProp, takes advantage of extended traces provided by OAT. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} how ad-hoc co-located collaborations can {{be supported}} with an arbitrary {{number of users}} that only have acces to small-size mobile displays. Our approach is based on tracking of these personal displays that share the same information space. All displays involved in the collaboration act as autonomous windows {{on a set of}} data items (the information space) positioned on a shared virtual <b>canvas.</b> Data <b>items</b> are identified by their three-dimensional location in physical space and can be manipulated through the displays that serve as windows on the shared canvas. Each display is tracked in physical space and is aware of its own location. Since different mobile displays can access and manipulate the same information space, a distributed locking mechanism makes sure the data stays consistent during simultaneous access of data in this information space...|$|R
40|$|This video {{presents}} {{a new technique}} for mobile and ad-hoc co-located collaboration with an arbitrary number of users. Our approach is based on tracking of personal displays that share the same information space. All displays involved in the collaboration act as autonomous windows {{on a set of}} data items (the information space) positioned on a shared virtual <b>canvas.</b> Data <b>items</b> are identified by their threedimensional location in physical space and can be manipulated through the displays that serve as windows on the shared canvas. Each display is tracked by a location positioning device and is aware of its own location in space. Since different displays access the same information space, a specialized distributed locking mechanism makes sure the data stays consistent during simultaneous access of data in this information space. The approach presented in this video enables people to set up ad-hoc collaborations using mobile devices while avoiding the problem of a small screen space typical for these kinds of setups. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of this lightweight rucksack led to an informal inquiry by officers of the infantry community as {{to the possibility of}} reducing the weight of the M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment (LCE). As a result of this interest, the army produced a set of LCE in 1962, substituting available nylon materials for the cotton canvas duck. This set of nylon load-carrying equipment weighed slightly more than 3 lb as opposed to 5 lb for the cotton <b>canvas</b> duck <b>items.</b> These two items, the lightweight rucksack and the set of nylon LCE, formed the basis for that portion of the LINCLOE Quantitative Material Requirement dealing with load-carrying equipment. Annex A to the Quantitative Material Requirement set a goal of 3.3 lb for the individual load-carrying equipment and 3 lb for the rucksack. Officials decided that the design of the new load-carrying equipment would follow that of the standard load-carrying equipment with material changes from cotton canvas duck to nylon duck and replacement of the brass and steel hardware with aluminum or plastic items.|$|R
2500|$|From 1942 {{there was}} a {{shortage}} of rubber so handlebar grips and foot pegs were replaced by <b>canvas</b> covered metal <b>items</b> and production was standardised, with only minor modifications {{until the end of}} World War II. [...] By early 1942 a new large rear carrier was fitted to hold universal WD steel pannier-frames and bags. This meant repositioning the long prop stand to forward of the nearside rear wheel spindle nut. In 1943 further modifications were made including redesign of the crankcase sump shield and fitting of the Vokes high capacity air cleaner, which was a box shaped canister on top of the fuel tank and was intended to assist operations in dusty environments. [...] In early 1945 a push-button switch was introduced for the headlight and the main lighting switch relocated to a bracket beneath the offside of the saddle.|$|R
40|$|We present rush as a recommendation-based {{interaction}} and visualization technique for repeated item selection from large data sets on mobile touch screen devices. Proposals and choices are intertwined {{in a continuous}} finger gesture navigating a two-dimensional <b>canvas</b> of recommended <b>items.</b> This provides users with more flexibility for the resulting selections. Our design {{is based on a}} formative user study regarding orientation and occlusion aspects. Subsequently, we implemented a version of rush for music playlist creation. In an experimental evaluation we compared different types of recommendations based on similarity, namely the top 5 most similar items, five random selections from the list of similar items and a hybrid version of the two. Participants had to create playlists using each condition. Our results show that top 5 was too restricting, while random and hybrid suggestions had comparable results. interfaces for mobile recommender systems is scarce: existing systems ([14],[18]) mostly rely on established desktop interaction metaphors (e. g., critique-based recommendation [21]) and examine issues of mobility such as loss of connection ([19],[8]) and decentralization [13]. Peculiarities of mobile device interaction, such as occlusion problems [35], the influence of the reduced screen space [30] and possibly abrupt endings (e. g., when the bus arrives at the station) have mostly been ignored.
