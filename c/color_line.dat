5|$|K.M. Landis {{was quite}} human and not infallible. If, for example, he did drag his feet at erasing baseball's <b>color</b> <b>line,</b> he was grievously wrong, but then so were many others of his post-Civil War generation.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde, {{owner of}} the cruiseferry company <b>Color</b> <b>Line,</b> {{announced}} that he would start a domestic low-cost airline. They company aimed for a 15–20% domestic market share and was named Color Air. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend.|$|E
5|$|In September, the {{ownership}} of Color Air was rearranged. Sunde reallocated his ownership and created Color Group, that would wholly own both <b>Color</b> <b>Line,</b> Scandi Line, Larvik Line and Color Air. Sunde retained a 77% ownership in the corporation through Larvik Scandi Line. The group was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In the general meeting held in December, two of the largest owners of <b>Color</b> <b>Line,</b> Vital Forsikring and the Government Pension Fund of Norway, both were opposed to the merger, as they felt the purchased companies were overvalued. Color Air {{was at the time}} valuated at NOK157 million. After a long process between the miniority shareholders and Color Group, the valuation was adjusted to NOK108 million. In May, Olav Nils Sunde bought the entire Color Group, and delisted it from the stock exchange following the conflict with the other shareholders.|$|E

5|$|After much {{lobbying}} {{of local}} officials by Rickey himself, the Royals {{were allowed to}} host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach. Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus {{became the first black}} player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the de facto baseball <b>color</b> <b>line</b> had been implemented in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|All {{flights were}} based at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. For the summer routes of 1999, Color Air {{operated}} four daily round trips to Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and five daily round trips to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. In addition, {{there was a}} single daily round trip to London Stansted Airport, and a weekly round trip to Alicante Airport. From each domestic destination, flights were made to correspond with the <b>Color</b> <b>Line</b> cruiseferries departing from Oslo to Kiel, Germany, and Hirtshals, Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Jack Roosevelt Robinson (January 31, 1919– October 24, 1972) was an American {{professional}} baseball second baseman {{who became the}} first African American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era. Robinson broke the baseball <b>color</b> <b>line</b> when the Brooklyn Dodgers started him at first base on April 15, 1947. When the Dodgers signed Robinson, they heralded the end of racial segregation in {{professional baseball}} that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues since the 1880s.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Landis's commissionership is the question of race. From 1884, black ballplayers were informally banned from organized baseball. No black ballplayer played in organized baseball during Landis's commissionership; Rickey (then running the Brooklyn Dodgers) broke the <b>color</b> <b>line</b> by signing Jackie Robinson to play for the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, after Landis's death; Robinson became the first black in the major leagues since the 19th century, playing with the Dodgers beginning in 1947.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{played in}} the minor leagues until 1889, and was the last African-American to {{participate}} on the major league level before Jackie Robinson broke baseball's <b>color</b> <b>line</b> in 1947. After his baseball career, he became a successful businessman and inventor. As an advocate of Black nationalism, Walker also jointly edited a newspaper, The Equator, with his brother. He published a book, Our Home Colony (1908), to explore ideas about emigrating back to Africa. He died in 1924 at the age of 67.|$|E

He remained active in football, playing for minor league and semi-professional teams, including the New York Brown Bombers, with whom he spent three seasons. Lillard was also a pitcher in Negro league baseball for five seasons from 1932 to 1944, and a guard in basketball for the future Harlem Globetrotters. After his athletic career, he became an appliance store employee and died in 1978.|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the <b>color</b> <b>line</b> because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
5|$|Between 1971 and 1977, nine {{players from}} the Negro Leagues were {{inducted}} by a special Negro Leagues Committee, which was given the task of identifying worthy players who played in the Negro Leagues prior to the breaking of baseball's <b>color</b> <b>line.</b> Since 1977, {{players from the}} Negro Leagues have been considered by the Veterans Committee, and nine more individuals have been approved by that body. In 2005, the Hall announced {{the formation of a}} Committee on African-American Baseball, which held a 2006 election for eligible figures from the Negro Leagues and earlier 19th-century teams; 17 additional Negro League figures were chosen in that election, including executive Effa Manley, the first woman inducted.|$|E

The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his shipping company Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a brand extension of Sunde's shipping company <b>Color</b> <b>Line.</b> The company aimed at a 15–20% market share, with 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend. Color Air made an agreement with the British airline Air Foyle HeavyLift to operate a fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In Major League Baseball, the Rookie of the Year Award is {{annually}} {{given to}} one player from each league as voted {{on by the}} Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). The award was established in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA, which selected an annual winner from 1940 through 1946. The award became national in 1947; Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers' second baseman, won the inaugural award. One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor {{has been given to}} one player each in the National and American League. Originally, the award was known as the J. Louis Comiskey Memorial Award, named after the Chicago White Sox owner of the 1930s. The award was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award in July 1987, 40 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball <b>color</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jackie Robinson Day is a {{traditional}} event which occurs annually in Major League Baseball, commemorating and honoring the day Jackie Robinson made his major league debut. April 15 was Opening Day in 1947, Robinson's first season in the Major Leagues. Initiated {{for the first time}} on April 15, 2004, Jackie Robinson Day is celebrated each year on that day. The festivity is a result of Robinson's memorable career, best known for becoming the first black major league baseball player of the modern era in 1947. His debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers (today known as the Los Angeles Dodgers) ended approximately 80 years of baseball segregation, also known as the baseball <b>color</b> <b>line,</b> or color barrier. He also was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, remembered for his services with the number 42 jersey.|$|E

5|$|On 20 April 2005, the Norwegian Ski Federation's board supported, with 13 against 1 vote, {{to build}} both a normal {{and a large}} hill at Rødkleiva and to close Vikersundbakken. However, the {{following}} day Svarstad Haugland stated that the government supported keeping Vikersundbakken rather than building a new venue in Rødkleiva. Clas Brede Bråthen responded that the federation hoped to build the venue with grants from the private sector, such as naming rights, and used <b>Color</b> <b>Line</b> Stadion in Ålesund {{as an example of}} a venue that had generated significant funding from corporate sponsors. A majority of the county chapters supported Vikersundbakken, with only 4 of 19 chapters supporting Rødkleiva. The Norwegian Ski Federation's national convention voted on 28 May with a large majority to place first a normal hill and then a ski flying hill at Rødkleiva.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{six days}} {{before the start of}} the 1947 season, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, more than 14,000 of whom were black. Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5–3 victory. Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball <b>color</b> <b>line.</b> Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.|$|E
5|$|The Rookie of the Year Award {{is given}} {{annually}} to one player from each league, as voted {{upon by the}} BBWAA. The award was established in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA who alone selected a rookie of the year. Starting in , {{all members of the}} national BBWAA organization voted. Jackie Robinson was awarded the first official Rookie of the Year award. The award was originally known as the J. Louis Comiskey Memorial Award, after the Chicago White Sox owner of the 1930s. In 1987, it was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award, in honor of the 40th year since Robinson broke the baseball <b>color</b> <b>line.</b> Only two players, both in the American League, have been named Rookie of the Year and MVP in the same year: Fred Lynn in 1975 and Ichiro Suzuki in 2001. The only Rookie of the Year to win the Cy Young Award in the same year was Fernando Valenzuela in 1981. In 1947 and 1948, only one award was given to a single player. Since 1949, the honor has been given to one player in each league.|$|E
