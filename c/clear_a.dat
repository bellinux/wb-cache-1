5|$|Around midday the Germans {{opened up}} an {{artillery}} and mortar barrage that caused casualties among the ridge's defenders and lasted {{for the entire}} afternoon. At about the same time, Kampfgruppe Weidinger seized an important road junction northeast of Coudehard. Several units of the 10th SS, 12th SS, and 116th Panzer Divisions managed to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> corridor past Point 262N, and by mid afternoon about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{had little}} time to mourn or {{celebrate}} {{the death of his}} grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and when it became <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine. Drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate.|$|E
5|$|During his {{recuperation}} Formby contracted gastroenteritis and had {{a suspected}} blood clot on his lung, after which he underwent an operation to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> fishbone that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Southport Garrick Theatre. That September {{he turned on the}} Blackpool Illuminations.|$|E

5|$|In Germany and Illyricum, {{the legions}} were in mutiny. In Germany, the legions in mutiny {{were those of}} the Lower Rhine under Aulus Caecina (the V Alaudae, XXI Rapax, I Germanica, and XX Valeria Victrix). The army of the Lower Rhine was {{stationed}} in summer quarters {{on the border of}} the Ubii. They had not gotten the bonuses promised them by Augustus, and when it became <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. Germanicus dealt with the troops in Germania, and Tiberius' son Drusus dealt with Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} the player must {{simultaneously}} drive a bus and clear roads of alien potato beings. The beings are scattered across the street, and by shooting out rows of alien potatoes, they can be cleared from the player's path. The player must <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> set number of aliens to proceed in the game. Hot Potato received mostly above average reviews from critics; it received 66.42% and 74% ratings on review aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.|$|E

5|$|On Amity Island, Martin Brody, {{famous for}} his role as Police Chief and his heroism during the {{previous}} events, has recently died from a heart attack. His wife, Ellen, attributes it to the fear of sharks. She now lives with Brody's younger son, Sean and his fiancée, Tiffany. Sean works as a police deputy, and is dispatched to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> log from a buoy a few days before Christmas. A great white shark attacks and kills him, sinking his boat in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand in three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> passage in two hours.|$|E
5|$|To keep up morale {{following}} Amherst's departure, Maxwell began organising {{his remaining}} 200 men (and one woman) {{to secure their}} position and gather supplies. The men were divided into parties, with one ordered to dig a well while another returned to the wreck of Alceste to salvage what weapons and equipment they could. A third party was ordered to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> path to the island's central hill, where a cool cave {{could be used as}} a larder and trees felled to form a protective stockade. By the end of the first day the well was producing a steady supply of water.|$|E

5|$|To {{obtain a}} licence, {{candidates}} must pass the Amateur Station Operator's Certificate examination {{conducted by the}} WPC. The examination consists of two 50-mark written sections: Radio theory and practice, Regulations; and a practical test consisting of a demonstration of Morse code proficiency in sending and receiving. After passing the examination, the candidate must <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> police interview. After clearance, the WPC grants the licence along with the user-chosen call sign. This procedure {{can take up to}} one year. This licence is valid for up to five years.|$|E
5|$|At the Great Bitter Lake, the Egyptian 130th Amphibious Brigade {{performed}} its own crossing. Composed of the 602nd and 603rd Mechanized Infantry Battalions with 1,000 men, {{including a}} Sagger anti-tank battalion, an anti-air battalion, 20 PT-76 tanks and 100 amphibious armored personnel carriers, it was tasked with seeking and destroying enemy installations at the entrances of the Gedy and Mitla Passes. The sand rampart {{that lined the}} entire Suez Canal {{did not exist in}} the Bitter Lakes, and there were no Israeli defences or units to be encountered, and the brigade reached the opposite bank around 14:40 without any losses. The Egyptians discovered a minefield blocking their advance, and military engineers worked to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> path.|$|E
5|$|Battles in {{the story}} take place on maps divided into a square-based grid. Battle actions are governed by a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During gameplay, weather and terrain effects appear such as fog of war or {{elements}} of the environment that can be manipulated to one side's advantage, affecting the progress of battle. Units are split between player, enemy and allied non-player character (NPC) units. Each unit's movement range and attack range is displayed when selected. The player must <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> map to advance the story: the objectives for clearing a level can vary from defeating all enemies to capturing strongholds or rescuing NPCs. When engaging a unit, the scene transitions into a battle between the player and enemy unit, with battle animation playing out. When hit with an attack, a character loses health points (HP). For player characters, HP can be restored with items or by units with healing magic; {{it can also be}} regained by standing on forts, gates or castles, or using a special spell that replenishes health based on damage dealt to an enemy.|$|E
50|$|When {{engaged in}} combat shooting, {{sometimes}} cartridges do not feed {{into the chamber}} properly. These malfunctions must be corrected quickly so that firing can be resumed. There are variations of malfunction drills, including the two most often required in competition: <b>clearing</b> <b>a</b> cartridge that fails to fire, and <b>clearing</b> <b>a</b> double feed malfunction.|$|R

5|$|During that operation, American {{soldiers}} initially {{made only}} limited {{contact with the}} Viet Cong, but defeated enemy troops in two separate battles. On June 17 the 1/16th infantry battalion, re-enforced by a company of 2/28th infantry engaged in a six-hour battle supported by airstrikes and massive artillery. The majority of the casualties suffered from that engagement alone, when the operation concluded on June 26, the 1st Infantry Division had lost 57 soldiers dead and 197 wounded. Then in September, following a string of attacks on allied military installations by Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops, Major General John H. Hay decided to temporarily stop conducting large-scale operations until the true intentions of Communist forces were known. Towards October, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment marched into the Long Nguyen Secret Zone, to rest and refit for their next major operation. To disrupt the Viet Cong's resting period, General Hay launched Operation Shenandoah II to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> section of National Highway 13 which stretched from Chon Thanh to Loc Ninh.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Bridges {{signed for}} Conference South side Chelmsford City on a free transfer. He made his debut {{for the club}} in a 3–2 home win over Bromley on 25 August. Bridges scored his first goal for Chelmsford in the club's 2–2 draw with East Thurrock United in the FA Cup in October 2012, {{sweeping}} the ball through a crowded penalty area after East Thurrock had failed to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> corner. It took Bridges seven months to open his goalscoring account for the league season, netting on the hour mark in a 6–0 home victory over Farnborough on 18 March 2013, {{a game in which}} he also assisted two other goals. It proved to be his only league goal of the campaign, in a season where Chelmsford would once again make the Conference South play-offs, but ultimately fall short. They lost 2–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals to Salisbury City, with Bridges playing in both games. He made 36 appearances in all competitions during the season, scoring two goals.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{originally}} intended to finish the series in a single volume titled A Memory of Light, but when Sanderson began writing the book it became <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> split was required as it was believed a single volume would be too large to print. The expected final book was then split into three volumes: The Gathering Storm, Towers of Midnight, and A Memory of Light. The books would be published a year apart with the first volume, The Gathering Storm, published on October 27, 2009; a week earlier than originally announced. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the No. 1 position on The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list, making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{started the}} second half in attacking fashion, as they had chances immediately. A Silvestre run down the pitch {{resulted}} in a pass that found Van Nistelrooy {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool penalty area, but his shot went high and wide of the goal. He had another chance a minute later, but despite beating the offside trap set by the Liverpool defence, he could not beat Westerveld, who saved his shot. United's attacking start to the half was underlined by a third chance in as many minutes, but Scholes' shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. However, two minutes later, United's pressure told and they scored. A move that involved Beckham, Keane and Ryan Giggs resulted in the ball being played to Van Nistelrooy, who went around Westerveld and subsequently scored to reduce Liverpool's lead to 2–1. Beckham came close to levelling the match in the 62nd minute when he had two chances to score; he was unable to get his shot on target after Liverpool failed to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> cross from Giggs and he was unable to score with a long-range shot.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November, the Germans {{launched}} an assault from Podgorica towards Nikšić to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> corridor {{through which the}} German forces in Montenegro could withdraw towards the Reich. This operation {{was supported by the}} Italian 86th National Republican Guard (GNR) Battalion. Around 1,200 of Đurišić's Chetniks were deployed on the flanks of the attack. Twelve days of fierce fighting resulted in significant casualties, and the Germans made no progress, losing Boka in the meantime. On 25 November, the Germans decided to abandon this line of attack and attack Kolašin. Chetniks under Đurišić's command continued to fight alongside the Germans. After reaching Kolašin, Đurišić's force separated from the Germans to relieve pressure on the German route of march and headed towards Bosnia, marching {{to the west of the}} Germans and bypassing Pljevlja. During the breakout and subsequent withdrawal, both the Germans and Chetniks were subjected to frequent attacks by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|On 4 October 1943, Smith {{took off}} from Idku at dawn in a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a {{shipping}} convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to <b>clear</b> <b>a</b> blast wall {{at the end of}} the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, and his face was smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.|$|E
