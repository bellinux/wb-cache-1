30|$|When {{it comes}} to {{establishing}} whether overeducation has a different incidence among native and migrant workers (Fig.  2), it appears {{this is the case}} on every continent but not in the non-EU European countries. Nevertheless, the relation between migration and overeducation can be of two kinds. In Europe and Asia, overeducation affects migrants {{to a greater extent than}} it does native workers. Its incidence appears to be around 5 % higher: 25 % versus 20 % in the EU 15, 26 % versus 21 % in the EU 12, and 33 % versus 28 % in Asian countries. Overeducation affects migrants to a lesser extent than native workers in African, Central & South American, and North American & Oceanian countries. On these continents the phenomenon is around 3 % lower among immigrants. The migration phenomenon is different across countries in terms of magnitude as well as <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance,</b> and these differences reflect differences in the reason behind the migration decision. Differences in the incidence of overeducation with respect to the native population might be a consequence of the different reasons for which people migrate.|$|E

Our aim is to investigate the strategic responses to the present and new food information requirements. Such requirements are diverse and scattered over more than 200 directives and regulations. To limit {{the scope of this}} contribution we address two controversial issues with different impact and responses: mandatory information on <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin/place <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> (COO/ PP) and voluntary information governed by the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation (NHCR). Uncertainties (and extra costs) with respect to nutrition and health claims are rooted ex-ante in the EU authorization procedures and ex post in the legal limitations for the use of claims. These factors negatively impact the expected value of the option to apply for a claim. Strategic options include – besides compliance – circumventing and temporarily trespassing the requirements. Uncertainties as to COO/ PP are vested in new Commission measures and possible new legislation that extends the scope of COO/PP. Strategic responses (and extra costs) are different of character and lie mainly in the re-ordering of the supply chain and production process, to be able to identify the source of a food or ingredient. The uncertainties in European information law do not contribute to the aim of realizing an internal market, nor does it support consumers in making informed choices...|$|R

They are places of encounter between migrants from sub-Saharan and North African, Eastern European, Latin American, and Middle Eastern countries who interact and negotiate their day-to-day existence among themselves {{as well as with}} the police, physicians, and NGOs. 	Based on ethnographic fieldwork with mostly imprisoned sub-Saharan women, I explore the multilocal dimension within an enclosed place. After having left behind the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance,</b> sub-Saharan migrants usually dwell for several years in Morocco, suffering displacement and forced relocation. The remembrance of their journeys, the aspirations for a better future in Europe, and the disillusions with Spanish (and European) immigration policy, echoes in women’s narratives. At the same time, their present stay is marked by waiting, worrying, and boredom, for they have to spend up to 60 days in the C. I. E., condemned to a state of not knowing whether they will be deported or not. “Eat and sleep” is a common narrative used by migrants to describe their daily routine.

30|$|Overview first: main map and {{timeline}}. The main map, {{table of}} news events and timeline provide a simple overview {{of thousands of}} tweets about news events. The main map shows events in their geopolitical context, represented as bubbles placed over the <b>country</b> or <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> their <b>provenance.</b> If the event {{is located in a}} particular city within the country, the bubble is placed in the city. On the other hand, if only country level information is available for the event, the bubble is placed on the country’s capital. The size of each bubble represents the relevance of the event, measured by the volume of tweets associated with it. Purple bubbles (Figure  2 (e)) represent events that are <b>of</b> local <b>provenance</b> (i.e., events in which only one country is the protagonist). Green bubbles (Figure  2 (f)) represent regional provenance (i.e., more than one country is involved in the event, but all of them correspond to the same continent). Orange bubbles (Figure  2 (g)) represent events which are <b>of</b> global <b>provenance</b> (i.e., more than one country is involved in the event and they belong to at least two different continents). If the cursor is placed over a bubble, a pop-up appears with information about the event. When the cursor is placed over green or orange bubbles - regional or global events - links appear to indicate the other countries that are relevant for that event. For example, in Figure  2 we observe several local events in the United States in May 6, 2014, indicated by purple bubbles located on this geographical area. In particular, the event with the highest impact is located in the West Coast. Some regional events (green bubbles) are located in South Korea and Brunei, and some global events (orange bubbles) are located in India, China and the United States. In addition, we highlight a global event that links the United States and Nigeria, which corresponds to the United States’ intentions to send aid to Nigeria in response to the kidnaping of a large group of schoolgirls claimed by Boko Haram, in 2014.|$|R

40|$|Editorial delay, {{the time}} between {{submission}} and acceptance of scientific manuscripts, was investigated {{for a set of}} 4, 540 papers published in 13 leading food research journals. Groups of accelerated papers were defined as those that fell in the lower quartile of the distribution of the editorial delay for the journals investigated. Delayed papers are those in the upper quartile of the distribution. Editorial stage is related to the peer review process and two variables were investigated in search of any bias in editorial review that could influence publication delay: countries of origin of the manuscript and authors’ previous publishing experience in the same journal. A ranking of countries was established based on contributions to the leading food research journals in the period 1999 - 2004 and four categories comprising heavy, medium, light and occasional country producers was established. Chi square tests show significant differences in country provenance of manuscripts only for one journal. The results for influence on editorial delay of cross-national research and international collaboration, conducted by means of the Fisher statistic test, were similar. A two-tailed Student’s t test shows significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the distribution of experienced and novel authors across the delayed and accelerated groups of papers. Although these results are time and discipline limited, it can be concluded that authors’ publishing experience causes a faster review and acceptance of their papers and that neither <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> nor cross-national research influence the time involved in editorial acceptance of the papers.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the elemental and isotopic composition of bullets and projectiles from old conflicts could give useful information for forensic science and archaeometry. Projectiles, bullets, cartridge cases and Pb artillery shots, dated back to the First World War, were analysed by inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry equipped with an octopole reaction system (ORS-ICP-QMS) to determine both the trace elemental composition and the Pb isotope ratios. Multivariate statistical analysis techniques were applied to the dataset to evaluate the different origins and characteristic of the war residues. The core of rifle bullets of Italian and Austro-Hungarian origin is characterized by high levels of Li, Sr, Cd, Ga and Ba compared to Russian, German and British bullets which all show higher concentrations of Ag and Mo. The origin of the bullet cores cannot be discriminated through the study of Pb isotopic ratios, while the external jacketing of Italian and Austro-Hungarian samples are well discriminated. This could mean that while the bullet cores were made using seized or salvaged war materials, the external jacket, which represents {{the most important part}} of a bullet, is principally made higher quality materials using non re-cycled metal from definite sources. Moreover, the external armoured jacket is different depending on the weapon type and is nation specific. Similarly, the Pb isotope ratios of Italian and Austrian artillery lead shots (shrapnels) differ significantly, allowing a good discrimination between these two groups.

40|$|Abstract: In many {{application}} {{areas like}} e-science and data-warehousing detailed information {{about the origin of}} data is required. This kind of information {{is often referred to as}} data provenance or data lineage. The <b>provenance</b> <b>of</b> a data item includes information about the processes and source data items that lead to its creation and current representation. The diversity of data representation models and application domains has lead to a number of more or less formal definitions <b>of</b> <b>provenance.</b> Most <b>of</b> them are limited to a special application domain, data representation model or data processing facility. Not surprisingly, the associated implementations are also restricted to some application domain and depend on a special data model. In this paper we give a survey <b>of</b> data <b>provenance</b> models and prototypes, present a general categorization scheme for provenance models and use this categorization scheme to study the properties of the existing approaches. This categorization enables us to distinguish between different kinds <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> information and could lead to a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> in general. Besides the categorization <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> types, it is important to include the storage, transformation and query requirements for the different kinds <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> information and application domains in our considerations.

A common provenance model with well-defined formal semantics to facilitate interoperability <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> metadata from different sources has not been defined. Another important issue is the lack of a systematic study <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query characteristics across multiple applications. A classification or taxonomy <b>of</b> the <b>provenance</b> queries will not only help to better understand provenance metadata, but will also enable the definition <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators. Finally, while provenance for a user or an application is a specific view over all available provenance metadata, a provenance management system that supports provenance storage as views has not been implemented.
