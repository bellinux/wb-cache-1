5000|$|According to {{the system}} of Aristoxenus and his followers—Cleonides, Bacchius, Gaudentius, Alypius, Bryennius, and Aristides Quintilianus —the {{paradigmatic}} tetrachord was bounded by the fixed tones hypate and mese, which are a perfect fourth apart and do not vary from one genus to another. Between these are two movable notes, called parhypate and lichanos. The upper tone, lichanos, can vary over the range of a whole tone, whereas the lower note, parhypate, is restricted to the span of a quarter tone. However, their variation in position must always be proportional. This interval between the fixed hypate and movable parhypate cannot ever be larger than the interval between the two movable tones [...] When the composite of the two smaller intervals {{is less than the}} remaining (incomposite) interval, the three-note group is called pyknon (meaning [...] "compressed"). The positioning of these two notes defined three genera: the diatonic, chromatic (also called chroma, [...] "colour"), and enharmonic (also called ἁρμονία harmonia). The first two of these were subject to further variation, called shades—χρόαι (chroai)—or species—εἶδη (eidē). For Aristoxenus himself, these shades were dynamic: that is, they were not fixed in an ordered scale, and the shades were flexible along a continuum within certain limits. Instead, they described <b>characteristic</b> <b>functional</b> progressions of intervals, which he called [...] "roads" [...] (ὁδοί), possessing different ascending and descending patterns while nevertheless remaining recognisable. For his successors, however, the genera became fixed intervallic successions, and their shades became precisely defined subcategories ( [...] ; [...] ). Furthermore, {{in sharp contrast to the}} Pythagoreans, Aristoxenos deliberately avoids numerical ratios. Instead, he defines a whole tone as the difference between a perfect fifth and a perfect fourth, and then divides that tone into semitones, third-tones, and quarter tones, to correspond to the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera, respectively [...]|$|E

40|$|The <b>characteristic</b> <b>functional</b> is the infinite-dimensional {{generalization}} of the Fourier transform for measures on function spaces. It characterizes the statistical {{law of the}} associated stochastic process {{in the same way}} as a characteristic function specifies the probability distribution of its corresponding random variable. Our goal in this work is to lay the foundations of the innovation model, a (possibly) non-Gaussian probabilistic model for sparse signals. This is achieved by using the <b>characteristic</b> <b>functional</b> to specify sparse stochastic processes that are defined as linear transformations of general continuous-domain white noises (also called innovation processes). We prove the existence of a broad class of sparse processes by using the Minlos-Bochner theorem. This requires a careful study of the regularity properties, especially the boundedness in Lp-spaces, of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>functional</b> of the innovations. We are especially interested in the functionals that are only defined for p< 1 since they appear to be associated with the sparser kind of processes. Finally, we apply our main theorem of existence to two specific subclasses of processes with specific invariance properties. Comment: 24 page...|$|E
