5000|$|Born in Portsmouth, {{he was the}} son of William John Madden (1757-1833), a Captain in the Royal Marines of Irish origin, and {{his wife}} Sarah Carter (1759-1833). From his {{childhood}} he displayed a flair for linguistic and antiquarian studies. In 1826 he was engaged by the British Museum to assist in the preparation of the <b>classified</b> <b>catalogue</b> of printed books, and in 1828 he became assistant keeper of manuscripts. In 1832 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At the age of 32 he was made a knight, entitling him to the initials KH after his name, and in 1837 he succeeded Josiah Forshall as Keeper of Manuscripts. He did not get on well with his colleagues, and retired in 1866. Madden was the leading palaeographer of his day. However, his ignorance of German prevented his ranking high as a philologist, although he paid much attention to the early dialectical forms of French and English. His minor contributions to antiquarian research were numerous: the best known, perhaps, was his dissertation on the spelling of Shakespeare's name, which, mainly on the strength of a signature found in John Florio's copy of the work of Montaigne, he contended should be [...] "Shakspere." [...] This led to a lengthy debate and to a period when the [...] "Shakspere" [...] spelling nearly became the norm.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{highlights}} the importance of cataloguing as the basic prerequisite for all information retrieval processes, and therefore its relevance as a core in LIS curriculum. The developments in ICT have brought in sea changes in the universe of information resources as well as in customer requirements. This changed situation has caused only a redefinition of the functions and format of the catalogue and not made it redundant. Formulation of FRBR as a conceptual model for bibliographical databases is a landmark in this context. The FRBR in fact is a manifestation of the theoretical frame that Ranganathan had proposed for the universe of documents. The recent attempts to incorporate Classification Numbers to enable browsing resources in the web and the approach of FRBR aiming at retrieval of the different manifestations and expressions of a work during a search, necessitate a coextensive Class Number as a key attribute for every work as an access point. Such an approach would necessitate training students of librarianship on the modus operandi of a <b>Classified</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> The paper gives an entity relationship diagram for a bibliographical database and a model of a <b>Classified</b> <b>Catalogue</b> with description as per the ISBD and access points derived {{on the basis of the}} rules of the <b>Classified</b> <b>Catalogue</b> Code of Ranganathan...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the early}} modern period, {{libraries}} were {{probably the most important}} place of work for historians. They were used as a kind of archive, where historians could find all sorts of records, be they original documents or copies. Based on the case of the Royal Library in eighteenth-century Paris, this study aims to investigate the chain of documentary acts which gave it a para-archivistical function – which it retains to this day. First of all, I will discuss the constitution of scholars' and bureaucrats' private collections and their incorporation in the Royal Library from the final decades of the seventeenth century onwards; then the various operations of <b>classifying,</b> <b>cataloguing</b> and filing that blurred the initial rationales of the 'archive avatars' developed by previous owners; finally the uses of this peculiar material, be they documentary (by scholars or royal officials) or pragmatic (by families wishing to clarify their genealogy or private individuals involved in court cases).

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a system and {{procedure}} for <b>classifying</b> and <b>cataloguing</b> the textile, costume, and slide collections of the Clothing, Textile, and Related Arts (CTRA) Department at Oregon State University. Investigation was made by letter, personal visit, interview with faculty and curators, and literature research to identify different purpose and use statements <b>classifying</b> and <b>cataloguing</b> systems, catalogue files, and criteria for evaluating the system and procedure. The investigation resulted in the development of a purpose and use statement based on the collection characteristics and user needs; identification of user needs; criteria for evaluating the proposed system and procedure; and the recommended system and procedure. Robert Chenhall developed a system for cataloguing in the computer age. The system contains 91 data fields and can be established as a manual or computerized file. The Chenhall system was adapted for CTRA using 39 of the 91 data fields. Eleven of the data fields were subdivided to meet the expressed needs of the users. Data field definitions and instructions were developed and arranged into a <b>Classifying</b> and <b>Cataloguing</b> Manual. The Manual procedure was tested and revised to meet the established criteria. Sample word lists were developed and reference resources were recommended to maintain vocabulary control. Basic rules were established to provide the cataloguer with a basis for consistency in recording information and use of the system. Procedures were developed and included in the Manual for completing the cataloguing process including instructions for the ledger page, catalogue worksheet, donated objects, label preparation, establishing data files such as Documentation File and History of Ownership, and establishing catalogue card files such as Subject-Index File, Registration-Accession File, and Appraisal File. A recommended test and evaluation of the proposed Subject- Index File was established to determine ease of use after the file is implemented. The CTRA department head will review the test and evaluation results to determine if any further changes are needed to improve ease of use of the Subject-Index File for information retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{effectiveness}} of library subject catalogues as tools of research. We know that they are indispensable from a theoretical point of view, and from general observation of their use and the results of a few studies we can conclude that they are generally compatible with the library use habits of readers. Some of the general conclusions which have been drawn from studies of the subject catalogue are: that there is no significant difference between the amount of author catalogue use and subject catalogue use; that the non- specialist ordinarily will make more use of the subject catalogue than the specialist; and that most of the use of the subject catalogue is for materials in English and of fairly recent date. If the second of these generalizations is true, namely that subject catalogue use is primarily by non- specialists, a discussion of the <b>classified</b> <b>catalogue</b> as a research tool may be a somewhat sterile exercise. On the other hand, we can remind ourselves that the importance of research isn't determined by popular vote, so even a minority use should justify its consideration. In any case, classification and classified catalogues have a high degree of relevancy. This was my reason for agreeing to discuss the subject of the role of the <b>classified</b> <b>catalogue</b> in research. In evaluating what I have to say about classification, one general caveat must be observed.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2004, we {{presented}} a web resource for stimulating {{the search for}} novel RNAs, RNA-As-Graphs (RAG), which <b>classified,</b> <b>catalogued,</b> and predicted RNA secondary structure motifs using clustering and build-up approaches. With the increased availability of secondary structures in recent years, we update the RAG resource and provide various improvements for analyzing RNA structures. Description Our RAG update includes a new supervised clustering algorithm that can suggest RNA motifs that may be "RNA-like". We use this utility to describe RNA motifs as three classes: existing, RNA-like, and non-RNA-like. This produces 126 tree and 16, 658 dual graphs as candidate RNA-like topologies using the supervised clustering algorithm with existing RNAs serving as the training data. A comparison of this clustering approach to an earlier method shows considerable improvements. Additional RAG features include greatly expanded search capabilities, an interface to better utilize the benefits of relational database, and improvements to several of the utilities such as directed/labeled graphs and a subgraph search program. Conclusions The RAG updates presented here augment the database's intended function - stimulating the search for novel RNA functionality - by classifying available motifs, suggesting new motifs for design, and allowing for more specific searches for specific topologies. The updated RAG web resource offers users a graph-based tool for exploring available RNA motifs and suggesting new RNAs for design. </p...|$|R
