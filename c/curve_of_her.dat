25|$|The austere {{portrait}} in his normally constrained palette is another Whistler exercise in tonal harmony and composition. The deceptively simple design {{is in fact}} a balancing act of differing shapes, particularly the rectangles of curtain, picture on the wall, and floor which stabilize the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face, dress, and chair. Again, although his mother is the subject, Whistler commented that the narrative was of little importance. In reality, however, it was an homage to his pious mother. After the initial shock of her moving in with her son, she aided him considerably by stabilizing his behavior somewhat, tending to his domestic needs, and providing an aura of conservative respectability that helped win over patrons.|$|E
2500|$|Her body is {{depicted}} nude, {{seen from the}} front, with yellow and white highlights and turquoise reflections, the mythological reference serving as pretext for the nude. She is the primary subject {{of the work and}} is framed in an exotic setting that accentuates the arching <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> back. She has a [...] "deep voluptuousness," [...] as in the works of Ingres (to use the term of Baudelaire), yet her timeless immobility makes her somehow chaste. The scene is seemingly calm and luxurious simultaneously.|$|E
60|$|She smiled very slightly, but the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips was delightful.|$|E
60|$|She came. I don't {{think the}} French window ever held a finer view than {{when she put}} aside the curtains, and stepped out. She had dressed herself simply and hurriedly, but with a woman's {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> best points; so that you got the long <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shapely limbs, the shorter <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> round waist and shoulders, the long sweep <b>of</b> <b>her</b> yellow braids, the light <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gray eyes, and even the delicate rose <b>of</b> <b>her</b> complexion, without knowing how it was delivered to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mistress Thankful, with a {{smile that}} began in the corners <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brown eyes, ran down into the dimpled <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth, and finally ended in the sudden revelation <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white teeth,--"no, not alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not mean}} him to wait long enough for that {{needlework}} to be finished," [...] she said, lifting her hands to stroke the backward <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair, while she rose from her seat and stood still.|$|R
60|$|Joan's {{eyes were}} bright with battle, the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips sharp with mockery.|$|E
60|$|He {{laid her}} card and letter on the twill {{bedspread}} near the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> knees.|$|E
60|$|He {{was silent}} for some moments. The faint <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips had again given him almost a shock.|$|E
60|$|Matters {{lingered on}} thus. And then, as a hoop by gentle knocks {{on this side}} and on that is made to travel in {{specific}} directions, the little touches of circumstance {{in the life of}} this young girl shaped the <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career.|$|R
60|$|Phases <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{childhood}} lurked in her aspect still. As {{she walked}} along to-day, {{for all her}} bouncing handsome womanliness, you could sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling from her eyes; and even her fifth would flit over the <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth now and then.|$|R
50|$|Yet, {{the image}} is a tender {{representation}} of a coyness, shyness and sensitivity which art historian Meyer Schapiro {{believed to be a}} projection of Cézanne's own character. One critic wrote that Cézanne painted heads as if they were apples, a tendency very evident here in the blush <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek and the oval shape and <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her then, sidelong. The <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek and chin looked very soft, and rather jolly.|$|E
60|$|He {{had come}} back from the window, and was {{standing}} close to her, who, in the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grand piano, was, as it were, embayed.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him over her shoulder, and he noticed with a twinge of delight how her little chin came out beneath the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek.|$|E
60|$|She {{rested her}} two hands behind {{her on the}} edge of a desk, and leaned against it, looking down upon the toe <b>of</b> <b>her</b> smart little shoe which was {{describing}} a small semicircle beyond the hem <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown. Her attitude, which was half-defiant, half-indolent, brought out the pretty <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> waist and shoulders. The master noticed it and became a trifle more austere.|$|R
60|$|Dick was relieved, but not voluble; {{he could}} only admiringly follow the <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pretty arms and hands, clasped lightly in her lap, down {{to the point of}} the little slipper. But even that charming {{vanishing}} point was presently withdrawn--possibly through some instinct--for the young lady had apparently not raised her eyes.|$|R
25|$|But {{the period}} {{produced}} {{a significant change}} in Weston's work. Isolated, Weston turned his attention away from landscapes and to his own wife's body. He painted her nude figure repeatedly, applying his painting techniques to the contours and <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body. The paintings Harold Weston produced {{came to be known as}} 'landscape nudes'—a radical departure from traditional nudes.|$|R
60|$|Millicent bent her head, and {{her eyes}} were misty. A raw wound, which the frost had irritated, marred the {{delicate}} <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> upper lip. It became painfully visible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! You do!" [...] He {{had come}} back from the window, and was {{standing}} close to her, who, in the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grand piano, was, as it were, embayed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, John, {{so strong}} and strange a tilter must {{fight for the}} {{brightness}} of his lady's eyes or the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyelash, even as Sir Nigel does for the Lady Loring." ...|$|E
60|$|Roger did {{not feel}} {{as if he wanted}} to talk about the Ideal. He noticed how vivid Freda's smile was and how lovable were the <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck where the dusky curls were caught up from it. He had also an inner vision of Freda making taffy with Tim and he did not approve of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is, {{you would}} wish {{me to be}} a little more like him, Rosy," [...] said Lydgate, in a sort of {{resigned}} murmur, with a smile which was not exactly tender, and certainly not merry. Rosamond was silent and did not smile again; but the lovely <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face looked good-tempered enough without smiling.|$|R
60|$|She did not {{now have}} on the man's {{overcoat}} which she had worn at the store, and her neat, close-fitting home-spun dress revealed to perfection the full, magnificent <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> figure. Her splendid hair was braided about her head in a glossy coronet, and her dark eyes were ablaze with ill-suppressed anger. Again Telford was overcome by a sense <b>of</b> <b>her</b> wonderful loveliness. Not {{all the years of}} bondage to ill-temper and misguided will had been able to blot out the beauty of that proud, dark face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} the first time that we met, Miss McIntyre?" [...] he asked, standing on the rug and looking down at her dark hair, and the beautifully feminine <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ivory neck.|$|E
60|$|Heyst {{stretched}} out his hands and looked at them for a moment, then let them fall by his side. Indignation was expressed more in the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips than in her clear eyes, which never wavered.|$|E
60|$|Tallente for {{a moment}} was almost at a loss. Then a glance into her really very {{wonderful}} eyes, and the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips as she smiled convinced him of the truth which he had at first discarded.|$|E
60|$|When Annie {{returned}} it, she met {{the younger}} sister, whom she found a great beauty. She seemed very cold, and of a hauteur which she subdued with difficulty; but she was more consecutively polite than her sister, and Annie watched with fascination <b>her</b> turns <b>of</b> the head, <b>her</b> movements <b>of</b> leopard swiftness and elasticity, the changing lights <b>of</b> <b>her</b> complexion, the <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fine lips, the fluttering <b>of</b> <b>her</b> thin nostrils.|$|R
60|$|The {{form and}} face {{reflected}} in the glass satisfied her. The puffs and draperies of the green voile displayed to perfection the full, but not over-full, <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fine figure. Lucinda lifted her arm and touched a red rose to her lips with the hand upon which shone the frosty glitter of Romney's diamond, looking at the graceful slope <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shoulder and the splendid line of chin and throat with critical approval.|$|R
5000|$|Venus is {{considered}} to be the embodiment of feminine beauty and form, and these traits are shown in the painting. Her head is tilted to one side, and her facial expression reflects that she is calm and comfortable with her nudity. She raises her arms, arranging her thigh-length, brown hair, swaying elegantly in an [...] "S" [...] curve contrapposto, emphasizing the <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. 162" [...] {{waits for}} us in Slip E of the topmost stage. The great <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> back shines frostily under the lights, and some minute {{alteration}} of trim makes her rock a little in her holding-down slips.|$|E
60|$|Clare {{knew that}} she loved him--every <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> form showed that-- {{but he did not}} know at that time the full depth of her devotion, its single-mindedness, its meekness; what long-suffering it guaranteed, what honesty, what endurance, what good faith.|$|E
60|$|The fair girl, who had overheard, leaned across. The {{shade of}} newly awakened {{interest}} in her face, and the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips as she spoke, added to her charm. A gleam of sunlight flashed upon the yellow-gold of her plainly coiled hair.|$|E
60|$|When Eric {{stepped through}} the gap she ran to meet him with outstretched hands, smiling. He took her hands and looked into her eyes with an {{expression}} before which hers {{for the first time}} faltered. She looked down, and a warm blush strained the ivory <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cheek and throat. His heart bounded, for in that blush he recognized the banner of love's vanguard.|$|R
60|$|They rowed that evening; {{the next}} came, {{and with it}} the {{necessity}} of rowing again. Then the next, and the next, Cytherea always sitting in the stern with the tiller ropes in <b>her</b> hand. The <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> figure welded with those of the fragile boat in perfect continuation, as she girlishly yielded herself to its heaving and sinking, seeming to form with it an organic whole.|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} Spitzer 4. 5 μm light <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> two {{intermediate}} polars (IPs) —DQ Her and EX Hya—obtained with Cycle 6 observations. Our initial evaluation <b>of</b> the light <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> DQ <b>Her</b> and EX Hya shows {{that these two}} IPs exhibit similar behavior as that seen in non‐magnetic systems (specifically WZ Sge). The binary eclipses seen in the Spitzer light <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> DQ <b>Her</b> and EX Hya are about three times longer than their optical counterparts, indicating that a reservoir of dust extends beyond {{the outer edge of}} the optically visible accretion disk...|$|R
