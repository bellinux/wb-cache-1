5|$|Abdul Aziz's younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rashid, {{had been}} {{negotiating}} {{with a government}} mediator. He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay down their arms, provided the government would grant them amnesty and not fire on them.

In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> and reiterated his innocence.

5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> but remained imprisoned {{for a year}} before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work {{he noted that the}} rise of industrial capitalism in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E

5|$|When the {{prosecution}} rested, the defence opened its {{case with a}} motion to dismiss based on the trial itself being illegal. Servatius challenged Eichmann's kidnapping and {{the basis for the}} Israeli law under which he had been indicted. He argued that if the trial were to continue, it should transfer its jurisdiction to West Germany. The prosecution countered by stating that the United Nations had endorsed Israel's actions, and that both West Germany and Argentina had agreed that the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> were legitimate. The defence motion was subsequently dismissed.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Weston {{was found}} incompetent {{to stand trial}} due to mental illness as {{he was a man}} with {{schizophrenia}} who stopped taking his medication. A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that he be treated with antipsychotic medication without his consent in 2001, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the decision. In 2004, the court determined that Weston still was not competent to be tried, despite ongoing treatment, and suspended but did not dismiss the criminal <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> Weston was known to the United States Secret Service prior to the incident as a person who had threatened the President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|In mid-January, when Earp ally Rickabaugh {{sold the}} Oriental Saloon to Earp adversary Milt Joyce, Wyatt sold his {{gambling}} concessions at the hotel. The Earps also raised some funds from sympathetic business owners in town. On February 2, 1882, Wyatt and Virgil, {{tired of the}} criticism leveled against them, submitted their resignations to Dake, who refused to accept them because their accounts had not been settled. On the same day, Wyatt {{sent a message to}} Ike Clanton that he wanted to reconcile their differences, which Clanton refused. Clanton was also acquitted that day of the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> in the shooting of Virgil Earp, when the defense brought in seven witnesses who testified that Clanton was in Charleston {{at the time of the}} shooting.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1944, Göth was {{relieved}} {{of his position}} and charged by the SS with theft of Jewish property (which belonged to the state, according to Nazi legislation), failure to provide adequate food to the prisoners under his charge, violation of concentration camp regulations regarding the treatment and punishment of prisoners, and allowing unauthorised access to camp personnel records by prisoners and non-commissioned officers. Administration of the camp at Płaszów {{was turned over to}} SS-Obersturmführer Arnold Büscher. Göth was scheduled for an appearance before SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> were dropped in early 1945. SS doctors diagnosed Göth as suffering from mental illness, and he was committed to a mental institution in Bad Tölz, where he was arrested by the United States military in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Piso {{was rumored}} to have been {{responsible}} for his death and with accusations coming in it wasn't long before the well known accuser, Lucius Fulcinius Trio, brought <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made him hesitant to hear the case himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide his deep anger toward Piso. Tiberius made allowances for Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecutors, but it made no difference: before the trial was over Piso died ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus' death.|$|E

On 16 May, fifty-five lawyers were present in court in solidarity with Rajab who [...] {{pleaded not guilty}} again and stated that the <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> was [...] "malicious". Despite being granted bail on 20 May, Rajab was kept in detention on a further charge of [...] "organizing illegal protests".

5|$|Raymond grows {{furious with}} Rusty's {{handling}} of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically involved with Carolyn at one time. Rusty calls on Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that the beer glass is missing, and Stern persuades Judge Larren Lyttle to keep this from the jury. Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation, thus confirming the defense's claim of a frame-up. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> dropped, with Carolyn acting as a facilitator.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Primera Junta, which took government after it. The local politics were soon divided {{between him and the}} secretary Mariano Moreno. Saavedra wanted gradual changes, while Moreno promoted more radical ones. Saavedra encouraged the expansion of the Junta with deputies from the other provinces; this left Moreno in a minority, and he resigned. A later rebellion made in behalf of Saavedra forced the remaining supporters of Moreno to resign as well. He left the presidency after the defeat of the first Upper Peru campaign, and headed to lead the Army of the North. His absence was exploited by political opponents, who established the First Triumvirate and issued an arrest warrant against Saavedra. Saavedra stayed in exile until 1815, when all the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> were dropped.|$|E
