5|$|Since 2008 {{the winning}} entry of each contest has been decided by {{a mixture of}} televoting and {{national}} juries, each counting for {{fifty percent of the}} points awarded by each country. The winners of all previous contests had been decided exclusively by televoting. The ten entries that have received the most votes in each country are awarded points ranging from one to eight, then ten and twelve. These points are then announced live during the programme by a spokesperson representing the participating country (who, like the participants, is aged between ten and fifteen). Once all participating countries have announced their results, the <b>country</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> received the most points is declared the winner of that year's contest.|$|E
