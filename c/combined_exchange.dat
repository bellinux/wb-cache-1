The officially admitted part of the training was Joint <b>Combined</b> <b>Exchange</b> Training. Prunier strongly implies the United States supplied communications equipment, vehicles, boots, and medicines to the RPA before the war began and after it broke out, delivered second-hand Warsaw Pact weapons and ammunition either directly to Goma or by airdrop along the AFDL front lines. He reports that after the war's outbreak, the U.S. Air Force had switched from using C-141 Starlifters and C-5 Galaxys to deliver the non-lethal aid to Kigali Airport and Entebbe Airport, to airdrops by C-130 Hercules aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Joint <b>Combined</b> <b>Exchange</b> Training or JCET {{programs}} are exercises {{designed to provide}} training opportunities for American Special Forces by holding the training exercises in countries that the forces may one day have to operate in, {{as well as providing}} training opportunities for the armed forces of the host countries. Typically, each JCET program involved 10–40 American special forces personnel, though can sometimes involved up to 100. The United States Congress permitted the use of funds from the military budget to be used in overseas training such as JCETs in 1991, providing that the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress annually a report on overseas training activities.|$|E

30|$|Leader-member {{exchange}} (LMX) {{theory is}} often used to study a leader’s individual relationship interaction with their followers. LMX is a process theory of leadership that <b>combines</b> <b>exchange</b> and role theory (Graen and Uhl-Bien 1995), and {{is often used}} to account for development of high quality relationships between the leader and the subordinates (Bass 1990). The theory emphasizes that when leaders offer the opportunity for high-quality relationships, the performance of in-group members would increase (Graen et al. 1982). Developing a high quality relationship is a process that starts with the leader offering a membership in the in-group, followed by a period of “acquaintance” phase. Finally the “partner” phase is reached based on exchanges and development of trust and mutual respect (Graen and Uhl-Bien 1995). An outcome of high quality relationship is commitment (Meyer and Allen 1991).|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{test the}} role of order flows in KRW/USD. We use {{transaction}} based high frequency data (electronic broker) happened in 2006. For robustness check, we extend our analysis by <b>combining</b> <b>exchange</b> rates (indicative quotes v. s. transaction rate), frequency (transaction based time v. s. 1 minute through 1 day), and order flows (sign v. s. signed volume). The results show that order flow is an important variable for explaining the KRW/USD regardless of frequency and of choice of quotes. Based on Hasbrouck's measure we find that 14 - 28 % of permanent exchange rate variation is due to private information. The magnitude is smaller than that of international currency presenting, for example, in Payne (2003). The discrepancy arises both from currency choice and from too short data span in Payne (2003) ...|$|R

40|$|From a brief {{statement}} {{of the principles of}} the theory of reciprocity in economic anthropology, this paper proposes a critical reading of the social and economic relations through the prism of market exchange. This view denies the existence of structuring relationships of reciprocity in many economic activities sectors, including the case of rural Brazil which we focus on in this article. The design, development, implementation and evaluation of public policies for rural development are also constrained and formatted by an exclusive reading of development processes based on the principle of exchange. This only thought also applies to the critics of the system by political economy: ignoring the economics of reciprocity it considers only the alienation of the market exchange system, namely the capitalist exploitation. The strength of alienation forms specific to reciprocity (particularly paternalistic oppression) is thus forgotten. These specific forms exist, for instance in Brazil, where the situation corresponds to a mixed system which <b>combines</b> <b>exchange</b> practices and practices of reciprocity.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} combined high-permeability and high-permittivity magnetodielectric {{thin films}} for microwaves. The results {{are based on}} outstanding material properties: ε = 18, μdc = 180, fr = 4. 8 GHz, and Δf = 480 MHz. This material <b>combines</b> <b>exchange</b> coupled high-magnetization ferromagnetic thin films and SrTiO 3 materials as dielectric lamination. The benefit of such magnetodielectric material is expected for size reduction of 1 / 2 wave resonators. To this end, this material has been integrated with different coplanar waveguides (CPW) structures. Here, we discuss the effect of increasing the overlap from {{the central part of}} ribbon to the lateral grounds. The potential of miniaturization based on the enhancement of the constant of propagation is evaluated for different configurations up to 40 %.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{distributed}} adaptive estimation over networks where nodes cooperate to estimate physical parameters that can vary over both space and time domains. We use a set of basis functions to characterize the space-varying nature of the parameters and propose a diffusion least mean-squares (LMS) strategy to recover these parameters from successive time measurements. We analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm, and derive closed-form expressions to predict its learning behavior and steady-state performance in terms of mean-square error. We find that in the estimation of the space-varying parameters using distributed approaches, the covariance matrix of the regression data at each node becomes rank-deficient. Our analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm can overcome this difficulty {{to a large extent}} by benefiting from the network stochastic matrices that are used to <b>combine</b> <b>exchanged</b> information between nodes. We provide computer experiments to illustrate and support the theoretical findings. Comment: IEEE Transaction on Signal Processing, Oct. 201...|$|R
