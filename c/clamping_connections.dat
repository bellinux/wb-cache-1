40|$|Shape-memory-materials show good {{actuating}} properties {{based on}} their high reversible strain potential. The implicit positioning range can profitably be used in micro machines, if detachable connections between shape-memory-elements and adjacent steel-components are sufficiently realized. In this paper theoretical approaches to describe the design principles of the shaft to collar connections are followed by experimental validation of clamping and pressfit connections. The variation of the preload for <b>clamping</b> <b>connections</b> can be predicted if the temperature-dependent elasticity of the shape-memory element is known. The experimental results for longitudinal pressfit connections match the extended theoretical elastic plastic model. The load transfer is characterized by considerable slip between shaft and collar even if small loads are applied. This results in huge hysteresis for cyclic loading. The evaluation of the surface appearance confirms the necessity of the calculated large joint length. Dependent on the temperature and the micro structure of the shape-memory-component different wear mechanisms are of major importance. (orig.)

50|$|Most Phanerochaetaceae {{species are}} crust-like. Their hyphal system is monomitic (containing only {{generative}} hyphae), and these hyphae lack <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b> Their spores are thin-walled, smooth, and hyaline (translucent).

Although rare, some species have a polyporoid form, a dimitic hyphal system, and <b>clamp</b> <b>connections.</b> Phanerochaetaceae fungi produce a white rot.|$|R
50|$|The hyphal {{system of}} Clavaria species is always monomitic.

50|$|<b>Clamp</b> <b>connections</b> {{are formed}} by the {{terminal}} hypha during elongation. Before the <b>clamp</b> <b>connection</b> is formed this terminal segment contains two nuclei. Once the terminal segment is long enough it begins to form the <b>clamp</b> <b>connection.</b> At the same time, each nucleus undergoes mitotic division to produce two daughter nuclei. As the clamp continues to develop it uptakes one of the daughter (green circle) nuclei and separates it from its sister nucleus. While this is occurring the remaining nuclei (orange circles) begin to migrate from one another to {{opposite ends of the}} cell. Once all these steps have occurred a septum forms, separating each set of nuclei.|$|R
