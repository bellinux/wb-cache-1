5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

25|$|When Maury {{was first}} granted its AOC, the minimum Grenache {{percentage}} required was only 50%, but that figure has risen steadily {{over the years}} and today Maury wines must be made from at least 75% Grenache noir with pre-2000 vintages grandfathered to require minimum of 70%. In reality, most Maury are 90-100% Grenache though other varieties are permitted to be used. These include Macabeo, which is limited to constituting no more than 10% of the blend (15% maximum for pre-2000 vintages), and Carignan, Cinsault, Listan Negra and Syrah which collectively <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> up more than 10% of the blend. Other white grape varieties beyond Macabeo are also permitted including Grenache blanc, Grenache gris, Tourbat, Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains and Muscat of Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|Every type of experiential content {{belonging}} to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural {{state that is}} a spontaneously present buddha—a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever sentient being. Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can describe, {{in a way that}} also transcends the reach of the intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena {{belonging to}} samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha—purity and perfection.|$|E

25|$|Players <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any {{use of any}} outside information. This {{includes}} advice, notes, {{and analysis}} of another chess board. During play, a player is forbidden to have a mobile phone and/or other electronic means of communication in the playing venue.

Chess scoresheets may be used for recording matters relevant to the game. Players should not distract or annoy their competitor in any way. Once a player has finished their game, they are considered a spectator. Refusal of a player to comply with the rules may result in penalty, up to and including forfeiture of the game or even disqualification of the player. If two opponents both refuse to obey the rules, the game may be considered lost by both players.
