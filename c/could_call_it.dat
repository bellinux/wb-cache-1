500|$|Shira is {{frequently}} shown playing the accordion, which Hadas Yaron {{did not know}} how to play. She described it as a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if you <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [...] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
2500|$|The {{product has}} a cult-like following. [...] Famous chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and David Chang have favored the product. [...] Food Republic {{reported}} that Chef John Currence said: [...] "There's Pappy Van Winkle, then there's everything else." [...] Bourbon aficionados {{have shown up}} in droves to get a small chance in a lottery to purchase some. It has been called [...] "the bourbon everyone wants {{but no one can}} get". A writer for The Wall Street Journal said [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> bourbon, or you <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a $5,000 bottle of liquified, barrel-aged unobtanium." [...] Jen Doll wrote in The Wire, [...] "It's an age-old dilemma (supply and demand) leading to an age-old marketing dream (a product that can't be kept on the shelves ... money in the pockets ... bourbon in the bourbon snifters)." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{can be done}} best between men. Your capital, Clara, is {{some five}} {{thousand}} pounds, but it is out on a mortgage, and you <b>could</b> not <b>call</b> <b>it</b> in." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gaahl is {{strongly}} opposed to Christianity. He {{has often been}} mistaken as a Satanist, but objects to being labeled as such. In a 1995 interview, he stated: [...] "I am my own God as I am my own Satan. So I'm not a Satanist judging by those terms". He jokingly added: [...] "Maybe you <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Gaahlism". He reiterated this belief in the documentary True Norwegian Black Metal when he said: [...] "The god within yourself is the only true god". In an interview for the documentary —at which time he was Gorgoroth's vocalist—Gaahl was asked what inspired the band's music, to which his sole reply was [...] "Satan". When asked what Satan represented, he again answered with a single word: [...] "Freedom".|$|E
2500|$|Commenting {{on later}} novels in the series, Lester del Rey in Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact wrote of The Hostage of Zir that [...] "here's {{only one way}} to {{describe}} it's a new Krishna novel. And like de Camp's other popular Krishna novels, it's a wry and wacky story of a human forced to contend with the semicivilized and semihuman cultures of an alien world where Murphy's law always holds good, and nothing ever goes according to plan. You <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> sword-and-sorcery, since swords are buckled with a touch of swash, and human science is a sort of magic to the too-human but egg-laying Krishnans. But the adventure is always cock-eyed." [...] He concludes that [...] "f you've read and enjoyed the other stories of Krishna, you'll want this one. If you haven't read any, this is a good one to start with." ...|$|E
2500|$|... company, {{independent}} of the HAS [...] but fed by the HAS. We don't want a clinic. We want one in operation but not in name. Perhaps we <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a Spiritual Guidance Center. Think up its name, will you. And we could put in nice desks and our boys in neat blue with diplomas {{on the walls and}} 1.knock psychotherapy into history and 2.make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3.keep the HAS solvent. It is a problem of practical business. I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell. A religious charter would be necessary in Pennsylvania or NJ to make it stick. But I sure could make it stick. We're treating the present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain. And brother, that's religion, not mental science.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{original}} [...] "fruit-flavored" [...] iMacs released in 1999 was the Tangerine iMac (Apple <b>could</b> not <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "Orange" [...] due {{to the existence of}} the rival firm Orange Micro).|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} {{companion}} dryly, [...] "chopping big trees. I've a ranch there. Still, I don't {{know that you}} <b>could</b> exactly <b>call</b> <b>it</b> practising. By this time, I've acquired a certain proficiency in the thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{a unique}} and {{beautiful}} album for many reasons. One <b>could</b> even <b>call</b> <b>it</b> an interdisciplinary album. The CD combines storytelling, poetry and beautiful visuals {{as well as the}} expertly played music. ~The Flute View, New York ...|$|R
2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes as she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, H. V. Evatt {{passed through}} Moree to {{campaign}} for the [...] "no" [...] case in the 1951 referendum, at which the Menzies Liberal government was attempting to alter the Constitution of Australia in order to ban the Australian Communist Party. Evatt was addressing a small crowd {{from the back of}} a blue Holden ute, discussing the upcoming referendum and the Constitution, and Gaudron, not knowing what Evatt was referring to, asked [...] "Please sir, what's a Constitution?" [...] Evatt explained that it was [...] "the laws by which Parliaments were governed." [...] Gaudron asked whether it was similar to the Ten Commandments and Evatt replied that [...] "you <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the Ten Commandments of government." [...] Gaudron then asked for a copy and Evatt subsequently sent her one in the mail. Gaudron, expecting two stone tablets, was disappointed to receive only a small pamphlet. However, when the school bullies declared the pamphlet useless, Gaudron retorted that it was of great use to lawyers, and that some day she would be one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe {{you could}} write some verses about that girl," [...] {{suggested}} Sam to Songbird, in a whisper. [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'The Cowboy's Sweetheart,' or something like that." ...|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{name for}} the species is Amphianthus pusillus,coined in 1837. D.Estes & R.L.Small wanted to {{transfer}} the species to Gratiola, but <b>could</b> not <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Gratiola pusilla because Willdenow had already used this name for another species. Hence the replacement name, Gratiola amphiantha.|$|R
6000|$|... "The other yesterday. But {{a funeral}} you <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> signore; {{it was a}} dull little passeggio of two gondolas. Poveretta!" [...] the man continued, referring apparently to Miss Tita. His conception of funerals was apparently that they were mainly to amuse the living.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, {{the name}} was changed to The Far Side. In The Prehistory of the Far Side, Larson commented, [...] "They <b>could</b> have <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Revenge of the Zucchini People for all I cared" [...] as he {{was so happy to}} be eagerly {{accepted}} into the San Francisco Chronicle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry {{remembered that}} he'd want the wagon to-morrow, and there's a bolt loose," [...] he explained. [...] "It didn't seem to occur to {{him until he}} noticed you. I suppose one <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a coincidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you {{want to send}} me away. Now, I {{had almost}} fancied I had made things easier in various ways for you, {{and we have been}} good comrades, haven't we? One <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Tommy!" [...] said Celia, {{with her}} {{broadest}} smile. [...] "Won't that be enough? I got Betty {{to show me}} how to make a cottage pudding. I guess we <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a flat pudding if we wanted to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we <b>could</b> hardly <b>call</b> <b>it</b> fighting," [...] {{answered}} the captain, with a smile, as he cleaned the glasses of his telescope and swept the horizon carefully; [...] "we had a round {{or two of}} the guns, and a few bullets whistled about our ears for a little--that was all." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand. It was white now and shapely, but one <b>could</b> not have <b>called</b> <b>it</b> small. Strong it felt and firm as it gripped mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{proposal}} is this. I {{do not know}} that in the strict use of words you <b>could</b> altogether <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a compromise, still it has something of that character. My {{proposal is}} that the Government (acting, as I presume, through your Museum) should pay Professor Chadd L800 a year until he stops dancing." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{abandoned}} {{himself to}} a fancy which had been working {{to the surface of}} his thought. [...] "We <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> our Silver Wedding Journey, and go round to all the old places, and see them in the reflected light of the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "... You don't {{know the}} half of it, dearie, you don't know {{the half of}} it! A {{one-piece}} bathing suit! Well, you <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that, but the cop of the beach said {{it was more like}} a baby's sock. And when...." ...|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. Do I? Then can't {{you paint}} {{me into the}} picture as well as Mamma? You <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'A Mother and Daughter' or simply 'Two ladies.' if the moon thinks that calling me her {{daughter}} would make her seem too old.|$|E
50|$|The {{growth of}} {{production}} output does not reveal {{anything about the}} performance of the production process. The performance of production measures production’s ability to generate income. Because the income from production is generated in the real process, we <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the real income. Similarly, as the production function is an expression of the real process, we <b>could</b> also <b>call</b> <b>it</b> “income generated by the production function”.|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke to}} her, {{and then turned}} away. The {{character}} of his manner was embarrassment. She <b>could</b> not have <b>called</b> <b>it</b> either cold or friendly, or anything so certainly as embarrassed.|$|R
50|$|The theatre retains {{many of its}} {{original}} features and was Grade II* listed in September 1960. The Palladium had its own telephone system so the occupants of boxes <b>could</b> <b>call</b> one another. <b>It</b> also had a revolving stage.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is false!" [...] I cried, {{springing}} up and seizing both his hands. [...] "It was an accident. No one <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a murder. Oh, my father, my father, {{that you should}} have suffered like this for so slight a cause!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Harry thoughtfully, [...] "you <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> most {{of twelve}} years. I {{used to go}} whittling with a toy {{tomahawk}} soon after I could walk. Of course, they confiscated the thing now and then. Once it was after I'd just brought down a one-leg round table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, we kept house together, if you <b>could</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> so. Stephen {{does not}} give much trouble in that way. He only drinks water and only eats herbs and fruits. He is the gardener," [...] added Gerard, smiling. [...] "I don't know how we shall fare when he leaves me." ...|$|E
40|$|Of {{course we}} <b>could</b> have <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Evolution and Global Warming, but our guest Randy Olsen might night {{think it was}} as engaging. Harvard-trained biology {{professor}} turned film director, Randy will chat about his films “Flock of Dodos” and “Sizzle: A Global Warming Comedy” and how film {{can be used to}} better engage the public in a discussion of controversial science topics...|$|R
5000|$|... "You <b>could</b> legitimately <b>call</b> <b>it</b> {{a victory}} for men, {{that we now have}} men famous for doing nothing," [...] Kimmel noted. He also observes that the origin of the himbo {{stereotype}} can be seen in mid 20th century television shows, whose audiences were primarily women, [...] "that traditionally present Mother as the all-wise and Father as a bit of a bumbling idiot".|$|R
6000|$|... "He was amusing," [...] {{she said}} slowly, picking her words. [...] "He came here {{once or twice}} when you were out, and on a few {{occasions}} I met him by accident on the prairie and at the settlement. I suppose I was--pleasant--to him, but nobody <b>could</b> have <b>called</b> <b>it</b> more than that. Then there was a change in his attitude." ...|$|R
