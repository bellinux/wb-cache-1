The actual sensor is a Hall plate realized in a standard CMOS digital process, exploiting its N-Well diffusion.

40|$|Power {{reduction}} {{is a central}} priority in battery-powered medical implantable devices, particularly pacemakers, to either increase battery lifetime or decrease size using a smaller battery. Low Power Analog CMOS for Cardiac Pacemakers proposes new techniques for the reduction of power consumption in analog integrated circuits. Our main example is the pacemaker sense channel, which is representative of a broader class of biomedical circuits aimed at qualitatively detecting biological signals. The first and second chapters are a tutorial presentation on implantable medical devices and pacemakers from the circuit designer point of view. This {{is illustrated by the}} requirements and solutions applied in our implementation of an industrial IC for pacemakers. There from, the book discusses the means for reduction of power consumption at three levels: base technology, power-oriented analytical synthesis procedures and circuit architecture. At the technology level, we analyze the impact that the application of the fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD SOI) technology has on this kind of analog circuits. The basic building block levels as well as the system level (pacemaker sense channel) are considered. Concerning the design technique, we apply a methodology, based on the transconductance to current ratio that exploits all regions of inversion of the MOS transistor. Various performance aspects of analog building blocks are modeled and a power optimization synthesis of OTAs for a given total settling time (including the slewing and linear regions) is proposed.

Most of the ADCs have a pre-ampliﬁer implemented for driving the large input capacitance of the ADC or amplifying the weak naturally occurred input signals. One of the key factors in designing a pre-ampliﬁer is its signal to noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) as the noise and distortion introduced by the pre-ampliﬁer might degrade the eﬀective number of bits (ENOB) of ADC. This work introduces a high gain, high bandwidth, wide input common mode range (ICMR), and highly linear fully diﬀerential folded cascode pre-ampliﬁer for a 14 -bit analog to digital converter. The system uses native n-channel transistors as diﬀerential input pair to achieve a wide ICMR with minimum transconductance variation. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the pre-ampliﬁer is minimized over diﬀerent process corners.

The Op Amp will be realized in a semi custom CMOS process with minimum channel lengths of 1 Opm. Simulations show that the minimum supply voltage is less than 2. 5 V. A unity gain bandwidth of 550 kHz and a DC voltage gain larger than 80 dB are feasible. The input range exceeds the supply rails, whereas the output range reaches the rails within 130 mV...|$|R
40|$|This {{wireless}} transponder recovers {{power and}} a reference clock from an incident RF signal and returns data on a 900 MHz carrier. A multi-stage voltage multiplier/rectifier converts the received low power RF signal to a useful DC voltage and stores the energy on a storage capacitor. The injection locking technique facilitates power efficient generation of a low phase noise 900 MHz internal clock from the received 450 MHz signal by employing a fully integrated low power LC oscillator. A fully integrated pseudodifferential power amplifier operating in <b>class</b> <b>AB</b> regime is used as the <b>output</b> <b>stage</b> of the system. The system dissipates an average of 5 µA in standby mode and 1. 1 mA during active operation...|$|R
3000|$|The AC 30 is {{an iconic}} guitar tube amplifier, first {{introduced}} by the VOX company in 1959 [13]. This <b>class</b> <b>AB</b> [14] amplifier uses four cathode-biased EL- 84 tubes in the <b>output</b> <b>stage.</b> In 1961, a [...] "Top Boost"-unit, an additional circuit box including treble and bass controls and an extra gain stage was introduced for the AC 30. Due to its immediate popularity among users, the Top Boost unit was integrated into the AC 30 circuitry from 1963 onwards. The distinct [...] "jangly" [...] sound of the AC 30 amplifier can be heard on many records from several bands such as the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Queen, R. E. M., and U 2, from the last five decades.|$|R
