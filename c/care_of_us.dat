2500|$|Escrivá's {{younger brother}} Santiago stated {{that his brother}} [...] "loved {{the members of his}} family" [...] and took good care of them. When their father died, he says, Escrivá told their mother that [...] "she should stay calm, because he will always take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> And he {{fulfilled}} this promise." [...] Escrivá would find time in his busy schedule to chat and take a walk with his younger brother, acting like a father towards him. When the family transferred to Madrid, he obeyed the instructions of their father that he obtain a doctorate in Law. [...] "Thanks to his docility to this advice", says Santiago, [...] "he was able to support the family by giving classes in Law, and with this he acquired a juridical mentality ... which would later be so necessary to do Opus Dei." [...] Monsignor Escrivá also modified his first name. From José María, he changed it to the original Josemaría. Biographers state, that around 1935 , [...] "he joined his first two names because his single love for the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph were equally inseparable".|$|E

40|$|Anthrax {{in humans}} {{in many parts}} of the world is largely an {{occupational}} disease and is acquired by entry of the infecting agent through the cut or abraded skin or by inhalation of dusts containing sufficient numbers of spores. The cutaneous type in such circumstances is by far the commonest; pulmonary, anthrax is much less common. Described cases of anthrax meningitis are few. This would at first seem surprising, as the disease in animals is so often and dramatically septicaemic, but is probably accounted for by the fact that the organism is less pathogenic to man than to animals.

The usual local treatment over the years produced little relief. He came under the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> (J.
