40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of proton MR Spectroscopic (MRS) imaging in the detection and localization of prostate cancer, prospectively compared with histopathologic findings. Magnetic Resonance (<b>MR)</b> <b>and</b> <b>MRS</b> imaging were performed in 65 patients with high levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and suspicious areas at the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). At MR areas of interest were reported as normal, equivocal or suspicious. At MRS imaging, cancer was diagnosed as "possible" if the ratio of choline plus creatine to citrate exceeded 2 SDs above mean normal peripheral zone values or as "definite" if the ratio exceeded 3 SDs. All patients underwent a TRUS 10 -core biopsy within 30 days of the imaging study. MR alone showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values and accuracy for detection of prostate cancer of 85 %, 76 %, 53 %, 91 % and 65 %, respectively, whereas MRS alone showed 89 %, 77 %, 78 %, 69 % and 83 %, respectively. These values were 71 %, 90 %, 89 %, 74 % and 80 % when the prostate was evaluated combining <b>MR</b> <b>and</b> <b>MRS.</b> The addition of MRS to the MR imaging provides a higher specificity in tumour detection and can be recommended as a problem-solving modality for patients with elevated PSA levels and suspicious TRUS before biopsy...|$|R

50|$|For the {{encryption}} functions {{used in the}} Shamir algorithm and the Massey-Omura algorithm described above, {{the security}} relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in a finite field. If an attacker could compute discrete logarithms in GF(p) for the Shamir method or GF(2n) for the Massey-Omura method then the protocol could be broken. The key s could be computed from the messages <b>mr</b> <b>and</b> <b>mrs.</b> When s is known, {{it is easy to}} compute the decryption exponent t. Then the attacker could compute m by raising the intercepted message ms to the t power. K. Sakurai and H. Shizuya show that under certain assumptions breaking Massey-Omura cryptosystem is equivalent to the Diffie-Hellman assumption.|$|R
