40|$|Objectives The Dutch {{guideline}} {{for cancer}} rehabilitation recommends patients {{to engage in}} multicomponent interventions, i. e. several single interventions combined into a rehabilitation programme. To perform a health economic evaluation of this guideline, data on the cost-effectiveness of these multicomponent interventions is required. However, to date, the interventions´ (cost-) effectiveness is almost exclusively assessed for the single interventions, rather than for the multicomponent intervention, which challenges the health economic analysis of the multicomponent interventions. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify or develop a method that allows to deduct the cost-effectiveness of multicomponent interventions from published data of the single interventions. Methods We searched the literature for articles offering a method or ideas for the development of a method for assessing the cost-effectiveness of multicomponent interventions on the basis of data on the single interventions. The <b>cost-effectiveness</b> gap <b>analysis</b> method, which can be used for assessing the maximum cost of an intervention given a certain willingness-to-pay, was identified as suitable and was further developed to allow assessing if a multidimensional programmes is cost-effective, based on the (cost-) effectiveness data of the single interventions. Results <b>Cost-effectiveness</b> gap <b>analysis</b> was identified in the literature as being a suitable method, with further refinement. We suggested to first calculate the costs of all interventions. Given the effectiveness of one intervention it is then possible to estimate how much additional effectiveness a second (or any subsequent) intervention would have to provide so that the multicomponent intervention remains cost-effective, given a range of ceiling ratios. Recommendations for methods for estimating the additional effect of subsequent interventions were deducted from the literature identified. Conclusions We suggest estimating the cost-effectiveness of the combined interventions as recommended in clinical guidelines by performing a refined <b>cost-effectiveness</b> gap <b>analysis</b> metho...|$|R
