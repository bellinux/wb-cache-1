40|$|The use of {{different}} 			pressuremeters for in-situ soil testing is now well established. The 			pressuremeters, which provide high quality design parameters, are 			affordable on high cost projects only. Small cost projects permit 			the use of low cost techniques only (e. g. SPT), which often yield 			poor quality design parameters. Usually pressuremeters are employed 			for soil characterization using pre-bored or self-boring or 			full-displacement techniques. There {{was a need}} to develop a device 			in Pakistan that could be used as pre-bored as well as 			full-displacement pressuremeter for characterizing the alluvial soil 			deposits of Punjab province. Moreover, the new device should be 			simple, robust, cost effective and still produces parameters of high 			quality. 			This thesis describes the development of such a new in-situ testing 			device; namely the New Pressuremeter. Certain modifications have 			been made to the design of Newcastle Full-Displacement Pressuremeter 			(NFDPM), developed earlier by Akbar (2001) that has a radial 			displacement measurement system. The length of the probe of NFDPM is 			 420 mm (length to diameter ratio of 8. 4), which creates handling 			problems in the field. To overcome this difficulty it was decided to 			reduce the length of the test section and to keep the length of the 			probe of the new device equal to the length of SPT split spoon 			sampler to get benefit from the available large SPT data. On the 			basis of this fact, the length of the probe of the new device was 			taken as 305 mm giving length to diameter ratio of 6. 3. The analysis 			of a pressuremeter test {{is based on the assumption}} that the membrane 			expands as a right circular cylinder. 			With modifications, the new pressuremeter was developed using most 			of the local resources. The main body of the 48. 2 mm diameter (D) 			probe is made of high strength stainless steel. Both ends of the 			main body are identical. The upper end of the probe is connected to 			drill rods used to push the probe into place. A pressure hose and 			electrical <b>cable</b> <b>pass</b> through the drill rods and are connected to 			the probe by a re-usable hydraulic fitting. A 45 Â° stainless steel 			cone having a maximum diameter of 50. 8 mm (surface area 28. 5 cm 2) is 			screwed onto the base of the probe. The cone creates a cavity, which 			is 5...|$|E

50|$|Bowden cables can {{cease to}} {{function}} smoothly, particularly if water or contaminants {{get into the}} housing. (Modern lined and stainless steel cables are less prone to these problems; unlined housings should be lubricated with a light machine oil.) In cold climates Bowden cable mechanisms are prone to malfunction due to water freezing. Cables also wear through use over a long time, and can be damaged through kinking or raveling. A common failure occurs on bicycles {{at the point where}} the housing enters a barrel adjuster; loose housing ends tend to fray the housing, making adjustments uncertain. Fraying due to fatigue is most likely if the <b>cable</b> <b>passes</b> over a pulley, which on bicycles is often below the recommended diameter, or where the cable is bent repeatedly where it attaches to the brake lever or caliper. A <b>cable</b> <b>passing</b> around a sharp bend tend to furrow the inner cable sleeve, leading to contact with the outer housing and rub fraying. A frayed cable can suddenly break when force is applied strongly, e.g. during emergency braking.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{anterior}} {{approach to}} the hip gained popularity for total hip arthroplasty in recent years. Distal extension of the anterior approach, sometimes needed intraoperatively, potentially endangers neurovascular structures to the quadriceps. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the anatomical structures placed at risk by distal extension of the anterior {{approach to the}} hip. Methods: Seventeen cadaveric hemipelves from twelve human specimens were dissected. The femoral nerve and its branches and the vessels arising from the lateral femoral circumflex artery were assessed in relation to the distal extension of the anterior approach. The damage caused by the introduction of a cerclage <b>cable</b> <b>passer</b> was also investigated. Results: The area immediately distal to the intertrochanteric line is a common entry point for several nerve branches and is a useful distal landmark for surgeons to use to protect important neurovascular structures. The distal extension of the anterior approach compromises the nerve supply to the anterolateral portions of the quadriceps. Introduction of a cerclage <b>cable</b> <b>passer</b> through the anterior access also jeopardizes nerve branches to the vastus lateralis, lateral parts of the vastus intermedius, and branches of the lateral femoral circumflex artery. Conclusions: Distal extension of the direct anterior approach to the hip is challenging to accomplish without neurovascular injury to anterolateral parts of the quadriceps muscle group. In addition, important neurovascular structures are endangered with the introduction of a <b>cable</b> <b>passer</b> through the anterior approach. Clinical Relevance: Distal extension of the direct anterior approach to the hip beyond the intertrochanteric line may compromise neurovascular structures supplying the quadriceps muscle. The direct anterior approach for total hip arthroplasty has recently gained popularity with good clinical results. However, there have been reports of intraoperative complications, such as femoral fracture, implant failure, and muscle trauma 7 - 12, that may require an extension of the surgical approach. Kennon et al. 1 reported that the direct anterior approach could be safely extended proximally and distally even in complex revisions without clinically relevant nerve injuries. Furthermore, a textbook on surgical exposures describes and recommends this option 13. While proximal extension with detachment of the tensor fascia femoris and gluteal muscles from the pelvis is part of the Smith-Petersen approach, distal extension could endanger neurovascular structures. The anatomical relationship of nerve branches and blood vessels to the quadriceps with respect to the anterior approach has not been documented, to our knowledge. The purpose of this cadaver study was to demonstrate the neurovascular structures encountered during the direct anterior approach to the hip joint with special emphasis on potential distal extension or the placement of a cerclage <b>cable</b> <b>passer</b> around the proximal part of the femur...|$|R

The Laboratory Telerobotic Manipulator (LTM) is a highly advanced 7 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) telerobotic/robotic manipulator. It was developed and built for the Automation Technology Branch at NASA's Langley Research Center (LaRC) for work in research and to demonstrate ground-based telerobotic manipulator system hardware and software systems for future NASA applications in the hazardous environment of space. The LTM manipulator uses an embedded wiring design with all electronics, motor power, and control and communication <b>cables</b> <b>passing</b> through the pitch-yaw differential joints. This design requires the number of <b>cables</b> <b>passing</b> through the pitch/yaw joint to be kept to a minimum. To eliminate the cables needed to carry each pitch-yaw joint's sensor data to the VME control computers, a custom-embedded electronics package for each manipulator joint was developed. The electronics package collects and sends the joint's sensor data to the VME control computers over a fiber optic cable. The electronics package consist of five individual subsystems: the VME Link Processor, the Joint Processor and the Joint Processor power supply in the joint module, the fiber optics communications system, and the electronics and motor power cabling...|$|R
