5|$|A {{variety of}} peptide {{coupling}} reagents {{can also be}} used to prepare Weinreb–Nahm amides from carboxylic acids. Various carbodiimide-, hydroxybenzotriazole-, and triphenylphosphine-based <b>couplings</b> have been reported specifically for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Rollingstock in Victoria {{has used}} air braking since tests of {{continuous}} train brakes {{were carried out}} in 1884. Initially screw <b>couplings</b> were used to connect wagons, but from 1924 automatic knuckle couplers were introduced, with buffers removed from freight wagons by 1960.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{generate}} transmission zeroes in stopbands {{for the purpose}} to improve filter selectivity, a number of supplementary <b>couplings</b> besides the nearest <b>couplings</b> are often made in the filters. They are called cross <b>couplings.</b> These <b>couplings</b> bring to foundation of several wave paths from the input port to the output port. Amplitudes of waves transmitted through different paths may compensate themselves at some separate frequencies while summing at the output port. Such the compensation results in transmission zeroes.|$|E
25|$|In the Standard Model, {{all of the}} quark and lepton Yukawa <b>couplings</b> {{are small}} {{compared}} to the top quark Yukawa coupling. Understanding this hierarchy in the fermion masses is an open problem in theoretical physics. Yukawa <b>couplings</b> are not constants and their values change depending on the energy scale (distance scale) at which they are measured. The dynamics of Yukawa <b>couplings</b> {{are determined by the}} renormalization group equation.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea is to}} {{integrate}} out lattice spins iteratively, generating a flow in <b>couplings.</b> But now the <b>couplings</b> are lattice energy coefficients. The fact that a continuum description exists guarantees that this iteration will converge to a fixed point when the temperature is tuned to criticality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Couplings</b> {{are needed}} for any {{continuous}} braking systems.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{automatic}} train <b>couplings,</b> most of which are mutually incompatible.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian <b>couplings</b> are not {{particularly}} strong, and may be supplemented by auxiliary chains.|$|E
25|$|In 7 mm scale, scale working Norwegian <b>couplings</b> are {{now being}} {{manufactured}} by Zamzoodled in the UK.|$|E
25|$|An {{episode of}} the 1958 TV series Casey Jones was devoted to the {{problems}} of link-and-pin <b>couplings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Yukawa <b>couplings</b> of the up, down, charm, {{strange and}} bottom quarks, are {{hypothesized}} to have small values at the extremely high energy scale of grand unification, 1015GeV. They {{increase in value}} at lower energy scales, at which the quark masses are generated by the Higgs. The slight growth is due to corrections from the QCD coupling. The corrections from the Yukawa <b>couplings</b> are negligible for the lower mass quarks.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} {{that connects the}} <b>couplings</b> to the rolling stock {{is known as the}} draft gear or draw gear.|$|E
25|$|Articulated sets of {{carriages}} or wagons {{share the}} intermediate bogies, {{and have no}} need for <b>couplings</b> in the intermediate positions.|$|E
25|$|Diesel–hydraulic {{drive is}} common in {{multiple}} units, with various transmission designs used including Voith torque converters, and fluid <b>couplings</b> in combination with mechanical gearing.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} Ising model and repeating this {{iteration}} eventually changes all the <b>couplings.</b> When {{the temperature is}} higher than the critical temperature, the <b>couplings</b> will converge to zero, since the spins at large distances are uncorrelated. But when the temperature is critical, there will be nonzero coefficients linking spins at all orders. The flow can be approximated by only considering the first few terms. This truncated flow will produce better and better approximations to the critical exponents when more terms are included.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} types of coupling do not always have formal or official names, which makes descriptions of the <b>couplings</b> in use on any railway system problematic.|$|E
25|$|Traumatic {{insemination}} is {{not limited}} to male–female <b>couplings.</b> Male homosexual traumatic inseminations have been observed in the flower bug Xylocoris maculipennis and bed bugs of the genus Afrocimex.|$|E
25|$|The <b>couplings</b> {{between the}} {{position}} variables {{have been transformed}} away; if the Q and Π were Hermitian (which they are not), the transformed Hamiltonian would describe N uncoupled harmonic oscillators.|$|E
25|$|As already stated above, the {{distinction}} of low and high energy regimes is valid only for sufficiently strong JT <b>couplings,</b> that is, when several or many vibrational energy quanta fit into the energy window between the conical intersection and the minimum of the lower JT-split APES. For the many cases of small to intermediate JT <b>couplings</b> this energy window and the corresponding adiabatic low-energy regime does not exist. Rather, the levels on both JT-split APES are intricately mixed for all energies and the nuclear motion always proceeds on both JT split APES simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Not all Norwegian <b>couplings</b> are {{compatible}} with one another as they vary in height, width, and {{may or may not}} be limited to one hook at a time.|$|E
25|$|For small J, this quickly {{flows to}} zero coupling. Large Js flow to large <b>couplings.</b> The {{magnetization}} exponent is determined from {{the slope of}} the equation at the fixed point.|$|E
25|$|For example, the 4 H {{sites of}} 1,2-dichlorobenzene divide into two {{chemically}} equivalent pairs by symmetry, but an individual {{member of one}} of the pairs has different <b>couplings</b> to the spins making up the other pair.|$|E
25|$|The {{articulated}} {{design is}} advantageous during a derailment, as the passenger carriages {{are more likely}} to stay upright and in line with the track. Normal trains could split at <b>couplings</b> and jackknife, as seen in the Eschede train disaster.|$|E
25|$|In New South Wales, sets of {{carriages}} were permanently {{coupled with}} a fixed bar, since the carriages were disconnected only at the workshops. Freight cars are sometimes coupled in pairs or triplets, using bar <b>couplings</b> in between.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{automatic}} train <b>couplings</b> similar to the Scharfenberg coupler, but not necessarily compatible with it. Older US transit operators continue to use these non-Janney electro-pneumatic coupler designs and have used them for decades.|$|E
25|$|When Yang and Mills {{proposed}} the theory, {{there was no}} candidate vector boson. J. J. Sakurai in 1960 predicted {{that there should be}} a massive vector boson which is coupled to isospin, and predicted that it would show universal <b>couplings.</b> The rho mesons were discovered a short time later, and were quickly identified as Sakurai's vector bosons. The <b>couplings</b> of the rho to the nucleons and to each other were verified to be universal, as best as experiment could measure. The fact that the diagonal isospin current contains part of the electromagnetic current led to the prediction of rho-photon mixing and the concept of vector meson dominance, ideas which led to successful theoretical pictures of GeV-scale photon-nucleus scattering.|$|E
25|$|<b>Couplings</b> {{are used}} during {{shunting}} operations as the yard is on level ground (see photograph of No.6 at Llanberis). It was originally intended that each steam locomotive push two carriages to the summit, {{but this has}} not been normal practice since 1914.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{railroad}} car design, {{the brake}} van, was used on British and Commonwealth railways. These provided the additional function of {{serving as a}} supplemental braking system for trains not fitted with a continuous braking system, and keeping chain <b>couplings</b> taut.|$|E
25|$|Upset forging {{increases}} {{the diameter of}} the workpiece by compressing its length. Based on number of pieces produced, this is the most widely used forging process. A few examples of common parts produced using the upset forging process are engine valves, <b>couplings,</b> bolts, screws, and other fasteners.|$|E
25|$|Clearly a {{truncation}} {{should be}} chosen {{such that it}} incorporates as many features of the exact flow as possible. Although it is an approximation, the truncated flow still exhibits the nonperturbative character of the FRGE, and the -functions can contain contributions from all powers of the <b>couplings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The gist of the RG is {{this group}} property: as the scale μ varies, the theory {{presents}} a self-similar replica of itself, and any scale {{can be accessed}} similarly from any other scale, by group action, a formal transitive conjugacy of <b>couplings</b> in the mathematical sense (Schröder's equation).|$|E
25|$|In British 00 scale (similar to H0 scale) models the 'tension lock' coupler {{developed}} by Tri-ang is standard. This {{is similar in}} operation to the meatchopper type of coupling. Remote uncoupling is possible by using a sprung ramp between the rails. The design of the hooks is such that the <b>couplings</b> will not uncouple when under tension (instead depressing the ramp). When the train is pushed over the ramp, it will lift the coupling hooks as the train passes over. By halting the train over the ramp, it is split at this point. While it works well, it is often seen as ugly and obtrusive (although smaller designs are available, these are not always fully compatible with other models) and many British modellers prefer to retrofit either Kadee types or working hook and chain <b>couplings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{tumbling}} of rigid molecules—that is, {{the random}} rotations of molecules in solution—plays {{a key role}} in the relaxations observed by nuclear magnetic resonance, particularly protein NMR and residual dipolar <b>couplings.</b> Rotational diffusion can also be observed by other biophysical probes such as fluorescence anisotropy, flow birefringence and dielectric spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{designs of}} fully {{automatic}} couplers in use worldwide, including the Scharfenberg coupler, various knuckle hybrids such as the Tightlock (used in the UK), the Wedgelock coupling, Dellner <b>couplings</b> (similar to Scharfenberg couplers in appearance), BSI coupling (Bergische Stahl Industrie, now Faiveley Transport) and the Schaku-Tomlinson Tightlock coupling.|$|E
25|$|The {{main engines}} are {{connected}} to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear manufactured in Finland by Valmet Rautpohja Works in co-operation with Renk AG. The gearbox is equipped with separate Renk multi disc clutches and Voith fluid <b>couplings</b> for the main engines. The hydrodynamic <b>couplings</b> that allow over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} are used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The gearbox itself is also designed to withstand the high thrust and torque loads caused by an open propeller operating in ice — the gear teeth are dimensioned to withstand loads up to five times the nominal value. The fully locking mechanical clutches are used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship is operating in open water or light ice conditions.|$|E
25|$|The report {{considered}} it surprising {{that there had}} been only eight deaths in the leading seven passenger coaches of the Liverpool train; some of these coaches were built to a new British Railways standard (all-steel construction, with buck-eye <b>couplings</b> and bodies welded to the underframe) and seemed to have fared better than older stock.|$|E
