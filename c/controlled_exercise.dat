In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that her songwriting had improved dramatically, [...] "becoming more relaxed, sexier, and less reliant on thudding clichés". [...] "One Sweet Day", [...] "Melt Away", [...] "Always Be My Baby", and [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] were {{singled out as}} highlights, while [...] "Fantasy" [...] featured what Holden described as [...] "some of the most gorgeously spun choral music to be found on a contemporary album". Los Angeles Times journalist Cheo H.

People deemed it Carey's best record, benefiting from [...] "funkier and mellower" [...] songs and the singer's improved control over her voice, [...] "evincing greater muscularity and agility". According to Encyclopedia of Popular Music writer Colin Larkin, [...] "some critics questioned whether Daydream was a <b>controlled</b> <b>exercise</b> in vacuous formula writing, with little emotion or heart." [...] Reviewing the record for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker preferred the [...] "less dignified tunes"—particularly [...] "Daydream Interlude (Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix)"—over the [...] "monuments to assiduous good taste" [...] in [...] "When I Saw You" [...] and [...] "I Am Free", which he panned as overwrought ballads. Tucker nonetheless called the album Carey's best since her 1990 self-titled debut.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background While {{one in ten}} Australians {{suffer from}} chronic low back pain this {{condition}} remains extremely difficult to treat. Many contemporary treatments are of unknown value. One potentially useful therapy {{is the use of}} motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise.</b> This therapy has a biologically plausible effect, is readily available in primary care and it is of modest cost. However, to date, the efficacy of motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise</b> has not been established. Methods This paper describes the protocol for a clinical trial comparing the effects of motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise</b> versus placebo in the treatment of chronic non-specific low back pain. One hundred and fifty-four participants will be randomly allocated to receive an 8 -week program of motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise</b> or placebo (detuned short wave and detuned ultrasound). Measures of outcomes will be obtained at follow-up appointments at 2, 6 and 12 months after randomisation. The primary outcomes are: pain, global perceived effect and patient-generated measure of disability at 2 months and recurrence at 12 months. Discussion This trial will be the first placebo-controlled trial of motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise.</b> The results will inform best practice for treating chronic low back pain and prevent its occurrence. </p...|$|R

40|$|Context: Therapeutic {{exercises}} are frequently prescribed {{to patients with}} low back pain. Numerous exercise programs for patients with low back pain have been described. Many of these treatment programs are based on 1 of 2 popular rehabilitation strategies: a motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise</b> approach or a general exercise approach. Data Sources: PubMed clinical queries from 1966 to March 2013 for keyword combinations including motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise,</b> core stability exercise, therapeutic exercise, general exercise, global exercise, local exercise, transversus abdominis, segmental stabilization, and low back pain. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials that assessed {{the effects of a}} motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise</b> approach, a general exercise approach, or both for patients with low back pain that were published in scientific peer-reviewed journals. Data Extraction: Included studies underwent appraisal for exercise intervention and outcomes. Results: Fifteen studies were identified (8, motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise</b> approach without general exercise comparison; 7, general exercise approach with or without motor <b>control</b> <b>exercise</b> approach comparison). Current evidence suggests that exercise interventions may be effective at reducing pain or disability in patients with low back pain. Conclusion: Stabilization exercises for patients with low back pain may help to decrease pain and disability. It may not be necessary to prescribe exercises purported to restore motor control of specific muscles...|$|R

40|$|Background: Excessive {{weight gain}} during {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} short-term obstetric outcomes (gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, increased risk of cesarean delivery, preterm labor, increased postpartum weight retention) and short-term neonatal outcomes (macrosomic or large-for-gestational-age infants) but few adequately powered randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of a <b>controlled</b> <b>exercise</b> program during pregnancy {{in order to prevent}} that. Objective: This study examines whether a <b>controlled</b> <b>exercise</b> program during pregnancy could decrease the proportion of women who exceed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for gestational weight gains and, therefore, the consequences arising from that, and increase the proportion of women who return to pregravid weights by 6 months post-partum compared to those that just attend to standard care and receive general counseling. Methods and study design: This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial. A sample of 338 pregnant women will enter into the study through a non-probabilistic consecutive recruitment. Participants will be pregnant, normal-weight, overweight and obese women whose age will be between 18 and 40 years. Participants will be randomly assigned within the IOM weight category (normal-weight, overweight or obese) to standard care (n= 169) or to the <b>controlled</b> <b>exercise</b> program (n= 169) to prevent excessive gestational weight gain. The intervention includes 2 weekly sessions: one on land (gym hall) and one as an aquatic based activity (small pool tank). Apart from that, women can go for a fast walking on flat surface during 30 minutes {{the rest of the week}} that will have to be documented to the research team.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 by the American Physiological Society. Tendons can be {{considered}} in two functional groups, those contributing to energetics of locomotion and those acting solely to position the limb. The energy-storing tendons in both human and equine athletes have a high frequency of injury with similar pathophysiology. In previous studies, high-intensity exercise appears to induce a disruption of the matrix rather than functional adaptation in adults. Here we explore {{the hypothesis that the}} introduction of <b>controlled</b> <b>exercise</b> during growth would result in an adaptive response without deleterious effects. Young horses were given a <b>controlled</b> <b>exercise</b> program similar to that previously shown to induce matrix changes in energy-storing tendons of skeletally mature animals. The tendons were assessed in relation to mechanical properties, molecular composition, and morphology. Results showed a significant increase in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in the positional tendon but not in the energy-storing tendon. Other matrix properties and mechanical properties were not significantly changed. While the imposition of high-strain-rate exercise in immature horses failed to augment the development of the energy-storing tendon over and above that induced by normal pasture exercise, it did not induce deleterious changes, supporting an earlier introduction of athletic training in horses.

40|$|Objective A {{sedentary}} lifestyle {{has been associated}} with mental health disorders. Many medical conditions result in the cessation of exercise, which may increase the risk of developing mental health problems. The {{purpose of this article is}} to systematically review the literature examining the effects of exercise withdrawal on mental health. Method Literature was searched using PubMed, PsycINFO, and SPORTdiscus for studies that experimentally manipulated the withdrawal of exercise and included mental health as outcome measure. Results A total of 19 studies met inclusion criteria (total N = 689 with 385 individuals participating in an exercise withdrawal condition). Exercise withdrawal consistently resulted in increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety. Other mental health outcomes were investigated infrequently. Severe mental health issues requiring clinical intervention after experimentally <b>controlled</b> <b>exercise</b> withdrawal was rare. Heterogeneity in methods and outcomes was observed, especially in terms of the duration of exercise withdrawal (range 1 to 42 days, median = 7 days), with stronger effects if exercise withdrawal exceeded 2 weeks. Conclusion Experimentally <b>controlled</b> <b>exercise</b> withdrawal has adverse consequences for mental health. These observations in healthy individuals may help to understand the onset of mental health problems in response to acute and chronic medical conditions associated with reduced physical activity. Future research is needed to investigate potential mechanisms explaining the adverse mental health consequences of cessation of exercise that will provide new targets for clinical interventions...|$|E
