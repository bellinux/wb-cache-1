50|$|The {{farms in}} Rupe {{are small and}} there is little {{agricultural}} production because of the harsh climate; most of the villagers were tenant farmers in the past. The houses have pear and apple orchards. Economic activity was based on the production of wooden ware, especially wooden spoons, <b>crates</b> for <b>fruit,</b> and toothpicks. There was also some charcoal production, and mushrooms and blueberries were gathered and sold, especially in the Lošca area.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a drawing}} {{depicting}} William Wolfskill's Pasadena orange and lemon grove and residence, between Alameda and San Pedro Streets, Los Angeles, ca. 1882. The lithograph shows a railroad depot at bottom, {{from which a}} train is departing. Behind this, a horse-drawn wagon has parked in order to load on <b>crates</b> of <b>fruit</b> taken from the orchard of trees that fills {{the rest of the}} image. A second horse-drawn wagon makes its way along a set of railroad tracks in the very front...|$|R
50|$|Orange Crate Art is a 1995 album by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks {{released}} on Warner Bros. Records. The album's title {{refers to the}} sun-drenched, idealized paintings that grace wooden <b>fruit</b> <b>crates,</b> and its theme is a nostalgic view {{of the history of}} California.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of wagons {{loaded with}} {{food at the}} Old City Market at 3 rd Street and Central Avenue, Los Angeles, ca. 1910. <b>Crates</b> of <b>fruits</b> and {{vegetables}} clutter the sidewalks. Some of them are leaning diagonally and others are stacked. Cloth awnings {{can be seen at}} left covering sidewalk in front of the many buildings that line the street. The street is filled with parked carriages at right containing goods to be sold at the market. A two-story building is visible beyond the parked carriages at right...|$|R
50|$|Foraging is {{classified}} as a crafting puzzle because it uses up a pirate's labor supply; however, {{the end result is}} not the production of material goods, but rather tradable commodities such as fruits, gems, and gold. In August 2008, Foraging became the newest puzzle in the game. Somewhat similar to Bilging, and even more similar to Treasure Haul, players must rotate groups of four tiles to make columns or rows of three matching tiles. Clearing tiles drops the ones above them, which may include small <b>crates</b> of <b>fruit</b> or larger boxes of more valuable goods.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} of a citrus packing house, showing <b>crates</b> of <b>fruit</b> ready to be shipped, ca. 1930. At left are several long conveyor belts. Standing along side the conveyor belts are many women holding wooden crates. The women are pulling citrus fruits off the belts and putting them into the crates. A stack of full crates is visible in the foreground at right. In the background at left are several ramps that lead to the second story of the building. The floor is wooden, and metal rafters can be seen supporting the roof...|$|R

25|$|Dominion Monarch {{was laid}} up {{for six weeks}} in Tilbury but then resumed her route, sailing on 9 January 1940 via Cape Town, Fremantle and Melbourne to Sydney, where she arrived on 12 February. This time she did not {{continue}} to New Zealand, but spent 11 days at Sydney before starting her return voyage on 23 February. Because of the German submarine threat she attracted few passengers in either direction, so on her return voyage from Australia much of her passenger accommodation carried extra cargo. Her public rooms were stacked with <b>crates</b> of <b>fruit</b> and vegetables, and bales of wool were stowed on her games deck. She called at Melbourne and Cape Town, and reached The Downs on 1 April.|$|R

50|$|Since inception, the {{organization}} has significantly expanded its activities. In 1906, the CFGE launched the Citrus Protective League, a lobbying arm. In 1907, it formed the Fruit Growers Supply Company to supply growers with materials such as radios, tires, shooks for <b>fruit</b> <b>crates,</b> insecticides, and fertilizers at wholesale prices. It later formed the Sunkist's Exchange By-Products Company, which developed markets for products such as citric acid, sodium citrate, lemon oil, pectin, orange oil and orange pulp.|$|R

50|$|Baca {{grew up in}} {{a coastal}} fishing village Chorrillos, a {{district}} of the Lima Province of Peru, and part of greater Lima. Her music is a mixture of traditional and contemporary. Her backing band features indigenous Peruvian instruments such as the cajón ("wooden box", whose origins lie in an upturned <b>fruit</b> <b>crate),</b> udu (clay pot), and quijada (jawbone of a burro) cheko a dried gourd, as well as acoustic guitar and electric upright baby bass. Although many of her songs are based on traditional forms such as the landó or vals, she also incorporates elements of Cuban and Brazilian music. Her debut CD for Luaka Bop, produced by Greg Landau, brought her to the attention of World Music audiences worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Edible {{films and}} {{coatings}} {{have been applied}} on fruit to reduce aromatic compounds and texture loss and to increase the barrier to transport of fats and solutes. Furthermore, the surface layer on the product can protect the <b>fruit</b> <b>crating</b> a modified atmosphere that by controls the O 2 and CO 2 exchange, reducing respiration rate, metabolism and, consequently, the senescence. A new potential application of this technology {{is the use of}} edible coatings and films as carriers of diverse food additives such as antioxidants and antimicrobial agents. This review discusses the incorporation of functional ingredients into the edible coatings and films and highlights of the recent advance in the search for these incorporations. The future trends for the study area are also presented...|$|R
50|$|During World War II, in {{the period}} of the Italian Social Republic (or Salò Republic), three days after the Germans {{occupied}} Rome on 10 September 1943, Ferri bluffed his way back into the research facility at Guidonia, destroyed the vital equipment and filled a <b>fruit</b> <b>crate</b> with documents of his research before escaping underground. He secluded his wife and family near his home in Fiastra, in the Marche region of the Apennine Mountains (they later were moved on to an Adriatic fishing village), and in October 1943, organized with his brother, Giuseppe Ferri, the Banda Fiastra band of partisans.For the next year he coordinated attacks of the regions anti-fascist bands using the Valle del Fiastrone Valley as a safe haven to return to and to receive Allied air drops.|$|R
50|$|The growing {{of grapes}} in the {{municipality}} began with wine grapes {{in the early}} 1960s and has grown {{to be one of}} the most important agricultural products, featured on Tequisquiapan’s municipal seal. Reds, whites and rosés are produced but most are sparkling wines. The major producer in the municipality is Viñedos La Redonda, about twelve km outside of the town proper. The vineyards are mostly planted with vines of French origin such as Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec for reds and Chenin blanc and Trebbiano for whites. It has guided tours for visitors, especially at harvest time. One major producer of table grapes is Rancho San Miguel. The ranch extends over forty hectares and primarily produces Red Globe and Ribier Negra grapes. The ranch also raises 1,200 sheep which helps the ranch maintain an ecological balance through the production of fertilizer. The ranch produces 3,200 <b>crates</b> of the <b>fruit</b> daily during harvest.|$|R
5000|$|While it grew to be a {{relatively}} prosperous and busy hub of activity throughout {{the end of the}} 19th century, it was not incorporated as a city until February 15, 1908. By that time intensive agricultural development surrounded most of the city (agriculture remains the major economic force in the region in current times). Many of the initial migrants to the region were Swedish. As an early San Francisco Chronicle article stated of the region and this community's lacteal productivity, [...] "you have to hand it to the Scandinavians for knowing how to run a dairy farm." [...] Turlock went on to become known as the [...] "Heart of the Valley" [...] because of its agricultural production. With the boom came racial and labor strife. In July 1921, a mob of 150 white men evicted 60 Japanese cantaloupe pickers from rooming houses and ranches near Turlock, taking them and their belongings on trucks out of town. The white men claimed the Japanese were undercutting white workers by taking lower wages per <b>crate</b> of <b>fruit</b> picked. In protest, fruit growers briefly threatened not to hire the white workers behind the eviction, preferring to let melons rot on vines than hire such characters. As a result of this stance, the eviction had the opposite effect of what the mob had intended. By August, Japanese workers had returned, and, moreover, they were nearly the only people employed to pick melons. The affair gained national attention, and California's Governor William Stephens vowed that justice would be served. Six men were quickly arrested, though they were apparently untroubled by the charges, stating that leaders of Turlock's American Legion and Chamber of Commerce had told them no trouble would come of their actions. Although a former Turlock night watchman testified that one of the accused had disclosed a plan [...] "to clean up Turlock of the Japs," [...] all those arrested were later acquitted of charges. The San Francisco Chronicle's editorial line was opposition to both the evictions and Japanese labor, with one column stating [...] "we in California are determined that Oriental workers shall be kept out of the state. But {{that does not mean that}} the decent citizens of California will tolerate for one moment such proceedings as the attack of a mob on the Japanese cantaloupe workers in the Turlock district." ...|$|R
40|$|Pear (Pyrus communis) is an {{important}} fruit crop in the Netherlands, with a total production of 349, 000 tons in 2014, and ‘Conference’ is the main pear cultivar that occupies 75 % of the total pear production area. In the Netherlands, pears are kept in controlled atmosphere cold storage up to 11 months after harvest. Occasionally, storage rots are observed when storage crates are contaminated with orchard soil. In a storage trial (2012 to 2013), boxes with ‘Conference’ pears were amended with soil particles from the same orchard from which the pears were harvested (four orchards), and stored for 11 months. Boxes without amended soil were included as controls. In contrast to the control boxes, up to 15 % of the pears stored in boxes with soil particles showed typical rot symptoms (lesions) of an unknown causal agent. The lesions showed brown and watery circular necrosis, were slightly sunken, and displayed whitish to yellowish mycelia covering the lesions. To isolate the causal agent, fruit were rinsed with sterile water, lesions were sprayed with 70 % ethanol until droplet runoff, the skin was removed aseptically with a scalpel, and tissue under the lesion was isolated and placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). The PDA plates were incubated at 20 °C in the dark, and single spore isolates were transferred to fresh PDA plates. These isolates produced fast-growing colonies with white-yellowish mycelium. Conidia were hyaline, cylindrical, 1 to 3 septate, and 15. 8 to 26. 4 × 5. 3 to 7. 9 µm. The fungus was morphologically identical to Neonectria candida (syn. N. ramulariae; anamorph Cylindrocarpon obtusiusculum) (Lombard et al. 2015). The identity of a representative isolate (VTN 10 Bs 3) was confirmed by means of multilocus gene sequencing. To this end, genomic DNA was extracted using the LGC Mag Plant Kit (Berlin, Germany) {{in combination with the}} Kingfisher method (Waltham, USA). Sequences of the ITS region, translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (TEF 1), and actin (ACT 2) loci were amplified, sequenced, and deposited in GenBank under accessions KU 588183 (ITS), KU 588186 (TEF 1), and KU 588184 (ACT 2). MegaBLAST analysis revealed that our ITS, TEF 1, and ACT 2 sequences matched with > 99 to 100 % identity to N. candida isolates in GenBank (KM 249079 and JF 735314 [ITS], JF 735791 and HM 054091 [TEF 1], and KM 231146 [ACT 2]). Subsequently, Koch’s postulates were performed on 15 ‘Conference’ pears. Surface sterilized fruits were inoculated with 20 µl of a suspension of 105 conidiospores ml– 1 water, prepared from a 15 -day-old PDA culture, after wounding with a needle. Inoculated fruits were sealed in a plastic bag and incubated in darkness at 20 °C. Symptoms appeared after 7 days on 100 % of the fruits while mock-inoculated controls with water remained symptomless. Fungal colonies isolated from the lesions and cultured on PDA morphologically resembled the original isolate from the infected pears. Moreover, symptoms observed on artificially inoculated ‘Conference’ pear fruit were identical to the decay observed on ‘Conference’ pears that were obtained from the cold storage experiment. The identity of the reisolations was confirmed as N. candida by sequencing. N. candida (syn. N. ramulariae) is known as a globally distributed soilborne fungus (Domsch et al. 2007), but only few studies have identified the fungus as plant pathogen (Hirooka 2012). This is the first report of N. candida causing storage rot of pears. Importantly, we note that the occurrence of storage rots may be enhanced by contamination of storage <b>crates</b> or <b>fruit</b> with orchard soil...|$|R
