40|$|Abstract We {{propose to}} solve the IMRT {{optimization}} problem through a successive linear programming approach. Taking advantage of the sensitivity information in linear programming and the re-optimization ability of simplex methods, the proposed approach provides an affordable methodology to efficiently solve problems with dose-volume constraints. Preliminary computational results indicate that, compared to the standard weighted least squares approach, the new approach leads to higher tumor dosage escalation and better conformation. 1 Introduction For many years, radiation {{has been used as}} a treatment for cancer. Bombarding a malignant tumor with high-energy particles can destroy the cancerous cells or at least slow down their growth. Since tumors grow in the presence of healthy tissue and even near <b>critical</b> <b>organs,</b> it is usually impossible to irradiate the tumor without allowing some damage to the nearby <b>critical</b> <b>organs.</b> In fact, complications can occur when neighboring <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> receive too much of this collateral radiation. Moderate damage to <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> may be acceptable, however, if the effect can be accurately predicted, since cancerous cells do not have the ability to repair themselves as efficiently as normal cells. Therefore, an important research activity in radiotherapy is to develop methods of escalating dosage delivered to the tumor while carefully controlling the dosage deposited in neighboring <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> and healthy tissues...|$|R

Since {{there is still no}} evaluation based on the correlation between scan center dose and <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> doses, in this study after measuring surface doses of thyroid and uterus as <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> the correlation between scan center dose and thyroid and uterus surface doses were calculated in order to assess the rate of radiation doze to patients. Methods: In this study, 40 women underwent bone densitometry of Lunar DPX-MD system with pencil beam in two scan modes of AP spine and femur, simultaneously. Then surface doses of thyroid, uterus, scan center, and background were measured by placing 433 TLDs- 400 at the surface of thyroid and uterus and also scan center. Then correlation between scan center dose and <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> surface dose were analyzed and regression functions with significant level were determined. Results: In AP spine and femoral scanning, average surface doses of thyroid (91 TLD- 400) and uterus (84 TLD- 400) were 1. 88 ± 1. 36 and 1. 81 ± 1. 03 µGy, respectively. Scan center dose in this scanning mode was 5. 70 ± 2. 38 µGy. There was significant correlation between surface doses of thyroid and uterus and scan center dose. Therefore, regression functions and correlation coefficients were calculated. Conclusion: The observed significant correlation between <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> surface dose and scan center dose showed that Lunar DPX-MD with pencil beam has very low radiation, similar to background doses.

40|$|Background & Objectives: Computed {{tomography}} (CT) represents 11 % of all {{diagnostic radiology}} procedures but {{it contributes to}} almost 67 % of the total effective dose to the human population. In head and neck CT which consist of 1 / 3 of total CT scans, other critical organs such as lenses and thyroid are in the radiation field. Also in the abdomen and pelvis scan, irradiation of ovaries is unavoidable. Because of high sensitivity of these organs, the probability of abnormality and cancer in these organs has increased. Therefore the dose assessment in these organs is very important. The {{aim of this study}} is to estimate the absorbed dose in <b>critical</b> <b>organ</b> of patient undergoing common head, neck, abdomen and pelvic spiral CT scan. Materials & Methods: In this study, Lithium fluoride thermo luminescent dosimeters (TLD- 100, Harshaw) were used to determine the absorbed dose of <b>critical</b> <b>organ</b> of tissue equivalent rando phantom (Alderson research industries, Inc, Stanford, Conn, U. S. A). The phantom was sectional in design and manufactured with a 2. 5 cm slab thickness. Each section contained some holes that allowed accommodation of TLDs. At least two crystals were placed in each hole. The average value of the TLD readings was taken as the organ dose. Readouts were obtained on a Harshaw 4500 reader (Harshaw, Ohio, USA). For calibration, the annealed dosimeters were exposed to an X-ray beam resulting from 120 kVp tube voltage and calibration curve was plotted. Results: result of this study showed during head CT scan the maximum absorbed dose belongs to occipital bones skin. Which were about 11. 45 mGy and the minimum absorbed dose belong to thyroid gland which was 0. 5 mGy. During abdomen & pelvic spiral CT, the maximum absorbed dose of abdomen skin was 23. 32 mGy and the minimum absorbed dose in the eye region was 0. 15 mGy. The readout results are correlated with the results of spiral CT detector with the “ALARA” principle, we recommend suitable techniques should be selected to reduce absorbed dose of <b>critical</b> <b>organ</b> without reducing image quality. Conclusion: further research is required to investigate whether modification of the parameters used during routine spiral CT scan can be limited absorbed dose of <b>critical</b> <b>organ</b> without a significant loss of image quality...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The overall aim was {{to conduct}} an {{analytical}} study {{of the impact of}} the modulation factor (MF) on the quality of the head and neck treatment plans and their execution time on Tomotherapy. Materials and Methods: In-phantom (RANDO® Alderson) planning study of the head and neck cancer was performed. Thirteen different plans in terms of MF were prepared. Other optimization parameters were the same for all plans. Results: Analysis of treatment plans in terms of quality shows that MF MF > 1. 8. The lower limit increases to 2. 4 when hard reduction of the dose in <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> is required. Conclusions: It was showed that the final MF value is less than the value calculated after each loop of optimization. The computer system reduces MF by shortening the longest time and increasing the average time of leaves opening. Increase in the average time is obtained by eliminating the use of leafs with the shortest times of opening, thereby reducing the dose in <b>critical</b> <b>organs</b> that are outside the direct irradiation area...|$|R
