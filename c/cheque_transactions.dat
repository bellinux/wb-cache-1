50|$|In Australia, {{following}} global trends, {{the use of}} cheques {{continues to}} decline. In 1994 the value of daily <b>cheque</b> <b>transactions</b> was A$25 billion; by 2004 this had dropped to only A$5 billion, almost all of this for B2B transactions. Personal cheque use is practically non-existent thanks to the longstanding use of the EFTPOS system, BPAY, Electronic transfers and debit cards.|$|E
50|$|Cheques {{are still}} the most {{important}} non-cash payment instruments in Australia, {{in terms of the}} value transferred. The number of monthly <b>cheque</b> <b>transactions</b> in 2008 was 33.7 million with a value of $139.3 billion. Cheque use is in decline worldwide, but it is declining faster in Australia than many other countries. Between 2010 and 2014, cheque use in Australia declined by 42.8% with just over seven cheques written per person in 2014. In 2014, 166.6 million cheques were used in Australia, compared to 291.1 million in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|The {{automated}} {{payment transaction}} (APT) tax was first proposed in Buenos Aires at the International Institute of Public Finance Conference by Edgar L. Feige in 1989 and an extended {{version of the}} proposal appeared in Economic Policy in 2000. [...] The APT tax proposal is a generalization of the Keynes tax and the Tobin tax. The APT tax consists of a small flat tax levied on all transactions. The tax is automatically assessed and collected when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking or payments system. In order to assure that all cash transactions are also taxed, the APT system proposes to exact a tax on currency as it enters and leaves the banking system. In order {{to be an effective}} means of discouraging currency usage for tax evasion, the APT tax imposes a tax rate on currency higher than the rate automatically charged on <b>cheque</b> <b>transactions.</b> Since cash can be used multiple times between the time it enters into circulation and the time it is returned to the banking system, the APT currency transaction tax is set at a multiple of the rate charged for all other transactions using non cash payment methods.|$|E

5000|$|In New Zealand, {{payments}} {{by cheque}} have declined {{since the mid-1990s}} in favour of electronic payment methods. In 1993, cheques accounted for over half of transactions through the national banking system, with an annual average of 130 cheques per capita. By 2006 cheques lagged well behind EFTPOS (debit card) transaction and electronic credits, making up only nine percent of transactions, with an annual average of 41 <b>cheque</b> <b>transaction</b> per capita. [...] Most retail stores no longer accept cheques, {{and those that do}} often require government-issued identification or a store-issued [...] "cheque identification card" [...] before they can be accepted as payment.|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Banking Industry, in 18 century, cheques were get cleared by sending the cheques to the other bank through a person. With the time volume of <b>cheque</b> <b>transactions</b> & number of Bank branches increased and as a result cheque clearing became more complex & time consuming. // In 1950 central Bank was formed under the sec. 98 of finance Act No. 58 of 1948. After forming the Central Bank it started acting as central clearing House. With the increase in the volume of cheques and the computerization of banks the Central Bank of Sri Lanka decided to automate the cheque clearing system for speedier and accurate processing. To achieve this objective firstly Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House (SLACH) was established within the purview of the Information Technology Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. SLACH commenced operation on 2 nd March 1988. Secondly computerized "High Speed Document Processors" (Reader/Sorter equipment) were introduced and new cheques were introduced with MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) characters. // In year 2002 the Central Bank of Sri Lanka decided to hand over the activities of the SLACH to its users namely commercial banks operating in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, Lanka Clear (pvt.) Ltd was incorporated under Companies Act and it took over the activities of Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House (SLACH) on 1 st of April 2002. After the divestment Lanka Clear was able to reduce the cheque processing time by 06 hours. As a result banks were able to reduce their cheque clearing realization time. Even now cheques out side Grater Colombo Region takes relatively longer time to clear. I. e. T+ 2 or beyond (T = to day, T+ l = Tomorrow, T+ 2 = Day after tomorrow). Major hurdle to achieve T + 1 is due to the time taken by banks to complete al l four legs of the cheque clearing process. In addition to the time taken for clearance it make errors such as missing items, Free own items, Encoding errors etc & also high cost involvement in collecting, sorting & transporting. This research is carried out to answer the research problem described above which will serve the purpose of enhancing the system to a real-rime automated system which can be adopted in Sri Lanka. This is important because payment systems are vital for economic development and this is a change to prevailing payment mechanism but not a new system. // This research will use opinion poll based survey in order to collect primary data for the study. Questionnaires will be used to collect primary data from managers in the Information Technology field specially in the Banking industry. Further the Questionnaire will focus to gather the operation information & the procedures from the users of the current process// After analyzing the data collected the researcher summarized the factors affecting for a Real-Time Cheque Clearance identified through Global Research findings and Survey results. Based on these factors a model for Real-Time Cheque Clearance will be presented. // Two models were developed in order to clear the cheque presented at the branchreal-rime. For such model the fundamentals requirements should be in place in order to implement such system, will be addressed finally...|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of Databank {{came at a}} time when computer systems were a scarce and expensive commodity in New Zealand, with the import of computers being restricted by the then government's prevailing highly regulatory economic policy. Computers could only be imported under licence. The executive management of the BNZ (Bank of New Zealand) wanted to obtain a computer and establish a computerised system to enable the automation of the processing of its banking transactions and customer accounting. Computerisation was deemed as the only way to proceed if the increasing <b>cheque</b> <b>transaction</b> volumes were to be accommodated in timely fashion. The other, smaller banks were approaching the point where they would face a similar situation. However, the NBNZ (National Bank of New Zealand) {{was the only one that}} happened to have a computer import licence.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{liquidity}} and {{certainty of}} payment of a certified cheque, {{it is sometimes}} considered equivalent to cash, {{such as in the}} regulation of credit for casino gaming in Macau, where the law explicitly states that if a casino patron obtains casino chips and pays with a certified <b>cheque,</b> the <b>transaction</b> is not regarded as credit for gaming (see Law 5/2004, art. 2).|$|R
50|$|Until 2012, Canada minted a one-cent coin {{of similar}} size and color as its American counterpart, with steel as the {{interior}} metal instead of zinc, though composition was near identical to US cents prior to 2000 {{and so it}} circulates at par in small quantities in the United States (and vice versa). However, on March 29, 2012, the Canadian government {{announced that it would}} eliminate the penny from the coinage system. The final Canadian penny was minted on May 4, 2012 and active distribution of the coin by the mint was discontinued on February 4, 2013. Since that date, businesses were encouraged to begin rounding cash transactions only to the nearest five-cent increment. <b>Cheques</b> and <b>transactions</b> using electronic payments debit, credit and payments cards are not rounded.|$|R
5000|$|Stated otherwise: To {{intervene}} in the [...] "business cycle", a central bank may choose to buy (or sell) government securities from (or to) the banks which it regulates, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the reserves (not deposits) of those banks; the regulated banks must comply with the buy & sell orders of the central bank. This process is known as open market operations. For example, a central bank may command its regulated banks to sell government bonds or bills to the central bank, which pays with <b>cheques</b> or electronic <b>transactions</b> which are cashed by these banks, moving money from the central bank to the bank reserves (not deposits) of the regulated banks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{signature}} identification or verification, means where "identification " implies matching a user signature {{against a}} signature {{associated with the}} identity that the user claim. Biometrics can be classified into two types Behavioral (signature verification, keystroke dynamics, etc.) and Physiological (iris characteristics, fingerprint, etc.). Signature and Finger Print verifications are most widely used personal verifications and {{are one of the}} first few biometrics used even before computers. Signature verification is widely studied and discussed using two approaches. On-line approach and offline approach. Online signature verification represents the dynamic information related to signature which is captured at the time when signature made. The offline signature verification represents the static information of signature. Offline systems are more applicable and easy to use in comparison with on-line systems {{in many parts of the}} world however it is considered more difficult than on-line verification due to the lack of dynamic information. This paper presents about offline Signature identification method that had more attraction in recent years because of its necessity for use in daily life routines and when the signature needs to be immediately verified like bank checks, Security for Commercial <b>Transactions,</b> <b>Cheque</b> Authentication, attendance etc. In this paper we present, features types and recent methods used for features extraction in offline signature verification systems. Finally, we suggest new interesting ideas to be incorporated in the future.
