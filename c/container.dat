5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a <b>container</b> with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the <b>container</b> more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the <b>container</b> is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A <b>container</b> wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{for this}} research {{was to assess the}} efficacy of biodegradable <b>containers</b> compared to plastic <b>containers</b> for the production of long-term crops using a subirrigation system. Plastic and various biocontainers were used to grow `Rainier Purple 2 ̆ 7 cyclamen (Cyclamen persicum L.) in ebb-and-flood benches. After 15 weeks, the physical properties of the <b>containers</b> were tested. The used plastic <b>containers</b> had strengths of 23. 3, 23. 5 and 21. 9 g for the bottom, middle and top zones respectively. The peat, dairy manure and wood fiber <b>containers</b> had strengths of less than 2 kg for each zone. The peat, dairy manure, wood fiber and rice straw <b>containers</b> had used tensile strengths of 0, 0, 3. 61 and 5. 29 g respectively. Total water for wood fiber <b>containers</b> was significantly higher than plastic <b>containers.</b> Irrigation interval for plastic <b>containers</b> was significantly longer than for wood fiber <b>containers.</b> Plastic, bioplastic, solid ricehull and slotted ricehull <b>containers</b> had no algal or fungal growth. There {{were no significant differences between}} biocontainers and plastic <b>containers</b> for days to flower. All biocontainers except wood fiber had significantly higher shoot dry weights than plants grown in plastic <b>containers.</b> The plants grown in the plastic <b>containers</b> had root dry weights of 3. 0 g. Solid ricehull, paper, wood fiber and coconut fiber <b>containers</b> had higher plant root dry weights than plastic <b>containers.</b> The bioplastic, solid ricehull and slotted ricehull <b>containers</b> would all be appropriate substitutes for plastic <b>containers.</b> These <b>containers</b> retained high levels of punch and tensile strength, had no algal and fungal growth, required a similar amount of water as the plastic <b>containers</b> and did not negatively affect plant growth. The peat, dairy manure, wood fiber and rice straw <b>containers</b> would not be appropriate substitutes for plastic <b>containers</b> because of the low used strengths, high percentages of algae coverage and shorter irrigation intervals. Paper and coconut fiber <b>containers</b> could be used to substitute for plastic. These <b>containers</b> retained high used strengths, similar total water usage amounts, and did not negatively affect plant growth. These <b>containers</b> had algae but it was less than 9...|$|R

5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two containers, with the larger, open top <b>container</b> filled with water. The smaller has an {{attached}} bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small <b>container</b> up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one <b>container.</b> The <b>container</b> must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the <b>container,</b> air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural <b>container</b> business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne <b>container</b> service from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon has taken over the Melbourne - Horsham <b>container</b> service.|$|E
