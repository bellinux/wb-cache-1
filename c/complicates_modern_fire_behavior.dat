40|$|Landscape {{heterogeneity}} shapes species distributions, interactions, and fluctuations. Historically, in dry forest ecosystems, low {{canopy cover}} and heterogeneous fuel patterns often moderated disturbances like fire. Over the last century, however, increases in canopy cover and more homogeneous patterns {{have contributed to}} altered fire regimes with higher fire severity. Fire management strategies emphasize increasing within-stand heterogeneity with aggregated fuel patterns to alter potential <b>fire</b> <b>behavior.</b> Yet, {{little is known about}} how such patterns may affect <b>fire</b> <b>behavior,</b> or how sensitive <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> changes from fuel patterns are to winds and canopy cover. Here, we used a physics-based <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> model, FIRETEC, to explore the impacts of spatially aggregated fuel patterns on the mean and variability of stand-level <b>fire</b> <b>behavior,</b> and to test sensitivity of these effects to wind and canopy cover. Qualitative and quantitative approaches suggest that spatial fuel patterns can significantly affect <b>fire</b> <b>behavior.</b> Based on our results we propose three hypotheses: (1) aggregated spatial fuel patterns primarily affect <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> by increasing variability; (2) this variability should increase with spatial scale of aggregation; and (3) <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> sensitivity to spatial pattern effects should be more pronounced under moderate wind and fuel conditions...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the specific correlation between fuel load and fuel moisture on <b>fire</b> <b>behavior,</b> an analysis of fuel conditions and <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> must be performed under controlled conditions. This will eliminate the topographic variation and differences in fuel composition inherent to in situ studies. We conducted experimental burns in a common garden to examine the characteristics of <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> across the range of fuel conditions found in eastern deciduous forests. We controlled the fuel load and fuel moisture within 1 m plots and used pyrometer temperature as a surrogate for <b>fire</b> <b>behavior.</b> Our results may ultimately be used, probably in conjunction with additional data, to verify and calibrate <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> models in eastern mixed-oak forests.|$|R
30|$|Fire is {{important}} for the maintenance of African savanna ecosystems, particularly humid savanna. Despite the importance of <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> to our understanding of fire’s ecological effects, few studies have documented <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> and its determinants in humid West African savannas and, in particular, whether <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> depends on season of the year. We analyzed <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> in the Guinean savanna of Lamto (Ivory Coast) during a 4 -year field experiment. The fire regimes tested consisted of three different burning seasons: early-season fire, mid-season fire, and late-season fire. Nine 0.5 ha plots were burned annually to determine the rate of spread and fire intensity. Fuel characteristics and weather conditions were measured to assess their impact on <b>fire</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|R
40|$|Transitions {{from one}} type of <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> to another cause {{difficulty}} in modeling <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> in some shrubland fuelbeds. Under different environmental conditions, some shrub fuel complexes may burn benignly in only surface litter, grass, or low shrubs, or more intensely in the taller main shrub canopy as well. With current surface fire modeling methods, simulating <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> in these fuels requires ex ante knowledge of which fuels will carry the fire so that the appropriate <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> fuel model can be selected. A conifer crown fire simulation technique has been adapted to simulate the transition between surface and shrubcanopy fire. Simulations {{are based on the}} Rothermel surface spread model; however, the technique can be adapted to other spread models. Two surface <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> fuel models are specified—a “low ” fuel model representing the grass, low shrub or litter fuels that support relatively benign <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> when the <b>fire</b> remains beneath the main canopy, and a “high” fuel model that represents <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> in the main shrub canopy. The method also requires an experience-based estimate of the flame length at which the transition to shrub-canopy fire begins. Standard or custom <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> fuel models may be used. Interpretation is similar to that for conifer crown fires...|$|R

30|$|Multiple factors {{interact}} {{to influence}} <b>fire</b> <b>behavior.</b> While {{the interactions of}} fuel moisture and fuel loading in western coniferous communities are well understood, {{few studies have examined}} <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> in eastern deciduous forests. In order to accurately predict <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> in mixed-oak forests, studies need to examine <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> in eastern deciduous forests. We conducted a fine-scale manipulative experiment to determine the specific effects that fine fuel moisture and load have on <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> in Ohio mixed-oak forests. Three fuel moisture levels (0, 4, and 15 % moisture), and five field-simulated fuel loads were burned in a 3 × 5 factorial experiment. Thermocolor pyrometers were used to measure maximum temperature at 5 and 30 cm as an indicator of <b>fire</b> <b>behavior.</b> Additionally, amount and percent of fuel burned were determined for each set of conditions. As expected, fires burned hotter with decreasing fuel moisture, and with increasing fuel load. Percent of fuel burned and mean temperature at 5 and 30 cm were positively correlated. Interactive effects were not observed. Temperatures were similar to those found in prior field studies in Appalachian Ohio. Controlled experiments such as this will likely prove useful in future efforts to link fuel conditions and <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> as landscape-scale effects are modeled. In particular, our results can be used to verify and calibrate <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> models in eastern mixed-oak forests.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to create <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> fuel models that {{replicate}} the <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> characteristics (spread rate and fireline intensity) produced by 23 candidate FCCS fuelbeds developed for the Savannah River National Wildlife Refuge. These 23 fuelbeds were created by FERA staff in consultation with local fuel managers.

FARSITE and FlamMap do not directly use FCCS fuelbeds, but instead use standard or custom <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> fuel models to describe surface fuel characteristics for fire modeling. Therefore, replicating fire growth and <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> potential calculations using FCCS‐simulated fire characteristics requires the development of custom fuel models that mimic, as closely as possible, the <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> characteristics produced by the FCCS for each fuelbed, over a range of fuel moisture and wind speeds...|$|R

We estimated <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> using FFE-FVS methods, whereby measured dead fuel loadings are keyed to Albini’s (1976) 13 original <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> fuel models, and the FFE-FVS algorithm selects and weights predicted <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> {{from one to}} two most similar models (Rebain 2010). This default FFE-FVS method produces consistent results to predictions based entirely on user-inputted, customized <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> fuel models in FFE-FVS (Noonan-Wright et al. 2014). Potential <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> was based on FFE-FVS’s default “severe” fire weather scenario (4 % 10 -h fuel moisture, 21.1  °C ambient temperature, and 32.2  km h− 1 wind speed at 6.1  m) instead of percentile (e.g., 80 th or 95 th) fire weather conditions to provide standardized analysis.

30|$|Ideally, the {{effectiveness}} of a fuel treatment to lessen potential <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> (i.e., reduced flame height) can be observed during or after a fire passes through the treatment. Fuel treatments have proven to be effective at reducing fire intensity, severity, and extent (Agee et al. 2000, Pollet and Omi 2002, Martinson and Omi 2003, Finney et al. 2005, Ritchie et al. 2007), and in aiding in suppression efforts during wildfires (Moghaddas and Craggs 2007). Observational evidence has also shown fires to burn into and through known treatments under extreme conditions (Pollet and Omi 2002). In the absence of this opportunity, and in necessity for fuel treatment planning, most researchers evaluate or predict fuel treatment effectiveness with <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> modeling. <b>Fire</b> <b>behavior</b> modeling can be done as a theoretical practice or with pre- and post-treatment fuel measures. Theoretical modeling can be completed to better understand the influence of potential fuel treatments on <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> metrics (van Wagtendonk 1996, Stephens 1998, Schmidt et al. 2008, Vaillant 2008). <b>Fire</b> <b>behavior</b> modeling that utilizes pre- and post-treatment fuel measurements allows managers to assess {{the effectiveness}} of completed fuel treatments to alter potential <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> (Stephens and Moghaddas 2005 a, b; Roccaforte et al. 2008; Schmidt et al. 2008; Vaillant et al. 2009).|$|R

The Northern Forest Fire Laboratory (now the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory) fuel model 4 (one of the original 13 <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> fuel models — Albini 1976) was primarily developed for chaparral <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> prediction during the severe period of the fire season (Anderson 1982). More recently, Scott and Burgan (2005) have developed 40 additional fuel models, two of which may improve accuracy of <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> predictions outside the severe period of the fire season, such as prescribed fire applications. Several custom fuel models have also been developed for southern California chaparral (Cohen 1986, Weise 1997) and the Fuel Characteristic Classification System contains descriptions of several chaparral fuel beds (Riccardi et al. 2007).|$|R
3000|$|Recently, a few authors (e.g., Baker 2014, 2015; Odion et al. 2014) have {{challenged}} the low- to moderate-severity paradigm for YPMC forests, and assert that fires in these forests previously resulted in extensive amounts of high-severity fire and high-severity patch sizes similar to <b>modern</b> <b>fires.</b> These authors reached their conclusions by comparing estimates of <b>modern</b> high-severity <b>fire</b> rotations to pre-settlement fire rotations calculated from fires {{that occurred during}} the California Gold Rush era (e.g., Leiberg 1902) or through the use of methods that are based upon an assumption that tree establishment is primarily linked to high-severity fire. These methods are problematic for several reasons. First, effects of fires caused by California Gold Rush era activities did not necessarily represent the pre-settlement fire regime (Safford and Stevens 2017). Second, tree establishment in dry forests is more closely linked to periodic wet episodes or longer fire-free periods (Fulé et al. 2014). Finally, comparing high-severity rotations does not answer the question of how <b>fire</b> <b>behavior</b> differs in individual <b>modern</b> <b>fires,</b> on average, compared with pre-settlement fires. The difference between the two questions is important. The average proportion of high severity per fire is typically used as a description of the fire regime (Sugihara et al. 2006 a). Proportion of high severity per fire is important because it is related to high-severity patch size (van Wagtendonk and Lutz 2007). In Sierra Nevada YPMC forests, high-severity patches often result in early seral shrub patches, which subsequently nearly always burn at high severity (van Wagtendonk 2012, van Wagtendonk et al. 2012). It is the average proportion of high severity, therefore, that, when coupled with fire rotation, describes how fire would have driven high-severity patch size, subsequent successional patterns, and the amount of young and old forests that could exist on a landscape (Sugihara et al. 2006 [...]...|$|R
