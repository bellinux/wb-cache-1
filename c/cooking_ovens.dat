40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2008. The archaeological {{record from}} Vanuatu, {{most of which}} falls into the early {{settlement}} period, exhibits {{a wide range of}} related stone oven features. Such patterning is suggestive of practices that are exploratory, rather than having an already established cooking strategy. The appearance of distinctive local technological variants that is detected at Arapus site on Efate, then, may indicate the process of local adaptation and diversification. The examination of contemporary cooking practices demonstrates that stone <b>oven</b> <b>cooking</b> is a complex technological system shaped by a range of ecological, social, and historical factors. In a sense, various styles of <b>oven</b> structures and <b>cooking</b> strategies are linked to certain food types such as taro and yams. However, the examination of ethnographic stone ovens from northern Vanuatu eliminates any simplistic causal relationship between a specific cooking style and particular foods. Conversely, there are multiple technological options to be taken, depending on how people in a given society conceptualize their cooking system. While ecological factors circumscribe the range of possible alternatives, factors such as cultural values and sociopolitical relations among the people also {{play an important role in}} determining the technological process. This dissertation examines the diversity of stone <b>oven</b> <b>cooking</b> strategies in northern Vanuatu, located in central Melanesia. Using an ethnoarchaeological research method, this study explores the variability of cooking practices in two regions with contrasting ecological settings (Northwest Santo, Malo, and other islands). This study aims to identify factors affecting the development and diversification of stone <b>oven</b> <b>cooking</b> technologies. Cooking with pots, another method whose use is confined to certain regions in Melanesia, is also taken into account in light of understanding the loss of pottery in Pacific prehistory. Employing an anthropology of technology framework which incorporates the active role of agency, provided a comprehensive perspective viewpoint in evaluating stone <b>oven</b> <b>cooking</b> strategies and related culinary practices.

40|$|With the United States {{being the}} worldâ€™s second largest {{consumer}} of primary energy, research into areas of significant consumption can provide large impacts {{in terms of}} the global energy consumption. Buildings account for 41 % of US total energy consumption with the residential sector making up a majority. Household appliances account for the second largest site energy consumption at 27 %, after the HVAC system for the U. S. residential sector. By quantifying the expected energy available in the waste stream for five major appliances; household refrigerator, clothes dryer and washer, dishwasher, and <b>cooking</b> <b>oven,</b> a potential energy source is presented. A cold water cooling stream is applied to the waste stream of each appliance and an estimated amount of energy can be recovered. The household refrigerator is modeled having an increase in cooling capacity of about 12 % and a reduction on compressor power consumption of about 26 %. A sample operation of the clothes dryer has the exhaust air stream being cooled down to 30. 5 Â°C (86. 9 Â°F) or on the other side, is able to heat 19 liter (5 gal) of water up to about 54. 5 Â°C (130. 1 Â°F). Large volumes of water are available by the clothes washer, but due to typical operation characteristics, low wash and rinse temperatures, the waste stream was not high in temperature. While the dishwasher provided higher heat source temperatures, 40 Â°C (104 Â°F), than the clothes washer, 36 Â°C (97 Â°F), the opposite was true. The volume of waste water drained is very low compared to the clothes washer 11. 7 liter (3. 1 gal) to 155 liter (41 gal). Thus water temperatures in the storage tank did not reach above 30 Â°C (86 Â°F) even with low storage volumes. The <b>cooking</b> <b>oven</b> can generate very high water temperatures depending how small of a storage tank is connected. Further work in this area is recommended due to the potential of high water temperatures generated from residential waste energy streams not currently being captured, and thus can offset some site-energy usage...|$|R
