Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E
25|$|Securitization is {{the process}} of {{creating}} asset-backed securities by transferring assets from the issuing company to a bankruptcy remote entity. <b>Credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> is an integral component of this process as it creates a security that has a higher rating than the issuing company, which allows the issuing company to monetize its assets while paying a lower rate of interest than would be possible via a secured bank loan or debt issuance by the issuing company.|$|E
25|$|These {{securitization}} trusts may {{be structured}} by government-sponsored enterprises {{as well as}} by private entities that may offer <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> features to mitigate the risk of prepayment and default associated with these mortgages. Since residential mortgage holders in the United States have the option to pay more than the required monthly payment (curtailment) or to pay off the loan in its entirety (prepayment), the monthly cash flow of an MBS is not known in advance, and an MBS therefore presents a risk to investors.|$|E
50|$|Green banks {{frequently}} utilize <b>credit</b> <b>enhancements</b> {{to leverage}} private investment. Loan loss reserves, overcollateralization and subordinated debt can help assuage concern among private lenders {{who are interested}} in entering the market, but concerned about the risks associated with developers, counter parties or technologies with less established history in their given jurisdiction. <b>Credit</b> <b>enhancements</b> also help lower the cost of capital for borrowers and improve debt ratings from credit agencies.|$|R

500|$|The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is an {{international}} financial institution which offers political risk insurance and <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> guarantees. Such guarantees help investors protect foreign direct investments against political and non-commercial risks in developing countries. MIGA {{is a member of}} the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1988 as an investment insurance facility to encourage confident investment in developing countries. MIGA's stated mission is [...] "to promote foreign direct investment into developing countries to support economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve people's lives". [...] It targets projects that endeavor to create new jobs, develop infrastructure, generate new tax revenues, and take advantage of natural resources through sustainable policies and programs.|$|E
2500|$|Miscellaneous {{bonds are}} {{those that do not}} fit well under the other {{commercial}} surety bond classifications. They often support private relationships and unique business needs. Examples of significant miscellaneous bonds include: lost securities bonds, hazardous waste removal bonds, <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> financial guaranty bonds, self–insured workers compensation guaranty bonds, and wage and welfare/fringe benefit (Union) bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{conventional}} {{corporate bonds}} which are unsecured, securities created in a securitization are [...] "credit enhanced", meaning their credit quality is increased above {{that of the}} originator's unsecured debt or underlying asset pool. This {{increases the likelihood that}} the investors will receive the cash flows to which they are entitled, and thus enables the securities to have a higher credit rating than the originator. Some securitizations use external <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> provided by third parties, such as surety bonds and parental guarantees (although this may introduce a conflict of interest).|$|E
25|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>enhancements</b> affect <b>credit</b> risk by {{providing}} {{more or less}} protection for promised cash flows for a security. Additional protection can help a security achieve a higher rating, lower protection can help create new securities with differently desired risks, and these differential protections can make the securities more attractive.|$|R

"Discussions {{with market}} {{participants}} show that compared to Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, many asset-backed securities are not liquid, and their prices are not transparent.

50|$|Surety {{bonds are}} {{insurance}} policies that reimburse the ABS for any losses. They are external forms of <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement.</b> ABS paired with surety bonds have ratings {{that are the}} same as that of the surety bond’s issuer. By law, surety companies cannot provide a bond as a form of a <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> guarantee.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> is key in {{creating}} a security that has a higher rating than the underlying asset pool. <b>Credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> can be created, for example, by issuing subordinate bonds. The subordinate bonds are allocated any losses from the collateral before losses are allocated to the senior bonds, thus giving senior bonds a <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement.</b> As a result, {{it is possible for}} defaults to occur in repayment of the underlying assets without affecting payments to holders of the senior bonds. Also, many deals, typically those involving riskier collateral, such as subprime and Alt-A mortgages, use over-collateralization as well as subordination. In over-collateralization, the balance of the underlying assets (e.g., loans) is greater than the balance of the bonds, thus creating excess interest in the deal which acts as a [...] "cushion" [...] against reduction in value of the underlying assets. Excess interest can be used to offset collateral losses before losses are allocated to bondholders, thus providing another <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement.</b> A further <b>credit</b> <b>enhancement</b> involves the use of derivatives such as swap transactions, which effectively provide insurance, for a set fee, against a decrease in value.|$|E

30|$|Securitized {{bonds are}} {{backed by a}} pool of assets and will not absorb losses coming from other {{concepts}} (i.e., losses from loans not belonging to that pool of assets, losses from tradable securities, etc). As well, Almazán et al. (2015) show that Spanish banks deployed securitization not to transfer risks (they offered <b>credit</b> <b>enhancements</b> and kept the worst tranches) but to exclusively obtain liquidity as a complement instrument to debt. Indeed, Spanish banks accounted the liability counterpart of securitization as deposits because Spanish regulation did not let them remove securitized assets from their balance sheet.|$|R
25|$|To {{facilitate}} the securitization of non-mortgage assets, businesses substituted private <b>credit</b> <b>enhancements.</b> First, they over-collateralised pools of assets; shortly thereafter, they improved third-party and structural enhancements.

A pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume, auto loans were a good match for structured finance; their maturities, considerably shorter than those of mortgages, made the timing of cash flows more predictable, and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence.|$|R

50|$|Mortgage {{underwriting}} standards deteriorated {{to the point}} that between 2002 and 2007 an estimated $3.2 trillion in loans were made to homeowners with bad credit and undocumented incomes (e.g., subprime or Alt-A mortgages) and bundled into MBSs and collateralized debt obligations that received high ratings and therefore could be sold to global investors. Higher ratings were believed justified by various <b>credit</b> <b>enhancements</b> including over-collateralization (i.e., pledging collateral in excess of debt issued), credit default insurance, and equity investors willing to bear the first losses. But as of September 2008, bank writedowns and losses on these investments totaled $523 billion.|$|R
50|$|Reduces funding costs: Through securitization, {{a company}} rated BB but with AAA worthy cash flow {{would be able}} to borrow at {{possibly}} AAA rates. This is the number one reason to securitize a cash flow and can have tremendous impacts on borrowing costs. The difference between BB debt and AAA debt can be multiple hundreds of basis points. For example, Moody's downgraded Ford Motor Credit's rating in January 2002, but senior automobile backed securities, issued by Ford Motor Credit in January 2002 and April 2002, continue to be rated AAA because of the strength of the underlying collateral and other <b>credit</b> <b>enhancements.</b>|$|R
