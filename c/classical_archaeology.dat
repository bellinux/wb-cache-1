5|$|Born in Sydney, New South Wales to {{a middle-class}} family of English descent, Childe studied Classics at the University of Sydney {{before moving to}} England to study <b>Classical</b> <b>archaeology</b> at the University of Oxford. Here, he embraced the socialist {{movement}} and campaigned against the First World War, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing imperialists {{to the detriment of}} Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the Australian Labor Party as the private secretary of politician John Storey. Growing critical of Labor, he authored an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left Industrial Workers of the World. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the Royal Anthropological Institute and continued his research into European prehistory through various journeys across the continent, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an archaeological culture to the British archaeological community.|$|E

25|$|Born Sybille Overhoff on 3 July 1926 to Edith née Kloeppel, her German mother, and Julius Overhoff, her Austrian father, {{she was one}} of five {{siblings}} {{including her}} twin sister Elfriede Knauer, an archaeologist. She grew up in a cultured family in Berlin, Frankfurt and Austria but her schooling was interrupted by the Nazi regime. She had to join Nazi youth organisations and spent a year doing compulsory labour in harsh conditions. After the war things remained difficult for some time and she studied Chinese while waiting for Frankfurt University to reopen in 1947. However, she had always been interested in the antiquities collected by her maternal great-grandfather, the sculptor and art historian , and had a long-standing wish to study <b>classical</b> <b>archaeology,</b> and in particular, Etruscology. Once at the Goethe University Frankfurt she studied <b>classical</b> <b>archaeology,</b> ancient history, art history and ethnology and found vacation work in museums in Paris, Rome, and London before graduating summa cum laude in December 1950. She went on to write a thesis on Etruscan bronze mirrors, supervised and encouraged by Guido von Kaschnitz.|$|E
25|$|From 1 May 1948 until 1 January 1963, Zadoks {{worked as}} {{part-time}} conservator of ancient coins and cut gems at the Koninklijk Penningkabinet, then located in The Hague. She {{then became a}} lecturer in <b>classical</b> <b>archaeology</b> at the University of Groningen. Prior to this appointment she had been lector in archaeology for many years, following the retirement of archaeologist G. van Hoorn in 1951 and the departure of his replacement G. H. Beyen soon after. Her initial appointment as a lecturer was for a fixed term of five years, in view of her background as an archaeologist and art historian rather than the more traditional foundation of classical philology. She published ten books and {{more than two hundred}} articles, and is credited with changing the face of <b>classical</b> <b>archaeology</b> in the Netherlands. She is also credited with stimulating the still nascent discipline of formal numismatic study in the Netherlands, particularly the work of Wim van Es. Her work inspired the publication of a Festschrift on the occasion of her 70th birthday, with a foreword and praise of Zadoks' work by Elizabeth Visser (1908–1987), the first female professor of ancient history in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Bioarchaeology in Europe {{is not as}} {{affected}} by these repatriation issues as American bioarchaeology but regardless the ethical considerations associated with working with human remains are, and should, be considered. However, because much of European archaeology {{has been focused on}} classical roots, artifacts and art have been overemphasized and Roman and post-Roman skeletal remains were nearly completely neglected until the 1980s. Prehistoric archaeology in Europe is a different story, as biological remains began to be analyzed earlier than in <b>classical</b> <b>archaeology.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Classical</b> <b>archaeology</b> {{was used}} by the Italian {{authorities}} as a propaganda tool to justify their presence in the region. Before 1911, no archeological research was done in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. By the late 1920s the Italian government had started funding excavations in the main Roman cities of Leptis Magna and Sabratha (Cyrenaica was left for later excavations because of the ongoing colonial war against Muslim rebels in that province). A result of the fascist takeover was that all foreign archaeological expeditions were forced out of Libya, and all archeological work was consolidated under a centralised Italian excavation policy, which exclusively benefitted Italian museums and journals.|$|E
