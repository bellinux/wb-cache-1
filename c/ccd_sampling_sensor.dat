40|$|Colon cancer (CC) {{pathological}} staging {{fails to}} accurately predict recurrence, and to date, no gene expression signature has proven reliable for prognosis stratification in clinical practice, perhaps because CC is a heterogeneous disease. The {{aim of this}} study was to establish a comprehensive molecular classification of CC based on mRNA expression profile analyses. Fresh-frozen primary tumor samples from a large multicenter cohort of 750 patients with stage I to IV CC who underwent surgery between 1987 and 2007 in seven centers were characterized for common DNA alterations, including BRAF, KRAS, and TP 53 mutations, CpG island methylator phenotype, mismatch repair status, and chromosomal instability status, and were screened with whole genome and transcriptome arrays. 566 samples fulfilled RNA quality requirements. Unsupervised consensus hierarchical clustering applied to gene expression data from a discovery subset of 443 <b>CC</b> <b>samples</b> identified six molecular subtypes. These subtypes were associated with distinct clinicopathological characteristics, molecular alterations, specific enrichments of supervised gene expression signatures (stem cell phenotype-like, normal-like, serrated CC phenotype-like), and deregulated signaling pathways. Based on their main biological characteristics, we distinguished a deficient mismatch repair subtype, a KRAS mutant subtype, a cancer stem cell subtype, and three chromosomal instability subtypes, including one associated with down-regulated immune pathways, one with up-regulation of the Wnt pathway, and one displaying a normal-like gene expression profile. The classification was validated in the remaining 123 samples plus an independent set of 1, 058 <b>CC</b> <b>samples,</b> including eight public datasets. Furthermore, prognosis was analyzed in the subset of stage II-III <b>CC</b> <b>samples.</b> The subtypes C 4 and C 6, but not the subtypes C 1, C 2, C 3, and C 5, were independently associated with shorter relapse-free survival, even after adjusting for age, sex, stage, and the emerging prognostic classifier Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay recurrence score (hazard ratio 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 1, p =  0. 0097). However, a limitation of this study is that information on tumor grade and number of nodes examined was not available. We describe the first, to our knowledge, robust transcriptome-based classification of CC that improves the current disease stratification based on clinicopathological variables and common DNA markers. The biological relevance of these subtypes is illustrated by significant differences in prognosis. This analysis provides possibilities for improving prognostic models and therapeutic strategies. In conclusion, we report a new classification of CC into six molecular subtypes that arise through distinct biological pathways...|$|R

The <b>CC</b> <b>samples</b> were at the same occasion also used to validate a previously obtained pregnancy prediction model comprising three genes (ephrin-B 2 (EFNB 2), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID, stanniocalcin 1). Latter validation yielded a correct pregnant/ non-pregnant classification in 72 % of the samples. Subsequently, 9 new genes were analyzed on the same samples and new prediction models were built.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human female meiosis is {{particularly}} error prone, {{leading to the}} generation of aneuploidy, a problem which increases dramatically with advancing age. Despite being of great clinical importance, the genesis of oocyte aneuploidy remains poorly understood. Cumulus cells (CCs) surround oocytes in antral follicles and {{play a crucial role}} in regulating their maturation. During this investigation, we aimed to obtain an insight into the follicular environment of oocytes that become aneuploid and identify non-invasive markers of oocyte chromosome status and competence. METHODS: Microarray comparative genomic hybridization was used to assess oocyte ploidy. Expression of 96 genes was examined via a large real-time PCR experiment in 51 <b>CC</b> <b>samples,</b> whereas an additional 26 CC clumps were used for a more focused real-time PCR experiment assessing just three genes. Gene selection was based on the results of a previous microarray analysis comparing the transcriptome of CCs from normal and aneuploid oocytes. RESULTS: Fifty eight of the investigated genes were confirmed to be expressed in CCs. Patterns of expression were generally similar among all <b>CC</b> <b>samples,</b> regardless of the chromosomal status of the corresponding oocyte. However, two genes, SPSB 2 and TP 53 I 3, were both significantly down-regulated in CCs from chromosomally abnormal oocytes (P< 0. 05). The expression of SPSB 2 was also found to display a strong trend towards up-regulation in the CCs of oocytes that produced a healthy live birth (P= 0. 054). CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, SPSB 2 and TP 53 I 3 exhibited highly significant differences in their expression between CCs of normal and chromosomally abnormal oocytes. SPSB 2 is involved in intracellular signalling and homeostasis, whereas TP 53 I 3 regulates carbohydrate metabolism and apoptosis. We speculate that both these genes might have the potential to serve as non-invasive markers of oocyte aneuploidy...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) {{have been}} widely used in {{environmental}} monitoring applications because sensors are cheap and portable. These tiny distributed <b>sensors</b> provide discrete <b>samples</b> of environmental parameters; for example, temperature, humidity, gas pressure, decibel levels, and so on. Since sensors are always constrained by their limited battery power, how to efficiently use a large number of distributed <b>sensors</b> and their <b>samples</b> in an application with the most minimal expenditure of energy is of great importance. In this thesis we have presented a series of intelligent sampling approaches. It is worthwhile to point out that <b>sampling</b> in <b>sensor</b> networks has many interesting properties. First, <b>sensor</b> <b>sampling</b> has two dimensions. The temporal dimension decides how many <b>samples</b> a <b>sensor</b> should obtain. In our sampling approaches, the temporal sampling is used to adjust the <b>sensor</b> <b>sampling</b> rates and provide the required data quality under a noisy environment. The spatial dimension selects a subset of sensors in a distributed fashion to save sampling and transmission costs. We also find that <b>sensor</b> <b>sampling</b> depends on applications. Different applications (e. g. different queries, data cleaning, pattern search) usually require different approaches to enable the optimal use of the <b>samples</b> and <b>sensors.</b> Even different scenarios of an application (e. g. in a pattern search application, the sensory data may have or have no spatial similarity) affect the design of a sampling approach. This thesis includes three main parts: (1) intelligent sampling for summary and range queries, (2) intelligent sampling for a data cleaning application, and (3) intelligent sampling for more complex sensor queries, such as pattern query over distributed sensory streams, and max regional aggregate query. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed sampling approaches in different applications...|$|R

Variation(s) in the exclusively maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) might contribute to this parental effect. Thirty-two to 40 mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available from genome-wide association study SNP arrays (Affymetrix 6. 0). For discovery, we analyzed association in a case-control (<b>CC)</b> <b>sample</b> of 1, 158 extremely obese children and adolescents and 435 lean adult controls. For independent confirmation, 7, 014 population-based adults were analyzed as <b>CC</b> <b>sample</b> of n = 1, 697 obese cases (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) and n = 2, 373 normal weight and lean controls (BMI< 25 kg/m 2). SNPs were analyzed as single SNPs and haplogroups determined by HaploGrep. Fisher's two-sided exact test was used for association testing. Moreover, the D-loop was re-sequenced (Sanger) in 192 extremely obese children and adolescents and 192 lean adult controls. Association testing of detected variants was performed using Fisher's two-sided exact test. For discovery, nominal association with obesity was found for the frequent allele G of m. 8994 G/A (rs 28358887, p = 0. 002) located in ATP 6. Haplogroup W was nominally overrepresented in the controls (p = 0. 039). These findings could not be confirmed independently. For two of the 252 identified D-loop variants nominal association was detected (m. 16292 C/T, p = 0. 007, m. 16189 T/C, p = 0. 048). Only eight controls carried the m. 16292 T allele, five of whom belonged to haplogroup W that was initially enriched among these controls. m. 16189 T/C might create an uninterrupted poly-C tract located near a regulatory element involved in replication of mtDNA.
