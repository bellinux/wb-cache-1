5000|$|One {{issue with}} the GSS is {{internal}} <b>consistency</b> <b>reliability,</b> specifically {{in regards to the}} Shift portion of the measure. Both Shift-positive and Shift-negative are associated with levels of internal <b>consistency</b> <b>reliability</b> of x2 < [...]60. Internal Shift scores have been reported as x2 = [...]60, which is [...] "unacceptably low". These numbers serve as a possible explanation for why studies have not found [...] "theoretically meaningful correlations" [...] between the Shift sub-scale and other external criteria. Researchers argue against the use of a Total suggestibility composite due to evidence that Yield 1 and Shift scores do not significantly correlate with each other. This absence of a correlation is problematic because it [...] "suggests that yielding to a leading question and yielding to negative feedback from an interviewer operate under completely different processes". Other researchers have found that {{there are two types of}} suggestibility: direct and indirect. The failure to take these into account may have led to methodological problems with the GSS. Researchers suggest that until these issues have been addressed, the GSS should only be limited to the Yield sub-scale.|$|E

Item-level test-retest reliabilities were acceptable for an ObsRO instrument, as were the subscale-level test-retest reliabilities (except for the Behavior Impact subscale). The internal <b>consistency</b> <b>reliabilities</b> of the GRCD were appropriate for its intended use, and inter-item correlations were generally as expected, providing evidence for construct validity. Correlational analyses supported the construct validity of the GRCD items, subscales, and total score and hypothesis tests in support of discriminating ability were in the anticipated direction and some were statistically significant, helping to verify the validity and usefulness of the GRCD. Responsiveness statistics were large, suggesting that the GRCD is capable of detecting change, a property that will be essential in future therapeutic trials.|$|R
