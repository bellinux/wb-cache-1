5000|$|Infiltration {{is caused}} by two forces: gravity and {{capillary}} action. While smaller pores offer greater resistance to gravity, very small pores pull water through capillary action in addition to and even against the force of gravity. [...] The rate of infiltration is determined by soil characteristics including ease of entry, storage capacity, and transmission rate through the soil. The soil texture and structure, vegetation types and cover, water content of the soil, soil temperature, and rainfall intensity all {{play a role in}} controlling infiltration rate and capacity. For example, coarse-grained sandy soils have large spaces between each grain and allow water to infiltrate quickly. Vegetation creates more porous soils by protecting the soil from raindrop impact, which can close natural gaps between soil particles, loosening soil through root action and enhancing the presence of soil organism like termites, worms and small mammals that have a direct impact on soil bulk densities. This is why forested areas have the highest infiltration rates of any vegetative types. [...] The top layer of leaf litter that is not decomposed protects the soil from the pounding action of rain; without this the soil can become far less permeable. In chaparral vegetated areas, the hydrophobic oils in the succulent leaves can be spread over the soil surface with fire, creating large areas of hydrophobic soil. Other conditions that can lower infiltration rates or block them include dry plant litter that resists re-wetting, or frost. If soil is saturated at the time of an intense freezing period, the soil can become a <b>concrete</b> <b>frost</b> on which almost no infiltration would occur. Over an entire watershed, there are likely to be gaps in the <b>concrete</b> <b>frost</b> or hygroscopic soil where water could infiltrate. [...] Once water has infiltrated the soil it remains in the soil, percolates down to the ground water table, or becomes part of the subsurface runoff process.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrology}} and geochemistry of meltwaters {{and streams}} during rain-on-snow {{events in a}} small boreal watershed in eastern Canada indicated that rapid runoff might occur during pre-melt and early melt periods due {{to the presence of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>frost</b> in litter and upper organic soil horizons. The approximate extent of <b>concrete</b> <b>frost</b> cover in the catchment was estimated from prevailing meteorological conditions for the winter–spring periods in 1982 – 83 as “high ” (> 75 % cover); in 1983 – 84 as “medium ” (≈ 50 % cover) and in 1984 – 85 as “low ” (< 5 % cover). When <b>concrete</b> <b>frost</b> coverage was medium to high then runoff was 20 % to 40 % of melt + rainfall to the <b>concrete</b> <b>frost</b> area of the basin. The efficiency with which runoff from <b>concrete</b> <b>frost</b> “contributing ” areas reached the stream was 25 – 50 %, but increased to near 100 % for a high rain on snow event. However, the “efficiency ” of chemical relocation in runoff from contributing areas varied from 60 % to 600 % depending on the species used as a tracer. This large range of values can be ascribed to the leaching of ground cover, litter and organic soil above or embedded in the frost cover, the patchiness of frost cover, erosion of the frost cover and flow through riparian zones. It is concluded that simple direct routing techniques will not always be able to successfully describe the complex phenomenon of runoff from variable frozen ground at small to medium scales...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the results from the}} precision evaluation of the modified slab test for resistance of <b>concrete</b> to internal <b>frost</b> damage. Two round Robin tests, one at the Nordic level and another at the RILEM level, were carried out in the project. Three non-destructive detecting techniques, Ultrasonic Pulse Transmission Time (UPTT), Dilation (length change) and Fundamental Frequency (FF), were evaluated through the round Robin tests. A destructive method (flexural strength test) was employed to examine the deterioration of concrete in mechanical properties due to internal frost damage. The results show that all the three techniques can be employed in the slab test for detecting internal damage of <b>concrete</b> subjected to <b>frost</b> attack. The dilation method reveals a better repeatability, but has a reproducibility similar to the UPTT technique. The temperature effect on test precision seems not significant. Therefore, the same frost test procedure as described in the Swedish standard SS 72 13 44 can be used in the modified slab test. Due to {{a very small number of}} laboratories participated in the FF test the precision estimate for this technique involves a large uncertainty.

40|$|<b>Concrete</b> {{undergoing}} early <b>frost</b> {{damage in}} cold weather will experience significant loss of not only strength, but also of permeability and durability. Accordingly, concrete codes like ACI- 306 R prescribe a minimum compressive strength and duration of curing to prevent frost damage {{at an early age}} and secure the quality of concrete. Such minimum compressive strength and duration of curing are mostly defined based on the strength development of concrete. However, <b>concrete</b> subjected to <b>frost</b> damage at early age may not show a consistent relationship between its strength and durability. Especially, since durability of concrete is of utmost importance in nuclear power plant structures, this relationship should be imperatively clarified. Therefore, this study verifies the feasibility of the minimum compressive strength specified in the codes like ACI- 306 R by evaluating the strength development and the durability preventing the frost damage of early age concrete for nuclear power plant. The results indicate that the value of 5 MPa specified by the concrete standards like ACI- 306 R as the minimum compressive strength to prevent the early frost damage is reasonable in terms of the strength development, but seems to be inappropriate in the viewpoint of the resistance to chloride ion penetration and freeze-thaw. Consequently, it is recommended to propose a minimum compressive strength preventing early frost damage in terms of not only the strength development, but also in terms of the durability to secure the quality of concrete for nuclear power plants in cold climates...|$|R

It was found, that depending on kinetics of water absorption and composition of concrete, closed porosity of concrete varies within the limits from 3. 51  % to 10. 62  %, open porosity of concrete varies within the limits from 10. 96  % to 15. 09  %, and predicted number of frost resistance of concrete in cycles varies within the limits from 550 to 1000.

Also it has been experimentally shown that ratio of relative decreasing R to ε in direction, perpendicular to compression, is assumed to be independent on values R and ε for a given concrete and on the ways of achieving them during mechanical or freeze-thaw cycling. To determine the dependence δR/R by ε (z) 8 specimens were tested by non-destructive method (RU 2 490 631) and two baths of 50 specimens by basic method (thermo cycling). Results of the non-destructive method are different from results by basic method for 6. 3 %. Dependence of relative decreasing in strength by rate of strain is near to linear and, therefore, value of z is constant.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a simplified method of obtaining future climate data inputs for natural resource models and apply that method to three locations within the continental United States to assess the effect of climate change on soil erosion, runoff, and fire risk. A method was developed for quickly obtaining future climate data over a wide range of scenarios, General Circulation Models (GCMs), and timescales from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) and Fifth Assessment Report (AR 5) model families using the MarkSim® DSSAT Weather Generator and a Microsoft Excel VBA Macro, the final result being a properly formatted parameter file which can be used by CLIGEN (CLImate GENerator) within the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. By using software which already exists on most computers and not requiring climatological or modeling knowledge to operate, the method herein for creating WEPP climate input files is fast and simple, requiring as little as 15 minutes. ^ At the first site, analysis of a small (6. 7 acre, 2. 71 ha) field site monitored as part of the USDA-ARS Conservation Effects Assessment Project in NE Indiana was conducted to determine the effect of climate change on agricultural resources. Precipitation, runoff, soil erosion, and crop growth were modeled using WEPP and the four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios used with the CMIP 5 model family from the IPCC 5 AR to determine the effectiveness of common agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) under predicted climate change. Although precipitation is predicted here to increase by 2100, sediment loss and runoff will decrease due to a reduction of <b>concrete</b> <b>frost</b> conditions during late winter. However, an increase in the amount of precipitation falling in spring and earlier soybean senescence was predicted to lead to increased soil loss in early spring and fall. ^ At the second site, a small agricultural hillslope managed by the USDA-ARS in the Southern Coastal Plain of the United States was modeled using WEPP under current and future climates to assess the effect of predicted future climate change on soil erosion, runoff, and BMP effectiveness. Future climate data was similar to that used at the first site. Predicted climatic shift caused soil loss and runoff to be reduced {{in the first three months}} of the year, while late fall and early winter months had increases in predicted soil loss and runoff. Increased temperatures were predicted to cause winter cover crops to grow faster, unhindered by frost in winter. Soil loss increased when cotton senesced earlier under warmer temperatures. Early season water deficits and higher evapotranspiration also increased irrigation demands in the growing season. The combination of no-till, rye cover crop, and riparian buffer increased in effectiveness into the future, while all other management systems had either similar or slightly reduced effectiveness under predicted future climate. ^ At the third site, the Blackwood Creek watershed, a tributary of Lake Tahoe in California, was assessed for potential changes in climate and fire risk under 21 st century climates projected by the IPCC AR 5. While total precipitation varied by decade, the portion of precipitation falling as snow decreased by as much as 26 %, and projected air temperatures increased by as much as 3. 4 °C by 2090. Total soil water (TSW) predictions by WEPP indicated that fire ignition in the Sierra Nevada region from 1984 - 2013 coincided with simulated minimum TSW. Risk categories based on simulated TSW changed under projected future climate, with an increase in the number of high risk days defined by TSWs less than 40 mm. Simulated TSW in the Blackwood Creek watershed at the time of historic fires in the region also indicated that the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) was correlated to TSW (R 2 = 0. 59) when KBDI was less than 500. ...|$|E

40|$|Frost {{deterioration}} of concrete {{can result in}} severe consequences to the safety, durability and functionality of a structure since it impairs {{the strength of the}} <b>concrete.</b> <b>Frost</b> damage may occur to structures that are in contact with water and subjected to frost action. Different types of concrete damage, which are suspected to be frost related, have been observed in concrete structures in Swedish hydro power plants. Questions have consequently been raised regarding the durability of concrete in hydraulic structures in cold climates. “Hydraulic structure” is the umbrella term for structures in contact with water – hydro power stations, dams, locks, canals, harbours and bridge piles. Different types of suspected frost related damage to concrete structures in hydro power plants are identified and categorised in this thesis. The underlying causes of damage are experimentally investigated by means of laboratory and field studies. Knowledge about the {{deterioration of}} concrete is important in order to secure long service life for hydraulic structures. The obtained results can be used as input for repairs of existing structures {{and in the case of}} new builds. The results may also be applicable to hydraulic structures in other countries where similar environmental conditions are present. The environmental exposure conditions of most Swedish hydraulic structures can be considered harsh. Most hydraulic structures are in contact with water all year round and are subjected to frost action in winter. The water in Swedish rivers is generally considered soft due to the geology of Sweden. Ice floes and driftwood may also cause abrasive wear to some structures. Progressive deterioration of the concrete surface occurs at the waterline of many hydraulic structures. Despite the fact that these structures are exposed to fresh water, the damage is similar in appearance to salt scaling of concrete. Surface deterioration results in exposure of the coarse aggregate and eventually the reinforcing steel. Analysis of the chemical composition of the cement paste shows that long-term exposure to soft water causes leaching of the concrete surface. Leaching leads to a decrease in the resistance against frost action and abrasion. The surface of frost resistant concrete may also suffer from frost damage if subjected to leaching prior to freezing. This thesis experimentally demonstrates that different degradation mechanisms can boost each other since the amount of superficial damage caused by the combined effects of leaching, frost action and abrasion exceeded the total amount of damage separately caused by these mechanisms. Progressive deterioration of the concrete surface at the waterline begins with leaching during the spring, summer and autumn months. Hence, the concrete surface becomes susceptible to frost action and is damaged in winter. During the spring, the damaged surface layer falls off and the process begins again. In some cases, internal damage has been observed at and just above the waterline of hydro power structures built prior to the 1950 s. Experimental results show that internal frost damage may occur above the waterline in non-frost resistant concrete. Determination of saturation levels in concrete in existing structures and in specimens after laboratory tests showed that the risk of internal frost damage at and above the waterline is low in frost resistant concrete. Another type of internal damage has been observed far below the waterline of thin water retaining concrete structures. The damage can be characterised by spalling of large concrete pieces. All damaged structures were subjected to long periods of unidirectional freezing in winter. The studies performed show that poor concrete quality and the effects of ageing and imperfections in the concrete may facilitate growth of macroscopic ice lenses, which causes spalling. In mechanically sound concrete with a water to cement ratio (w/c) lower than 0. 9, the risk of macroscopic ice lens growth is low. In concrete with internal cracking due to frost damage, spalling may occur within a few days regardless of the w/c-ratio. Concrete spalling may occur also in concrete with cavities and other imperfections. However, the higher the quality of concrete, the longer the freezing time required to facilitate macroscopic ice lens growth. Since unfavourable temperature and saturation conditions may exist in winter, the risk of macroscopic ice lens growth in thin water retaining concrete structures cannot be overlooked. Determination of saturation levels in concrete from a 55 -year old dam showed that high saturation levels are to be expected so that even frost resistant concrete is at risk of frost damage. Microstructural observations of concrete from the dam further showed that the frost resistance of concrete can be reduced due to the fact that air voids fill with ettringite and calcium hydroxide crystals over time. In spite of high saturation levels in the concrete, the risk of frost damage can be minimised by preventing thin water retaining structures from freezing in winter...|$|E
40|$|Klimafremskrivninger varsler en fremtid med hyppigere og mer intense nedbørhendelser. Stadig utbygging av flere sentrumsnære boliger medfører høyere grad av fortetting, og skaper store avrenningsvolum som infrastrukturen ofte ikke er dimensjonert for å takle. Store investeringskostnader knyttet til oppgradering av ledningsnett fremmer nytenking, og resulterer i at overvann i større grad håndteres lokalt. Denne oppgaven omhandler regnbed som tiltak for overvannshåndtering. Regnbed kan beskrives som en beplantet nedsenkning i terrenget, hvor det forekommer infiltrasjon og fordrøyning av overvann. Per i dag er regnbed et lite kjent og benyttet overvannstiltak i Norge. Tre regnbed i småhusbebyggelse ble undersøkt med hovedfokus på hydrologisk ytelse under norske forhold. To regnbed i Oslo og ett i Melhus kommune utgjorde testobjektene i feltarbeidet, der geometrisk oppmåling, infiltrasjonsmålinger og vannføringsmålinger ble utført. Installerte {{instrumenter}} logget naturlige nedbørhendelser i regnbedene. Forsøkene knyttet til hydrologisk ytelse ble gjennomført ved å utsette regnbedene for kraftig hydraulisk belastning (syntetisk nedbør). Det ble etterstrebet at tilførte vannmengder skulle tilsvare nedbørhendelser med 25 - 50 års gjentaksintervall. Regnbedenes hydrologiske ytelse ble bestemt ved blant annet måling av videreført vannføring og dreneringstid. Målingene ga grunnlag for beregning av flomtoppreduksjon og forsinkelsestid. Observasjoner fra feltarbeid ble i tillegg benyttet i hydrologiske modeller for å simulere nedbørhendelser utover observasjonsgrunnlaget. Resultater fra simulert syntetisk nedbør viser en betydelig demping av kraftige nedbørhendelser opp til 50 års gjentaksintervall. Resultater fra modellering viser at regnbedene er sårbare overfor nedbør med høy intensitet og kort varighet. Regnbedenes geometri spiller en viktig rolle for god hydrologisk ytelse. Ved bruk av større overflateareal viser resultatene forholdsvis god tilbakeholdelse. Storskalaimplementering av regnbed i et eksisterende delfelt i Veumdalen i Fredrikstad kommune, viser at regnbedene holdt tilbake hele 20 års regnet. Dette ga en betydelig vannføringsreduksjon ut av delfeltet. I nedbørfelt med høy andel impermeable flater, bør imidlertid ytterligere overvannstiltak vurderes for å oppnå tilfredsstillende reduksjon av vannføring. Regnbedets ytelse under kalde forhold påvirkes ikke nødvendigvis av frost i jorden. Imidlertid kan frosttypen være av stor betydning. Porøs og granulær frost kan ha god infiltrasjonsevne, grunnet åpne porekanaler. Betongfrost er derimot impermeabel, og kan svekke hydrologisk ytelse betydelig. Frosttypen avhenger av grad av vannmetning, temperatur og jordtekstur i filtermedia. Observasjoner kan tyde på at regnbed fungerer bra under kalde forhold, med forbehold om god vannledningsevne under varme forhold og lavt vanninnhold ved temperaturer under 0 °C. Climate projections foresee {{more frequent}} and intense precipitation events in the future. An increasing development of centrally located housing involves {{a higher degree of}} densification, and creates large runoff volumes that infrastructure is often not designed to handle. Large investment costs associated with upgrading the pipeline network promotes innovation, handling the stormwater locally. This thesis treats rain gardens as measures for stormwater management. Rain gardens can be described as a planted depression in the ground, which allows infiltration and retention of stormwater runoff. Today rain gardens are little known and rarely used as a stormwater measure in Norway. Three rain gardens in areas with individual housing were studied, focusing on hydrological performance under Norwegian conditions. The field investigations were conducted in the municipalities of Oslo and Melhus. Geometric-, infiltration- and flow measurements were performed at each site, and installed instruments logged actual precipitation events in the rain gardens. The experiments related to the hydrological performance were conducted by exposing the rain gardens to a heavy hydraulic load (synthetic precipitation). It was pursued to make the supplied water volumes correspond to precipitation events with a 25 - 50 year return period. Hydrological performance was determined by measurement of the outlet flow and filter bed drain time. The measurements provided the basis for the calculation of peak flow reduction and retention time. Observations from the field investigations were additionally applied in hydrological models, to simulate rainfall events beyond the observational basis. Results from the simulated synthetic precipitation show a significant reduction of heavy precipitation events up to a 50 year return period. Results from modeling simulations show that rain gardens are vulnerable with regard to precipitation with high intensity and short duration. The geometry features {{an important role in the}} hydrologic performance of rain gardens. The results show a fairly satisfactory retention, using a larger surface area. Large-scale implementation of rain gardens in an existing sub-catchment in Veumdalen, Fredrikstad. Model results show that the rain gardens retained a precipitation event with a 20 year return period. This reduced the water flow out of the sub-catchment significantly. In order to achieve satisfactory reduction of discharge from sub-catchment with high proportion of impermeable surfaces, additional storm water measures should be considered. The performance of rain gardens during cold climate conditions is not necessarily affected by the presence of soil frost. The frost type however, is of great importance. Porous and granular frost may provide a high infiltration capacity, due to open pore canals in the soil. <b>Concrete</b> <b>frost</b> however, appears impermeable and may impair the hydrological performance significantly. The frost type depends on the degree of water saturation, temperature and soil texture in the filter media. Observations suggest that rain gardens perform well under cold conditions, subject to high hydraulic conductivity under warm conditions and low water content at temperatures below 0 °C...|$|E
40|$|In the {{freezing}} and thawing test of <b>concrete,</b> the <b>frost</b> damage is nondestructively evaluated by elastic-wave methods.

Re-examining formula to estimate dynamic moduli of elasticity in the standards available, evaluation of the frost damage by the elastic-wave methods is studied. Concerning the resonant frequencies of concrete samples, a three-dimensional analysis is performed by the boundary element method to identify actual vibrating-modes. It is clarified that an assumption of the one-dimensional resonant vibration is not applicable, because the assumption is responsible for a discrepancy between the dynamic and the static moduli.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the article}} the {{incipient}} experimental works about using of alkali-activated mortars in an aggressive environment are introduced. Several types of mortars with different composition were prepared and examined. Observed properties of alkali-activated mortars were: resistance of cement concrete's surface to water and defrosting chemicals, resistance against crack formation and development, adhesion to the <b>concrete</b> base and <b>frost</b> resistance. The {{purpose of this}} experiment was to propose a mixture of alkali-activated material that would be suitable for application {{in the form of}} a screed for concrete and other materials. The pilot tests were performed with several mixtures with different combinations of initial materials. They were also tested in different mixing ratios, depending on the rheological properties of the respective individual mixtures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConcrete and {{reinforcement}} {{used for}} making of reinforced concrete foundations, can {{be exposed to}} different aggressive impacts of the environment. As a consequence, reinforced concrete material deteriorates in time. There is a number of methods, i. e. ways to prevent the damage of reinforced concrete foundations. In the paper are mentioned some of the methods such as: proper selection of foundation depth, construction of the gravel layer below the foundations, construction of the proper drainage and construction of adequate moist and water insulation, proper placing and curing of concrete. In additions, during design of concrete mixes, one must {{take into consideration the}} degree of exposure of concrete to the external impacts. In the design of the concrete mix, various admixtures are used, providing appropriate water-tightness of <b>concrete</b> and <b>frost</b> resistance. Also various coating chemical can be used as the additional protection of the concrete surface, such as: hydrophobic silicon impregnation chemical, epoxy resins, bitumen sealing strips or self-adhesive strips, bitumen emulsions, synthetic foils (membranes), hydro-insulation cement masses, bentonite barriers, studded foils (membranes) HDPE, bathtub –like structures [...] . A special attention must be paid to the thickness of the protective layer of the concrete, as well as (when needed) to the choice of reinforcement resistant to corrosion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from {{a study of the}} effects of mineral additions on chloride penetration into <b>concrete</b> under the <b>frost</b> action. Mineral additions namely fly-ash (FA), silica fume (SF), GGBF slag (SL) were used to replace some part of cement in concrete. Seven types of concrete were investigated. All specimens were immersed in tap water or NaCl solutions under the freeze-thaw (F-T) and the climate room conditions. The results showed that the frost action significantly increase liquid uptake in both plain Portland cement concrete and concrete with mineral additions whatever specimens were exposed to tap water or salt solutions. Incorporation of mineral additions in concrete can in general reduce the amount of uptaken liquid. As a conclusion, incorporation of mineral additions and proper entraining air pores in concrete can improve resistance of concrete to chloride penetration even under the frost action...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{extensive}} use of reinforced concrete as building materials in the last century, even in severe and aggressive environment, the demand for designing durable structure has increased together {{with the need for}} developing reliable and appropriate models which allow the prediction of concrete behaviour on time. One of the most severe types of deterioration in r. c. structures is associated to the volume expansion of <b>concrete</b> caused by <b>frost</b> attack. Actually in cold environments, freezing and thawing can be detrimental for a brittle material such as concrete, especially related to its porosity characteristics. The causes and mechanisms of frost damaging process have been dealt with by several research papers, but very little attention has been given to the effect of frost attack on the material characteristics and on the bond properties of concrete, see e. g. [1] where {{it has been shown that}} the relations between compressive and tensile strength for undamaged concrete cannot be used directly for frost-damaged concrete. In this paper the environmental-mechanical coupled damage model, based on the works of Saetta et al [2] – [3] and Tesser et al. [4] was developed accounting for the deterioration of concrete during the freeze-thawing (F/T) process. A 4 -node finite element based on Reissner-Mindlin thick plate formulation with Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components is used. Stress resultants are evaluated via numerical integration of the concrete plastic damage model over the thickness. Moreover an enhanced formulation [5] of the environmental damage is presented, which takes into account the effect of the number of F/T cycles on the value of concrete strength and ductility. In particular both uniaxial and biaxial experimental tests of <b>concrete</b> subjected to <b>frost</b> damage were considered and an optimization technique was adopted to calibrate the coupled damage model. Test results showed a significant influence of freeze–thaw cycles on the compressive strength and on biaxial behaviour. Finally the paper presents a case study able to evaluate the model capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{arch dam}} at Selsforsen and the {{buttress}} dam at Storfinnforsen are two concrete dams of which both {{have suffered from}} severe surface spalling on the upstream face, far below the full water supply level. A hypothesis is that macroscopic ice lens growth, similar to frost heave in soil, could have occurred within the dam walls. After initial deterioration of the <b>concrete</b> dams by <b>frost</b> damage or cracking, the formation of macroscopic ice lenses {{could have been made}} possible. In an attempt to test the hypothesis, specimens of low strength concrete were exposed in the laboratory to climatic boundary conditions {{similar to those of the}} dams. After one week of freezing, the upper part of the concrete specimens was separated from the lower part due to cracking. The gradual propagation of the crack, which appeared about 25 mm below the top surface, was caused by macroscopic ice lens growth...|$|R
40|$|Spalling of {{concrete}} {{has been observed}} in water retaining concrete structures exposed to long periods of freezing weather. A hypothesis is that poor quality concrete, inadequate compaction or aging make hardened concrete susceptible to macroscopic ice lens growth, i. e. ice segregation. To simulate winter conditions, the top surface {{of concrete}} specimens was subjected to freezing, whereas the bottom surface was submerged in heated water. Given constant thermal conditions, ice segregation occurred in sound concrete with w/c-ratio 0. 9 and higher. In <b>concrete</b> with internal <b>frost</b> damage, ice segregation occurred {{within a few days}} regardless of the w/c-ratio. Ice segregation also occurred in specimens with paper sheets cast into the concrete to form cavities. However, the period of freezing required to facilitate ice segregation increased with decreasing w/c-ratio. The risk of macroscopic ice lens growth in actual structures cannot be overlooked since unfavourable temperature and moisture conditions may exist in winter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{recycled}} concrete {{was prepared}} {{by using the}} high-strength artificial aggregates. This kind of concrete can be completely regenerated to be cement, and the recycling utilization of the concrete can also be truly realized. The frost resistance and influencing factors of the recycled concrete were studied. The {{results show that the}} mechanical performance and frost resistance of artificial aggregates recycled concrete are better than those of the ordinary concrete under the same water/cement ratio condition. When the water/cement ratio is 0. 40, the relative dynamic elastic modulus, weight loss and frost durability factor of the recycled concrete are 98. 7 %, 0. 5 % and 65. 8 after 200 times freeze-thaw cycles. When the fly ash and silica fume were added into the recycled <b>concrete,</b> the <b>frost</b> resistance can be improved. The optimal amounts of fly ash and silica fume are 30 % and 15 % of cement by weight, respectively. The recycled concrete was prepared with the optimal fly ash and silica fume content, respectively. After 200 times freeze-thaw cycles, the relative dynamic elastic modulus of the recycled concrete are 99. 1 % and 99. 2 %, and the weight losses of the recycled concrete are 0. 4 % and 0. 3 %, and antifreeze durability coefficient of the recycled concrete are 66. 07 and 66. 13. Therefore, the recycled concrete with silica fume has better frost resistance performance than that with fly ash as admixture...|$|R
5000|$|Treval Clifford Powers (1900-1977) was a 20th century {{materials}} scientist considered [...] "the {{father of}} the modern science of cement-based materials." [...] He made contributions {{to the understanding of}} the structure of fresh and hardened cement paste and achieved fundamental results on concrete rheology, workability, consistency, durability, shrinkage and swelling, creep, and resistance of <b>concrete</b> to <b>frost,</b> sulfates and abrasion. Born on February 8, 1900, in Palouse, Washington, Powers studied chemistry at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, a small private college founded in 1846. From 1930 until his retirement in 1965 he conducted research at the famous PCA (Portland Cement Association) Laboratories (located initially in Chicago and later in Skokie, Illinois). For many years until his retirement in 1965 he served as the PCA Director. His stellar research achievements earned him top honors. The ACI (American Concrete Institute) bestowed on Powers its highest award, the Wason Medal for Materials Research; in fact, it did so three times, in 1933, 1940 and 1948, which is a singular case in ACI history testifying to his fundamental contributions. In 1957, Powers received the S.E. Thompson Award from the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and, in 1976, the Arthur R. Anderson Award from the ACI. In 1961 he became an Honorary Member of ACI and, also in 1961, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of Toledo. During 1967-68 he lectured as Visiting Professor at the University of Toronto. He died on June 30, 1997, in Green Valley, AZ. The founding conference of IA-ConCreep at M.I.T. in 2001 was dedicated to Powers, to honor his memory.|$|R
