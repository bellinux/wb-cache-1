5|$|A Diver {{breathes}} a <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> mixture {{that contains}} inert gas which dissolves {{in the various}} tissues during the pressure exposure. When the ascent is initiated, the inert gas is off-loaded {{as soon as a}} suitable gradient is created.|$|E
5|$|Most {{countries}} require diving cylinders to {{be checked}} on a regular basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test. The inspection and testing requirements for scuba cylinders may {{be very different from}} the requirements for other <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> containers due to the more corrosive environment.|$|E
5|$|The NFPA 704 {{standard}} rates {{compressed oxygen}} gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) {{is given a}} health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings {{are the same as}} the <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> form.|$|E
50|$|Within laboratories, <b>compressed</b> <b>gases</b> {{are usually}} {{supplied}} either through fixed piped gas systems or individual cylinders of <b>gases.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>gases</b> can be toxic, flammable, oxidizing, corrosive, or inert. Leakage {{of any of}} these gases can be hazardous.|$|R

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries {{meet their}} deaths {{at the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment to kill his opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of <b>compressed</b> <b>gas,</b> causing him to inflate and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and their deaths often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner has noted that a number of the villains or henchmen have met their deaths through Bond using the technology of the villains against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard skewered by a nuclear fuel rod.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over {{the next two weeks}} the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.|$|E
5|$|Transportation of {{hazardous}} materials {{for commercial purposes}} in the USA is regulated by Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 - Transportation, (abbreviated 49 CFR). A cylinder containing 200kPa (29.0psig/43.8psia) or greater at 20°C (68°F) of non-flammable, nonpoisonous <b>compressed</b> <b>gas,</b> and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as HAZMAT (hazardous materials) in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400psi) by several manufacturers.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, the Bell Rocketbelt was {{presented}} to the public. The jet of gas was provided by a hydrogen peroxide-powered rocket, but the jet could also be provided by a turbojet engine, a ducted fan, or other kinds of rockets powered by solid fuel, liquid fuel or <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> (usually nitrogen).|$|E
25|$|A nearly {{isobaric}} {{solution is}} possible if the <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> {{is used to}} drive a hydroelectric system. However, this solution requires large pressure tanks located on land (as well as the underwater air bags). Also, hydrogen gas is the preferred fluid, since other gases suffer from substantial hydrostatic pressures at even relatively modest depths (such as 500 meters).|$|E
50|$|Safety: <b>Compressed</b> <b>gases</b> tend {{to expand}} at high {{velocities}} when decompressed, thus pneumatics are typically {{limited to a}} working pressure of up to around 100 psi (7 bar).|$|R
50|$|A {{piston pump}} {{is a type}} of {{positive}} displacement pump where the high-pressure seal reciprocates with the piston. Piston pumps can be used to move liquids or <b>compress</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Blowguns and {{pneumatic}} rifles use <b>compressed</b> <b>gases,</b> {{while most}} other guns and cannons utilize expanding gases liberated by sudden chemical reactions. Light-gas guns {{use a combination}} of these mechanisms.|$|R
25|$|Axial flow {{compressors}} {{produce a}} continuous flow of <b>compressed</b> <b>gas,</b> {{and have the}} benefits of high efficiency and large mass flow rate, particularly {{in relation to their}} size and cross-section. They do, however, require several rows of airfoils to achieve a large pressure rise, making them complex and expensive relative to other designs (e.g. centrifugal compressors).|$|E
25|$|Breath-hold diving depth {{is limited}} in animals when the volume of rigid walled {{internal}} air spaces is occupied {{by all of the}} <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> of the breath and the soft spaces have collapsed under external pressure. Animals that can dive deeply have internal air spaces that can extensively collapse without harm, and may actively exhale before diving to avoid absorption of inert gas during the dive.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{centrifugal}} compressors, commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio {{of more than a}} 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in vapor-liquid separators.|$|E

5000|$|Reactivity hazards are {{assessed}} using the OSHA criterion of physical hazard. Seven such hazard classes are recognized:Water Reactives, Organic Peroxides, Explosives, <b>Compressed</b> <b>gases,</b> Pyrophoric materials, Oxidizers, and Unstable Reactives.|$|R
50|$|Pressure {{regulators}} use diaphragms as part {{of their}} design. Most uses of <b>compressed</b> <b>gasses,</b> for example, in gas welding and scuba diving rely on regulators to deliver their gas output at appropriate pressures. Automotive fuel systems frequently require fuel-pressure regulators; this is true of many fuel injection systems as well as in vehicles fueled with liquefied petroleum <b>gas</b> (autogas) and <b>compressed</b> natural <b>gas.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{tourniquet}} cuff bladder {{requires a}} source of <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> to supply a carefully controlled amount of tourniquet pressure. The gas used may be ambient air, nitrogen, or some other gas. Most modern tourniquet systems utilize low-pressure gas provided by pumps, while a few systems use high-pressure gas sources. Note that nitrous oxide or oxygen should never be used to inflate the tourniquet cuff, because of the increased risk of fire.|$|E
25|$|As the {{pressure}} increases, a point is reached where {{the pressure}} differential across the displacer rod becomes {{large enough to}} begin to push the displacer rod (and therefore also the displacer) towards the piston and thereby collapsing the cold space and transferring the cold, <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> towards the hot side in an almost constant volume process. As the gas arrives in the hot side the pressure increases and begins to move the piston outwards to initiate the expansion step as explained in (1).|$|E
25|$|Today modern {{spearfishing}} {{makes use}} of elastic powered spearguns and slings, or <b>compressed</b> <b>gas</b> pneumatic powered spearguns, to strike the hunted fish. Specialised techniques and equipment {{have been developed for}} various types of aquatic environments and target fish. Spearfishing may be done using free-diving, snorkelling, or scuba diving techniques. Spearfishing while using scuba equipment is illegal in some countries. The use of mechanically powered spearguns is also outlawed in some countries and jurisdictions. Spearfishing is highly selective, normally uses no bait and has no by-catch.|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} hazard is any hazard involving a machine or industrial process. Motor vehicles, aircraft, and air bags pose {{mechanical hazard}}s. <b>Compressed</b> <b>gases</b> or liquids {{can also be}} considered a mechanical hazard.|$|R
