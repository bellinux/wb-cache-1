Methods: Total of 463 patients (329 males and 134 females) hospitalized with the diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria and who were between 15 - 65 years of age were included in the study. We evaluated the age, gender, marital status, number of <b>children,</b> <b>onset</b> of the disease and subtype of schizophrenia.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Unilateral {{intracranial}} focal nonprogressive arteriopathy {{is often}} found in children with arterial ischemic stroke. We aimed to investigate the course of unilateral intracranial arteriopathy in young adults. METHODS: We searched the Utrecht Stroke Database for patients between 16 and 50 years of age diagnosed with anterior circulation arterial ischemic stroke and a nonatherosclerotic, unilateral intracranial large-artery arteriopathy between 1991 and 2005. We assessed clinical features, potential causes, risk factors, extent of infarction and arteriopathy at presentation, long-term angiographic course, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Of 356 patients with anterior circulation arterial ischemic stroke, 17 (5 %) had a documented unilateral intracranial arteriopathy, of whom 14 could be included for follow-up investigations (median age, 34 years; range, 27 - 49 years). Median duration of follow-up was 8. 8 years (range, 1. 7 - 12. 8 years). In 11 patients, onset of symptoms was not abrupt. The arteriopathy normalized completely in 5 and improved in 3 patients; in none of the patients did the arteriopathy worsen. Two of 14 patients had recurrent symptoms. Ten patients (71 %) had a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score</= 2). CONCLUSIONS: In young adults, arterial ischemic stroke is rarely caused by a unilateral intracranial arteriopathy. Similar to <b>children,</b> <b>onset</b> of symptoms in young adults is often not abrupt and the arteriopathy may improve over time. Late recurrences were rare. Possibly, a monophasic inflammatory process, as has been suggested for childhood intracranial focal nonprogressive arteriopathies, also occurs in young adults...|$|E

METHODS: Genotyping for the NOD 2 mutations p. Arg 702 Trp, p. Gly 908 Arg, and p. 1007 fs was performed in 171 CD <b>children</b> (<b>onset</b> of disease < 17 years; mean 11. 8 years) and in 253 controls. NOD 2 mutation status was correlated with the need for surgery during childhood. RESULTS: Seventy-eight children (45. 6 %) were carriers of at least 1 NOD 2 mutation versus 36 (14. 2 %) in the control group (P <. 0001). NOD 2 mutations were highly associated with CD and stricturing behavior (P <. 0001), with the p. 1007 fs mutation also conferring a risk for isolated ileal disease (P =. 003). Thirty-two children (18. 7 %) needed an intestinal resection with a significant association between the need of surgery and NOD 2 carrier status. Surgery occurred at an earlier stage of disease in children with p. 1007 fs mutations.

40|$|PurposeChildren's early {{onset of}} {{cannabis}} use was examined {{as a function}} of their parent's early onset of cannabis and subsequent incidence of a lifetime cannabis abuse or dependence disorder. MethodsProspective, longitudinal data from the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS) and the Rochester Intergenerational Study (RIGS) for 442 parent-child dyads (274 father-child, 168 mother-child) were utilized. The children were evenly split by sex. Logistic regression models and a path analysis were estimated to assess the effect of parent's cannabis use on <b>child's</b> <b>onset</b> of cannabis by age 15. ResultsFathers who began using cannabis by age 15 were more likely to meet the criteria for a lifetime cannabis disorder (O. R. = 5. 66, 95 % CI = 1. 89, 16. 90). The offspring of fathers who met the criteria for a disorder had higher odds of early initiation of cannabis use (O. R. = 9. 70, 95 % CI = 3. 00, 31. 34). Early onset cannabis use by father was indirectly associated with their <b>child's</b> <b>onset</b> of cannabis use via father's lifetime cannabis disorder. No significant effects for mothers were observed, although analyseswere limited due to the low rate of mothers who met the criteria for a lifetime cannabis disorder. ConclusionsThis study provides evidence of intergenerational continuity in cannabis use among fathers and their children and confirms the need to consider timing of use and intervening mechanisms in the study of continuity in cannabis use across generations.

40|$|Background: In <b>children,</b> <b>onset</b> {{time and}} {{duration}} of action of mivacurium are shorter than in adults. Some suggest that {{this is due to}} differences in plasma cholinesterase (pChe), whereas others indicate that there is no difference. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and pharmaco-kinetics of mivacurium in phenotypically normal children aged 3 – 6 and 10 – 14 years old, respectively. Methods: Ten children aged 3 – 6 years and 10 children aged 10 – 14 years were studied during halothane anaesthesia. Before in-duction of anaesthesia, a bloodsample was drawn to measure the pChe activity and phenotype. The neuromuscular block was monitored at the thumb using train-of-four (TOF) nerve stimula-tion every 12 s and mechanomyography. The times to different levels of neuromuscular recovery following mivacurium 0. 2 mg/kg were recorded. The concentrations in venous blood of the three isomers and the metabolites of mivacurium were measured. Results: No statistically significant difference was found in pChe activity or in the pharmacodynamics of mivacurium. The onset time was 1. 4 min (0. 8 – 1. 9) median (range) and 1. 3 min (1. 1 – IN CHILDREN, ED 95 of mivacurium is larger and theonset time and the duration of action shorter than in adults (1 – 4). This difference between children and adults is often explained by an age-dependent vari-ation in volume of distribution and in differences in plasma cholinesterase activity (pChe) (5, 6). Some studies in children have indicated that pChe is low at birth, increases to a maximum at the age of 3 – 6 years, and decreases to adult level at puberty (7, 8), but other studies indicate that no such differences exist (9 – 12). No studies have, however, evaluated the pharmaco-dynamics together with the pharmacokinetics of miv-acurium in young and older children and generally pharmacokinetic data following mivacurium ar...|$|E
40|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) is rarely seen in children. A literature search in 1989 revealed 52 published cases. The authors review 163 additional cases that were published since that date. The {{majority of these}} cases were related with a genetic condition. The most common aetiology was lysosomal storage disease: mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in 95 and mucolipidoses (ML) in 22. In CTS secondary to MPS, clinical signs typical of adult CTS are rarely seen, and difficulty with fine motor tasks is the most frequent finding. CTS in MPS {{does not seem to}} be prevented by bone marrow transplantation, the usual treatment for the condition. CTS is probably due to a combination of excessive lysosomal storage in the connective tissue of the flexor retinaculum and a distorted anatomy because of underlying bone dysplasia. Mucolipidoses come next in the aetiology, with essentially similar symptoms. The authors found in the literature 11 cases of primary familial CTS, a condition which presents as an inheritable disorder of connective tissue mediated by an autosomal dominant gene; the symptoms may be more typical in some cases, but are more similar to MPS in others. A case with self-mutilation has been reported. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterised by episodes of decreased sensation or palsies after slight traction or pressure on peripheral nerves; it may also give symptoms of CTS. Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS), another genetic disorder with autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia, is characterised by varying degrees of myotonia and chondrodysplasia; it has also been noted associated with CTS in a child. Melorrheostosis and Leri's syndrome have also been noted in children with CTS, as well as Déjerine-Sottas syndrome and Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Among non-genetic causes of CTS in children, idiopathic cases with <b>children</b> <b>onset</b> have been reported, usually but not always related with thickening of the transverse carpal ligament. Intensive sports practice has been reported as an aetiological factor in several cases of childhood CTS. Nerve territory oriented macrodactily, a benign localised form of gigantism, is another unusual cause of CTS in children, as are fibrolipomas of the median nerve or intraneural perineuroma or haemangioma of the median nerve. Acute cases have been reported in children with haemophilia, secondary to local bleeding. Another local cause is a musculotendinous malformation of the palmaris longus, the flexor digitorum superficialis, the flexor carpi radialis brevis (a supernumerary muscle), the first lumbricalis or the palmaris brevis. Isolated cases of childhood CTS have also been reported in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, in Poland's syndrome and in scleroderma. Finally, several cases have been noted following trauma, most often related with epiphysiolysis of the distal radius. Immediate reduction has cleared the problem in most cases, but exploration of the median nerve should be considered otherwise, and also in cases with delayed occurrence of symptoms. Overall 145 of the 163 reviewed cases have undergone open carpal tunnel release. Childhood CTS often has an unusual presentation, with modest complaints and children are often too young to communicate their problem. In CTS with specific aetiologies such as storage disease, the symptoms may be masked by the skeletal dysplasia and joint stiffness. Every child with even mild symptoms must be thoroughly examined and a family history must be taken. Children with storage disease may benefit from early clinical and electrophysiological screening before they develop obvious clinical signs. status: publishe...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: We studied the extent to which parent marijuana use in adolescence is associated with marijuana use onset in offspring through contextual family and peer risks. METHOD: Fathers assessed (n = 93) since childhood, their 146 offspring (n = 83 girls), and offspring’s mothers (n = 85) participated in a longitudinal study. Using discrete-time survival analysis, fathers’ (prospectively measured) and mothers’ (retrospective) adolescent marijuana use was used to predict offspring marijuana use onset through age 19 years. Parental monitoring, child exposure to marijuana use, peer deviance, peer marijuana use, and perceptions of parent disapproval of child use were measured before or concurrent with onset. RESULTS: Parents’ adolescent marijuana use was significantly associated with less monitoring, offspring alcohol use, the peer behaviors, exposure to adult marijuana use, and perceptions of less parent disapproval. Male gender and the two peer behaviors were positively associated with children’s marijuana use onset, controlling for their alcohol use. Parents’ adolescent marijuana use had a significant indirect effect on <b>child</b> <b>onset</b> through children’s deviant peer affiliations and a composite contextual risk score. CONCLUSIONS: Parents’ histories of marijuana use may contribute indirectly to children’s marijuana use onset through their influence on the social environments children encounter; specifically, those characterized by more liberal use norms, exposure to marijuana use and deviant and marijuana-using peers, and less adult supervision.

Recurrent seizures, visual loss, and myoclonus were mostly reported after a delay from onset; 7 children were chairbound and had severe dementia less than 4 years from <b>onset.</b> One <b>child,</b> with <b>onset</b> at 8 years, had a milder course. Three patients with a teenage/adult onset presented with a classic progressive myoclonic epilepsy phenotype that was preceded by learning disability in one. The EEG background was slow close to disease <b>onset</b> in 7 <b>children,</b> and later showed severe attenuation; a photoparoxysmal response (PPR) was present in all. The 3 teenage/adult patients had normal EEG background and an intense PPR. Early attenuation of the electroretinogram was seen only in <b>children</b> with <b>onset</b> younger than 5. 5 years. Somatosensory evoked potentials were extremely enlarged in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: In all patients, multifocal myoclonic jerks and seizures were a key feature, but myoclonic seizures were an early and prominent sign in the teenage/adult form only. Conversely, the childhood-onset form was characterized by initial and severe cognitive impairment coupled with electroretinogram and EEG attenuation. Cortical hyperexcitability, shown by the PPR and enlarged somatosensory evoked potentials, was a universal feature...|$|R
40|$|Aims Neonatal {{diabetes}} mellitus (NDM) {{is a rare}} monogenic disorder, reported to affect less than 2 cases per 100, 000 infants. There are two types, permanent (PNDM) and transient (TNDM). We describe our clinical experience in determining and comparing the genetic basis of diabetes in <b>children</b> with <b>onset</b> before 6 months versus those diagnosed between 6 and 12 months of age. Methods We reviewed medical records of children with diabetes diagnosed before 12 months of age. Genetic testing was performed in all cases. Results 12 patients were diagnosed with diabetes before 6 months of age (PNDM = 6; TNDM = 6), and 11 patients between 6 and 12 months (all with permanent diabetes). Among children with PNDM, we identified three different KCNJ 11 mutations in 5 patients, and one novel ABCC 8 mutation in a single patient. Among children with TNDM, we detected a KCNJ 11 and ABCC 8 mutation each in a single patient and methylation abnormalities at chromosome 6 q 24 in 4 patients. Among children with diabetes diagnosed between 6 and 12 months, 1 patient had an INS mutation and one patient was homozygous for an SLC 19 A 2 mutation which confirmed a diagnosis of thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia syndrome. Five of the patients with an ABCC 8 or KCNJ 11 mutation have successfully transferred from insulin to glibenclamide whist 1 child demonstrated a partial response to sulfonylurea treatment. Conclusions Investigating the underlying genetic basis of diabetes in <b>children</b> with <b>onset</b> before 1 year is useful for choosing the most efficient treatment, the basis of Personalized Medicine...|$|R
40|$|A <b>child</b> with {{systemic}} <b>onset</b> juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) {{who developed}} a bilateral femuropopliteal vein thrombosis after plaster immobilisation following a tibial fracture is described. When the thrombosis was diagnosed, antiphospholipid antibodies detected either as lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were found. This suggests that short term prophylatic antithrombotic treatment {{should be considered}} in antiphospholipid antibody positive JCA patients who require immobilisation after fractures of demineralised bones...|$|R
