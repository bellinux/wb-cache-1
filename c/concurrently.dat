5|$|At its {{greatest}} extent in the 1950s, the highway extended north from Webberville through Owosso and St. Charles to a junction with M-46 between Hemlock and Shields. M-47 turned east along M-46, running <b>concurrently</b> with that highway to Saginaw Township.

M-47 then ran separately to the state park before turning south and back into downtown Bay City, ending at the US23 business loop.|$|E
5|$|<b>Concurrently</b> {{with these}} processes, the {{activity}} of mitochondria may be reduced, which causes cells to rely on anaerobic metabolism to produce energy, increasing levels of the byproduct lactate.|$|E

5|$|M-21A was an {{alternate}} route for M-21 near Flint.
