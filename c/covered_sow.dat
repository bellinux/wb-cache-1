500|$|The Wars of Independence {{brought the}} first {{recorded}} instances of major mechanical artillery in Scotland. Edward I used {{a range of}} siege engines, which were carefully constructed, transported, deployed, dismantled and stored for reuse. This began with the siege of Caerlaverock Castle in 1300. Here, after the failure of an initial assault, a small rock-throwing engine was employed, while three large engines (probably trebuchet, using a counter-weight mechanism), were constructed. Their destruction of walls demoralised the garrison and forced a surrender. Edward's armies deployed several such engines, often named, with [...] "Warwolf", one of 17 used in the capture of Stirling Castle in 1304, being the best known. They also deployed lighter bolt-shooting balistas, belfry siege towers and on one occasion a <b>covered</b> <b>sow.</b> Some of these were supplied by Robert Earl of Carrick, the future Robert I, who was present on the English side. Scottish armies, with more limited resources and expertise tended to rely on assault, blockade and subterfuge as siege tactics. Robert I {{is known to have}} employed siege engines against the English, but often with little success, as at Carlisle in 1315 where his siege tower floundered in mud. The disparity in siege technology has been seen as resulting in a policy of castle destruction by Robert I.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis was the analysis of reproductive traits of sows. Data from the years 2009 ? 2011 were obtained in the company conducting production herds. The highest number of piglets born alive per one sow a year (26. 8) was reached in 2011. The highest number of weaned piglets (25. 6) per a sow was obtained in 2010. By shortening farrowing index in a monitored three-year period the number of births increased from 2. 29 to 2. 35. We found out that <b>sows</b> <b>covered</b> at older age gave birth to more piglets born alive. Concerning total number born piglets the difference between <b>sows</b> <b>covered</b> in more than 246 days and <b>sows</b> <b>covered</b> in the age interval of 225 ? 246 days was 0. 14 piglets, or, {{as the case may}} be, with <b>sows</b> <b>covered</b> in 203 ? 224 days the difference was 0. 18 piglets. <b>Sows</b> <b>covered</b> in less than 203 days gave birth only to 10. 67 total number born piglets.

40|$|When sown {{correctly}} at {{the right}} time, in the right position within the rotation, cover crops retain nutrients, conserve water, prevent soil erosion, improve soil fertility and quality, and suppress weeds. Growing cover crops is recognized as a climate-smart agricultural practice. Practical recommendation Where to position and when to time cover crops in the rotation? •	Grow cover crops in the 1 st and 2 nd year after ploughing of clover-grass to avoid nitrogen losses. •	Grow nitrogen fixing cover crops on soils with low fertility. •	<b>Sow</b> <b>cover</b> crops into or immediately after the main crop. In row crops, <b>sow</b> the <b>cover</b> crop {{in combination with the}} last hoeing. If the harvest of the main crop is rather early, <b>sow</b> the <b>cover</b> crop after harvest. •	The earlier a <b>cover</b> crop is <b>sown</b> in August, less nitrogen is lost. Each day of delay in <b>sowing</b> a cruciferous <b>cover</b> crop in August results in loss of about 2 kg of N per ha. •	Do not <b>sow</b> cruciferous <b>cover</b> crops into main crops shortly before the harvest, as weed competition may be too high for successful establishment of the cover crop. •	<b>Cover</b> crops <b>sown</b> in spring usually establish well and safely. For spring-sown cover crops use clover mix rather than ryegrass to satisfy nitrogen needs. •	On sandy soils with irrigation, undersow spring crops with wide row distances after the main crop has developed 1 - 2 nodes high to allow hoeing of the main crop in early stages. •	In winter crops, <b>sow</b> <b>cover</b> crops (clover mix rather than ryegrass) in spring as early as possible. •	Use cover crops after application of large amounts of solid manure, as it helps to retain the nitrogen. •	In lupines or broad beans, undersow a cover crop followed by a spring crop the next year. If a winter crop is chosen instead, perennial weeds might flourish. Cover crops and weed control •	Problems with creeping thistle, sow-thistle and coltsfoot do not rule out <b>cover</b> crops: <b>Sow</b> the <b>cover</b> crop immedia¬tely after an early harvest and ploughing. Repeat ploughing in spring before sowing a spring crop. •	To reduce couch-grass, mechanical treatment in autumn is more efficient than growing a cover crop...|$|R

40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is a major}} issue in organic farming systems. Although interseeding cover crops is one alternative to herbicides, cover crops often suppress not only weeds but also main crops. Therefore, using cover crops for weed control without adverse effects on main crop growth is important. To verify the effect of cover crops on competition between main crops, cover crops and weeds in a snowy-cold region, main crops soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in 2005 and maize (Zea mays L.) in 2006 were grown with cover crops winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), respectively. The <b>cover</b> crops were <b>sown</b> on three sowing dates: before main crop planting (Pre-MC), on the same date of main crop planting (Syn-MC) and after main crop planting (Post-MC). A plot without cover crops (Sole-MC) was used as a control. The dry weight (DW), vegetation cover ratio (VCR), vertical community structure and chlorophyll content were measured to estimate the competition between main crops, cover crops and weeds. Weed DW was suppressed significantly by <b>sowing</b> <b>cover</b> crops in both soybean and maize. This weed suppression was associated with the increase of VCR of main crops plus cover crops at the early growth stage of main crops. Soil seed banks of dominant weed also became lower by <b>sowing</b> <b>cover</b> crops, implying the importance of proper weed management for suppressing weeds successively. In addition, the <b>sowing</b> dates of <b>cover</b> crops had large effects on main crops DW especially in maize, i. e., it was significantly lower in Pre-MC and Syn-MC than in Post-MC. Although the cover crop height was markedly shorter than the main crop height, the chlorophyll content of the main crops was significantly lower when <b>cover</b> crops were <b>sown</b> earlier. These results suggest that the growth inhibition of main crops by cover crops was partly caused by competition for nutrients between main crops and cover crops, and this growth inhibition was alleviated when <b>cover</b> crops were <b>sown</b> after the establishment of main crops. Consequently, soybean yield was the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 29 %, 18 % and 7 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively, and maize yield was also the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 68 %, 100 % and 24 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively. It was concluded that weeds could be controlled effectively by <b>sowing</b> <b>cover</b> crops after planting main crops in organic farming systems in a snowy-cold region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn agrosystems, the {{increase}} in non-crop plant diversity by habitat management in or around arable fields contributes to improved Conservation Biological Control. During winter, plant flower are often used as monospecific ground cover {{and are expected to}} die before flowering as a result of recurrent frost events. Decreases in minimal temperature due to climate change offers new possibilities for plants used in such <b>sown</b> <b>cover</b> crops to mature and flowers. Changes in plant phenology thus constitute an important environmental change with expected consequences for ecosystem functioning, such as biological control. In Brittany, where winter agricultural landscape is dominated by a mosaic of cereal and <b>sown</b> <b>cover</b> crops, we assessed the consequences of mustard (Synapis alba) flowering cover crops (MFCC) on aphid parasitism and food web structure in plots adjoining cereal crops, in contrast to plots close to spontaneous non-crop plants (SNCP) of the same field. Overall, aphid parasitism rate at the field scale was strong (60 – 70 %), being 13 % higher adjacent to the MFCC than closer to SNCP. In addition, there was no change in food web structure between the two distinct zones, enabling us to hypothesize that MFCC mostly constituted an alimentary patch. The positive effect on parasitism rate was significant but weak, as floral nectar of mustard is known to be of poor quality for parasitoids. Results highlight the potential advantages of adapting practices in response to actual changes in agrosystems. Increase floral diversity in <b>sown</b> <b>cover</b> crops could constitute a complementary method in management programs, by providing more alternative food resources, alternative hosts, and climatic refuge to enhance the Conservation Biological Control of parasitoid populations...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the responses of yield, berry composition, and wine quality to various degrees of irrigation supply and different soil management practices in a vineyard. Data were collected during two years from ‘Aragonez’ grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. syn. ‘Tempranillo’). The experimental site was located in a private vineyard in the Baixo Alentejo, southern Portugal. The vineyard is grown on vertisols, with drip irrigation. In the 4 ha area under study, a cover crop in the interrow was sown in half the plots, with the permanent resident vegetation maintained in the other half. The irrigation treatments were: high water availability (200 mm annual irrigation supply); moderate water availability (150 mm annual irrigation supply); deficit irrigation (100 mm annual irrigation supply); ultra-deficit irrigation (50 mm annual irrigation supply); rainfed. The deficit and ultra-deficit irrigation treatments were conducted in accordance with the Regulate Deficit Irrigation (RDI) strategy. The vine's vegetative growth and yield responses influenced by irrigation in both years were: pruning weight, yield, and cluster weight. The quality responses were different in the two years of study: the grape composition parameters that showed significant differences were few and different each year; in wine composition, only in 2008 was the effect of irrigation on titratable acidity proven. Vegetative growth and yield were lower in the presence of the <b>sown</b> <b>cover</b> crop. The composition of grapes and wine was mostly affected by the surface cover in 2008, with the best performance for the phenolic compounds corresponding to plants growing on plots with permanent <b>sown</b> <b>cover</b> crop.

Introducing seeds significantly increased the number and <b>cover</b> of <b>sown</b> species persisting. Summer grazing by cattle maintained the number, but not <b>cover,</b> of <b>sown</b> species. Few sown species persisted when grazed by sheep, although those that did maintained high cover. Sorenson?s qualitative similarity index (based solely on species presence or absence data) revealed that pairs of sown and non-sown plots within a management treatment {{did not appear to}} converge during succession. However, using Sorenson?s quantitative similarity measure (based on both species occurrence and abundance) pairs of plots became increasingly similar after the first year. The sown plots became less similar to each other using the qualitative similarity measure, but this was less marked using the quantitative measure. In contrast, the non-sown plots became less similar to each other with the quantitative measure, but no changes were observed with the qualitative measure. The vegetation in the sown plots became more like that in the non-sown plots as sown species failed to persist. In contrast, the non-sown plots became more like the sown plots as the sown grasses Agrostis capillaris and Festuca rubra increased in abundance. The exception to this was the cattle-grazed sown plots, which retained more sown species, however, succession in this treatment also converged towards the non-sown plots because the non-sown species Trifolium repens and Ranunculus repens increased in abundance in this treatment.

40|$|Halting {{the loss}} of {{grassland}} biodiversity and restoring degraded ecosystems are high priority tasks in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Sowing low-diversity seed mixtures is widely used in grassland resto-ration because of its high predictability and fast, promising results. Generally, the sown perennial grass-es establish {{within a few years}} and form a dense sward, which effectively suppresses weeds. Unfortu-nately, these grasslands are often species-poor because the sown grasses hamper the colonisation of target grassland forbs. Our aim was to test a novel approach to increase the diversity of species-poor grasslands. We selected eight 8 -year-old grasslands restored by low-diversity seed sowing where we created 32 establishment gaps by breaking up the grass sward and sowing a high-diversity seed mixture (35 native species). Altogether, we established three grazed gaps (1 m × 1 m, 2 m × 2 m and 4 m × 4 m) and one fenced gap (4 m × 4 m) per site and monitored the presence and abundance of sown and non-sown species within a time frame of two years. We asked the following questions: (1) Which target species establish most successfully? (2) What is the effect of establishment gap size on the establish-ment success of target species and weeds? (3) What is the effect of management (grazed versus not managed) on the species composition of the establishment gaps? Our results showed that by creating establishment gaps and sowing diverse seed mixtures, we were able to overcome microsite and propa-gule limitation, successfully introducing target species into the species-poor grasslands. We found that all sown species established in the gaps, and the majority of the species maintained or even increased their first-year cover in the second year. Smaller gaps were characterised by lower <b>cover</b> of <b>sown</b> spe-cies and a quite stochastic development compared to the larger ones. Weed cover was moderate in the first year and decreased significantly in the second year, regardless of gap size. Therefore, in restoration practice, the use of larger establishment gaps is recommended. We found that the <b>cover</b> of <b>sown</b> species and weeds were similar in the grazed and unmanaged gaps during our study. However, management by extensive grazing might be crucial in the long-term because livestock can disperse target species propagules and create microsites. Our study shows that establishment gaps can serve as biodiversity hotspots. Further studies need to clarify to what extent they can improve the restoration success across the entire grassland...|$|R
40|$|Maturational {{changes during}} the {{follicular}} {{phase of the}} porcine oestrous cycle were investigated in spontaneously cycling gilts. The results revealed considerable variation in the morphological and biochemical development of dominant follicles in the early follicular phase. This asynchrony was emphasised by the marked differences in follicular fluid steroid concentrations and LH binding to granulose cells and theca tissue between follicles of identical size within the same ovary. The nature of this variation may have great significance on our present understanding of asynchronies in embryo development. On {{the basis of the}} variables assessed in this study, those follicles destined to ovulate or to become atretic were only readily distinguishable on Day 20 of the oestrous cycle, suggesting that the selection of the preovulatory population continues over a 4 day period from about Day 16 to Day 20 of the cycle and, furthermore, that the selection process involves some initial maturation even in those unselected follicles that ultimately join the atretic pool. Leading on from this study, the control of the initiation of follicular development in lactating primiparous sows was examined by assessing the relationships between ovarian activity and circulating hormone levels following manipulation of the suckling stimulus. In the first experiment, piglet suckling behaviour and follicular development were 'investigated following a reduction in litter size to five piglets (split-weaning), seven days before weaning at 21 days post-partum. Overall, morphological and biochemical follicular development were significantly advanced (p < 0. 001) in the treatment sows. The significantly (p < 0. 001) greater concentration of follicular fluid oestradiol in follicles recovered from the split-weaned sows suggested that the supply of androgen substrate was probably limiting production of this steroid in the control animals. It was proposed that the latter was due to inadequate gonadotrophin stimulation. The comparative ethological study revealed that the remaining split-weaned piglets 'multiple-suckled' quarters vacated by their heavier litter mates. Despite a constant suckling frequency, suckling intensity was reduced in the split-weaned litters as evidenced by a regression in mammary tissue growth in the dams. In a subsequent experiment, further manipulation of the suckling stimulus was achieved by physically restricting the number of mammary quarters available to the piglets. Canvas sheeting strapped around the anterior quarters of one group of <b>sows</b> (<b>cover)</b> limited the five piglets remaining after split-weaning to suckle only the posterior quarters. An investigation of circulating hormone levels, 12 hours before and 48 hours after the start of treatment, revealed that, compared to the split-weaned and control sows, LH levels were significantly (p < 0. 001) elevated in the <b>cover</b> <b>sows</b> with a concomitant significant (p < 0. 001) depression in circulating prolactin. Although split-weaning induced a similar endocrine response in several sows, this effect was short-lived and overall, levels of both hormones were similar in the split-weaned group to those recorded in the control sows. The concentration of oxytocin, released at suckling was unaffected by litter size or the intensity of mammary stimulation. Ovarian activity at weaning was significantly enhanced in the cover (p < 0. 001) and split-weaned (p < 0. 001) groups. Hence, it was concluded that the critical factor influencing hormone levels and follicular development in the lactating sow was the neural intensity of the suckling stimulus. The cumulative data of the lactation experiments suggest that in practice, serious consideration should be given to the use of litter size reduction as a means of effectively improving the performance of the primiparous sow and her litter during lactation...|$|R

After the harvesting of these crops, the same <b>cover</b> crops were <b>sown</b> again (March 2009) and followed by upland rice in the total area (November 2009). The experiment consisted of the combination of five cover crops (fallow, Panicum maximum, Brachiaria ruziziensis, B. brizantha and Pennisetum glaucum), four desiccation timings (30, 20, 10 and 0 days before rice sowing), and two antecedents of the summer crop (rice or soybean) under no-tillage system (NTS), plus two control treatments at conventional tillage system (CTS). Cover crops significantly affect rice grain yield and its components. There is a significant tendency to highest yield when cover crop desiccation is conducted farther from the rice sowing date (from 2, 577. 1 kg ha- 1 - desiccation at rice sowing to 3, 115. 30 kg ha- 1 - desiccation 30 days before rice sowing).

40|$|The {{influence}} of two sward treatments and soil cultivation on the composition, the structure, {{and the evolution}} of the biomass of vineyard weed communities was examined. The 3 -year study (2002 - 2004) was carried out in a sloping, non-irrigated vineyard, cv. ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’, in the Estremadura winegrowing region of Portugal. The experimental treatments were: soil tillage (control); permanent <b>sown</b> <b>cover</b> crop - Lolium perenne ‘Nui’, L. multiflorum ‘Bartíssimo’, Festuca ovina ‘Ridu’, F. rubra ssp. rubra ‘Echo’, Trifolium incarnatum. ‘Red’, T. repens ‘Huie’ and T. subterraneum ‘Claire’; and permanent resident vegetation. Total weed biomass in the spring did not reveal significant differences between treatments, but varied annually. The management practices – e. g. time and number of soil cultivations and inter-row mowing – were determinant in weed biomass evolution. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed significant treatment effects on community structure. Three years after the experiment was set up, in the soil tillage treatment weed composition was dominated by annual broad-leaved species, namely five Geraniaceae species, Medicago polymorpha and Sonchus oleraceus. The perennial broad-leaved species Oxalis pes-caprae was also a dominant species in soil tillage. In both sward treatments there was an increase in the perennial broad-leaved and grass species. Compared to soil tillage, in the resident vegetation treatment there was a significant increase in perennial species, such as Rumex crispus, Veronica anagallis-aquatica and Polypogon monspeliensis, and in the annuals Melilotus indica and Avena sterilis. The increase in these perennial species, which are considered to compete with vines, requires more frequent mowing in the summer. In the permanent <b>sown</b> <b>cover</b> crop treatment, L. perenne and T. repens displayed the ability to re-establish successfully, and their abundance decreased or suppressed most of the annual and perennial weed species...|$|R

The percentage cover of vascular plants {{was recorded in}} 4 permanent plots per field on 7 restored fields between 2006 and 2009. Ten aboveground biomass samples per field were also collected in June in each year. We addressed two questions: (i) How do seed sowing and annual mowing affect the species richness, biomass and cover of weeds? (ii) How fast does the <b>cover</b> of <b>sown</b> grasses develop after seed sowing? Weedy species were characteristic {{in the first year}} after sowing. In the second and third year their cover and species richness decreased. From the second year onwards the cover of perennial grasses increased. Spontaneously immigrating species characteristic to the reference grasslands were also detected with low cover scores. Short-lived weeds were suppressed as their cover and biomass significantly decreased during the study. The amount of litter and sown grass biomass increased progressively. However, perennial weed cover, especially the cover of Cirsium arvense increased substantially. Our results suggest that grassland vegetation can be recovered by sowing low diversity mixtures followed up by yearly mowing.

5000|$|In agriculture, a harrow (often {{called a}} set of harrows in a plurale tantum sense) is an {{implement}} for breaking up and smoothing out {{the surface of the}} soil. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by plowing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to <b>cover</b> seed after <b>sowing.</b> Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds).|$|R

40|$|It was {{assessed}} morphological parameters, yield and mineral contents of grains and panicles of new sorghum cultivars harvested in two grain vegetative stages and two year season. Those sorghum cultivars (CIAP MC- 04 - 12, CIAP 2 E- 95, CIAP 132 R- 05) were sown on experimental station at CIAP, Santa Clara, Cuba. The results were processed {{in the general}} lineal model (SPSS 21. 0) to assess the effects of sorghum culti -var, the grain vegetative stage and harvesting season on morphological variables (plant high, stalk diameter, knot per stalk, leaves per plant, peduncle length, panicle length), yield (forage, grain, panicles) and minerals contents (Ca, P, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn) in grains and panicles. The small panicles (P< 0, 001) in both harvesting season corresponded to CIAP 132 R- 05 and the biggest panicle (P< 0, 001) to CIAP MC- 04 - 12. The CIAP 2 E- 95 showed the higher forage production (DM/ha) in both harvesting season. In the grain vegetative stage of hard dough was evidenced the higher grains and panicles production in terms of dry matter/ha. It was concluded that CIAP MC- 04 - 12 showed the highest mineral concentration in their grains and that the three sorghum cultivars have Zn and Mn contents that not <b>cover</b> the <b>sow’s</b> requirements at gestation-lactation stages, hence the diets to those sows’ categories on base grains and panicles from those sorghum cultivars should be su-pplemented with Zn and M...|$|R
40|$|Exceeding normal seeding rates when {{establishing}} turf {{cover in}} worn areas of cool-season athletic fields {{is a common}} practice. Maximum sowing rates during traffic have not been determined for annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). Our objective {{was to determine the}} seeding rate ceiling and seeding schedule that maximizes turf <b>cover</b> when <b>sowing</b> annual ryegrass during traffic. Improved varieties of annual ryegrass are expanding its potential applications. One such variety, 2 ̆ 7 Panterra 2 ̆ 7 annual ryegrass was established at the Horticulture Research Farm in Ames, Iowa USA, on 4 Sept 2006 and 3 Sept 2007 into two separate study areas, bare soil and killed turf (existing biomass). Treatments consisted of eight seeding rates 25, 50, 75, 150, 225, 300, 450, and 750 g m- 2; and two seeding schedules (a single seeding vs. six multiple seeding events one week apart). Traffic consisted of 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 passes wk- 1 with a GA-SCW simulator with cleated rollers and a differential slip action. The seeding rate ceiling for ‘Panterra’ annual ryegrass was 450 g m- 2 or 18 times the normal seeding rate of 25 g m- 2. Sowing annual ryegrass in early Sept. produced more turf cover than dividing the same amount of total seed into multiple applications throughout the traffic season.

40|$|Grasslands {{recovered}} by sowing low diversity seed {{mixtures of}} local provenance are usually managed by mowing. Besides restoration success {{only a few}} studies have focused on the direct effects of post-restoration mowing on recovered grassland vegetation. In this study we followed vegetation changes in 13 successfully recovered grasslands in 5 9 5 -m-sized sites with continuous and ceased mowing at Hortoba´gy National Park, East- Hungary. We asked the following questions: (i) What are the effects of cessation of mowing on the vegetation structure and diversity of recovered grasslands? (ii) What are the effects of cessation of mowing on the abundance of sown grasses, target and undesirable species? (iii) Is yearly mowing an appropriate management tool for the maintenance of recovered grasslands? Our results showed that the cessation of mowing caused litter accumulation, while diversity, total vegetation cover and the <b>cover</b> of <b>sown</b> grasses decreased compared to the mown sites. The cover of undesirable perennial species was significantly higher in unmown sites than in mown ones. The species composition of mown sites remained more similar to near-natural grasslands than the unmown ones. Our results suggest that without regular post-restoration mowing the favourable status of recovered grasslands can rapidly decline due to litter accumulation and by the expansion of undesirable species, even in the short-run. We also stress that while yearly mowing is enough to maintain grasslands recovered by low-diversity seed sowing, it cannot be considered to be enough to recover target vegetation composition...|$|R
40|$|Water {{drainage}} and herbicide {{degradation and}} leaching were studied during {{four years in}} a continuous maize field managed with two tillage systems and two types of fallowperiods. The tillage systems consisted of either a conventional practice with mouldboard ploughing (28 cm-depth) or a conservation practice with superficial tillage (< 12 cm-depth). The management of the fallowperiod involved either a <b>cover</b> crop <b>sown</b> after maize or bare soil. Water drainage and isoxaflutole and its active diketonitrile metabolite leaching were determined under the four cropping systems using fibreglass wick lysimeters installed at 40 cm-depth. Isoxaflutole was rapidly degraded (half-lives < 2. 1 days) in soil for all cropping systems and years and its leaching was limited (< 1 % of applied dose). Diketonitrile was more mobile and was quantified each year in soil solution at 40 cm-depth. Cumulated losses of diketonitrile ranged from 1. 8 ± 0. 6 to 31. 5 ± 15. 1 % of applied dose according to the cropping system and year. Tillage system had no systematic effects on herbicide losses, but, considering the four years, significant lower losses were measured under conservation tillage. In a same way, using cover crops during the fallowperiod led to a decrease in herbicide losses compared to cropping systems where soil was left bare during the fallowperiod. The use of winter cover crop in continuous maize production showed promise to reduce diketonitrile losses by leaching...|$|R
40|$|Tillage affects soil {{physical}} properties, e. g., porosity, {{and leads}} to different amounts of mulch on the soil surface. Consequently, tillage {{is related to the}} soil temperature and moisture regime. Soil cover, temperature and moisture were measured under corn (Zea mays) in the tenth year of five tillage systems (NT = no-tillage; CP = chisel plow and single secondary disking; CT = primary and double secondary disking; CTb = CT with crop residues burned; and CTr = CT with crop residues removed). The tillage systems were combined with five nutrient sources (C = control; MF = mineral fertilizer; PL = poultry litter; CS = cattle slurry; and SS = swine slurry). Soil <b>cover</b> after <b>sowing</b> was greatest in NT (88 %), medium in CP (38 %) and lowest in CT treatments (< 10 %), but differences decreased after corn emergence. Soil temperature was related with soil cover, and significant differences among tillage were observed {{at the beginning of the}} growing season and at corn maturity. Differences in soil temperature and moisture in the surface layer of the tilled treatments were greater during the corn cycle than in untilled treatments, due to differences in intensity of soil mobilization and mulch remaining after soil management.

With a view to evaluating this effect, three non-fertilized <b>covers</b> were <b>sown</b> in May 1995. These covers were ploughed in at three different times: October 1995, December 1995 and March 1996. The ploughed-in nitrogen quantities did not vary greatly with destruction time. The greatest quantities were incorporated into red clover plots and the smallest quantities into perennial ryegrass plots. The C/N of perennial ryegrass was on average 24 and that of red clover 14. The soil cover by clover just before ploughing is {{significantly related to the}} ploughed-in nitrogen quantities. An Italian ryegrass was sown as the subsequent crop to the set-aside. Overall, during the whole year 1996 and 1996 - 1997, {{there was no difference between}} the yields for different destruction times except for the first cut of 1996. The highest production was obtained after red clover and the lowest after perennial ryegrass. The relationship between the nitrogen amount or C/N of the ploughed-in material and the nitrogen export for the annual harvest of Italian ryegrass showed highly significant correlations in 1996 as well as for the 2 -year harvest. Two multiple regressions were calculated in order to take into consideration the characteristics of the ploughed-in material of the set-aside.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{conservation}} agriculture on small scale farms of the Brazilian Cerrado, we hypothesized that planting a cover crop in relay with a commercial crop improves the efficiency of use of available natural resources, increasing biomass for use as fodder without reducing the grain yield of the main crop. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the performance of two intercropped systems in terms of total above-ground biomass production and maize (Zea mays) grain yield: pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and Brachiaria (Brachiaria ruziziensis) <b>sown</b> as <b>cover</b> crops in established maize under a no-tillage management. The <b>cover</b> crops were <b>sown</b> at two different dates and a comparison was made with the three crops sown as a sole crop at the early sowing date. The experiment was conducted during the 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009 growing seasons. Maize grain yield was not reduced by the presence of the relay cover crops in comparison with maize as the sole crop, even when the <b>cover</b> crop was <b>sown</b> soon after maize emergence. In contrast, the production of above-ground biomass by the cover crop was significantly lower when grown with maize than it was when grown as a sole crop. In the intercropped systems, when <b>sown</b> early, the <b>cover</b> crop produced higher total biomass than when sown late. Total above-ground biomass production of maize intercropped with a cover crop was much higher than that of any of the crops sown alone: the total biomass (average of the two growing seasons) produced by maize and pigeon pea was more than double that of maize grown alone. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of maize grain yield and biomass production was higher than one whatever the intercropped system used. It was particularly high when maize was intercropped with early sown pigeon pea; grain yield LER and biomass LER reaching, respectively, 1. 72 and 1. 73 in 2007 - 2008 and 2. 02 and 2. 03 in 2008 - 2009. These high LER values provide evidence for the complementary and the high efficiency of use of available resources by the intercropped plants and thus the advantage of such systems to produce both maize grain and cover crop forage under the conditions of our study.
