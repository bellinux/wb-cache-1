50|$|The plug-in hybrid comes {{equipped}} with two <b>charging</b> <b>sockets,</b> regular and quick charging CHAdeMO. When charging at home the driver can choose between a standard 3-pin plug socket or via a dedicated EV charging point. The vehicle {{comes with a}} 5 m charging cable for connection to a standard plug socket. From a standard plug, charging from empty to full charge takes about five hours. From a dedicated charging point at home or at a public charging point, it takes about 3.5 hours for a full charge. The DC rapid <b>charging</b> <b>socket</b> can be used at CHAdeMO charging stations. Rapid charging allows for an 80% charge in approximately 30 minutes.|$|R

50|$|While {{the first}} ACEA {{position}} paper (June 2010) has {{ruled out the}} Type 1 connector (based on the requirement of three-phase charging which is abundant in Europe and China but not in Japan and the USA) it has left open the question whether a Type 2 or Type 3 connector {{should be used for}} the uniform plug type in Europe. The rationale points to the fact that Mode 3 requires the socket to be dead when no vehicle is connected so {{that there can be no}} hazard that the shutter could protect from. The shutter protection of Type 3 connectors do only have advantages in Mode 2 allowing for a simpler charging station. On the other hand, a public charging station exposes the <b>charging</b> <b>socket</b> and plugs to a harsh environment where the shutter could easily have a malfunction which is not noticeable to the electric vehicle driver. Instead the ACEA expects that Type 2 Mode 3 connectors also to be used for home charging in the second phase after 2017 while still allowing Mode 2 charging with established plug types that are already available in home environments. The impact of some jurisdictions requiring shutters is still being debated.|$|R
5000|$|Hershner {{purchased}} a new Zero S ZF9 electric motorcycle from Hollywood Electrics on April 26, 2012. It had {{a range of}} up to 114 miles {{in the city and}} 63 miles with half city/half highway riding. [...] To increase this, Hershner modified his electric motorcycle to increase charging capacity and extend the driving range. He initially added an SAE J1772 <b>charging</b> <b>socket,</b> and three onboard 1 kW battery chargers to raise the total onboard charging to 4 kW. Using the public charging electric vehicle network, he tested the modifications first on a 500-mile trip to Miami, FL, and then a 1200-mile trip to the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN, which he said was the longest distance ridden on an electric motorcycle at that time. After these two long-distance trips, Hershner made additional modifications by adding two 2500 watt Elcon chargers to the Zero to max out the available power from a public charging station to charge at 7.2 kW from level 2 and 1.8 kW from level 1 for 9 kW combined charging, reducing the charge time to one hour to recharge his 9 kWh ZF9 pack.|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of publicly accessible charging stations {{in urban areas}} can foster the widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs). However, the introduction of public charging infrastructures will put an additional strain on the power grid due to the possible occurrence of peak demands. This study is a first attempt to quantitatively assess {{the potential benefits of}} introducing in a public charging infrastructure smart charging stations that are capable of modulating the current supplied to the EVs. Specifically, we assume that each charging station has limited power resources that must be shared among the EVs attached to its <b>charging</b> <b>sockets</b> according to a given scheduling strategy. To evaluate the performance of such system we utilise SUMO, an open-source and widely used vehicular traffic simulator, along with a highly realistic mobility trace for the metropolitan area of Luxembourg City. Simulation results indicate that the use of simple charging strategies that take advantage of the modulation capabilities of smart charging stations (e. g., fair-sharing or token-based scheduling approaches) can effectively mitigate the impact of EV charging demands on the power grid with a limited degradation of charging performance. However, our results also confirm that a significant investment on charging infrastructure might be necessary to guarantee a non-blocking charging service...|$|R

40|$|Alternative fuel {{vehicles}} (AFVs) {{face the}} lack of refuelling infrastructure as one obstacle to initial market diffusion. Also potential operators of refuelling stations await significant market shares before constructing a dense refuelling network. The resulting lock-in effect or chicken-egg-problem has been a field of research for many AFVs, but the co-diffusion of PEVs has rarely been analysed for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) up to now. 1 This might derive from the large availability of private <b>charging</b> options (simple <b>sockets</b> at home) or semi-public charging options (at work). The question is whether these charging options are sufficient to overcome the potential lock-in or how much additional public charging infrastructure is needed. Here, we develop an agent-based market diffusion model for PEVs and their charging infrastructure {{that is based on}} a large number of individual driving profiles for private and commercial car holders in Germany. Within the model, we determine the utility-maximising fuel type for each user based on cost, willingness-to-pay and the available charging infrastructure which derives from its driving behaviour and socio-demographic information. Infrastructure agents build public charging points when economically sensible. Our results show that there can be a market evolution in Germany without any public charging infrastructure facilities, since many vehicles are parked in garages or close to a house where power outlets are already available or easy to install. The second-best option for an infrastructure set-up is at work where the majority of vehicles is parked over a long time during the day, the installation is not costly and users profit more than from public facilities. Public charging facilities can increase PEV market shares, but they need to be subsidised for a long time...|$|R
