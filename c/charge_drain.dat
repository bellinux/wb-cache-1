40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, the {{deposition}} processes and formation of films in SF 6 ion-ion plasma, with {{positive and negative}} ion flows accelerated to the surface, are investigated. The PEGASES (acronym for Plasma Propulsion with Electronegative GASES) source is used as an ion-ion plasma source capable of generating almost ideal ion-ion plasma with negative ion to electron density ratio more than 2500. It is shown that film deposition in SF 6 ion-ion plasma is very sensitive to the polarity of the incoming ions. The effect is observed for Cu, W, and Pt materials. The films formed on Cu electrodes during negative and positive ion assisted deposition were analyzed. Scanning electron microscope analysis has shown that {{both positive and negative}} ion fluxes influence the copper surface and leads to film formation, but with different structures of the surface: the low-energy positive ion bombardment causes the formation of a nano-pored film transparent for ions, while the negative ion bombardment leads to a continuous smooth insulating film. The transversal size of the pores in the porous film varies in the range 50  500 &# 8201;nm, and further analysis of the film has shown that the film forms a diode together with the substrate preventing positive <b>charge</b> <b>drain,</b> and positive ions are neutralized by passing through the nano-pores. The film obtained with the negative ion bombardment has an insulating surface, but probably with a multi-layer structure: destroying the top surface layer allows to measure similar diode IV-characteristics as for the nano-pored film case. Basing on results, practical conclusions for the probes and electrodes cleaning in ion-ion SF 6 plasmas have been made. Different applications are proposed for the discovered features of the controlled deposition from ion-ion plasmas, from Li-sulphur rechargeable batteries manufacturing and nanofluidics issues to the applications for microelectronics, including low-k materials formation...|$|E

This generally {{occurs when the}} generation from PV resources substantially exceeds the load demand during high insolation period. This paper has investigated the solar PV impacts and developed a mitigation strategy by an effective use of distributed energy storage systems integrated with solar PV units in LV networks. The storage is used to consume surplus solar PV power locally during PV peak, and the stored energy is utilized in the evening for the peak-load support. A charging/discharging control strategy is developed {{taking into account the}} current state of charge (SoC) of the storage and the intended length of charging/discharging period to effectively utilize the available capacity of the storage. The proposed strategy can also mitigate the impact of sudden changes in PV output, due to unstable weather conditions, by putting the storage into a short-term discharge mode. The charging rate is adjusted dynamically to recover the <b>charge</b> <b>drained</b> during the short-term discharge to ensure that the level of SoC is as close to the desired SoC as possible. A comprehensive battery model is used to capture the realistic behavior of the distributed energy storage units in a distribution feeder.

Due to {{the high}} {{critical}} field in 4 H-SiC, the <b>drain</b> <b>charge</b> and switching loss densities in a SiC power device are approximately 10 X {{higher than that of}} a silicon device. However, for the same voltage and resistance ratings, the device area is much smaller for the 4 H-SiC device. Therefore, the total <b>drain</b> <b>charge</b> and switching losses are much lower for the 4 H-SiC power device. A 2. 3 kV, 13. 5 mΩ-cm 2 4 H-SiC power DMOSFET with a device area of 2. 1 mm x 2. 1 mm has been demonstrated. The device showed a stable avalanche at a drain bias of 2. 3 kV, and an on-current of 5 A with a VGS of 20 V and a VDS of 2. 6 V. Approximately an order of magnitude lower parasitic capacitance values, as compared to those of commercially available silicon power MOSFETs, were measured for the 4 H-SiC power DMOSFET.

The data coming from the analysis of the collected samples have been utilised to determine the distribution of the contaminants in the whole lagoon area by using a geostatistical method. The distribution of the following contaminants have been estimated: heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, As, Hg and Cu) and organic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, polychlorinated biphenyl, hydrocarbons, chlorinated pesticides) in confrontation to the Italian standard limits. Dedicated software, such as Surfer and ArcView, has been applied to produce thematic maps. In particular, Surfer has been utilised, to put in evidence the iso-concentration lines obtained after application of kriging. ArcView, software to implement a Geographic Information System, allowed lying out the contaminant distribution in the real geographic co-ordinates. A statistic analysis of data has been carried out in order to calculate average, variance, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value of the considered variables. The correlation between the contaminants has been computed and the analysis of the principal components of the variables has been carried out. The obtained maps show that the heavy metal pollution (characterised by huge concentrations especially of Cu, As, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb) is enhanced in the areas close to the industrial site of Porto Marghera. Furthermore, a relevant chromium contamination has been found in the sediments of the south part of the Venice lagoon, probably coming from to leather industries located in the surroundings the Brenta River now flowing in sea close to the mouth of the same lagoon.
