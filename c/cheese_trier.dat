50|$|Hypno-Disc's Mayhem {{qualifier}} {{battle was}} the Main Event {{of the second}} episode of the first series of Extreme, this battle was for a right {{to fight in the}} first annihilator of the series. The battle saw Hypno-Disc go up against Wheely Big Cheese and Ming 3. Hypno-Disc convincingly won the battle. It began the battle by tearing one of the wheels of Ming 3, before then putting several gashes into the sides and into the wheels of Wheely Big Cheese. Hypno-Disc dislodged one of Wheely Big Cheese's wheels, before then ripping a wheel clean off Ming 3, before then ripping off the other one. The Refbot then came in, counting out the immobilised Ming 3, and also counting out the limping Wheely Big Cheese, despite one wheel and the flipper still working. Hypno-Disc then held back, watching Ming 3 to be flipped by the arena floor flipper. Hypno-Disc moved in for one more slice at Ming 3, as Wheely Big <b>Cheese</b> <b>tried</b> to flip the wheel-less robot itself. Hypno-Disc then sat and witnessed the demise of Wheely Big Cheese and Ming 3, as both were sent down the pit by the house robots before cease was called. Despite this promising start to the series, Hypno-Disc struggled to make much of an impression in Extreme.|$|R

The processed cheese was made from Sudanese white cheese with different ripening time (15 days and 30 days) from milk with different fat present (2. 2 % and 4. 4 %). At time of processing the processed cheese was packed into two types of packaging (glass and plastic) and stored at 4 ° C for 3 months. The yield of the processed cheese and the Sudanese white cheese made out of it from 4. 4 fat % of milk after 15 and 30 days ripening were 2. 850 Kg and 1. 75 Kg and 2. 750 Kg and 1. 50 Kg respectively, while that made from 2. 2 fat % yielded 2. 0 Kg and 1. 25 Kg and 2. 0 Kg and 1. 2 Kg, respectively. On other hand as judged by the panelists the colour, taste, flavour, texture and saltiness of the processed cheese showed noticeable changes during storage period. The processed cheese made from Sudanese white cheese after 15 days ripening was more stable and acceptable. Also glass packaging was more acceptable compared to plastic packaging (70 % and 30 %, respectively). The overall acceptability showed that the processed cheese made from white Sudanese cheese after 15 days ripening from milk with 2. 2 fat % was the best of the <b>cheese</b> <b>tried</b> (4. 4 %). Hence, the present study concluded that the Sudanese white cheese could be further reprocessed to obtain the processed Sudanese cheese...|$|R

Pepe's restaurant began serving littleneck clams on the half shell at the bar. It {{was only a matter}} of time before he decided to put the clams on the pizza. The white clam pie is just crust, olive oil, oregano, grated cheese, chopped garlic, and fresh littleneck clams. The restaurant will serve the pizza with or without mozzarella <b>cheese,</b> but they <b>try</b> to discourage customers from ordering it with mozzarella because they feel that it makes the pizza too heavy and rich. They are also adamant on using freshly shucked clams as opposed to canned clams; if fresh clams are not available then they will not serve the white clam pie. Three men are employed by Pepe's just for shucking the clams on location. Since its invention, the white clam pie has become the signature pizza of pizzerias in New Haven.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{types of}} {{bacteria}} {{are used in}} the production of Emmental cheese: Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus, Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus helveticus or Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus), and Propionibacterium (Propionibacterium freudenreichii subspecies shermani). In a late stage of cheese production, the propionibacteria consume the lactic acid excreted by the other bacteria and release acetate, propionic acid, and carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide slowly forms the bubbles that develop the [...] "eyes". The acetate and propionic acid give Swiss its nutty and sweet flavor. A hypothesis proposed by Swiss researchers in 2015 notes that particulate matter may also {{play a role in the}} holes' development and that modern sanitation eliminated debris such as hay dust in the milk played a role in reduced hole size in Swiss cheeses, or even [...] "blind cheese". Historically, the holes were seen as a sign of imperfection and <b>cheese</b> makers originally <b>tried</b> to avoid them by pressing during production. In modern times, the holes have become an identifier of the cheese.|$|R

Patrick and Angie are then hired by the child's aunt Beatrice (Amy Madigan) to find Amanda. Using his connections in the Boston crime underground, Patrick discovers that Helene and her boyfriend [...] "Skinny Ray" [...] (Sean Malone) were drug mules for a local Haitian drug lord named Cheese (Edi Gathegi) and had recently stolen over $130,000 from him.

Patrick meets with <b>Cheese</b> and <b>tries</b> to negotiate the return of Cheese's stolen money for Amanda, but Cheese initially denies his involvement in the girl's disappearance. Police Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) later reads Patrick a telephone transcript of the drug lord calling into the station to set up an exchange for Amanda. The exchange at a nearby quarry in Quincy is botched after a gunfight breaks out, killing Cheese and his men. It is believed that Amanda fell in the quarry and drowned in the confusion; her doll is retrieved from the water and returned to Helene.

Tom dings to show Jerry that his guard can't hear his gong. Tom dings the gong close to Spike's ear. Spike wakens and shoots Tom into the air. Tom yells in fear and claws the roof he landed on. it doesn't work and he is teetering on the gutter's edge. Tom does a quick salute and falls. Then Tom takes a giant leap and lands on the roof. Tom, who was shaking in fear, heaves a sigh of relief. Jerry does everything he can to anger Tom, including making funny faces, showing him his (underwear-clad) buttocks, etc. It works and the chase is off again. They run down the street into a toy store where Jerry hides in a toy airplane. Jerry turns it on, pilots it, and scalps Tom's head and then shaves Tom's body with the propeller. As soon as Tom's fur comes back the chase starts again. He gets into a larger toy airplane, chases Jerry's plane in a dogfight-like chase and is shredding Jerry's plane with his propeller. Jerry gongs for Spike and Tom slams into Spike's chest, causing him (Tom) to disintegrate. Spike sweeps him up and throws him in a trash can. A panicked Tom calls an exterminator, Butch, along with three more cats to remove Spike from the household. They do nothing more than fire paintballs at Spike, who is thrown by the force into the swimming pool; Tom then breaks out laughing. However, Spike then grabs Tom and squashes him into a bowling ball which he uses to, literally, strike the cats out of the garden.|$|R
