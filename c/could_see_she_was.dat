500|$|When mature, Chicado V stood [...] tall. She was a brown mare, with a {{connected}} star, stripe, and snip on {{her face}} as her only markings, or identifying marks. [...] Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels, had the care of ChicadoV after she was born, and said of her that she [...] "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke." [...] When she stood in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said {{she looked like a}} rabbit, because [...] "she had big ears and that's all you <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E
500|$|Jewish {{characters}} {{try to pass}} {{themselves off}} as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back. [...] Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's—"you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> more Jewish", Vladek says. [...] Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise. [...] This literalization of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their Final Solution may risk reinforcing racist labels, but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters. [...] According to art historian Andrea Liss, this may paradoxically enable the reader {{to identify with the}} characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and {{it seemed as if}} she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You'll {{take great}} care of her, Joe, {{and bring her}} back safe,' the mother says, half {{laughing}} like; but I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a little anxious about lettin' her go alone, which had never happened before.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head away, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> crying.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} {{to drive her}} to a disadvantage if possible.|$|R
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's only in Bombay?" [...] Lady Meadowcroft cried, {{clutching}} {{at the last}} straw. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> registering a mental determination to go straight up-country the moment she landed.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he ain’t got no birthmarks," [...] ses the woman, {{speaking}} very slow—and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{afraid of}} making a mistake and losing me—"but he’s got tattoo marks. He’s got a mermaid tattooed on ’im." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the light}} of the hall lamp I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very pale.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him, and he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{inclined}} to believe him.|$|R
60|$|Grace's cheeks flushed, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{extremely}} gratified, {{though still}} tremblingly anxious.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{becoming}} serious again. Lights flashed {{upon her}} face. I {{felt a sudden}} wave of pity mingled with my love for her. After all, {{there were times when}} her anxiety must have been almost insupportable.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas {{received}} no shock of jealousy from her announcement. He knew her {{so well that}} he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{not in the least}} in love with Bellston. But he asked if Bellston were going to continue his explorations.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought there}} was {{something}} brave and pathetic in her getting up there before that churchful of people, to confess," [...] she said. [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> frightened to death--yet she was bound to clear her father. I loved her for it." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Maqueda {{began to}} speak, quietly enough, {{although}} I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quaking with passion.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth was {{bending over}} her dog, but even Tavernake, unobservant though he <b>was,</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> shaken.|$|R
60|$|She drew a {{long breath}} of relief. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{trembling}} all over. She sank into a chair.|$|R
60|$|As my head outpassed {{the edge}} of the top so that she came into view, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> looking at me with storm-bright eyes. And as I swung around the rigging lightly and joined her, I saw {{approval}} in her eyes that was quickly routed by petulance.|$|E
6000|$|She {{thrust out}} her hand. [...] "Good boy!" [...] He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> profoundly pleased. Indeed {{she could not}} at once resume. At last she said: [...] "I was going to say, Harold, that you can't earn a home trailin' around over these {{mountains}} year after year with a band of Indians." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stunningly civil! He {{began with}} Ave Ward, in the Lancers, {{and it was}} such fun--he chaffed her in his solemn way, about music I believe it was, and her harmonium. I could not quite hear, but I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in a {{tremendous}} taking, and she won't recover it all the evening.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Behold {{the goddess}} and do homage," [...] said Juanna with mock solemnity, {{although}} Leonard <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trembling with excitement.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke off}} {{abruptly}} in her speech. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> agitated, and I thought that I knew the cause.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} a short silence, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> crying under her veil. I laid my hand upon hers.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned in}} a startled way. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{wondering}} who I was, and what right I had there, but wasn't certain whether {{it might not be}} city etiquette for strangers to come and dump themselves down and start chatting. 'I've just been dancing with your husband,' I said, to ease things along.|$|E
60|$|She rose hastily {{from the}} table, and darted {{up to her}} own room. 'Lois,' she said, as she rose, in a curious voice of mingled regret and suspicion, 'I will {{talk to you about}} this later.' I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not quite {{satisfied}} in her own mind whether Harold Tillington and I had not arranged this coup together.|$|E
60|$|Daphne, meanwhile, was {{watching}} me closely. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> anxious to discover what impression her friend Mr. Holsworthy was making on me. Till then, I had no idea she was fond of anyone in particular; but the way her glance wandered from him to me and from me to Hilda showed clearly that she thought much of this gawky visitor.|$|E
60|$|Joan recoiled {{from him}} in panic, tearing herself from his arms and going {{backward}} several steps. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> really frightened.|$|R
60|$|This {{time she}} slept about two hours, {{and when she}} woke, even my unpractised eye <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> decidedly better than before.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} her quite coolly--I believe respectfully. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> Paul's mother. Yet I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be}} very rude to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, Wilfrid, {{your mother}} was anxious about you. She did not say anything, for she is a plucky woman, and not given to {{complaining}} or grumbling, still I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> anxious, so I arranged with these natives {{to be ready to}} start three hours before daybreak, so as to get here just as the sun was rising." ...|$|E
60|$|Her old {{distaste for}} the fashionable life of New York {{seemed to have}} {{vanished}} absolutely. As far as Kirk <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> always entertaining or being entertained. He was pitched head-long into a world where people talked incessantly of things which bored him and did things which seemed to him simply mad. And Ruth, whom he had thought he understood, revelled in it all.|$|E
60|$|She dug {{away at the}} red plush {{with the}} hatpin, picking out little bits and {{dropping}} them over the edge. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> bracing herself to put me wise to the whole trouble. There's a time comes when things aren't going right, and you've had all you can stand, when {{you have got to}} tell somebody about it, no matter who it is.|$|E
60|$|The smile deepened slightly. Little lines {{appeared}} {{at the sides of}} her eyes. So far from being annoyed, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> laughing.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> entirely changed now. She {{began to}} laugh. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> insanely happy. <b>She</b> {{got up and}} knelt down by Philip's side, taking his hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{into the}} house and I'll tell you all about it," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Basswood. Her face was drawn with anxiety, and all <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> suffering keenly.|$|R
