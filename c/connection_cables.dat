5000|$|Consumers {{initially}} {{were also}} slow to adopt Blu-ray {{due to the}} cost. By 2009, 85% of stores were selling Blu-ray Discs. A high-definition television and appropriate <b>connection</b> <b>cables</b> are also required {{to take advantage of}} Blu-ray disc. Some analysts suggest that the biggest obstacle to replacing DVD is due to its installed base; a large majority of consumers are satisfied with DVDs. The DVD succeeded because it offered a compelling alternative to VHS. In addition, the uniform media size let manufacturers make Blu-ray players and now defunct format HD DVD players backward-compatible, so they can play older DVDs. This stands in contrast to the change from vinyl to CD, and from tape to DVD, which involved a complete change in physical medium. [...] it is still commonplace for studios to issue major releases in [...] "combo pack" [...] format, including both a DVD and a Blu-ray disc (as well as, in many cases, a third disc with an authorized digital copy). Also, some multi-disc sets use Blu-ray for the main feature, but DVDs for supplementary features (examples of this include the Harry Potter [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] collections, the 2009 re-release of the 1967 The Prisoner TV series, and a 2007 collection related to Blade Runner). Another reason cited (July 2011) for the slower transition to Blu-ray from DVD is the necessity of and confusion over [...] "firmware updates" [...] and needing an internet connection to perform updates.|$|E

40|$|Laminatedglass is {{composed}} of two glass layers and a thin intermediate PVB layer, strongly influencing PVB's viscoelastic behaviour its dynamic response. While natural frequencies are relatively easily identified even with simplified FE models, damping ratios are not identified with such an ease. In order to determine to what extent external factors influence dampingidentification, different tests have been carried out. The external factors considered, apart from temperature, are accelerometers, <b>connection</b> <b>cables</b> {{and the effect of}} the glass layers. To analyse the influence of the accelerometers and their <b>connection</b> <b>cables</b> a laser measuring device was employed considering three possibilities: sample without instrumentation, sample with the accelerometers fixed and sample completely instrumented. When the sample is completely instrumented, accelerometer readings are also analysed. To take into consideration the effect of the glass layers, tests were realised both for laminatedglass and monolithic samples. This paper presents in depth data analysis of the different configurations and establishes criteria for data acquisition when testing laminatedglass...|$|E
