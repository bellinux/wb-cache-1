500|$|Macdonald faced a huge, but <b>critical</b> <b>task</b> in {{overseeing}} {{the expansion of}} the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). As historian Desmond Morton points out, the RCN was tiny when Canada entered the war in 1939. It consisted of six destroyers, five minesweepers and about 3,000 personnel in its regular forces and volunteer reserves. By the time Macdonald took office in 1940, the RCN had grown to 100 ships and more than 7,000 personnel, but as biographer Stephen Henderson notes, [...] "few of its ships and sailors were ready for service at sea". By the end of the war, the RCN had expanded by 50 times its original strength with about 400 fighting ships, almost 500 additional craft and about 96,000 men and women.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{in the domain of}} real-time scheduling theory has tackled the problem of scheduling mixed-criticality systems upon uniprocessor or multiprocessor platforms, with the main objective being to respect the timeliness of the most <b>critical</b> <b>tasks,</b> {{at the expense of the}} requirements of the less critical ones. In particular, the less <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> are carelessly discarded when the computation demand of (some of) the high <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> increases. This might nevertheless result in system failure, as these less <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> could be accessing data, the consistency of which should be preserved. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method to cautiously handle task suspension. Furthermore, it is usually assumed that the less <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> will never be re-enabled once discarded. In this paper, we also address this concern by proposing an approach to re-enable the less <b>critical</b> <b>tasks,</b> without jeopardizing the timeliness of the high critical ones. The suggested approaches apply to systems having two or more criticality levels...|$|R
40|$|Mixed-Criticality {{systems are}} arising {{due to the}} push from several major {{industries}} including avionics and automotive, where functionalities with different safety criticality levels are integrated into a modern com-puting platform to reduce size, weight and energy. The state-of-the-art {{research has focused on}} protecting <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> under the threat of task overrun, which is achieved by killing less <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> or degrading their services to free system resources to guarantee <b>critical</b> <b>tasks.</b> We take in this paper a different approach to protecting critial tasks by embracing rich features of modern computing platforms. In particular, we explore dynamic processor speedup to aid the scheduling of mixed-criticality sys-tems. We show that speedup in situation of overrun can not only help to protect the timeliness of <b>critical</b> <b>tasks,</b> but also to improve the degraded services for less <b>critical</b> <b>tasks.</b> Furthermore, we show that speedup is even more attractive as it can help the system to recover faster to normal op-eration. Thus, speedup could only be temporarily required and incur low cost. The proposed techniques are validated by both theoretical analysis and experimental results with an industrial flight management system and extensive simulations. ...|$|R

500|$|The {{first task}} of the {{division}} after its arrival {{in the western part}} of the NDH was to secure the Adriatic coastline along the Croatian Littoral between Rijeka and Karlobag (including all islands except Krk) and about [...] inland, and was a <b>critical</b> <b>task</b> due to German fears of an Anglo-American landing on the Adriatic coast. This operation included securing the crucial supply route between Karlovac and Senj. These areas had been largely dominated by the Partisans since the Italian capitulation in autumn 1943, in particular the port of Senj. The division was placed under the command of the XV Mountain Corps as part of the 2nd Panzer Army, and was initially headquartered in Karlovac. The division also took over responsibility for the security of the Zagreb-Karlovac railway line from the 1st Cossack Division. The division was engaged by the Partisans from the first night in their garrison areas. Before the division had completed its initial deployment, it was called upon to relieve the NDH garrison of Ogulin. This involved a drive southwest from Karlovac between 13 and 16 January 1944 initially led by the 847th Infantry Regiment. In the first engagements with Partisan units, the Croatian soldiers panicked and their German leaders were quickly wounded or killed. When the bodies of those that had been killed were recovered, they were often found stripped of equipment and some were even found naked. On 16 January, Ogulin was relieved, but the advance was continued south to Skradnik, and villages in that area were also secured.|$|E

Jack was a little surprised at being drawn aside by her ladyship, but was not to be flurried by such an honour: he was still more surprised by the nature of her communication, and by this first intelligence of an affair which had been passing under his eye. He listened, however, with his usual gravity, as her ladyship represented the advantages of the match, the good qualities of the girl, and the distress which she had lately suffered: at length his eye began to kindle, and his hand to play with the head of his cudgel. Lady Lillycraft saw that something in the narrative had gone wrong, and hastened to mollify his rising ire by reiterating the soft-hearted Phoebe's merit and fidelity, and her great unhappiness; when old Ready-Money suddenly interrupted her by exclaiming, that if Jack did not marry the wench, he'd break every bone in his body!

40|$|International audienceA common {{assumption}} for scheduling mixed-criticality {{systems is}} {{the degradation of}} less <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> when the system is in the emergency mode; which is entered when <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> overrun their expected WCET. In the meanwhile, common safety standards enforce strict safety requirements on all criticality levels. However, the impact of degrading less <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> on the overall system safety is not well understood. By introducing probabilistic distributions of task execution times, we show in this paper a first analysis of safety of mixed-criticality systems. Inspired by standards, we provide the probability-of-failure-per-hour (PFH) of a system when no overrun is detected. We also introduce and analyze the expected mode switching time, which describes how often emergency mode is entered. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between these two values. Finally, we discuss other possible safety measures that form a complete overview of a system's safety...|$|R

Today's DRAM controllers cannot adequately satisfy the often conflicting requirements of tightly bounded worst-case latency for <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> and high performance for non-critical real-time tasks. We propose a DRAM memory controller that meets these requirements by using bank-aware address mapping and DRAM command-level priority-based scheduling with preemption. Many standard DRAM controllers can be extended with our approach, incurring no performance penalty when <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> are not generating DRAM requests. Our approach is evaluated by replaying memory traces obtained from executing benchmarks on an ARM ISA-based processor with caches, which is simulated on the gem 5 architecture simulator.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a limited {{assessment of the}} conservatism of the Accident Sequence Evaluation Program (ASEP) human reliability analysis (HRA) procedure described in NUREG/CR- 4772. In particular, the, ASEP post-accident, post-diagnosis, nominal HRA procedure is assessed {{within the context of}} an individual`s performance of <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> on the simulator portion of requalification examinations administered to nuclear power plant operators. An assessment {{of the degree to which}} operator perforn:Lance during simulator examinations is an accurate reflection of operator performance during actual accident conditions was outside the scope of work for this project; therefore, no direct inference can be made from this report about such performance. The data for this study are derived from simulator examination reports from the NRC requalification examination cycle. A total of 4071 <b>critical</b> <b>tasks</b> were identified, of which 45 had been failed. The ASEP procedure was used to estimate human error probability (HEP) values for <b>critical</b> <b>tasks,</b> and the HEP results were compared with the failure rates observed in the examinations. The ASEP procedure was applied by PNL operator license examiners who supplemented the limited information in the examination reports with expert judgment based upon their extensive simulator examination experience.
