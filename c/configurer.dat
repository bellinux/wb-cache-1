40|$|We {{investigate}} formal {{analysis of}} {{two aspects of}} usability in a deployed interactive, configurable and context-aware system: an event-driven, sensor-based homecare activity monitor system. The system was not designed from formal requirements or specification: we model the system {{as it is in}} the context of an agile development process. Our aim was to determine if formal modelling and analysis can contribute to improving usability, and if so, which style of modelling is most suitable. The purpose of the analysis is to inform <b>configurers</b> about how to interact with the system, so the system is more usable for participants, and to guide future developments. We consider redundancies in configuration rules defined by carers and participants and the interaction modality of the output messages. Two approaches to modelling are considered: a deep embedding in which devices, sensors and rules are represented explicitly by data structures in the modelling language and non-determinism is employed to model all possible device and sensor states, and a shallow embedding in which the rules and device and sensor states are represented directly in propositional logic. The former requires a conventional machine and a model-checker for analysis, whereas the latter is implemented using a SAT solver directly on the activity monitor hardware. We draw conclusions about the role of formal models and reasoning in deployed systems and the need for clear semantics and ontologies for interaction modalities...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2008. Large scale {{production}} systems contain dynamically unequal distributing lead times and improvement rates. This {{has made it}} very problematic to statistically predict the ability of global partners to meet common deadlines simultaneously This system behavior {{can be attributed to the}} effects of asynchronous stochastic learning curves (ASLC) among all partners. There is no known prior research that provides an analytical model of the synchronized performance among partners in a large {{scale production}} system (LSPS) with these ASLC effects. In large scale production systems, integration of complicated products such as commercial airplanes brings unique concerns. These concerns involve the synchronized integration of customized products amongst processes of different lead times and stochastic learning curves. The source of the processes may include the system integrator, partners, suppliers, product designers, and custom feature <b>configurers.</b> Determining statistically predictable performance based on the roles and influence of all participants across different domains of production systems has been more of an art than a science. The fact that people improve efficiencies when doing the same task repeatedly was addressed as the learning curve effect, which was first studied in the aerospace industry in the 1930 s (Wright 1936). The larger the integrated production system, the more complicated it becomes to customize product design and deployment. Challenges in unstable individual production starting times have significant impacts on the productivity of the overall system. Other challenges in modeling this system are associated with the speed of process improvements, unequal lead times, and production rate fluctuations. Low volume and highly customized products of a large scale production system have not been previously analyzed through the ASLC approach combined with dynamic interactive discrete event simulation modeling. This dissertation addresses research and findings associated with customized products during the early product inception stages in large scale production system integration with the ASLC effects. Data is collected and partially derived through an ASLC model with statistical linear regression analyses and augmented with some discrete event simulation modeling. Deliverables of this research will provide a theoretical definition and practical model of the ASLC, and contributions in the following areas: ASLC impacts in large scale production system integration, discrete event simulation modeling methods in LSPS integration, and statistical presentation of ASLC in LSPS. This research will further enhance analyses of LSPS in the following: mass customization influences, production rate change impacts to all parties in the supply chain, logistics in transporting large size items globally, customized product design and production considerations, customer ordering points for fixed and for customized configurations, impacts of unexpected events and change orders in LSPS, postponement of engineering-to-order decision points, and production balance between existing learning curves and increasing planned/unplanned changes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to discuss the {{requirements}} for a general set of tests that would both test any <b>Configurer,</b> and allow different Configurers to be compared.

The obvious approach is to produce a test suite, in some chosen domain or domains, in some `neutral' representation language. Each <b>configurer</b> could then be tested by converting the test suite into the input format required by each system. The performance of different systems could then be compared. For this paper, the main issues that are raised by this idea are:. What should the test suite "test"?. What is it that one might want to compare? Hence the general question, what are the requirements for <b>configurer</b> tests? Not all configurers view configuring in the same way.

Such methods require a system <b>configurer</b> to have intimate knowledge about the modules and their interactions or the configuration will not behave as expected.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} metaphysics, {{there are}} two popular options for personal numerical identity (NID) over time: substance dualism and materialism. According to recent arguments by some Christian philosophers, both options conflict with the Christian doctrine of the bodily resurrection. Substance dualism trivializes the physical body for NID (when it {{has some kind of}} role in the bodily resurrection), and also is seen to conflict with modern neuroscience. But NID and mind cannot be continued solely by the material body, as versions of the Replacement Argument (from Richard Swinburne and Alvin Plantinga) show. There are good aspects to both options, especially with regard to the bodily resurrection. Is there a way to reconcile them? In this thesis I have two motivating big questions: 1) Can the conflict between Christian substance dualists and materialists be resolved by the hylomorphic Aristotelian model of human personhood proposed by Eleonore Stump, based on her interpretation of Thomas Aquinas (the Stump/Aquinas model) ? 2) Does the Stump/Aquinas model overcome metaphysical challenges against numerical identity and the bodily resurrection? I argue that the Stump/Aquinas model accommodates the conflict between Christian dualists and materialists by identifying human persons with both the physical body and the immaterial mind as a single-substance composite. If we think of the disembodied state as a `data backup 2 ̆ 7 and couple the medieval solutions with contemporary terminology, then the Stump/Aquinas model overcomes most of the metaphysical challenges it faces. But, the model ultimately requires a modification to answer the second big question. DNA (as genome or immaterial information) is the configured <b>configurer</b> and part of Aquinas 2 ̆ 7 s original concept of the soul as the Aristotelian form of the body. In light of its explanatory power and compatibility with Aquinas 2 ̆ 7 thought, I argue the Stump/Aquinas model, modified with DNA, is a strong contender for a robust philosophical-theological anthropology...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNew England has {{too long}} monopolized the {{attention}} of regionalist writers and critics alike, {{and we do not}} intend to take it once again as the major representative of a literary genre that flourished towards the close of the century, even as the region’s political impress upon the nation began to decline. If we go back to New England still in this paper, it is because as early as in the 1830 s and 1840 s, well before the word “regionalism” was coined, New England was preeminently “the site of contestation over the meaning of region. ” (Fetterley and Pryse) The region that New England also was, in addition to its claims as the beating heart of the nation, was indistinguishably an abstraction and a highly recognizable piece of land, two definitions in keeping with New England-born Noah Webster’s definitions and Ralph Waldo Emerson’s variations on the meaning of the term. What is at stake in this fluctuating semiosis is not a mere symptom of the “newness” of a national lexicon; it tells of the prequels of regionalism as an uneasy response to the process of abstraction that is the building of a nation-state. Both appealing and a priori forbidden, such abstraction, haunted Emerson’s usages of the word: throughout his essays, lectures and journals, New England is indeed repeatedly divested of its particulars and understood as a “region” of the mind, an abstraction in its own right that problematizes the relative positions and definitions of both region and nation. If Emerson’s New England seems to lack substance, color or flesh, we wish to contend that this process of “emptying out” enabled him in fact to conceive of the region as a possible universal. New England’s lack of particularity, its generality as it were, allowed it to encompass, yet neither contain, nor erase, the nation’s many regional characters. In that perspective, Emerson’s region was not so much a “part” of the nation envisaged as a “whole,” as a “line” that circumscribed and defined, thus reactivating the etymological meaning of the word; it became a moving frontier whose limitless expansion would adumbrate the nation’s manifest destiny. New England could therefore be thought as the “idea” of the nation, its “measure,” the “third abstract term” via which every other place could be translated into America, at least until this conflictive yet functional articulation between region and nation was shaken by the inescapable, inacceptable and untranslatable reality of the “particular institution” of slavery. With the “Fugitive Slave Act” (1850), the promise of the Union as abstraction was turned into an all-too concrete compromise, a despicable trade-off that forced Emerson to reconsider one more time New England’s place within the nationDans les jeunes années de la République, la Nouvelle-Angleterre voit grand. Elle se pense « idée » et « idéal » de l’Amérique, sa généralité abstraite. Depuis Boston, il est donc possible de voir l’Amérique, le tout de la nation – de le voir, sinon de le <b>configurer</b> comme un tout. Dans les écrits d’Emerson des années 1830 et 1840, la Nouvelle-Angleterre, de fait, est moins localité que concept, désignée de façon répétée comme une « région de l’esprit » (« a region of the mind »). Sous la plume du philosophe, la région, dont le sens n’est pas encore stabilisé dans les pages du Webster, devient un possible universel, lavé de toute particularité et prêt à devenir modèle de la nation, le troisième terme garantissant la traduction de tous les autres lieux en une possible « Amérique ». Pourtant, avec la ratification de la loi sur les esclaves fugitifs, il devient manifeste que la promesse d’une Union pensée comme abstraction recouvre de sombres transactions. La crise de l’abstraction des années 1850 exige d’Emerson de repenser la Nouvelle-Angleterre comme une région sauvée, cette fois, par sa particularité, pour un temps du moins. La critique récente a redéfini le régionalisme comme un discours de résistance à l’hégémonie d’un centre et, ce faisant, a déterritorialisé la région même. Cette déterritorialisation, pourtant, au sens propre et au sens deleuzien du terme, a pour effet pervers d’arracher le régionalisme à l’histoire et d’effacer la tension même qui gîte au cœur de ce qu’on appelle « région » : entre particularité et abstraction. En replongeant dans les essais et le journal d’Emerson des années 1830 jusqu’à la Reconstruction, cet article entend complexifier notre compréhension du terme « région » quand il est appliqué à la Nouvelle-Angleterre, et d’historiciser ses fluctuations sémantiques dans lesquelles sont inscrites les hésitations de la politique et de la construction nationales...|$|E
40|$|Cet article analyse le {{potentiel}} régulatoire de la responsabilité sociale dans un contexte de mondialisation économique à partir d’une distinction entre ses trois dimensions : les pratiques, le discours et le questionnement. Sans comprendre la dynamique des initiatives corporatives de responsabilité sociale, le discours sur la responsabilité sociale élude les questionnements auxquels l’entreprise doit aujourd’hui faire face pour conserver sa légitimité et assurer son ancrage dans la société. Mais plutôt que de déplorer leur manque d’effectivité, les auteurs avancent que les mesures volontaires de responsabilité sociale telles que les codes de conduite ou ce que certains appellent la {{soft law}} sont annonciatrices d’un cadre de responsabilité sociale en voie d’institutionnalisation à l’échelle mondiale. Sur la base d’une analyse de l’expérience européenne, ils montrent que deux cadres de responsabilité sociale au potentiel régulatoire très différent sont actuellement en concurrence, et concluent en jetant les bases du système régulatoire qui semble se <b>configurer</b> à l’échelle internationale. “Social responsibility” {{now seems to}} have become the panacea for the ills of globalization. Still marginal only a few decades ago, it now promises to fill the regulatory void created by the dismantling of Fordism {{and the formation of}} global economic and financial markets. In this article, we explore the anticipated regulatory impact of social responsibility in order to determine whether it could play a regulatory role for globalized business. One of the most recent definitions of social responsibility actually cites the voluntary initiatives now being taken by corporations, above and beyond their legal obligations. Since many stakeholders from the business world argue that regulatory measures are excessive, unwieldy and costly, voluntary initiatives are being viewed as alternatives to regulation or as regulatory alternatives inasmuch as they are founded on self-regulation. In contrast, this paper presents voluntary measures and regulations as {{two sides of the same}} coin : voluntary measures only emerge in anticipation of regulatory measures. This interweaving of voluntary measures with regulation is diametrically opposed to the discourse on social responsibility, which tends to reinforce the image of voluntary measures as an alternative to traditional regulation. Accordingly, the current discourse on social responsibility would have us believe that somewhere between the invisible hand of the market and the all-too-visible hand of the State, corporate management can lend a helping hand in the regulation of corporate activities. Thus, the discourse on social responsibility appears to have placed the greater good of society at the heart of corporate missions, without reforming corporate structures—structures still devoted to the private interests of their shareholders. So, what is this discourse on social responsibility really targeting ? It is hypothesized here that the social responsibility discourse is a corollary of the new role that business is playing in the society in an era of a globalized economy. By entering into discussions and partnering with states in their strategic manoeuvres to profit from globalization, global corporations have freed themselves of the now obsolete Fordist regulatory framework. However, they have also distanced themselves from the social role defined by Fordism and the social relevance of their production in a global era. In such a context, the call for social responsibility could redefine the social role of business in way that is consistent with the new conceptualization of development, contributing to its legitimacy in a post-industrial society. Discussion on social responsibility unfailingly brings us back to social transformations. It is not only a question of knowing how to make business socially responsible, but also of examining its role in the context of a new model of development, one that is different from the Fordist model. By approaching the discussion on social responsibility from these two vantage points, a variety of modes of regulation can be foreseen in the context of globalization. Given the dynamic created between adopting voluntary measures and establishing the regulatory possibilities mentioned earlier, we argue that international initiatives on corporate social responsibility are the harbingers of a worldwide normative regulatory framework that will be characterized by an unprecedented repositioning of the regulatory axes traditionally defined by the State, the market and civil society. Socio-economic movements are bringing pressure to bear on globalized corporations. In the absence of any world governing body, these initiatives are unlikely to be institutionalized, but such pressures could lead to an international regulatory framework supported by new regulatory agencies. Supposing that business anticipates the emergence of such a framework, we can view social responsibility initiatives as proactive and strategic behaviour on the part of leading edge businesses and conclude that official codes reflect an emerging compromise between international social movements and global corporations. We believe that codes of conduct that include substantive obligations are evidence of a compromise regarding the content of corporate social responsibility. They should be viewed as premises within this new international regulatory framework, rather than as regulatory instruments. Although still in its infancy, analysis in Europe has been instructive in predicting the configuration of this emerging regulatory framework. The European Commission clearly recognizes the existence of a new axis of regulation brought forth by civil society. However, it does not want to interfere with the definition of any substantive criteria, emphasizing instead the recognition of emerging social compromises. Ostensibly prudent, this analysis is nonetheless courageous since the Commission has explicitly cited reference norms, unlike some conceptualizations of social responsibility which tend to reject or invalidate the idea of a shared, worldwide commitment to universal values or norms. The stakeholders approach to corporate social responsibility excludes any debate on the substantive content of social responsibility by concentrating on the definition of a procedural framework. This perspective on social responsibility, which widens the gap between procedural and substantive norms, is already changing the international regulatory landscape. In years to come, it is entirely possible that two regulatory systems, with quite different regulatory impact, will be at loggerheads : one will be weak on substance and mainly oriented towards procedural imperatives, the other will be based in international law. Often presented as a univocal response to the regulation of globalized business, corporate social responsibility has generated a new arsenal of tools, signalling the arrival of an emerging international regulatory system. The emerging system is infinitely complex, relying on a variety of actors, mechanisms and normative foundations. It has been the basis of fundamental debates fired by antagonistic conceptions of society and the greater good. Combined with an analysis of other international initiatives now being taken, the tone and orientation of discussions across Europe give us a glimpse of how the emergent regulatory system will be configured : private and public, national and international, mandatory and voluntary, and brought forth by institutions whose legitimacy will be crucial.
