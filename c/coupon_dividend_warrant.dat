50|$|The time-weighted {{return is}} a measure of the {{historical}} performance of an investment portfolio which compensates for external flows. External flows are net movements of value which result from transfers of cash, securities or other instruments, into or out of the portfolio, with no simultaneous equal and opposite movement of value in the opposite direction, as in the case of a purchase or sale, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, <b>coupons</b> or <b>dividends.</b>|$|R

40|$|Convertible {{bonds are}} hybrid {{securities}} whose pricing {{relies on a}} set of complex inter-dependencies due to the sensitivity to interest rate risk, underlying (equity) risk, FX risk, and credit risk, and due to the convertible bond’s early exercise American feature. We present a two factor model of interest rate and equity risk that is implemented using the Crank-Nicholson technique on the discretized pricing equation with projective successive over-relaxation. This paper extends a methodology proposed in the literature (TF[98]) to deal with credit risk in a self- consistent way, and proposes a new methodology to deal with FX sensitive cross-currency convertibles. A technique for extracting the price of vanilla options struck on a synthetic asset, the foreign equity in domestic currency, is employed to obtain the implied volatility for these options. These implied volatilities are then used to obtain the local volatility for use in the numerical routine. The model is designed to deal with most of the usual contractual features such as <b>coupons,</b> <b>dividends,</b> continuous and/or Bermudan call and put clauses. We suggest that credit spread adjustments in the boundary conditions can be made, to account for the negative correlation between spreads and equity. Detailed description of the numerical methods and the discretization schemes, together with their accuracy, are provided. cross-currency convertibles, credit spread, interest rate risk, American feature, local volatility, Crank-Nicholson. ...|$|R
40|$|Mean-variance {{portfolio}} {{theory can}} apply to streams of payoffs such as dividends fol-lowing an initial investment. This description is useful when returns are not indepen-dent over time and investors have nonmarketed income. Investors hedge their outside income streams. Then, their optimal payoff is split between an indexed perpetuity— the risk-free payoff—and a long-run mean-variance efficient payoff. “Long-run ” mo-ments sum over {{time as well as}} states of nature. In equilibrium, long-run expected returns vary with long-run market betas and outside-income betas. State-variable hedges do not appear. THIS PAPER EXAMINES LONG-HORIZON portfolio problems and corresponding equi-libria. I allow asset return dynamics, dynamic trading, nonmarket wealth, such as wages, businesses, or real estate, and preference shocks. Markets are in-complete, so investors {{may not be able to}} completely hedge outside-income or state-variable shocks. I focus on the optimal stream of final payoffs, rather than on the composi-tion and dynamics of portfolio returns. I find that the stream of final payoffs obeys a classic mean-variance characterization and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) equilibrium pricing. Let x = {xt} denote a stream of payoffs, costing p(x) at time 0. (The Appendix summarizes all notation.) These payoffs can be <b>coupons,</b> <b>dividends,</b> or pay-outs from dynamic trading strategies. I define a “long-run expectation ” E ̃ that sums over time, weighted by a number β < 1, as well as over states of nature, weighted by probabilities, Ẽ(x) ≡ 1 − β β E t=...|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ This essay {{analyses}} the shareholder role {{in corporate}} governance {{in terms of}} Albert Hirschman's Exit, Voice, and Loyalty. The term 'exit' is embedded in a law & economics framework, while 'voice' relates to a corporate constitutional framework. The essay takes an eclectic approach and argues that, {{in order to understand}} the shareholder role in its full breadth and depth, the corporate law & economics framework can 'share the analytical stage' with a corporate constitutional framework. It is argued that Hirschman's concept of 'loyalty' is the connecting link between the corporate law & economics and corporate constitutional framework. Corporate law is perceived as a Janus head, as it is influenced by corporate law & economics as well as by corporate constitutional considerations. In the discussion on the shareholder role in public corporations, it is debated whether corporate law should facilitate loyalty-promoting instruments, such as loyalty <b>dividend</b> and loyalty <b>warrants.</b> In this essay, these instruments are analysed based on the eclectic approach. It is argued that loyalty <b>dividend</b> and <b>warrants</b> are law & economics instruments (i. e. financial incentives) based on corporate constitutional motives (i. e. promoting loyalty in order to change the exit/voice mix in favour of voice) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{modified}} Dietz {{method is}} a measure of the ex post (i.e. historical) performance of an investment portfolio in the presence of external flows. (External flows are movements of value such as transfers of cash, securities or other instruments in or out of the portfolio, with no equal simultaneous movement of value in the opposite direction, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, <b>coupons</b> or <b>dividends.)</b> To calculate the modified Dietz return, divide the gain or loss in value, net of external flows, by the average capital over the period of measurement. The result of the calculation is expressed as a percentage return over the holding period. The average capital weights individual cash flows by the amount of time from when those cash flows occur until the end of the period.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} optimal design of debt maturity, <b>coupon</b> payments, and <b>dividend</b> payout {{restrictions}} under asymmetric information. They show that, if the {{asymmetry of information}} is concentrated around long-term cash flows, firms finance with coupon-bearing long-term debt that partially restricts dividend payments. If the asymmetry of information is concentrated around near-term cash flows and there exists considerable refinancing risk, firms finance with coupon-bearing long-term debt that does not restrict dividend payments. Finally, if the asymmetry of information is uniformly distributed across dates, firms finance with short-term debt. Copyright 1995 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

50|$|Interest is the {{additional}} {{amount of money}} gained between {{the beginning and the}} end of a time period. Interest represents the time value of money, and can be thought of as rent that is required of a borrower in order to use money from a lender. For example, when an individual takes out a bank loan, they are charged interest. Alternatively, when an individual deposits money into a bank, their money earns interest. In this case, the bank is the borrower of the funds and is responsible for crediting interest to the account holder. Similarly, when an individual invests in a company (through corporate bonds, or through stock), the company is borrowing funds, and must pay interest to the individual (in the form of <b>coupon</b> payments, <b>dividends,</b> or stock price appreciation).The interest rate is the change, expressed as a percentage, in the amount of money during one compounding period. A compounding period is the length of time that must transpire before interest is credited, or added to the total. For example, interest that is compounded annually is credited once a year, and the compounding period is one year. Interest that is compounded quarterly is credited four times a year, and the compounding period is three months. A compounding period can be any length of time, but some common periods are annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, daily, and even continuously.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} why, {{in contrast}} to the predictions of finance theory, firms do not call convertible debt when the conversion price exceeds the call price. The empirical results suggest that the principal reason is because some firms enjoy an advantage of paying less in after-tax interest than they would pay in dividends were the bond converted. This cash flow incentive is the inverse of an investor's incentive to convert voluntarily if the converted dividends are greater than the bond's coupon. Because of taxation, however, the decisions by investors and firms are not symmetric, and there exist bonds which the firm may not call and an investor will not convert. The results also find that voluntary conversion is significantly related to both the conversion price and the differential between the <b>coupon</b> and the <b>dividends</b> on the converted stock.

40|$|Convertible {{bonds are}} {{securities}} {{that can be}} converted into common stock {{at the option of}} the investor. As corporate debt instruments they give the holder the right to forgo future principle and/or coupon payments to convert such payments into a predefined quantity of shares in a company's stock. Convertible bonds give the holder the ability to share in the price appreciation of a company's stock with the safety of a floor price set at the debt level. The presence of downside protection makes convertibles attractive to many private and institutional investors searching for yield-enhancing securities with a degree of defense against adverse volatility movements. As a hybrid security, convertibles are generally priced as a straight bond and a call option on the underlying equity. This chapter will discuss traditional and contemporary valuation techniques aligned to the accounting treatment of convertible bonds. It will also analyze the optimal call and conversion policy of issuers and investors respectively, with reference to recovery rate, hazard rate, <b>coupon</b> payments and <b>dividend</b> yield of the security. Our analysis will then show that the likelihood of convertible debt issues increases when the costs of either straight debt or common stock issues are high, and mirrors the 'backdoor equity hypothesis' which predicts that convertible bonds are a substitute for common equity and that this substitution is most likely to occur in firms facing significant information asymmetries and high financial distress costs. Using stock liquidity analysis, we will see that the probability of exercise of convertible bonds issued against a firm's stock directly affects the liquidity of the stock itself, while controlling for firm size, book to market equity value and firm beta. The effects of conversion probability on stock liquidity are less pronounced for smaller firms, which helps explain time series variations in the liquidity premiums for smaller firms over time.
