5|$|End of Watch {{was filmed}} on {{location}} in South <b>Central</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> primarily {{in the area of}} the LAPD's Newton Division, one of the most violent and gang-affiliated areas of the city.

25|$|In 1886, the {{department}} hired {{its first two}} black officers, Robert William Stewart and Roy Green.. The LAPD {{was one of the}} first two police departments in the country to hire an African-American woman officer, Georgia Ann Robinson in 1919.

During the 1965 Watts riots, only 5 of the 205 police assigned to South <b>Central</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> were black, despite the fact that it was the largest black community in Los Angeles.

When Bradley was elected mayor in 1972, only 5% of LAPD officers were black and there was only one black captain in the department, Homer Broome.
