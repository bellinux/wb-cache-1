25|$|Childers {{returned}} to London {{with his wife}} and resumed his position in the House of Commons. His reputation as an influential author gave the couple access to the political establishment, which Molly relished, {{but at the same time}} she set to work to rid Childers of his already faltering imperialism. In her turn Molly developed a strong admiration for Britain, its institutions and, as she then saw it, its willingness to go to war in the interests of smaller nations against the great. Over the next seven years they lived comfortably in their rented flat in Chelsea, supported by Childers's salary—he had received promotion to the position of parliamentary <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Petitions</b> in 1903—his continuing writings and, not least, generous benefactions from Dr Osgood.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1910 Childers {{resigned}} his post as <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Petitions</b> to leave himself free to join the Liberal Party, with its declared commitment to Home Rule, and in May 1912 he secured for himself the candidature {{in one of the}} parliamentary seats in the naval town of Devonport. As the well-known writer of The Riddle of the Sands, with its implied support for an expanded Royal Navy, Childers could hardly fail to win the vote whenever the next election was called. The Liberal Party relied on Irish Home Rule MPs for its Commons majority. But in response to threats of civil war from the Ulster Unionists, the party began to entertain the idea of removing some or all of Ulster from a self-governed Ireland. Childers abandoned his candidacy and left the party.|$|E

25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> the court. <b>Petitions</b> are assigned to a law clerk or staff attorney for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. If the law clerk, staff attorney, or brief in opposition identify any procedural defects in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may dismiss it with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner has an opportunity to correct the procedural error and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on the docket for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|R

50|$|Parliament {{originally}} did {{not hear}} appeals as a court might; rather, it heard petitions for the judgments of lower courts to be reversed. The House of Commons ceased considering such petitions in 1399, leaving the House of Lords, effectively, as the nation's court of last resort. The Lords' jurisdiction later began to decline; only five cases were heard between 1514 and 1589, and no cases between 1589 and 1621. In 1621, the House of Lords resumed its judicial role when King James I sent the <b>petition</b> <b>of</b> Edward Ewer, a persistent litigant, to be considered by the House <b>of</b> Lords. <b>Petitions</b> for the House of Lords to review the decisions of lower courts began to increase once again. After Ewer, 13 further cases would be heard in 1621. The House of Lords appointed a Committee for Petitions. At first, the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the Parliaments would bring petitions to the House, and the whole House could decide if they {{should or should not}} be referred to the Committee. As the number <b>of</b> <b>petitions</b> increased, the Committee gained the power to reject petitions itself.|$|R

5000|$|In 1858 Campbell was {{designated}} as the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the General Assembly and on 22 December 1868, {{on the recommendation of}} Premier Edward Stafford, he {{was designated}} as the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Parliaments. The title <b>of</b> <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Parliaments is traditionally conferred on the <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> the upper house in a Westminster parliamentary system but Stafford advised the Governor to appoint Campbell to this office as he was far more experienced than the <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council refused to recognise Campbell as anything more than acting in the role <b>of</b> the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Parliaments, stating that he was not correctly appointed (the Council was not consulted and the appointment was not Gazetted) and that his duties were never defined. A compromise resolution to this impasse was eventually reached with the passing <b>of</b> The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Parliaments Act, 1872, which provided that Campbell would continue to be the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Parliaments {{for as long as he}} held the office <b>of</b> <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the House of Representatives; after which subsequent appointments would be made [...] "in accordance with the law and usage of the Imperial Parliament". Accordingly, Leonard Stowe, who was appointed <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the Legislative Council in 1865, was appointed as the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Parliaments when Campbell retired in 1889.|$|R
