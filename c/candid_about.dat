[...] The novelist and critic A. N. Wilson judged it to be a truthful record of an unusual kind:There is nothing in it which can be contradicted by other biographical evidence…Yet there is something extremely conscious about it. [...] It is far more than a work of art. [...] Scott was not making himself out to be someone that he was not; rather, the Journal is his record of how he made himself conform to the heroic standards of his own fictions…Scott was intent on facing [...] with the bravado of Burley and the stubbornness of Jeanie Deans.|$|E
