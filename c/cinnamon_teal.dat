50|$|Evidence for {{adaptation}} is best investigated {{among the}} Andean birds. The water fowls and <b>cinnamon</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas cyanoptera) {{are found to}} have undergone significant molecular modifications. It is now known that the α-haemoglobin subunit gene is highly structured between elevations among <b>cinnamon</b> <b>teal</b> populations, which involves almost entirely a single non-synonymous amino acid substitution at position 9 of the protein, with asparagine present almost exclusively within the low-elevation species, and serine in the high-elevation species. This implies important functional consequences for oxygen affinity. In addition, there is strong divergence in body size in the Andes and adjacent lowlands. These changes have shaped distinct morphological and genetic divergence within South American <b>cinnamon</b> <b>teal</b> populations.|$|E
