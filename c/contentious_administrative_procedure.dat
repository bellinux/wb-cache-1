50|$|The {{opposition}} procedure before the European Patent Office (EPO) is a post-grant, <b>contentious,</b> inter partes, <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> intended to allow any European patent to be centrally opposed. European patents {{granted by the}} EPO under the European Patent Convention (EPC) may be opposed by any person from the public (no commercial or other interest whatsoever need be shown). This happens often when some prior art was not found during the grant procedure, but was only known by third parties.|$|R

The purpose of this thesis is to place the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code and the Old <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> side by side to compare them with one another and to attempt to evaluate the contribution of the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code to the Czech legal system.

We chose a topic which other authors have researched, but we emphasized based on analysis and comparison, certain peculiarities of the legal regime applicable to the legal acts assimilated to the administrative acts, as they are outlined in the <b>Contentious</b> <b>administrative</b> law. Given that the legal documents assimilated to the administrative acts have a greater share in the public administration activity, it requires knowledge of its legal effects, in order to see whether there are fulfilled the above-mentioned law conditions or not, in order to use the action in the <b>administrative</b> <b>contentious,</b> when appropriate.

40|$|Despite {{the quality}} of legal norms in {{existing}} Law on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure,</b> for the realization of citizens' rights in the Republic of Serbia in accordance to international legal standards, a significant problem are specific <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures.</b> In this type of procedures {{in recent years have}} been made many variations from the basic rules of general <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure,</b> which can not be classified as requirements of the specific nature of proceeding in certain administrative matters. Therefore it is particularly important that it in new Law on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> (which will begin to fully implement from 1 June 2017) is provided no more only an obligation of compliance of rules in specific <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> with the basic principles of <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure,</b> but now also a prohibition of reducing the level of protection of rights and legal interests of the parties guaranteed by the law on <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure,</b> as well as a legal obligation to harmonize all special procedures with the new law, no later than 1 June 2018. Based on mentioned solutions in the new Law on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedures,</b> to citizens of the Republic of Serbia should be allowed to fully realize their rights and legal interests in administrative proceedings, in accordance to the most important international legal standards.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} that the Romanian Constitution {{mentions}} the "state of law" and "constitutional democracy", concomitantly specifying the essential values- human dignity, citizens' rights and freedoms, the free development of human personality, justice and political pluralism- defended by the domestic legal order, it seems of a real practical interest to notice the concrete means established {{in order to protect}} the above mentioned values. As it has been mentioned before, the <b>contentious</b> <b>administrative</b> represents one of the most efficient ways under which the values constitutionally affirmed are guaranteed and defended. The <b>contentious</b> <b>administrative</b> basically answers the old question: "Quis custodiet custodes?", question that comprises one of the most difficult obstacles against the state of law actualization: to find the most efficient procedural ways for the state bodies able to use, directly or indirectly, the coercion force in order to make the citizens observe the laws, to be in their turn under the situation to observe the same laws. As the <b>contentious</b> <b>administrative</b> represents the courts of law activity meant to settle the conflicts whereas at least one of the parties is a public authority, we will try, while evoking procedural aspects, procedural means available for someone prejudiced by a public authority, to stress the weight of the procedural rules in guarantying and defending effectively the citizens' rights and legitimate interests...|$|R

In conformity with the organic law no. 554 / 2004, the <b>contentious</b> <b>administrative</b> matters has the following components: " "the activity of courts' legal solving of litigations batween different parties, where at least one such party is a public authority, and the conflicts appeared at the issuing or concluding of an administrative act, either without a sentence - due to no not abiding by the lawful term - or with the unjustified refusal to solve a claim referring to a legitimate right or interest"...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2014, the Republic of Serbia has become a candidate {{for membership in the}} European Union. As such, it {{is in the process of}} harmonizing its legal system with the EU legislation. On the one hand, Serbia will have to make some new regulations which are currently missing. On the other hand, along with the adoption of the new (missing) regulations, Serbia will have to amend or supplement some of the existing regulations, in order to make them comply with the EU law. In this context, we may observe the need to harmonize the Serbian <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> with the EU legislation. The key issue is to which extent the process of harmonizing the Serbian regulations with the EU law extends to the basic <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> regulations governing the work of public administration and public services in deciding on particular cases. Does the General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act diverge from the EU law and does it have to be harmonized with the EU law? EU member states are not obliged to harmonize their <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> legislations with EU regulations as the applicable principle in this respect is the principle of procedural autonomy of each Member State. Moreover, there are member states that do not have a codified <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure.</b> On the other hand, there are significant differences among the EU member states which have codified their <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures.</b> Some countries have regulated only general procedural issues, while other countries have enacted detailed <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> acts. Serbia has had the General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act since 1930 (as a member of the former Yugoslavia) and this legislative act falls into the category of high-quality procedural laws. All the principles established by the European Court of Justice are already built into the current Serbian General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act. Therefore, Serbia has a legislative act which is by no means inferior to those enacted in many EU member states; moreover, the quality of some <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> solutions may be said to be superior to the legal solutions enacted in many EU member states. Therefore, we may conclude that the existing General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act of the Republic of Serbia is not an obstacle on the road to the European Union...|$|R
