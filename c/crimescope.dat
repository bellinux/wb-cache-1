Often performed using either non-specific techniques such as <b>CrimeScope</b> or/and acid phosphatase specific methods such as naphtyl, these detection requirements were {{in need of a}} new technique and procedure: rapid, simple, specific and non-toxic. We are here presenting the results of a comparative study between mini- <b>CrimeScope</b> and the newly launch product Sperm Trackerâ„¢. Evidence are given with regards to the specificity, sensitivity and ease of use of the new product. Genetic analysis were also performed right after localization and demonstrated the full compatibility of the method with the subsequent DNA analysis...|$|E
