40|$|Introduction. The {{value of}} <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> use in medical {{education}} {{is an area}} of considerable interest, with preliminary investigations showing that the majority of medical trainees feel that <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> added value to the curriculum. This study investigated potential differences in <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> use between medical students and resident physicians. Materials & Methods. Data collection for this survey was accomplished with an anonymous online questionnaire shared with the medical students and residents at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIU-SOM) in July and August of 2012. Results. There were 76 medical student responses (26 % response rate) and 66 resident/fellow responses to this survey (21 % response rate). Residents/fellows were more likely to use <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> several times daily than medical students (32 % vs. 20 %, p = 0. 035). The most common reported uses were for accessing medical reference applications (46 %), e-Books (45 %), and board study (32 %). Residents were more likely than students to use a <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> to access an electronic medical record (41 % vs. 21 %, p = 0. 010), review radiology images (27 % vs. 12 %, p = 0. 019), and enter patient care orders (26 % vs. 3 %, p < 0. 001). Discussion. This study shows a high prevalence and frequency of <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> use among physicians in training at this academic medical center. Most residents and students use <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> to access medical references, e-Books, and to study for board exams. Residents were more likely to use <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> to complete clinical tasks. Conclusions. <b>Tablet</b> <b>computer</b> use among medical students and resident physicians was common in this survey. All learners used <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> for point of care references and board study. Resident physicians were more likely to use <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> to access the EMR, enter patient care orders, and review radiology studies. This difference is likely due to the differing educational and professional demands placed on resident physicians. Further study is needed better understand how <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> and other mobile devices may assist in medical education and patient care...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the use of <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> in a Swedish language, classroom. This study aims to {{investigate}} student and teacher attitudes when using <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> for story writing. One fifth grade classroom was observed on three occasions and a total of six students and three teachers were subsequently interviewed. This study addresses the following questions: How are <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> used for writing stories in a Swedish classroom?   What opportunities and obstacles do teachers experience when using the <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> when it comes to writing stories? Which method was preferred by the students? Writing stories on <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> or writing by hand? This qualitative study was based on observations and interviews.  Analysis of observations and interviews show that the <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> appear to help the students with language, organisation and structure in the writing of stories. However, teachers still need to incorporate both writing by hand and using the <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> to ensure competence for real-life situations which still use a mixture of both skills.  The results also showed that <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> are a useful tool for communication when students help each other in their writing. Classroom observations suggest that tablet computers can act as a mediator tool in the Swedish elementary school classroom primarily as it makes the writing process easier for the students. Analysis of teacher interviews suggest that teachers prefer to have students use tablets as it makes the student’s texts clearer, facilitating assessment...|$|R

40|$|Context: Older adults’ {{everyday}} usages of <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> in a {{home environment}} are currently left out from today’s research. Current researches include many specialized focuses regarding <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> interfaces but a holistic view of how older adults experience usage of <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> in their everyday life is still {{to a large extent}} missing. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} apply a use- and user-centred action research approach to explore how older adults experience the usage of <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> in their everyday life. Older adults are observed using <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> in their home environment in order to explore experienced issues and identify possible improvements for the older adults’ interaction and use of <b>tablet</b> <b>computers.</b> Methods: This study is a qualitative explorative case study using a grounded theory approach. The study consists a two week observation period beginning with an introduction and tutorial to <b>tablet</b> <b>computers.</b> Semi-structured interviews were conducted directly before and after as well as a long term follow up interview, few months after the observation period. The research body with the first two interviews and observation period was conducted using grounded theory iteration, allowing for analysis between each participant. The study involved 10 older adults and took place in the older adults’ natural everyday home environment and targeted older adults born 1960 or earlier. Results: The study used different ways to introduce <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> to the older adults, individually adjusted to their knowledge about information communication technology in general and <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> in particular as well as for them familiar subjects. Associations using their familiar subjects were used to help the older adults to remember the functionality of different icons. Some of the interaction issues encountered could be solved on the spot using accessibility options and accessories. The participants’ interest in <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> increased during the main body of the study, but later decreased again between the last two interviews. Conclusions: Many interaction issues were identified during the study where the main issues were related to accuracy, typing, gesture and terminology. Suggestions are made concerning how to solve some of the issues encountered, like a dynamic grid for icons and text on the <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> home screen and an ergonomic version of a touchscreen pen. Although there are interaction issues that are directly related to the interface, there are other important aspects too that affect the experienced interaction issues when interacting with and using a <b>tablet</b> <b>computer</b> in one’s everyday life home environment. Influencers affecting how older adults feel about <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> played a very important role. Having the observer functioning as a technical mentor, during the two week observation period, played a bigger role than expected, but the short time the older adults had with the mentor was not enough to keep them interested on a long term basis...|$|R
