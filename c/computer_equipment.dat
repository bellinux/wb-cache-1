25|$|In {{many ways}} the fair symbolized a grand {{consumer}} show covering many products produced in America at the time for transportation, living, and consumer electronic needs {{in a way that}} would never be repeated at future world's fairs in North America. Many major American manufacturing companies from pen manufacturers, to chemical companies, to computers, to automobiles had a major presence. This fair gave many attendees their first interaction with <b>computer</b> <b>equipment.</b> Corporations demonstrated the use of mainframe computers, computer terminals with keyboards and CRT displays, teletype machines, punch cards, and telephone modems in an era when <b>computer</b> <b>equipment</b> was kept in back offices away from the public, decades before the Internet and home computers were at everyone's disposal.|$|E

30|$|The {{nature of}} modern {{biomedical}} research incurs high costs. From expensive specialized equipment and consumables, {{there are other}} considerations involving rental, safety, and specialized infrastructure (e.g. for tissue culture). On top of the <b>equipment,</b> <b>computers</b> are required to control these devices and facilitate data analysis (e.g. flow cytometry). This necessary pairing of <b>computer</b> and <b>equipment</b> further constrains the researcher to a specific location within the lab. In this aspect, mobile apps and peripheral devices that displace <b>computers</b> or other <b>equipment</b> can aid to mobilize research processes, contributing to significant savings {{not only in terms}} of equipment costs, but also reducing the rental space and equipment setup and delivery costs.|$|R
