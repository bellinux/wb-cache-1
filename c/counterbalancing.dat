5|$|Aside {{from its}} vertebrae, Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton. Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail <b>counterbalancing</b> {{the head and}} body, {{maintaining}} its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was {{much smaller than the}} rest and did not make contact with the ground.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by <b>counterbalancing</b> the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no <b>counterbalancing</b> effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E

40|$|The paper shows {{standard}} circuits {{with load}} reactive and non load reactive <b>counterbalance</b> valves. A Matlab simulation {{based on a}} linear model for the circuit with load reactive <b>counterbalance</b> valves shows what parameters have a significant influence on {{the stability of the}} system. The most important parameters of the <b>counterbalance</b> valve that influence the stability are pilot gain and relief gain. The factors describe how pilot pressure and load pressure affect the flow across the <b>counterbalance</b> valve. A new <b>counterbalance</b> valve (patent pending) has the pilot gain and relief gain required for stability only in operating ranges that require the parameters for stability. When the load is not moving or the <b>counterbalance</b> valve is not required for positive (non overrunning) loads, the new valve has a higher pilot ratio, which means that the valve opens further at lower inlet pressures. The new <b>counterbalance</b> valves saves about 30 % power compared with a standard <b>counterbalance</b> valve that has the same parameters for stability when it is lowering an overrunning load. The standard <b>counterbalance</b> can be replaced with the new load adaptive valve in the same cavity. The paper shows test results and the design of the valve...|$|R

5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). <b>Counterbalancing</b> {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E

In most water-tube designs these were a few large-diameter external pipes from the steam drum to the water drum. These large-diameter pipes were thus a problem for reliability owing to their rigidity and the forces upon them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} {{conventional}} <b>counterbalance</b> mechanism featuring a fixed <b>counterbalance</b> torque is {{to balance the}} nonuniformity of polished rod load. Therefore, it cannot satisfy the demand of polish rod load which changes with well-condition and then leads to increase of power cost for decreasing quality of balance. This paper presents a new dynamic adjusting mechanism of <b>counterbalance</b> in beam-pumping unit that can adjust the <b>counterbalance</b> torque automatically without stopping the unit {{according to the new}} balance parameters derived by analyzing the variation of well-condition and increase productivity at the same time. A data comparison based on the corresponding kinetic model of transmission mechanism is also discussed...|$|R

25|$|It {{was already}} {{recognised}} that a water-tube boiler {{relied on a}} continuous flow through the water-tubes, and that this must be by a thermosyphon effect rather than requiring an impractical pump. Forced-circulation boilers with pumps, such as the Velox, would not appear for another thirty years and even then they would be initially unreliable. The assumption was that flow through the water-tubes would be upwards, owing to their heating by the furnace, and that the <b>counterbalancing</b> downward flow would require external unheated downcomers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Counterbalance</b> valves {{are widely}} used in {{hydraulic}} deck machinery to balance the overrunning loads. However, as is well known, <b>counterbalance</b> circuit designed with poor choice of <b>counterbalance</b> valve tends to introduce instability to the system. This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a pilot operated <b>counterbalance</b> valve which can operate at a flow rate about 2000 L/min. A linearized stability analysis of such a hydraulic circuit which consists of a slip in cartridge, a pilot <b>counterbalance</b> valve and a hydraulic winch is presented. Pole-zero plots are employed to reveal {{the effect of the}} volume of control cavity, the hydraulic resistance on pilot line and <b>counterbalance</b> valve pilot area ratio on the stability of the system. The analysis results indicate that such a system will be unstable within the normal range of each parameter. An alternative approach that guarantees system stability by adding an accumulator on the pilot line is put forward. The approach stabilizes the pilot pressure by reducing the hydro-stiffness of pilot control cavity, thus the system can reach its stability condition. Finally, a numerical optimization method is putted forward, with the optimized parameters, the dynamic performance of considered system become better...|$|R

25|$|Benzene, {{the model}} π system, has no {{permanent}} dipole moment, as {{the contributions of}} the weakly polar carbon–hydrogen bonds cancel due to molecular symmetry. However, the electron-rich π system above and below the benzene ring hosts a partial negative charge. A <b>counterbalancing</b> positive charge is associated with the plane of the benzene atoms, resulting in an electric quadrupole (a pair of dipoles, aligned like a parallelogram so there is no net molecular dipole moment). The negatively charged region of the quadrupole can then interact favorably with positively charged species; a particularly strong effect is observed with cations of high charge density.|$|E

25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the <b>counterbalancing</b> arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.|$|E

25|$|By {{the eve of}} the Invasion of Kuwait {{which led}} to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the army was {{estimated}} to number 1,000,000 men.

Although it was said at the time in Western media that Iraqi troops numbered approximately 545,000 (even 600,000) today most experts think that both the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the Iraqi army at the time were exaggerated, as they included both temporary and auxiliary support elements. Many of the Iraqi troops were also young, under-resourced and poorly trained conscripts. Saddam did not trust the army; among <b>counterbalancing</b> security forces was the Iraqi Popular Army.|$|E
