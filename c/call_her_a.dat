500|$|At {{the start}} of the Perón government, Eva dresses glamorously, enjoying the {{privileges}} of being the First Lady. Soon after, she embarks on what is called her [...] "Rainbow Tour" [...] to Europe. While there, she receives a mixed reception. The people of Spain adore her, the people of Italy <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> whore and throw things at her, and Pope Pius XII gives her a small, meager gift. Upon returning to Argentina, Eva establishes a foundation and distributes aid. The film suggests the Perónists otherwise plunder the public treasury.|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 US presidential campaign, Lohan {{offered her}} {{services}} to Barack Obama's Democratic election effort, but was declined. In a blog post, Lohan criticized {{the media and}} then Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin for not focusing on policy, and she described Palin as homophobic and anti-choice. Lohan had previously {{expressed an interest in}} going to Iraq, during the Iraq War in 2006, on a USO tour with Hillary Clinton. In the 2012 presidential election, Lohan supported Republican candidate Mitt Romney, something that prompted ABC News to <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> [...] "political turncoat". Only weeks later, she tweeted words supportive of Obama.|$|E
500|$|Leech's regimen {{differed}} from most swimmers because Froelich {{was not an}} advocate of distance training, and designed shorter workouts for his students. She trained once a day, swimming no more than [...] Froelich did not push her to continue swimming laps when she felt tired, but emphasised an efficient stroke mechanism, which Leech implemented with a long and graceful arm action. Leech stood 180 centimetres (5'11"), but weighed only , with broad shoulders, slim hips and large hands and feet. Her long streamlined action prompted observers to <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> [...] "flying fish". Spinal problems caused by a back misalignment prevented her from using the optimal flip turn preferred by freestyle swimmers. Instead, {{she was forced to}} utilise the touch turn, which was slower.|$|E

500|$|... "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The guy gets all the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same and yet you <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E
500|$|Makeba {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: [...] "Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that [...] "black is beautiful". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting [...] "that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex". Makeba's critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the [...] "most steadfast voices for social justice".|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Baker {{summed up}} the {{difficulties}} and potential confusion when assessing a ship as a potential pinnace candidate. [...] There is no consensus as to what type of ship should be assigned to the Sparrow-Hawk. Decked and with a square stern, she cannot be a shallop. Baker believes her too chunky to be a pinnace, others <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> 'ketch' but this author goes {{with the department of}} Nautical Archeology at Texas A University that assigns “Sparrow-Hawk” to the pinnace category, and representative of the 'small pinnace' design in contrast to the 'large pinnace' type.|$|E

She looked unlikely to obtain a clear run in the straight but broke through in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Happy Clapper. Waller commented, [...] "I'll <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> champion while I can speak. I thought she was beaten at the half-mile. She must have an amazing will to win." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{bishop and}} {{historian}} Eusebius of Caesarea states {{that she was}} about 80 on her return from Palestine. Since that journey has been dated to 326–28, Helena was probably born in 248 or 250. Little is known of her early life. Fourth-century sources, following Eutropius' [...] "Breviarium," [...] record that she came from a low background. Saint Ambrose {{was the first to}} <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> stabularia, a term translated as [...] "stable-maid" [...] or [...] "inn-keeper". He makes this fact a virtue, calling Helena a bona stabularia, a [...] "good stable-maid". Other sources, especially those written after Constantine's proclamation as emperor, gloss over or ignore her background.|$|E
2500|$|On July 5, 2006, Schaefer {{launched}} into a rambling commentary on immigration as the public works board considered a contract to provide testing services for the English as a Second Language (ESOL) program in Maryland schools. As state education officials tried to explain the contract, Schaefer demanded {{to know whether the}} program would benefit Korean students. [...] "Korea's another one, all of a sudden they're our friends, too, shooting missiles at us", he said. Schaefer was apparently referring to North Korea's test launch earlier that week of a long-range missile, which fell into the ocean. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments after a meeting with South Korean community leaders. Later that same day, when he was questioned by a female Baltimore Sun reporter about the ESOL program, Schaefer's response was to <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sweet little girl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kelley's views became {{progressively}} more radical {{as she worked}} with abolitionists such as Angelina Grimké. [...] She became an “ultra”, advocating not only the abolition of slavery, but also full civil equality for blacks. [...] In addition, Garrison's influence led her to adopt the position of “non-resistance", which went beyond opposing war to opposing all forms of government coercion. [...] Radical abolitionists led by Garrison refused to serve on juries, join the military, or vote. [...] The Garrisonian call {{for the end of}} slavery and the extension of civil rights to African Americans caused controversy. [...] Kelley's advocacy of the radical abolitionist movement prompted some opponents to <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> “Jezebel", as what she proposed threatened their sense of social structure. [...] On the other hand, many fellow abolitionists praised her public speaking skills and her dedication to the cause. [...] Kelley’s influence was shown by activist women being called “Abby Kelleyites". [...] Radical abolitionism became known as “Abby Kelleyism.” ...|$|E

Aika considers herself reliable, especially compared to distractible Akari and antisocial Alice, but both her friends <b>call</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> crybaby for her tendency to tear up when emotional. She is proud of her gondola skill as an undine, and can be very competitive about it.
