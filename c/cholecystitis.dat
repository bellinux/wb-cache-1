5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute <b>cholecystitis),</b> {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the setting of bile duct obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually ultrasound, as this is the most easily available. Ultrasound may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones farther down the bile duct. Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and <b>cholecystitis</b> (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound. A better test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, <b>cholecystitis</b> or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cholecystitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder. Symptoms include right upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally fever. Often gallbladder attacks (biliary colic) precede acute <b>cholecystitis.</b> The pain lasts longer in <b>cholecystitis</b> than in a typical gallbladder attack. Without appropriate treatment, recurrent episodes of <b>cholecystitis</b> are common. Complications of acute <b>cholecystitis</b> include gallstone pancreatitis, common bile duct stones, or {{inflammation of}} the common bile duct.|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>cholecystitis</b> occurs after {{repeated}} episodes of acute <b>cholecystitis</b> and {{is almost always}} due to gallstones. Chronic <b>cholecystitis</b> may be asymptomatic, may present as a more severe case of acute <b>cholecystitis,</b> or {{may lead to a}} number of complications such as gangrene, perforation, or fistula formation.|$|E
25|$|Xanthogranulomatous <b>cholecystitis</b> (XGC) {{is a rare}} form {{of chronic}} <b>cholecystitis</b> which mimics {{gallbladder}} cancer {{although it is not}} cancerous.|$|E
25|$|In acalculous <b>cholecystitis,</b> no {{stone is}} in the biliary ducts. It {{accounts}} for 5–10% of all cases of <b>cholecystitis</b> and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Acalculous <b>cholecystitis</b> is typically seen in people who are hospitalized and critically ill. Males {{are more likely to}} develop acute <b>cholecystitis</b> following surgery in the absence of trauma. It is associated with many causes including vasculitis, chemotherapy, major trauma or burns.|$|E
25|$|More than 90% of {{the time}} acute <b>cholecystitis</b> is from {{blockage}} of the cystic duct by a gallstone. Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, {{a family history of}} gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. Occasionally acute <b>cholecystitis</b> occur as a result of vasculitis, chemotherapy, or during recovery from major trauma or burns. <b>Cholecystitis</b> is suspected based on symptoms and laboratory testing. Abdominal ultrasound is then typically used to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cholecystitis</b> {{accounts}} for 3–10% {{of cases of}} abdominal pain worldwide. <b>Cholecystitis</b> caused an estimated 651,829 emergency department visits and 389,180 hospital admissions in the US in 2012. The 2012 US mortality rate was 0.7 per 100,000 people. The frequency of cholecysitis is highest in people age 50–69 years old.|$|E
25|$|Cholelithiasis (gallstones) and <b>cholecystitis</b> {{may result}} from {{excessive}} bilirubin production and precipitation due to prolonged haemolysis.|$|E
25|$|Reasons for false {{positive}} elevated serum amylase include salivary gland disease (elevated salivary amylase), bowel obstruction, infarction, <b>cholecystitis,</b> and a perforated ulcer.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for pancreatitis includes {{but is not}} limited to <b>cholecystitis,</b> choledocholithiasis, perforated peptic ulcer, bowel infarction, small bowel obstruction, hepatitis and mesenteric ischemia.|$|E
25|$|Known as <b>cholecystitis,</b> {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder is commonly caused by obstruction of the duct with gallstones, which is known as cholelithiasis. Blocked bile accumulates, and pressure on the gallbladder wall {{may lead to the}} release of substances that cause inflammation, such as phospholipase. There is also the risk of bacterial infection. An inflamed gallbladder is likely to cause pain and fever, and tenderness in the upper, right corner of the abdomen, and may have a positive Murphy's sign. <b>Cholecystitis</b> is often managed with rest and antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins and, in severe cases, metronidazole.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of pancreatitis is supportive and depends on severity. Morphine generally {{is suitable for}} pain control. There are no clinical studies to suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause pancreatitis or <b>cholecystitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gallstones are {{a common}} cause of {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder, called <b>cholecystitis.</b> Inflammation of the biliary duct is called cholangitis, which {{may be associated with}} autoimmune disease, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, or a result of bacterial infection, such as ascending cholangitis.|$|E
25|$|Patients are {{initially}} suspicious for paragangliomas {{when they}} present with symptoms like hypertension, heart palpitations, headaches, and anxiety; somatostatinomas usually induce diabetes and <b>cholecystitis.</b> From these symptoms, patients undergo biochemical testing from blood and urine samples {{as well as}} functional and anatomical imaging to confirm tumor presence.|$|E
25|$|Untreated <b>cholecystitis</b> {{can lead}} to worsened {{inflammation}} and infected bile that {{can lead to}} a collection of pus surrounding the gallbladder, also known as empyema. The symptoms of empyema are similar to uncomplicated choleystitis but greater severity: high fever, severe abdominal pain, more severely elevated white blood count.|$|E
25|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} {{may occur}} {{in up to}} 0.2 per 1000 per year. A worm may block the ampulla of Vater, or go into the main pancreatic duct, resulting in acute pancreatitis with raised serum levels of amylase and lipase. Occasionally, a worm can travel through the billiary tree and even into the gallbladder, causing acute cholangitis or acute <b>cholecystitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meperidine {{has been}} {{historically}} favored over morphine {{because of the}} belief that morphine caused an increase in sphincter of Oddi pressure. However, no clinical studies suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause pancreatitis or <b>cholecystitis.</b> In addition, meperidine has a short half-life and repeated doses can lead to accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine, which causes neuromuscular side effects and, rarely, seizures.|$|E
25|$|The {{gallbladder}} can {{be affected}} by gallstones, formed by material that cannot be dissolved – usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of haemoglobin breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy. <b>Cholecystitis,</b> inflammation of the gallbladder, has {{a wide range of}} causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.|$|E
25|$|Diseases of the {{gallbladder}} {{have affected}} humans since antiquity, with gallstones {{found in the}} mummy of Princess Amenen of Thebes dating to 1500 BCE. Some historians believe the death of Alexander the Great may {{have been associated with}} an acute episode of <b>cholecystitis.</b> The existence of the gallbladder has been noted since the 5th century, but it is only relatively recently that the function and the diseases of the gallbladder has been documented, particularly in the last two centuries.|$|E
25|$|Filming for Harlow's final film Saratoga, co-starring Clark Gable, was {{scheduled}} to begin in March 1937. However, production was delayed when she developed septicemia {{and had to be}} hospitalized after a multiple wisdom tooth extraction. After she recovered, shooting began on April 22. On May 20, 1937, while shooting Saratoga, Harlow began to complain of illness. Her symptoms—fatigue, nausea, water weight and abdominal pain—did not seem very serious to her doctor, who believed she was suffering from <b>cholecystitis</b> and influenza. However, he was apparently unaware that Harlow had been ill during the previous year with a severe sunburn and influenza. Her friend and co-star Myrna Loy noticed Harlow's grey pallor, fatigue, and weight gain.|$|E
500|$|John Benjamin Murphy, born John Murphy (December 21, 1857 in Appleton, Wisconsin [...] August 11, 1916 Mackinac Island, Michigan), was an American {{physician}} and abdominal surgeon noted for advocating early surgical intervention in appendicitis appendectomy, and several eponyms: Murphy’s button, Murphy drip, Murphy’s punch, Murphy’s test, and Murphy-Lane bone skid. [...] He is best remembered for the eponymous clinical sign {{that is used}} in evaluating patients with acute <b>cholecystitis.</b> [...] His career spanned general surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and cardiothoracic surgery, which helped him to gain international prominence in the surgical profession. Mayo Clinic co-founder William James Mayo called him [...] "the surgical genius of our generation".|$|E
2500|$|The {{presentation}} of acalculous <b>cholecystitis</b> {{is similar to}} calculous <b>cholecystitis.</b> [...] Patients {{are more likely to}} have yellowing of the skin (jaundice) than in calculous <b>cholecystitis.</b> Ultrasonography or computed tomography often shows an immobile, enlarged gallbladder. Treatment involves immediate antibiotics and cholecystectomy within 24–72 hours.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{people with}} {{gallstone}}s {{do not have}} symptoms. When a gallstone lodges in the cystic duct, they experience biliary colic. [...] Biliary colic is abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastric region. It is episodic, occurs after eating greasy or fatty foods, and leads to nausea and/or vomiting. People who suffer from <b>cholecystitis</b> most commonly have symptoms of biliary colic before developing <b>cholecystitis.</b> The pain becomes more severe and constant in <b>cholecystitis.</b> Nausea is common and vomiting occurs in 75% of people with <b>cholecystitis.</b> In addition to abdominal pain, right shoulder pain can be present.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cholecystitis</b> {{occurs when}} the {{gallbladder}} becomes inflamed. Gallstones {{are the most common}} cause of gallbladder inflammation but it can also occur due to blockage from a tumor or scarring of the bile duct. The greatest risk factor for <b>cholecystitis</b> is gallstones. [...] Risk factors for gallstones include female sex, increasing age, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, obesity, diabetes mellitus, ethnicity (Native North American), rapid weight loss.|$|E
2500|$|On {{physical}} examination, fever is common. A gallbladder with <b>cholecystitis</b> {{is almost}} always tender to touch. Because of the inflammation, its size can be felt from {{the outside of the}} body in 25–50% of people with <b>cholecystitis.</b> Pain with deep inspiration leading to termination of the breath while pressing on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen usually causes pain (Murphy's sign). [...] Murphy's sign is sensitive, but not specific for <b>cholecystitis.</b> Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) may occur but is often mild. Severe jaundice suggests another cause of symptoms such as choledocholithiasis. People who are old, have diabetes, chronic illness, or who are immunocompromised may have vague symptoms that may not include fever or localized tenderness.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cholecystitis</b> {{causes the}} {{gallbladder}} to become distended and firm. [...] Distension {{can lead to}} decreased {{blood flow to the}} gallbladder, causing tissue death and eventually gangrene. [...] Once tissue has died, the gallbladder is at greatly increased risk of rupture (perforation). Rupture can also occur in cases of chronic <b>cholecystitis.</b> Rupture is a rare but serious complication that leads to abscess formation or peritonitis. [...] Massive rupture of the gallbladder has a mortality rate of 30%.|$|E
2500|$|Gallstones {{blocking}} {{the flow of}} bile account for 90% of cases of <b>cholecystitis</b> (acute calculous <b>cholecystitis).</b> [...] Blockage of bile flow leads to thickening and buildup of bile causing an enlarged, red, and tense gallbladder. The gallbladder is initially sterile but often becomes infected by bacteria, predominantly E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium species. [...] Inflammation can spread to the outer covering of the gallbladder and surrounding structures such as the diaphragm, causing referred right shoulder pain.|$|E
2500|$|About 10–15% {{of adults}} in the {{developed}} world have gallstones. Women more commonly have stones than men and they occur more commonly after age 40. Certain ethnic groups are more often affected; for example, 48% of American Indians have gallstones. Of all people with stones, 1–4% have biliary colic each year. If untreated, about 20% of people with biliary colic develop acute <b>cholecystitis.</b> Once the gallbladder is removed outcomes are generally good. Without treatment, chronic <b>cholecystitis</b> may occur. The word is from Greek, cholecyst- meaning [...] "gallbladder" [...] and -itis meaning [...] "inflammation".|$|E
2500|$|This phase {{may develop}} {{months or years}} after initial infection. Adult flukes in the bile ducts cause {{inflammation}} and hyperplasia of the epithelium. The resulting cholangitis and <b>cholecystitis,</b> combined with the large body of the flukes, are sufficient to cause mechanical obstruction of the biliary duct. In this phase, biliary colic, epigastric pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, pruritus, right upper-quadrant abdominal tenderness, etc., are clinical manifestations indistinguishable from cholangitis, <b>cholecystitis</b> and cholelithiasis of other origins. Hepatic enlargement {{may be associated with}} an enlarged spleen or ascites. In case of obstruction, the gall bladder is usually enlarged and edematous with thickening of the wall (Ref: Hepatobiliary Fascioliasis: ...|$|E
2500|$|In immunocompetent individuals, {{cryptosporidiosis}} {{is primarily}} localized to the {{distal small intestine}} and sometimes the respiratory tract as well. [...] In immunocompromised persons, cryptosporidiosis may disseminate to other organs, including the hepatobiliary system, pancreas, upper gastrointestinal tract, and urinary bladder; pancreatic and biliary infection can involve acalculous <b>cholecystitis,</b> sclerosing cholangitis, papillary stenosis, or pancreatitis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inflammation}} of <b>cholecystitis</b> {{can lead to}} adhesions between the gallbladder {{and other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly the duodenum. These adhesions can lead to the formation of direct connections between the gallbladder and gastrointestinal tract, called fistulas. With these direct connections, gallstones can pass from the gallbladder to the intestines. [...] Gallstones can get trapped in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly at the connection between the small and large intestines (ileocecal valve). [...] When a gallstone gets trapped, it can lead to an intestinal obstruction, called gallstone ileus, leading to abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distension.|$|E
2500|$|Gallstones {{form when}} the bile is saturated, usually with either {{cholesterol}} or bilirubin. Most gallstones do not cause symptoms, with stones either {{remaining in the}} gallbladder or passed along the biliary system. When symptoms occur, severe [...] "colicky" [...] pain in the upper right part of the abdomen is often felt. If the stone blocks the gallbladder, inflammation known as <b>cholecystitis</b> may result. If the stone lodges in the biliary system, jaundice may occur; and if the stone blocks the pancreatic duct, then pancreatitis may occur. Gallstones are diagnosed using ultrasound. When a symptomatic gallstone occurs, it is often managed by waiting it to be passed naturally. Given the likelihood of recurrent gallstones, surgery to remove the gallbladder is often considered. Some medication, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, may be used; and lithotripsy, a procedure used {{to break down the}} stones, may also be used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cholecystitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder. Symptoms include right upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally fever. Often gallbladder attacks (biliary colic) precede acute <b>cholecystitis.</b> The pain lasts longer in <b>cholecystitis</b> than in a typical gallbladder attack. Without appropriate treatment, recurrent episodes of <b>cholecystitis</b> are common. Complications of acute <b>cholecystitis</b> include gallstone pancreatitis, common bile duct stones, or {{inflammation of}} the common bile duct.|$|E
