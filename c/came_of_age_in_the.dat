When his father died, Géza was still a child and he started ruling under the {{guardianship}} {{of his mother and}} her brother, Beloš. A pretender to the throne, Boris Kalamanos, who had already claimed Hungary during Béla the Blind's reign, temporarily captured Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) with the assistance of German mercenaries in early 1146. In retaliation, Géza, who <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year, invaded Austria and routed Henry Jasomirgott, Margrave of Austria, in the Battle of the Fischa.|$|E
500|$|Cristina Kirchner, {{the first}} elected female {{president}} in Argentine history, is a Peronist who has occasionally {{been referred to}} as [...] "The New Evita." [...] Kirchner says she does not want to compare herself to Evita, claiming she was a unique phenomenon in Argentine history. Kirchner also says that women of her generation, who <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s during the military dictatorships in Argentina, owe a debt to Evita for offering an example of passion and combativeness. On 26 July 2002, the 50th anniversary of Eva Perón's death, a museum opened in her honor called Museo Evita. The museum, created by her great-niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriquez, houses many of Eva Perón's clothes, portraits, and artistic renderings of her life, and has become a popular tourist attraction. The museum was opened in a building that was once used by the Eva Perón Foundation.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Animal House {{received}} mixed reviews from critics but several immediately recognized its appeal, and it has since been {{recognized as one of the}} best films of 1978. The film holds a 91% positive rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Its consensus states [...] "The talents of director John Landis and Saturday Night Lives irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, [...] "It's anarchic, messy, and filled with energy. It assaults us. Part of the movie's impact comes from its sheer level of manic energy. ... But the movie's better made (and better acted) than we might at first realize. It takes skill to create this sort of comic pitch, and the movie's filled with characters that are sketched a little more absorbingly than they had to be, and acted with perception". Ebert later placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978, the only National Lampoon film to have received this honor. In his review for Time, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "At its best it perfectly expresses the fears and loathings of kids who <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late '60s; at its worst Animal House revels in abject silliness. The hilarious highs easily compensate for the puerile lows". Gary Arnold wrote in his review for The Washington Post, [...] "Belushi also controls a wicked array of conspiratorial expressions with the audience. ... He can seem irresistibly funny in repose or invest minor slapstick opportunities with a streak of genius". David Ansen wrote in Newsweek, [...] "But if Animal House lacks the inspired tastelessness of the Lampoon's High School Yearbook Parody, this is still low humor of a high order". Robert Martin wrote in The Globe and Mail, [...] "It is so gross and tasteless you feel you should be disgusted but it's hard to be offended by something that is so sidesplittingly funny". Time magazine proclaimed Animal House one of the year's best.|$|E

[...] It became associated with hippies and the anti-war movement, civil rights, feminism and environmentalism, paralleling the similar rise of Afrocentric Black Power in soul and funk.

2500|$|In Tunisia a {{reformer}} also arose. Khair al-Din al-Tunsi (1810–1889) [...] {{was an early}} reformer of Circassian origins. When a child he learned Turkish and eventually became an Ottoman Pasha. As a young man he was brought to Tunisia to enter the declining Turkish-speaking elite. Here he spent several decades {{in the service of}} several Beys (1840s-1877), when he chose to adopt the Maghrib as his own and learned Arabic. Khair al-Din has been discussed previously. He preceded al-Afghani, and appeared to be more traditionally religious. He <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> era of the Ottoman Tanzimat, a series of modern reforms begun in 1839. Khair al-Din advocated a modern rationalism in the reform of society and government, yet one respectful of Muslim institutions. Once in power in Tunisia to implement his reforms (1873–1877), Khair al-Din encountered stiff opposition and was replaced mid-steam.|$|E

2500|$|Tito Enrique Canepa Jiménez (21 September 1916 - 11 February 2014) was {{a leading}} Dominican painter of the {{generation}} that <b>came</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s and 1940s. Canepa's artistic identity was shaped in New York City, where he lived {{from the age of}} 21, never returning to stay in his native country. Despite this distance, or perhaps because of it, as León David has pointed out, his works always evince a certain dominicanidad without his setting out to achieve it as a goal — a dominicanidad that is never folkloric. Of the three modernist Dominican painters of the 1930s and 40s — [...] Canepa, Colson and Suro — singled out by Rafael Díaz Niese in 1944 as most significant, Canepa is the one whose artistic activity developed in the most continuous absence from his native country, and the one longest resident in New York. Cánepa is accented in Spanish but not in the original Ligurian.|$|E

And it gave us so many great, geeky lines to quote." [...] Cosford of The Miami Herald said in his review, [...] "I suspect that Buckaroo's odd musings, particularly the one about being there no matter where you go, are about to enter the popular argot on the scale of [...] "Where's the beef?"—and his prediction has been proved right. (There is a page at CafePress for Buckaroo Banzai Quotes Gifts, for example.) Entertainment Weekly ranked Buckaroo Banzai as #43 in their Top 50 Cult Movies. The film was also ranked #21 on the magazine's [...] "The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83" [...] list. The Guardian has also cited Buckaroo Banzai as one of their [...] "1,000 films to see before you die".|$|E

That the twenty thousand pounds (from which the income was supposed to be derived) had every farthing of it been sold out of the Funds, at different periods, ending {{with the end of the}} year eighteen hundred and forty-seven.
