The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act has created a new platform for multi-sector collaboration by creating a process of engagement between entities. A mechanism within this platform includes state response program grants authorized by <b>CERCLA</b> <b>Section</b> 128(a)(1) that seek to protect {{human health and the environment}} by encouraging the voluntary investigation and cleanup of properties by establishing memorandum of agreements/understandings with state environmental authorities. When a brownfields site is in a state response program, the responsible party is protected from enforcement. This protection and the available resources to provide environmental site assessments and limited cleanups are the attributes that encourage the revitalization of historic sites with an industrial past.

40|$|This Comment {{will examine}} the {{development}} of arranger liability under Ninth Circuit jurisprudence, specifically looking at the impact of Ninth Circuit‟s decision in Burlington Northern {{and the impact of}} the Supreme Court‟s reversal. Section II of this Comment will briefly examine the mechanisms for triggering CERCLA liability, specifically the definition of arranger liability under CERCLA. Next, Section III will address arranger liability in the Ninth Circuit. Specifically, this discussion will consider “direct” arranger liability considered in Cadillac Fairview/California, Inc. v. United States, which examined when transactions constitute “arrangements for disposal,” as contrasted with Burlington Northern, which expanded and applied a category of broader arranger liability to a supplier of chemical products to a site. That section will also consider United States v.

Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (MCB Camp Lejeune) is in Onslow County, North Carolina, southeast of Jacksonville and about 70 miles northeast of Wilmington, North Carolina. The base covers an area in southeastern North Carolina 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Coastal Plain: approximately 151, 000 acres (233 square miles), with 14 miles of beach on the Atlantic Ocean. Camp Lejeune began operations in late 1941 (Watson 1995). The military base has been densely populated throughout its history, with approximately 43, 000 active duty military personnel and 51, 000 dependents as current occupants. Over the years, contaminants from unlined landfills and leaking, aboveground and underground storage tanks migrated into soil and groundwater at locations across MCB Camp Lejeune. In 1983, MCB Camp Lejeune conducted an initial assessment of the potentially contaminated areas. Since that time, base-wide environmental investigations have been ongoing and continue under MCB Camp Lejeune 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Installation Restoration Program. Because of proven environmental contamination, on October 4, 1989, USEPA added Camp Lejeune to its National Priorities List. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (CERCLA), {{commonly known as the}} Superfund Law, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was then required to conduct a public health assessment of the MCB Camp Lejeune site. ATSDR 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s 1997 public health assessment found that people had been exposed to contaminants of concern in the MCB Camp Lejeune drinking water. ATSDR declared those past exposures a public health hazard, and ATSDR maintains that position today. Since the 1997 PHA, additional scientific information has expanded the knowledge base related to exposures to contaminants of concern in drinking water at MCB Camp Lejeune. This public health assessment will use this new information to evaluate these exposures, particularly the findings from ATSDR 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s historical reconstruction modeling efforts. As of 2015, MCB Camp Lejeune 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s eight water-distribution systems had supplied or currently supply drinking water to base family housing and other facilities (Figures 1 and 2). Three of the eight distribution systems were contaminated and therefore were evaluated in this public health assessment: Tarawa Terrace, Hadnot Point, and Holcomb Boulevard. The Hadnot Point and Tarawa Terrace water-distribution systems operate independently of each other and were contaminated from different sources. Trichloroethylene (TCE), vinyl chloride (VC), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and refined petroleum products such as benzene were most of the groundwater contaminants in the Hadnot Point Water Treatment Plant service area. Except for intermittent supply by contaminated Hadnot Point water between 1972 and 1985, groundwater in the Holcomb Boulevard WTP service area remained largely uncontaminated. Researchers have identified historical base operations and disposal practices at MCB Camp Lejeune as responsible for contamination of groundwater and drinking water supplies in the Hadnot Point-Holcomb Boulevard study area (Faye et al., 2010, 2012 b). PCE and its degradation products [TCE, trans- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene (trans- 1, 2 -DCE), and VC] were the contaminants found in the Tarawa Terrace drinking water. ABC One-Hour Cleaners, an off-site drycleaner, was the source of the contaminants found in the Tarawa Terrace Water Treatment Plant (Shiver, 1985).

MDH also evaluates environmental data, and advises {{state and local governments}} on actions that can be taken to protect public health. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) asked the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to review environmental data for the former Gopher Ordnance Works (GOW) site and evaluate potential public health concerns. The former GOW site, located in the City of Rosemount in Dakota County, Minnesota was constructed and operated by the federal government during World War II for the production of smokeless gunpowder and nitric and sulfuric acids. Following decontamination and demolition activities by the federal government, portions of the site were purchased by the University of Minnesota in 194722 ̆ 0 ac? 1948. Since that time, the property has been used for a variety of purposes by the University and their tenants. As a result of the historic uses of the property, physical and chemical hazards are present at the site, which have been evaluated in a series of site investigations starting in the 1980 s. Extensive redevelopment is planned for much of the site; as development proceeds, additional environmental data will need to be collected {{to ensure the safety of}} the property for future use. Many data gaps currently exist, due in part to the large acreage of the site. This document summarizes and catalogs information about the residual soil and groundwater contamination in Rosemount, Minnesota, at the former GOW site. It is written for multiple stakeholders who may be concerned about current exposures and/or future development of the property. The residents of Rosemount and nearby areas, the City of Rosemount, Dakota County, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the University of Minnesota, and future residents and occupants of the site have varying interests in the site information. This report reviews the environmental data and relevant site history from a large number of documents to provide recommendations and assist with future response action and development decisions. MDH reached five major conclusions in this Public Health Assessment of the former Gopher Ordnance Works site 1. MDH concluded that physical hazards are the most important public health hazard on the site. 2. MDH concluded that contaminated surface soil in some areas of the site pose a public health hazard. 3. MDH concluded that contaminated soils in some areas of the site pose an indeterminate public health hazard. 4. MDH concluded that some areas of the site have not had adequate investigation to evaluate whether a public health hazard exists. 5.
