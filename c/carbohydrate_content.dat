40|$|Amino {{acid and}} <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>contents</b> during early 30 minutes (min) of wheat seed {{imbibition}} {{have not been}} reported earlier. In this study, wheat seeds (cv. Inqalab) preimbibed in water for 2, 6, 16 and 24 hours (h) and dried back, were soaked in water for 30 minutes and amino acid and <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>contents</b> in leachates were measured. Untreated seeds showed 4. 5 times increase in amino acid contents (2 - 9. 1 nmoles/seed) in 30 min of imbibition. However, in preimbibed seeds, as the time to pretreatment increased (from 2 to 24 h), the amount of amino acids leached decreased and in 24 h preimbibed seeds, it was 2. 8 nmoles/seed after 30 min. Changes in <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>contents</b> in leachates in untreated seeds rose from 13 to 52 �g/seed in 30 min, an overall increase of 4 times was exhibited. All the pretreated seeds exhibited lower levels of carbohydrates effluxed in 30 min.

25|$|Work {{continues}} on substituting vegetable proteins and protein concentrates for fish meal in the salmonid diet. As of 2014, an enzymatic {{process can be}} used to lower the <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>content</b> of barley, making it a high-protein fish feed suitable for salmon. Many other substitutions for fish meal are known, and diets containing zero fish meal are possible. For example, a planned closed containment salmon fish farm in Scotland uses ragworms, algae and amino acids as feed. However, commercial economic animal diets are determined by least cost linear programming models that are effectively competing with similar models for chicken and pig feeds for the same feed ingredients and these models show that fish meal is more useful in aquatic diets than in chicken diets, where they can make the chickens taste like fish. Unfortunately, this substitution can result in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 content in the farmed product. However, when vegetable oil is used in the growing diet as an energy source and a different finishing diet containing high omega-3 content fatty acids from either fish oil, algae oils or some vegetable oils are used a few months before harvest, this problem is eliminated.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Algae {{species have}} been used as an {{important}} source of food because they are highly nutritive considering their vitamin, protein, mineral, fiber, essential fatty acid and <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>contents.</b> However, a large number of seaweeds have been poorly studied, especially Brazilian species. Two red macroalgae species from the Brazilian coast (Plocamium brasiliense and Ochtodes secundiramea) were assessed with respect to their total lipid, fatty acid, total nitrogen, protein, amino acid and total <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>contents.</b> RESULTS: The total lipid contents (dry weight) were 36. 3 and 35. 4 g kg(- 1); fatty acid contents were 9. 3 and 12. 1 g kg(- 1); total nitrogen contents were 37. 4 and 24. 9 g kg(- 1); protein contents were 157. 2 and 101. 0 g kg(- 1); amino acid contents were 127. 5 and 91. 4 g kg(- 1); and total <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>contents</b> were 520. 3 and 450. 7 g kg(- 1) for P. brasiliense and O. secundiramea, respectively.

2500|$|Thy-1 {{is one of}} {{the most}} heavily glycosylated {{membrane}} proteins with a <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>content</b> up to 30% of its molecular mass. Thy1 in most species has 3 N-glycosylation sites (Asn 23, 74 and 98) but no O-glycosylation. The composition of Thy-1 carbohydrate moieties varies considerably between different tissues or even among cells of the same lineage at different stages of differentiation: e.g., galactosamine only in brain Thy-1, sialic acid in thymic Thy-1 in far excess than brain Thy-1, that too increasing in parallel with T cell maturation. In this regard it has yet another historic association: Thy1 happens to be the first glycoprotein in which cell type specificity of variant glycosylation on an invariant protein was demonstrated.

30|$|To use lignin {{as active}} food {{packaging}} material, {{it is of}} importance to study its possible cytotoxic effects. The IC 50 value obtained for A 2 (149.67  µg/ml) and LG-D (229.34  µg/ml) reveals that it has cytotoxic effects, but only at moderate concentrations (Fig.  8 b).

Furthermore, both the glycemic index and glycemic load measurements are defined by the <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>content</b> of food. For example, when eating steak, which has no <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>content</b> but provides a high protein intake, up to 50% of that protein can be converted to glucose when there is little to no carbohydrate consumed with it.
