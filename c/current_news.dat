5|$|Fielding's seventh play, Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic {{play that}} first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success {{until it was}} renamed The Coffee-House Politician and was altered to {{possibly}} update the play as it focused on mocking <b>current</b> <b>news</b> events. The play is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in the play is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.|$|E
5|$|Correspondent {{segments}} {{feature a}} rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on <b>current</b> <b>news</b> stories and conduct interviews with people {{related to the}} featured issue. Topics have varied widely; {{during the early years}} of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of The Daily Show. However, as the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.|$|E

25|$|The impalement arts {{have evolved}} {{as the product}} of a history of {{performance}} dating back to at least the 19th century. That heritage, and especially the collective achievements of notable performers, helps to define the subject. As with other performance arts, judgements about who might be the most notable are highly subjective and clouded by the hyperbole of publicity. For similar reasons it is also sometimes difficult to resolve debates about who originated particular stunts. Nevertheless, some names recur frequently in historical records and <b>current</b> <b>news.</b> Some are recognised for pioneering achievements, some for bringing the arts to widespread audiences and some as distinctive characters who, although less famous, have had significant influence on their peers. Because this is not a league table of merit and because overlaps make a chronological presentation awkward, they are presented here in alphabetic order under the two main disciplines.|$|E
500|$|For Alter {{and other}} critics, the {{structural}} support and {{impetus for the}} contemporary references rests upon the visual nature of the film's exposition, occurring {{in the form of}} imagery as opposed to conventional dialogue. [...] Visually, the refugee camps in the film intentionally evoke Abu Ghraib prison, Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and The Maze. [...] Other popular images appear, such as a sign over the refugee camp reading [...] "Homeland Security". [...] The similarity between the hellish, cinéma vérité stylized battle scenes of the film and <b>current</b> <b>news</b> and documentary coverage of the Iraq War, is noted by film critic Manohla Dargis, describing Cuarón's fictional landscapes as [...] "war zones of extraordinary plausibility".|$|E

500|$|On March 6, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{reported}} that Angle's name {{was found in}} the client database of a Florida wellness center suspected of being a front for distributing performance enhancing drugs. The magazine alleged that Angle had received prescriptions for trenbolone (which is not approved for human use by the FDA) and nandrolone, both anabolic steroids. Angle responded on his official website: [...] "I did not improperly receive prescriptions. It is well documented that in my career I have broken vertebrae in my neck on five occasions and each time the course of treatment was under the care and supervision of my doctors. Any attempt to link me to the athletes in the <b>current</b> <b>news</b> accounts who may have improperly sought performance-enhancing drugs is without foundation".|$|E

500|$|Jack Rosenthal of The New York Times {{says that}} Flocabulary is [...] "one {{example of how}} Web sites have latched onto {{mnemonics}} as ways to teach SAT words to high-school students." [...] In November 2014, Entrepreneur.com reporter Laura Entis called a video about credit cards in Flocabulary’s financial literacy series “direct, clear and insanely catchy.” Common Sense Media notes that, [...] "One of Flocabulary's best qualities is that the songs sound like real rap songs, not an embarrassing facsimile that's obviously for educational purposes. The backing beats and samples are catchy and memorable, and videos contain a fun combo of stock footage, original animation, and, for The Week in Rap, <b>current</b> <b>news</b> clips." [...] In the book Slam School: Learning Through Conflict in the Hip-Hop and Spoken Word Classroom Bronwen Low, while praising Flocabulary and similar programs for incorporating hip hop into American schools, argues that Flocabulary is culturally inauthentic and refers to Flocabulary's methods as a gimmick. Similarly, while the book The Anthology of Rap supports Shakespeare Is Hip Hop as an [...] "effective and entertaining [...] ", the author said Flocabulary failed to [...] "illuminate rap's distinct poetic tradition." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{still at}} Hayden, Stone, Kennedy had boasted to a colleague, [...] "Look at that bunch of pants pressers in Hollywood making {{themselves}} millionaires. I {{could take the}} whole business away from them." [...] In 1925, {{he set out to}} do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including Filene's department store owner Louis Kirstein and Union Stockyards and Armour and Company owner Frederick H. Prince. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million. The bid was initially rejected, but in February 1926, FBO's owners decided to take the money. In short order, Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business. He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation. By March, he was traveling to Hollywood. The president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, Will Hays, was delighted by the new face on the scene—in Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and Wall Street's faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as [...] "exceedingly American" [...] (historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation: [...] "not Jewish," [...] in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's [...] "background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the <b>current</b> <b>news</b> from Hollywood." ...|$|E
