40|$|Abstract. An {{integrated}} sensor method {{is used to}} measure interfacial temperature profiles with an ultrasonic friction test process. The profiles are compared to numerical results obtained by a transient thermal 2 D axisymmetric finite elements (FE) analysis. In the experiments, the 50 µm diameter gold balls used in wire bonding are deformed by the <b>capillary</b> <b>tool</b> during impacting on the flat surface of a silicon chip (contact zone). The deformed balls then are pressed onto the SiO 2 layer on the chip and vibrated with various amplitudes of 128 kHz ultrasonics. The 52 µm diameter contact zone is surrounded in 14 µm distance by a 50 Ω aluminum resistor which {{is used as a}} resistive temperature detector. Temperature increases of typically 0. 18 K and up to 0. 3 K are measured by the sensor close to the heat source at the contact zone, corresponding to 3. 1 K and 5. 2 K at the interface as suggested by the FE model. With typical bonding parameters, the contact zone friction power is determined to be 4. 4 mW which is less than 2 % of the electrical energy delivered to the used ultrasonic transducer type...|$|E
40|$|Cu-to-Cu {{wire bonding}} {{provides}} benefits both from economical and from electrical point of view. However, since Cu is harder than Al or Au, {{it is expected}} to induce higher mechanical stresses in the substrate and more bonding problems during and/or after wire bonding. There are three steps during bonding: bond forming, ultrasonic vibration, and cooling down. In order to understand their physical nature, different techniques are applied. The bond forming process is simulated using finite element analysis (FEA) and the stress generated at the last stage (when the wire ball reaches its final shape) is presented. The grain distortion in the Cu wire bond after bonding is studied using scanning electron microscopy and orientation imaging microscopy. After ultrasonic vibration, the whole structure cools down. Due to the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between Cu and Si, extra stress is built up. The final residual stress is measured by Raman spectroscopy. The result is compared with FEA and an excellent agreement has been achieved. The impact on the substrate by the <b>capillary</b> <b>tool</b> is clearly shown. The result also shows that the maximum tensile stress in the substrate is located {{near the edge of the}} pad and depends highly on the positioning of the wire bond. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to improve the}} {{understanding}} of the stitch bonding process in microelectronic wire bonding. In particular, it focuses on investigating the effect of the process parameters bonding force, scrub amplitude, and skid on experimental bond quality responses, including qualitative (non-sticking, sticking, and tail-lifting) and quantitative (stitch pull force, tail pull force). In addition to the experimental work, a finite element (FE) model is developed for the stitch bonding process using ABAQUS software, and compared with the experimental observations. For the first set of experiments, the stitch bonding is performed with a 18 μm diameter Pd coated Cu (PCC) wire on a “low bondability” Au/Ni/Pd plated quad-flat non-lead (QFN) substrate. Results showed that a high bonding force, a high scrub amplitude, and a positive skid provoke the sticking of the stitch bond and reducing the chance of non-sticking observation. However, such parameters also increase the chance of tail-lifting. As a trade-off for a low bondability substrate, a process parameter combination containing a high bonding force and a high scrub amplitude and a negative skid could ensure a strong enough stitch bonding process with low chance of tail-lifting. For the second set of experiments, the stitch bonding is performed with a 18 μm diameter uncoated Cu wire on a “high bondability” Ag plated QFN substrate. Statistical analysis of stitch and tail pull force showed that the skid and scrub parameters have a more significant influence than bonding force. A positive skid can degrade the stitch pull force, while enhancing the tail pull force. A high scrub amplitude is found to degrade both the stitch and the tail pull forces. The bonding force is shown to improve the stitch and tail pull forces slightly. Performing an optimization, process parameters of 70 gf (687 mN) bonding force, 3 μm scrub amplitude, and zero skid result in acceptable stitch and tail pull forces, along with a reliable stitch bond appearance (low peeling and shallow <b>capillary</b> <b>tool</b> impression). The influence of the process parameters is significantly different depending on if bonding on low or high bondability substrates. For example, a positive skid increases the chances of sticking and tail-lifting on low bondability substrate, but it decreases the tail pull force and increases the tail pull force for high bondability substrate. This indicates that finding a general experimental rule for understanding the effect of process parameters on the stitch bond quality is difficult if not impossible. In other words, instead of general rule, it is more likely to find individual rules for specific individual applications. To improve the understanding of stitch bonding a three dimensional (3 D) dynamic explicit FE model is developed in ABAQUS. The model components and boundary conditions are constructed and applied to reflect the experimental conditions. The bonding force, scrub, and skid are successfully implemented into the model. Mass scaling is applied carefully to save calculation time while ensuring there are no artificial effects of inertia. The model is able to render the conventional responses reported in the past including stress and strain distributions. However, these conventional outputs were not sufficient to provide a correlation between model and experiment. Therefore, new candidate responses were developed and extracted from the numerical results. The new responses are based on accepted welding mechanisms. One of the mechanisms is interfacial cleaning by frictional energy which is beneficial for bonding. Thus the friction energy accumulated during the simulated bond duration is extracted as a candidate response. For classical cold welding processes, the interfacial surface expansion is a key mechanism, as it opens up cracks in the surface contamination and oxide layers and thereby generates paths to bring the fresh metals together under pressure. Therefore, candidate responses related to surface expansion at the contact interface are extracted from the model. The complete set of new responses extracted from the numerical model includes contact areas, surface expansion per areas, frictional energy, and combination of frictional energy combined with surface expansions per areas. In addition the bond interface is divided into “wedge” and “tail” regions. The model is run for the same DOE cells as used in the first set of experiments and candidate responses are extracted and compared with the experimental observations. By ranking the correlation coefficients of each individual candidate responses, for the first time correlations that are relatively strong are found between a numerical response and experimental observations of stitch bonding. Responses that have correlation coefficients of 0. 79 and 0. 85 were found for wedge sticking and tail-lifting, respectively. Such relatively strong correlation indicates that the friction enhanced cleaning and the surface expansion mechanisms are proper theories for the current stitch bonding system. These theories can be used for developing similar models for other types of the solid-state bonding processes. Based on the best candidate responses, a procedure to determine numerical process windows is demonstrated for a specific application. Such a window defines the parameter ranges which result in an acceptable stitch bonding process and is an excellent indication of how suitable a process is for mass production. Depending on the application, materials, geometries, and tools, the FE model and process window procedure allow a variety of numerical process windows to be produced and compared. 1 yea...|$|E

Isolates were collected from diarrheic preweaned calves originating from 61 dairy cattle farms in northern Spain. A <b>capillary</b> electrophoresis-based <b>tool</b> combining three different fluorescent tags was used to analyze all six satellites in one capillary. Fragment sizes were adjusted after comparison with sizes obtained by sequence analysis of a selection of isolates for every allele. Size discrepancies at all but the 5 B 12 locus were found for those isolates that were typed by both techniques, although identical size differences were reported for every allele within each locus. A total of eight alleles were seen at the ML 2 marker, which contributed the most to the discriminatory power of the multilocus approach. Multilocus fragment typing clearly improved the discriminatory power of GP 60 sequencing, since a total of 59 multilocus subtypes were identified based on the combination of alleles at the six satellite loci, {{in contrast to the}} 7 GP 60 subtypes previously reported. The majority of farms (38) displayed a unique multilocus subtype, and individual isolates with mixed multilocus subtypes were seen at 22 farms.

40|$|The {{trend towards}} high {{throughput}} applications and miniaturization necessitates approaches capable of microlitre volume sampling and low protein concentration detection. Furthermore, {{one of the}} major trends in high throughput screening is the growing replacement of technologies that depend on radioactivity to generate a signal with those that rely on fluorescence. This trend towards non-radioactive detection in general can be understood by some of the advantages inherent to these methods over radioactive modes. These include a significant reduction in safety concerns leading to a relaxation of strict laboratory procedures, elimination of expensive waste disposal, extended shelf-life of labeled reagents, and the possibility of acquiring multiplexed data through the spectral isolation of different wavelength signals. A variety of capillary electrophoretic (CE) approaches utilizing laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) have thus been developed, providing researchers with valuable tools in protein analysis. Various covalent and non-covalent fluorescent derivatization approaches have been investigated, with emphasis on biochemical and/or clinical applications. The non-covalent dye, NanoOrange, is used as a clinical diagnostic tool for early disease diagnosis, quantitating nanomolar concentrations of human serum albumin in solution, and obtaining fluorescence-based biofluid profiles. An alternate non-covalent labeling approach utilizing the fluorescent probe, Sypro Red, and capillary gel electrophoresis allows for rapid, sensitive analysis of protein sample purity as well as molecular weight determination. These two non-covalent approaches are complemented by the development of a fluorescent Insulin-Like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) analog for use in bioanalytical applications. Specific derivatization reaction conditions were developed to selectively label the N-terminus of the analog hence preserve biological activity. High-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry were used to confirm the extent of labeling and modification site. Antibody recognition of this fluorescent analog was evaluated using CE-LIF, illustrating the clinical utility of this diagnostic reagent. In addition to the above CE-LIF approaches, a fourth <b>capillary</b> electrophoretic <b>tool</b> is provided for the clinical chemist. Rapid analysis of biofluids is of significant importance in early disease diagnosis. As such, an extensive CE-based analysis of human seminal plasma is presented. Separation conditions, sample stability, and protein/non-protein zone identification issues are addressed.

By using an EDTA ligand competition method, a bi-modal species distribution of LnEDTA and LnHS is attained, separated by CE, and detected online by sector field ICP-MS. We quantified the binding of all 14 rare earth elements (REEs), Sc and Y with Suwannee river fulvic acid, Leonardite coal humic acid, and Elliot soil humic acid under environmental conditions (pH 6 9, 0. 001 0. 1 mol L? 1 NaNO 3, 1 1000 nmol L? 1 Ln, 10 20 mg L? 1 HS). Conditional binding constants for REE HS interaction (Kc) ranged from 8. 9 < log Kc < 16. 5 under all experimental conditions, and display a lanthanide contraction effect, ?LKc: a gradual increase in Kc from La to Lu by 2 3 orders of magnitude {{as a function of}} decreasing ionic radius. HS polyelectrolyte effects cause Kc to increase with increasing pH and decreasing ionic strength. ?LKc increases significantly with increasing pH, and likely with decreasing ionic strength. Based on a strong correlation between ?LKc values and denticity for organic acids, we suggest that HS form a range of tri- to tetra-dentate complexes under environmental conditions. These results confirm HS to be a strong complexing agent for Ln, and show rigorous experimental evidence for potential REE fractionation by HS complexation...|$|R

40|$|The {{number and}} {{diversity}} of microaerophilic bacteria in nature has been underappreciated {{in part because of}} the challenges of isolation. Capillary assays for aerotaxis in microaerophiles have played a central part of chemotaxis research. This study evaluates the efficacy of <b>capillaries</b> as a <b>tool</b> for microaerophile enrichment and isolation using cultivation dependent and independent methods. Direct plating of capillary samples versus underlying microbial mat liquid with which capillaries were loaded (control) showed no difference in the percentage of total cells able to form colonies under 2 % O 2 on SWC rich media plates after 5 days. Colonies were also tested for their ability to grow under normal atmopheric O 2. Colonies picked on day 2 from both capillary and control plates grew up overnight under 21 % O 2 but day 5 colonies took at least 3 days to become visible. 16 S rDNA analysis of colonies showed that most colonies from control plates were Marinobacterium species whereas most of the colonies from capillary plates were Roseobacter-like. The closest pure cultured relative in 16 S rDNA databases shared only 96 % sequence identity (by BLASTn analysis) with this study’s Roseobacter isolates, suggesting that new species of Roseobacter have been isolated using capillary techniques that select for microaerophilic behavior and that aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs may prefer microaerophilic conditions. Cultivation independent 16 S rDNA analysis revealed an enrichment of phylotypes closely associated with known microaerophiles such as Thiomicrospira, Hydrogenovibrio, and Arcobacter species in capillary tubes whereas phylotypes from control samples grouped within the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroidetes group characterized by ability to degrade complex polysaccharides...|$|R
