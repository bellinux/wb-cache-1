Subjects and methods. Forty - six interns and residents took a simulation course of training in basic CPR and automatic external defibrillation. Three - {{four days before the}} course, its participants received the <b>certified</b> <b>translation</b> of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) information material and studied it. The course education program encompasses lectures, lessons on a medical care algorithm in sudden cardiac arrest, and practical works using models, including chest compression, ventilation, and automatic external defibrillator (AED) training. The duration of the course is 6 — 7 hours. Results. All the interns and residents were motivated to learn: to acquire first aid skills to manage sudden cardiac arrest. The ERC algorithm and a 4 - stepped model to have practical skills were used. The taken course met expectations in 100 % of the participants; all the interns and residents adequately acquired practical CPR skills and successfully completed their training. A questionnaire survey {{at the end of the}} course showed the high efficiency of the course.

40|$|International audienceTemplate-Coq is a plugin for Coq, {{originally}} {{implemented by}} Malecha, {{which provides a}} reifier for Coq terms and global declarations, as represented in the Coq kernel, {{as well as a}} denotation command. Initially, it was developed for the purpose of writing functions on Coq's AST in Gallina. Recently, its use was extended for the needs of the CertiCoq certified compiler project, which uses it as its front-end language and to derive parametricity properties, and the work of Forster on extracting Coq terms to a CBV λ-calculus. However, the syntax currently lacks semantics, be it typing semantics or operational semantics, which should reflect, as formal specifications in Coq, the semantics of Coq itself. This is an issue for CertiCoq where both a non-deterministic small step semantics and a deterministic call-by-value big step semantics had to be defined and preserved, without an " official " reference specification to refer to. Our hope with this work is to remedy this situation and provide a formal semantics of Coq's implemented type theory, that can independently be refined and studied. By implementing a (partial) independent checker in Coq, we can also help formalize <b>certified</b> <b>translations</b> from Coq to Coq...|$|R

Studies in English, French, German, Spanish and, to a limited extent, Italian and Russian are offered by the two business schools as full-time programs. The present training structure for these languages is three years for the bachelor’s degree and another two years for the master’s degree – the last two years being devoted to specialization in core subjects such as legal language, technical language, economics, accounting, banking and finance and interpretation skills both into and from Danish. Authorization is granted to these candidates after they have obtained the degree of cand. ling. merc.

40|$|Purpose: The Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), {{including}} the PG-SGA Short Form (SF, aka ‘abridged’), was originally {{developed in the}} mid 1990 ’s as a scored, patient self-report, paperbased instrument and has been widely validated. The PG-SGA (SF) {{has been used for}} screening, assessment and monitoring, triageing for multimodal intervention and for evaluation of clinical and health economic outcomes. There have been ad hoc translations, often with permission of the originator (FDO) but broad international use requires consistent, medically accurate, and <b>certified</b> <b>translations.</b> Although the PG-SGA (or SF) is known to be quick and easy, current advances in technology could further improve and facilitate quick and easy use of global patient screening and assessment, standardized scoring algorithms, limiting inter-observer variability, and global collaboration and communication. We aimed to develop a user friendly, cross-culturally validated, multilingual digital app and resources to support the clinical and research applications of the PG-SGA (SF) and Pt-Global app {{in the context of a}} global centralized database and research consortium. Methods: After completion of a Dutch PG-SGA cross-cultural adaptation project, a digital app based on the English and Dutch PG-SGA was developed. Steps included: 1) development and testing of standardized scoring and decision-making algorithms based on the validated PG-SGA scoring system; 2) compatibility with iOS, Android and WindowsPhone platforms; 3) development and pilot testing of prototype by an international test panel (n= 35; professionals testing the app on patients as part of routine care process, researchers, and lay persons) from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands and USA, evaluating the app on lay-out, user friendliness, relevance and time of completion; 4) improvement based on input; 5) launch of app and supportive website at www. pt-global. org on 12 Jun 2014, including complimentary introductory use; 5) international education activities; 6) digital presence through Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube; 7) launch of web-based version on 15 September 2014. Results: 15 professionals (Pros; 11 dietitians, 1 doctor, 1 physiotherapist) and 2 lay persons participated in the pilot testing. Included settings were: 9 hospitals, 4 cancer centers, 2 nursing homes, 3 research. 8 / 15 had experience with the PG-SGA, 7 / 15 PG-SGA were naïve. 5 Pros tested on 1 - 5 patients, and 9 on 6 - 10 patients. 88 % rated layout (very) good with feedback: calm, professional, clear, intuitive, easy; 88 % rated good for user friendliness. 75 % rated flow/user interface (very) good. In 88 % Patient screens were completed by Pros. Reported time to complete Patient screens was: 65 % in 0 - 5 minutes, 29 % in 5 - 10 min; 6 % (n= 1) > 10 minutes.

40|$|Background/Aim. As {{lung cancer}} is {{considered}} the greatest contributor to death among all cancer types any help might be valuable {{in the assessment of}} treatment effects. The aim of this study was for assess the quality of life (QoL) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with gemcitabine- cisplatin regimen as the first line of chemotherapy. Methods. The QoL was assessed using <b>certified</b> Serbian <b>translations</b> of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C 30) and Lung Cancer Module (QLQ-LC 13) - version 3. The questionnaire was used before starting treatment and after the completion of the 2 nd and the 4 th cycle of chemotherapy. The questionnaire scales and single items were compared in order {{to assess the impact of}} treatment on the QoL. Results. A total of 60 patients started and 51 completed all questionnaires. There were no changes in the global health status score between the baseline, the 2 nd and the 4 th cycle of chemotherapy (42. 78 ± 15. 76, 45. 56 ± 17. 59, 48. 20 ± 19. 24, respectively; p = 0. 1). Social function score, symptom scores: nausea and vomiting, pain, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties score differed significantly among chemotherapy cycles, indicating improved or worsened the QoL. In the lung cancer symptom score a significant difference between measurements was observed in cough, alopecia, chest pain and in using analgesics. Conclusion. Monitoring of changes in the QoL among patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC showed that chemotherapy did not decrease the global health status but led to significant changes in the social and financial functioning of patients. Some symptoms associated with the disease reduced in the intensity but some new occurred as a result of chemotherapy. Using questionnaires to assess the QoL helped in easier identification of adverse effects and specific problems for adequate treatment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe multilingualization of Web {{sites with}} high quality is {{increasingly}} important, but is unsolvable in most situations where internal quality certification is needed, and not solved {{in the majority}} of other situations. We demonstrate it by analyzing a variety of techniques to make the underlying software easily localizable and to manage the translation of textual content in the classical internal mode, that is by modifying the language-dependent resources. A new idea is that volunteer final users should be able to contribute to the improvement oreven production of translated resources and content. For this, we have developed a PHP piece of code which naive webmasters (not computer scientists nor professional translators) can add to a Web site to enable internal multilingualization by users with enough access rights: in management mode, these users can edit the texts of titles, button labels, messages, etc. in text areas appearing in context in the Web page. If Web site developers follow some recommendations, all textual interface elements should be localizable in this way. Another angle of attack, applicable in all cases where navigating a site though a gateway is possible, consists in replacing the problem of diffusion by the problem of access in multiple lang uages. We introduce the concept of iMAG (interactive Multilingual Access Gateway, dedicated to a Web site or domain) {{to solve the problem of}} higher quality multilingual access. First, by using available MT systems or by default morphological processors and bilingual dictionaries, any page of an elected website is made instantly accessible in many languages, with a generally low quality profile, as through usual translation gateways. Over time, the quality profile of textual GUI elements, Web pages and even documents (if accessible in html) will improve thanks to outside contributors, who will post-edit or produce the translations from the reading context. This is only possible because the iMAG associated to the website stores the translations in its translation memory (TM) and the contributed dictionary items it its dictionary. The TM has quality levels, according to the users' profiles, and scores within levels. An API will be proposed so that the developers of the elected website can connect their to its iMAG, retrieve the best level <b>translations,</b> <b>certify</b> them if necessary, and put them in their localized resources. At that point, external localization meets internal localization...|$|R
