An instrument has been developed that assesses the suitability of a blasted surface for subsequent spraying by measuring the reflectivity and has proved reasonably successful under laboratory conditions. The present need is to ascertain the performance of this reflectivity meter under shop and site conditions. The opportunity to carry out such tests at H. M.

40|$|Immobilization {{of heavy}} metals by {{stabilization}} amendments is a promising method to restore contaminated soils. In our study, we investigated {{the efficiency of}} zero-valent iron (Fe 0) added to the soil {{in the form of}} <b>iron</b> <b>grit</b> to reduce leaching and uptake of Zn and Cd by Lupinus albus L. Results of column leaching experiments show that metal leaching decreased proportionally to the rate of amendment application (1 %, 2 % or 5 %: w/w) and that the reduction reached up to 98 % and 83 % for Zn and Cd respectively. An increase in pH and in the number of sorption sites which bind ionic free metals and organometal complexes are possible mechanisms for this attenuation. Moreover, a rhizobox experiment has demonstrated that phytoavailability of Zn and Cd was reduced by 63 % and 45 % respectively when soil was treated with 5 % (w/w) <b>iron</b> <b>grit,</b> and that L. albus did not develop strategies to reduce Zn and Cd uptake in untreated soil. We conclude that covering contaminated soil with L. albus could be used in association with immobilization techniques for soil remediation.

40|$|The {{combination}} of revegetation {{and application of}} stabilizing soil amendments on heavy metal-contaminated soils is {{generally considered to be}} a promising alternative to expensive classical remediation techniques. Here, we simultaneously investigated the effects of six cost-effective amendments (CaCO 3, <b>iron</b> <b>grit,</b> fly ash, manure, bentonite and bone meal) on Cd, Zn and Pb leaching and phytoavailability (assessed using white lupin, Lupinus albus L.). The Cd and Zn leaching was reduced by all amendments mainly due to alkalinity increase. The Pb leaching was strongly affected by the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release. Therefore, bone meal and manure treatments, which highly increased DOC concentrations in leachates, increased the flow-weighted mean Pb concentrations by 2. 3 and 16 times, respectively. Surprisingly, while <b>iron</b> <b>grit</b> induced strong Cd and Pb leaching reductions, this amendment doubled Cd and Pb concentrations in shoots of white lupin. Conversely, the addition of bone meal reduced Pb concentrations in shoots by 74 %, probably because organo-Pb complexes (predicted using Visual MINTEQ) were largely dominant in solution. Overall, the addition of CaCO 3 offered the best compromise as it successfully reduced both the leaching and the phytoavailability of the three considered metals. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of several amendments while stressing the need to measure simultaneously the leaching and the phytoavailability of metals induced by each amendment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} {{a surface}} modification technique {{to evaluate the}} mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance of cast Iron surface used in engineering. Basic sand casting mold was used and a portion of {{it was designed to}} accommodate the external mild steel chill (MSC). Chill accelerates the cooling rate of molten metal which leads to directional solidification. Cooling rate is directly proportional to formation of carbides in the form of iron carbide (Fe 3 C) near the chill end By controlling the flow of liquid nitrogen, the temperature of chills was reduced (upto - 100 °C). Effect of using chills on mechanical properties like hardness and sliding wear resistance was evaluated and analyzed. The present work provides the effective chilling thickness, which gives higher hardness near the chilled surface and a fairly appreciable hardness conducive for a specific wear functional requirement.
