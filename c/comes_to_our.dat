When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> eyes. This effect is called Rayleigh scattering, after Lord Rayleigh, the British physicist who discovered it. It was confirmed by Albert Einstein in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Gandhi criticised {{as well as}} praised Christianity. He was {{critical}} of Christian missionary efforts in British India, because they mixed medical or education assistance with demands that the beneficiary convert to Christianity. According to Gandhi, this was not true [...] "service" [...] but one driven by ulterior motive of luring people into religious conversion and exploiting the economically or medically desperate. It {{did not lead to}} inner transformation or moral advance or to the Christian teaching of [...] "love", but was based on false one-sided criticisms of other religions, when Christian societies faced similar problems in South Africa and Europe. It led to the converted person hating his neighbours and others religions, it divided people rather than bringing them closer in compassion. According to Gandhi, [...] "no religious tradition could claim a monopoly over truth or salvation". Gandhi did not support laws to prohibit missionary activity, but demanded that Christians should first understand the message of Jesus, and then strive to live without stereotyping and misrepresenting other religions. According to Gandhi, the message of Jesus wasn't to humiliate and imperialistically rule over other people considering them inferior or second class or slaves, but that [...] "when the hungry are fed and peace <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> individual and collective life, then Christ is born".|$|E

2500|$|On October 13, 2017, Humble Bundle {{announced}} it was acquired by IGN, a division of Ziff Davis Media. Humble Bundle will continue to operate as a separate entity within IGN, {{and according to the}} company, there are no plans to change their current business approach in the short-term. Instead, they see [...] "a lot of opportunities" [...] for the customer bases of both companies, according to Humble Bundle founder John Graham. [...] Graham said that the acquisition by IGN enables them to continue to do the same sales and charity promotions [...] "faster and better" [...] with IGN's resources backing them. IGN's executive vice president Mitch Galbraith said that they felt Humble Bundle was a [...] "great fit" [...] for IGN, and would also help IGN to [...] "give something back" [...] by supporting its charitable drives. As IGN publishes news and reviews of video games, Galbraith responded to several concerns about conflicts of interest, saying that they [...] "will strike the right balance when it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> coverage of Humble Bundle and the games they sell" [...] {{as a result of the}} acquisition. Among steps to avoid conflicts, Galbraith said that they will keep a firm separation between the IGN editorial staff and Humble Bundle, and will implement policies to report disclosure of ownership when IGN reports on games featured on Humble Bundle's store or promotions.|$|E
2500|$|From early on, Urechia was defended against {{criticism}} {{by people who}} shared his views. In his speech to commemorate the writer's death, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu claimed: [...] "As an agitator for the benefit and growth of the Romanian nation, Urechia was sublime; no one shall replace him, nothing shall be able to shadow him when it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> national history, in which he will endure as an archangel of enthusiasm {{in the memory of}} all Romanians". According to cultural historian Ovidiu Pecican, Hasdeu, with political support from National Liberal leader Ion Brătianu, managed to impose a nationalist cultural model to compete with Junimea, thus ensuring that both Urechia and his rival Şăineanu, alongside George Dem. Teodorescu, Grigore Tocilescu, George Ionescu-Gion, Alexandru Vlahuţă and other Bucharest-based figures, addressed an alternative and autonomous milieu. Partly building on the observations made by literary critic Alexandru George, Z. Ornea notes that, for all his [...] "real inadequacies", Urechia [...] "was but moreover became incontestably superior to many members of [...] who were much amused when reading Maiorescu's admirable lampoon." [...] Ornea also concluded that, with his final historical works, particularly Istoria şcoalelor, Urechia contributed texts [...] "relevant to this day". Although Maiorescu's early treatment of Urechia's work left an enduring impact on his public image, the author came to be viewed with more sympathy during the 20th century. Among the influential monographs which reclaimed part of his writings was one published by Alexandru George in 1976. According to Ornea, it and other such works [...] "reclaim a fairer and more lenient posterity." [...] Urechia's work as a teacher and cultural promoter also reflected on intellectual life: dramatist Alexandru Davila was one of the V. A. Urechia Institute graduates, and, according to Tudor Vianu, Urechia's post-1870s support for Macedonski, together with similar efforts by Ionescu-Gion, Tocilescu, Anghel Demetriescu, Bonifaciu Florescu, Th. M. Stoenescu, was largely responsible for passing down [...] "a better and truer image of the abused poet." ...|$|E
