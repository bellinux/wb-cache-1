40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a semantic model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> and investigates its {{applications for the}} analysis and design <b>of</b> programming languages. <b>Inheritance</b> is a mechanism for incremental programming {{in the presence of}} self-reference. This interpretation <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> is formalized using traditional techniques of fixed-point theory, resulting in a compositional model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> that is directly applicable to object-oriented languages. Novel applications <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> revealed by the model are illustrated to show that inheritance has wider significance beyond object-oriented class inheritance. Constraints induced by self-reference and inheritance are investigated using type theory and yield a formal characterization of abstract classes and a demonstration that the subtype relation is a direct consequence of the basic mechanism <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> The model is proven equivalent to the operational semantics <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> embodied by the interpreters of object-oriented languages like Smalltalk. Concise descriptions <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> behavior in several object-oriented languages, including Smalltalk, Beta, Simula, and Flavors, are presented in a common framework that facilitates direct comparison of their features...|$|R

40|$|Sunni and Shia laws <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> are {{different}} in their foundational structure as well as detailed implications, though the both are inspired from the Quranic verses <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Owing {{to the fact that}} Sunnis are in majority in Pakistan, their law <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> is relatively well appreciated by lawyers and students of law, while Shia law <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> does not have such an advantage. The paper aims to present in a simplified manner the salient features of Shia law <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> so that the same may become comprehensible to anyone who is new to this field but interested to develop his skills further. The paper does not explain Sunni law <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> in detail and assumes that the reader would be conversant with it. While explaining the salient features of Shia law, it compares them with corresponding features of Sunni law. The paper illustrates how these features are instrumental in conferring different shares to legal heirs in Shia and Sunni schemes <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> There is also an elaboration of the space which is shared by the both legally different traditions <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> in Islam...|$|R

40|$|In [Touretzky et al., 1987] and [Selman and Levesque, 1989], a brief {{comparison}} between upward and downward view <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> reasoning is given. In this paper, we review the evolution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> networks, and analyze systematically, the downward (property flow) and upward (individual flow) views <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> for different categories of networks. We observe that both these views assign the same meaning to tree-structured hierarchies, {{and explain the}} divergence in the interpretation <b>of</b> more general <b>inheritance</b> networks {{in terms of their}} expressive power.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use HMRC estate {{statistics}} and micro-data from four UK household surveys to examine {{changes in the}} size, the composition {{and the distribution of}} inherited wealth in the UK over the period 1985 - 2010. Our findings indicate that the period under examination is characterised by a substantial increase in the flow <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> This increase, which was particularly marked in the early 2000 s, was mainly driven by the rise in house prices {{and to a lesser extent}} by the increase in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>inheritances</b> which included housing assets. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> amongst recipients became more unequal over this period. However, the inequality-increasing effect from the greater dispersion in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> was counterbalanced by the increase in the percentage of the population who received an inheritance, resulting in a small decrease in the inequality <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> for the population overall. Analysis of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> by socio-economic status suggests a positive association between inheritance and socio-economic status with some suggestive evidence that this association might have strengthened over time. Overall, however, the value <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> for most people is rather small and the differences across groups rather moderate...|$|R
