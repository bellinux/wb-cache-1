5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to <b>calcification</b> which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. <b>Calcification</b> of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential <b>calcification</b> is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{the theory}} that temnospondyls were the {{ancestors}} of all lissamphibians has gained wide support. The skull morphology of some small temnospondyls {{has been compared to}} those of modern frogs and salamanders, but the presence of bicuspid, pedicellate teeth in small, paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians. Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls, pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases. During the development of most tetrapods, teeth begin to calcify at their tips. <b>Calcification</b> normally proceeds downward {{to the base of the}} tooth, but <b>calcification</b> from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth. <b>Calcification</b> resumes at the base, leaving an area in the center of the tooth uncalcified. This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is unknown}} whether if a plain X-ray of the iliac arteries (pelvic X-ray) is a {{reliable}} tool to detect <b>calcifications</b> and predict vascular complications. METHODS: In a prospective study, a pelvic X-ray was performed before transplantation in patients without evidence of peripheral vascular disease (n = 109) and vascular <b>calcifications</b> were scored. Vascular <b>calcifications</b> in the iliac arteries and complications were scored by the transplant surgeon during the operation (gold standard). RESULTS: Vascular <b>calcifications</b> {{were found on}} the pelvic X-ray in 33 patients (30. 2 %). The transplant surgeon identified vascular <b>calcifications</b> in 35 %. Sensitivity and specificity of the pelvic X-ray for vascular <b>calcifications</b> in the iliac arteries were 48 and 82 %, respectively. Technical problems with the arterial anastomosis due to vascular <b>calcifications</b> were observed in five patients. The negative predictive value and positive predictive value of a pelvic X-ray for complications with the arterial anastomosis were 99 and 14 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A pelvic X-ray is not a reliable tool to detect vascular <b>calcifications.</b> Technical problems with the arterial anastomosis due to <b>calcifications</b> are infrequent in the absence of vascular <b>calcifications</b> on the pelvic X-ray...|$|R
5|$|The 1952 {{classification}} by French zoologist J.

Therefore, diverse patterns of <b>calcification</b> centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony <b>calcification</b> on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis.

The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue <b>calcification,</b> which can lead to serious consequences: for example, <b>calcification</b> of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{concerns}} of long-term adverse side effects such as <b>calcification</b> of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Calcifications</b> of the pineal, habenula, choroid plexus, and dura {{are often}} physiologic. In the modern CT era with thin-section images and multiplanar reformats, {{intracranial}} <b>calcifications</b> {{have become more}} conspicuous. We aimed to discover the CT prevalence of pineal region, choroid plexus, and dural <b>calcifications</b> {{in the first decade}} of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred head CTs from different patients (age range, 0 – 9 years) encountered during a consecutive 6 -month period at a single academic children’s hospital were reviewed retrospectively after excluding examinations with artifacts and pineal region masses/hemorrhage. All studies were performed on a 320 -detector CT, with 0. 5 -mm collimation and a 512 512 matrix. Five-millimeter reformatted axial, sagittal, and coronal images were analyzed for location and extent of intracranial <b>calcifications.</b> RESULTS: Themean agewas 3. 5 5. 7 years (range, 0 – 9 years). There were 285 males (57 %) and 215 females (43 %). Pineal <b>calcifications</b> were present in 5 % (n 25; age range, 3. 2 – 8. 9 years; median, 7 years). Habenular <b>calcifications</b> were found in 10 % (n 50; age range, 2. 8 – 8. 8 years; median, 7 years). Twelve percent (n 58) had choroid plexus <b>calcifications,</b> (age range, 0. 1 – 8. 8 years). Dural <b>calcifications</b> were rare, present in 1 % (n 6; age range, 2. 9 – 8. 7 years). CONCLUSIONS: Physiologic intracranial <b>calcifications</b> may be found in the first decade, principally in children older than 5 years. Most epithalamic <b>calcifications</b> are habenular. Pineal and habenular <b>calcifications</b> were never present in children younger than 3 and 2 years, respectively. Choroid plexus <b>calcifications</b> may be present in the very young. Dural <b>calcifications</b> are rare...|$|R

30|$|Two {{categories}} of <b>calcifications</b> are recognised: dystrophic and metabolic (also termed metastatic) [1]. Dystrophic <b>calcifications</b> occur in necrotic or damaged tissue with normal serum levels of calcium and may progress to ossification.

5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased <b>calcification</b> due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic <b>calcification,</b> difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E

5|$|Rivera rebounded in 2008 {{and began}} the year with 16consecutive {{scoreless}} innings pitched and 28consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06ERA and 23saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher {{as a tribute to}} him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on September21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out.

40|$|Introduction: Pulp <b>calcifications</b> are {{relatively}} frequent findings on dental radiographs. They {{may be seen}} in primary, permanent, erupted or unerupted teeth. <b>Calcifications</b> within the pulp are seen in such a frequency that it may be questioned whether their presence represents a pathological state or a mere occurrence of normal biological variation. Aims and Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence of idiopathic pulp <b>calcifications</b> in permanent teeth by using digital orthopantomographs (OPG), and to report any association between the occurrence of pulp <b>calcifications</b> with gender, tooth type, dental arches, and the side of the dental arch. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 digital panoramic radiographs of an equal number of male and female patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were examined. The sample was composed of 150 patients within the age group of 15 - 50 years. Four thousand three hundred and ninety-nine teeth were evaluated and the pulp <b>calcifications</b> were assessed. The frequency of occurrence of pulp <b>calcifications</b> between gender, tooth type, dental arches, and the side of the dental arch were compared. Results: From 150 orthopantomographs (OPGs), a total of 4399 teeth were examined, and the total number of patients with pulp <b>calcifications</b> were 80 (41 females and 39 males). The overall distribution was more in females, in the maxillary arches, and in the first molars. Patients with bilateral pulp <b>calcifications</b> were more than those with unilateral pulp <b>calcifications.</b> Conclusion: The pulp <b>calcifications</b> assessed in this study were of idiopathic origin, as only healthy patients and healthy teeth were included in the study. Most of the pulp <b>calcifications</b> were seen in the young age group. Therefore, pulp <b>calcifications</b> could be a normal biological variation within the pulp...|$|R
