40|$|Despite growing {{interest}} among policymakers, {{there is no}} theory of independent fiscal institutions. The emerging literature on "fiscal councils" typically makes informal parallels with the theory of central bank independence, but a very simple formal example shows that such a shortcut is flawed. The paper then illustrates key features of a model of independent <b>fiscal</b> <b>agencies,</b> {{and in particular the}} need (1) to incorporate the intrinsically political nature of fiscal policy - which precludes credible delegation of instruments to unelected decisionmakers - and (2) to focus on characterizing "commitment technologies" likely to credibly increase <b>fiscal</b> discipline. <b>Central</b> bank autonomy;Budget deficits;Budgetary policy;fiscal policy, inflation, <b>central</b> bank, <b>fiscal</b> institutions, <b>fiscal</b> <b>agencies,</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>agency,</b> <b>fiscal</b> discipline, monetary policy, public debt, fiscal rules, monetary fund, fiscal performance, budget balance, fiscal deficits, public finances, budget deficit, fiscal policy rules, budget constraint, fiscal authority, fiscal council, taxation, national fiscal rules, fiscal transparency, discount rate, fiscal policy decisions, tax revenues, fiscal rule, fiscal affairs department, excessive deficits, monetary target, fiscal affairs, fiscal profligacy, monetary aggregates, fiscal stance, intermediate monetary target, monetary institutions, fiscal frameworks, fiscal contract, budget constraints...|$|R
40|$|A well-organized and {{effective}} finance ministry {{and its associated}} central finance agencies (CFAs) are essential to good fiscal outcomes. Recent studies of CFAs in selected low-income countries demonstrate that their organizational structure varies widely and that decision making on public finance is strongly influenced by political economy factors. This note presents some common themes arising from the case studies and provides some descriptive evidence about the organizational structure of the CFAs. This note also includes evidence of a “U-curve” pattern {{in the development of}} the organizational structure of CFAs over the long term. It confirms that political economy analysis, though difficult to apply in practice, is highly relevant in the development of reform strategies for strengthening CFAs and public financial management systems. finance ministry, <b>central</b> finance <b>agencies,</b> <b>fiscal,</b> public finance, political economy, low-income countries, development, reform, public financial management, World Bank...|$|R
