25|$|One craft {{particular}} {{to the state}} is “pasta de caña,” literally “corn stalk paste.” It is a technique created by the Purépecha to create lightweight images of their gods. After the Conquest, it was then turned to making lightweight Catholic images for use in processions. It is the bundling of inner <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> along with {{the making of a}} paste from the same material, which is then sculpted to the desired image, which when finished, is as smooth as one made of ceramic, but considerably lighter. Today, the craft is mostly practiced in Patzcuaro.|$|E

The state has a wide variety of over thirty crafts, with the most important being the working of wood, ceramics, and textiles.
