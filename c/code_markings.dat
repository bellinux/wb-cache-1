50|$|Some decks include {{additional}} design elements. Casino blackjack decks {{may include}} markings intended for a machine {{to check the}} ranks of cards, or shifts in rank location to allow a manual check via inlaid mirror. Many casino decks and solitaire decks have four indices instead of just two. Many modern decks have bar <b>code</b> <b>markings</b> {{on the edge of}} the face to enable them to be sorted by machine (for playing duplicate bridge, especially simultaneous events where the same hands may be played at many different venues). Many decks have large indices, largely for use in stud poker games, where being able to read cards from a distance is a benefit and hand sizes are small. Some decks use four colors for the suits in order to make it easier to tell them apart: the most common set of colors is black (spades ♠), red (hearts ♥), blue (diamonds ♦) and green (clubs ♣). Another common color set is borrowed from the German suits and uses green spades and yellow diamonds with red hearts and black clubs.|$|E
50|$|To further combat {{infringement}} {{of recorded}} works, the IFPI and the compact disc manufacturing industry introduced Source Identification (SID) codes in 1994. The SID <b>codes</b> are <b>markings</b> on optical discs such as compact discs (CD) and digital versatile discs (DVD) that identify the manufacturer, equipment, and master discs {{used to create}} each disc. There are two codes: the SID mastering code and the SID mould code. The SID mastering code identifies the manufacturing facility used to produce a master from which moulds are produced. The SID mould code identifies the plant where the disc was moulded (replicated). Since not all optical disc manufacturing facilities {{have the ability to}} both produce master discs and replicate discs, the SID mastering code and SID mould code on a given optical disc may or may not represent the same manufacturing facility.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} a framed vertex {{operator}} algebra (FVOA) is new (cf. [DGH]). This article contributes to this theory with a full analysis of all Virasoro frame stabilizers in V, the important example of the E 8 level 1 affine Kac-Moody VOA, which is isomorphic to the lattice VOA for the root lattice of E 8 (C). We analyze the frame stabilizers, both as abstract groups and as subgroups of Aut(V) ∼ = E 8 (C). Each frame stabilizer is a finite group, contained in the normalizer of a 2 B-pure elementary abelian 2 -group in Aut(V), but is not usually a maximal finite subgroup of this normalizer. In particular, we prove that there are exactly five orbits for the action of Aut(V) {{on the set of}} Virasoro frames, thus settling an open question about V in Section 5 of [DGH]. The results about the group structure of the frame stabilizers can be stated purely in terms of modular braided tensor categories, so this article contributes also to this theory. There are two main viewpoints in our analysis. The first is the theory of <b>codes,</b> lattices, <b>markings</b> and the resulting groups of automorphisms. The secon...|$|R
5000|$|The {{bombardment}} group {{moved to}} England in January to February 1944, and {{was assigned to}} Ninth Air Force. It entered combat in March 1944, and during {{the next several weeks}} directed most of its attacks against V-1 and V-2 sites in France. In addition to the assigned <b>code</b> <b>markings</b> assigned to each of its squadrons, the 416th's aircraft were marked with a [...] "white diagonal stripe emanating outwards from the trailing edge of the ... rudder." [...] The 416th flew a number of missions against airfields and coastal defenses to help prepare for the invasion of Normandy. It supported the invasion in June 1944 by striking road junctions, marshalling yard, bridges, and railway overpasses. The group assisted ground forces at Caen and Saint-Lô in July and at Brest later in the summer, by hitting transportation facilities, supply dumps, radar installations, and other targets. In spite of intense resistance, the group bombed bridges, railways, rolling stock, and a radar station to disrupt the enemy's retreat through the Falaise gap, 6-9 August 1944, and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for the missions.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, after crash-landing {{or being}} forced down, {{approximately}} 40 B-17s were captured and refurbished, {{with about a}} dozen put back into the air. Given German Balkenkreuz national markings on their wings and fuselage sides, and [...] "Hakenkreuz" [...] swastika tail fin-flashes, the captured B-17s {{were used to determine}} the B-17's vulnerabilities and to train German interceptor pilots in attack tactics. Others, with the cover designations Dornier Do 200 and Do 288, were used as long-range transports by the Kampfgeschwader 200 special duties unit, carrying out agent drops and supplying secret airstrips in the Middle East and North Africa. They were chosen specifically for these missions as being more suitable for this role than other available German aircraft; they never attempted to deceive the Allies and always wore full Luftwaffe markings. One B-17 of KG200, bearing the Luftwaffe's KG 200 Geschwaderkennung (combat wing <b>code)</b> <b>markings</b> A3+FB, was interned by Spain when it landed at Valencia airfield, 27 June 1944, remaining there {{for the rest of the}} war. It has been alleged that some B-17s kept their Allied markings and were used by the Luftwaffe in attempts to infiltrate B-17 bombing formations and report on their positions and altitudes. According to these allegations, the practice was initially successful, but Army Air Force combat aircrews quickly developed and established standard procedures to first warn off, and then fire upon any [...] "stranger" [...] trying to join a group's formation.|$|E
40|$|Conversion of {{automobiles}} to {{different type of}} fuel involves evaluation of material compatibility of the new fuel and components of the engine and fuel supply system. Automobiles, equipped with a spark ignition gasoline fueled engine, {{can be converted to}} work on gaseous fuels, such as liquefied petrol gas or liquid fuels, such as ethanol/gasoline blend E 85. In case of such conversion, materials in question can be divided in two categories - metallic and polymeric. This study focuses on evaluation of compatibility of the fuel supply system parts made of non-elastomer polymeric and fuel containing up to 85 % of ethanol. Automobile parts which are made of polymeric materials have standardized <b>code</b> <b>markings,</b> required for recycling purposes. The authors propose to use the material <b>code</b> <b>markings</b> to identify the type of polymeric material of the fuel supply system parts.

40|$|NOVELTY - The image spot {{generator}} {{includes a}} rotary deflector (36) {{to which a}} code disc (32) is fixed. The <b>code</b> disc carries <b>markings</b> (41) for producing a correction clock.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A digital exposure apparatus for exposing a straight line using an acousto-optic modulator, and correcting for distortion using the image spot clock generator is also claimed. USE - For exposure of lines on a light sensitive material. ADVANTAGE - The clock generator is compact and requires little adjustment during manufacture or maintenance.
