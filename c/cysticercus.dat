5000|$|<b>Cysticercus</b> was {{discovered}} in the late 17th century CE as a parasitic bladder. It {{was believed to be}} a different organism from the adult tapeworm (Taenia solium), but still closely related to tapeworms for their similarly-looking scolex. Hence, it was given a proper scientific name Taenia cellulosae in 1800 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin. At the same time another German Johann Zeder had created a new genus Cysticercosis for a dog tapeworm. This genus was accepted for all bladder worms of Taenia. It became a tradition to refer to the larva of Taenia solium as <b>Cysticercus</b> cellulosae, that of beef tapeworm (T. sanginata) as <b>Cysticercus</b> bovis, that of sheep tapeworm (T. ovis) as <b>Cysticercus</b> ovis, that of ruminant tapeworm (T. krabbei) as <b>Cysticercus</b> tarandi, and that of the dog tapeworm (T. crassiceps) as <b>Cysticercus</b> longicollis. Even though, this system of naming is now scientifically unacceptable, it is still widely used, particularly for description of the infections by the different species.|$|E

Invasion of muscle by <b>cysticerci</b> can cause myositis, with fever, eosinophilia, and muscular pseudohypertrophy, which initiates with muscle swelling and later progress to atrophy and fibrosis. In most cases, it is asymptomatic since the <b>cysticerci</b> die and become calcified.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cysticerci</b> of Taenia solium {{were exposed}} to gamma {{radiation}} in doses varying from 20 - 140 krad. Radiation had an adverse effect {{on the ability of}} the <b>cysticerci</b> to evaginate in vitro after a time lag of 9 days. This effect was most marked at doses of 100 krad and higher, thus no <b>cysticerci</b> exposed to 140, 120 and 100 krad evaginated after 12, 18 and 21 days, respectively. On Day + 24, when 60 % of the control <b>cysticerci</b> evaginated, 55 %, 50 %, 30 % and 40 % of the <b>cysticerci</b> exposed to 20, 40, 60, and 80 krad, respectively, evaginated in vitro. <b>Cysticerci</b> exposed to radiation doses of 20 - 120 krad are as infective to golden hamsters as are unirradiated <b>cysticerci.</b> Cestodes resulting from irradiated <b>cysticerci,</b> however, cannot maintain themselves indefinitely, and are excreted or digested at varying times from Day + 12 onwards. Moreover, cestodes resulting from such irradiated <b>cysticerci</b> do not grow, but are resorbed, and finally consist of only a scolex. By Day + 30 the mean length of the worms resulting from the unirradiated <b>cysticerci</b> is 173, 8 mm, while those resulting from <b>cysticerci</b> exposed to 20 and 40 krad consist of scolices only and the hamsters fed material exposed to 60 krad were negative. It appears, therefore, that radiation inhibits the ability of the cells in the neck region to divide and thus form new proglottids. Carcasses infested with cysticercosis can possibly be rendered fit for human consumption by exposure to gamma radiation at doses between 20 and 60 krad.

40|$|Background Neurocysticercosis (NCC), {{infection}} of {{the central nervous system}} by Taenia solium cysti-cerci, is a pleomorphic disease. Inflammation around <b>cysticerci</b> is the major cause of dis-ease but is variably present. One factor modulating the inflammatory responses may be the location and characteristics of the brain tissue adjacent to <b>cysticerci.</b> We analyzed and com-pared the inflammatory responses to <b>cysticerci</b> located in the parenchyma to those in the meninges or <b>cysticerci</b> partially in contact with both the parenchyma and the meninges (corticomeningeal). Methodology/Principal Findings Histological specimens of brain <b>cysticerci</b> (n = 196) from 11 pigs naturally infected with Tae-nia solium <b>cysticerci</b> were used. Four pigs were sacrificed after 2 days and four after 5 days of a single dose of praziquantel; 3 pigs did not receive treatment. All pigs were intravenously injected with Evans Blue to assess disruption of the blood-brain barrier. The degree of inflammation was estimated by use of a histological score (ISC) based on the extent of th...|$|R
50|$|Cattle {{acquire the}} embryonated eggs, the oncospheres, when they eat {{contaminated}} food. Oncospheres enter the duodenum, the anterior {{portion of the}} small intestine, and hatch there {{under the influence of}} gastric juices. The embryonic membranes are removed, liberating free hexacanth ("six-hooked") larvae. With their hooks, they attach to the intestinal wall and penetrate the intestinal mucosa into the blood vessels. The larvae can move to all parts of the body by the general circulatory system, and finally settle in skeletal muscles within 70 days. Inside the tissue, they cast off their hooks and instead develop a protective cuticular shell, called the cyst. Thus, they become fluid-filled cysticerci. Cysterci can also form in lungs and liver. The inner membrane of the <b>cysticercus</b> soon develops numerous protoscolices (small scolices) that are invertedly attached to the inner surface. The <b>cysticercus</b> of T. saginata is specifically named <b>cysticercus</b> bovis to differentiate from that of T. solium, <b>cysticercus</b> cellulosae.|$|E

40|$|Development of Taenia saginata asiatica metacestodes in SCID mice, and its {{infectivity}} in humans, golden hamsters, and Mongolian gerbils as alternative definitive hosts, were investigated. <b>Cysticerci</b> {{were recovered}} from SCID mice that were subcutaneously injected with hatched oncospheres of T. s. asiatica.

50|$|Eggs are {{introduced}} into the environment through infected canine feces. In the feces are the gravid proglottids that house the T. pisiformis eggs that will eventually be released form the proglottid onto nearby vegetation. The eggs are then ingested by a rabbit or from {{any member of the}} Leporidae family. Once inside the rabbit's gut the larva or oncosphere phase will then penetrate into the intestinal wall until they reach the blood stream. When the worm reaches the liver the larva transforms into a <b>cysticercus</b> form. This <b>cysticercus</b> will stay in the liver for about two to four weeks, then move to the peritoneal cavity where it will wait for the definitive host to eat the rabbit. The definitive hosts are ether dogs or other members of the Canidae family. Once ingested the <b>cysticercus</b> finds its way into the intestine and attaches to the intestinal wall with hooks and suckers. After the worm has time to develop and grow in size, the gravid proglottids is released from the distal end of the parasite and passed in the feces to start a new cycle.|$|E
50|$|In pigs, the <b>cysticercus</b> {{can produce}} cysticercosis. Cysts develop in liver and lungs. (T. saginata {{does not cause}} cysticercosis.) Due to its {{biological}} similarity to T. solium, which is the major cause of neurocysticercosis, T. asiatica may also cause cysticercosis.|$|E

40|$|Bovine {{cysticercosis}} is a zoonosis {{that affects}} humans in their adult form (taeniasis) and its larval is found {{inserted in the}} musculature of infected cattle (<b>cysticerci).</b> It is still not entirely clear how animal immune response against infection occurs, being the comprehension of this process necessary for the enhancement of diagnostic capacity and disease prevention. This work aimed to evaluate {{the evolution of the}} immune response in experimentally infected cattle, compared with findings in cell response by optical microscopy. Nine animals were infected at a rate of 120, 000 eggs of Taenia saginata. Five of the animals were similar in the kinetics of antibody production against <b>cysticerci,</b> with maximal levels of IgG and IgM. The other four animals showed an immune response different from the majority, with two of them showing delayed response to infection by <b>cysticerci</b> while the others apparently did not have initial contact with antigens secreted by <b>cysticerci.</b> Regarding the cellular response, it was found that, in lesions of viable <b>cysticerci,</b> inflammatory cells predominated, whereas in nonviable <b>cysticerci</b> there were tissue repair cells in the most part, being possible to notice that the amount of migratory calcareous corpuscles are related to the death stage of the parasite.

40|$|Neurocysticercosis (NC) is a {{clinically}} and radiologically heterogeneous {{parasitic disease}} {{caused by the}} establishment of larval Taenia solium in the human central nervous system. Host and/or parasite variations {{may be related to}} this observed heterogeneity. Genetic differences between pig and human-derived T. solium <b>cysticerci</b> have been reported previously. In this study, 28 <b>cysticerci</b> were surgically removed from 12 human NC patients, the mitochondrial gene that encodes cytochrome b was amplified from the <b>cysticerci</b> and genetic variations that may be related to NC heterogeneity were characterised. Nine different haplotypes (Ht), which were clustered in four haplogroups (Hg), were identified. Hg 3 and 4 exhibited a tendency to associate with age and gender, respectively. However, no significant associations were found between NC heterogeneity and the different T. solium <b>cysticerci</b> Ht or Hg. Parasite variants obtained from patients with similar NC clinical or radiological features were genetically closer than those found in groups of patients with a different NC profile when using the Mantel test. Overall, this study establishes the presence of genetic differences in the Cytb gene of T. solium isolated from human <b>cysticerci</b> and suggests that parasite variation could contribute to NC heterogeneity...|$|R
3000|$|T. solium {{lives in}} the small {{intestine}} of humans, their definitive host. Their eggs are released with the faeces and ingested by pigs, the intermediate host.

50|$|T. solium eggs {{can cause}} {{cysticercosis}} in humans. Intermediate hosts, which harbor the disease {{for a short}} period of time, include: sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, and deer. Definitive hosts, which harbor the parasite until it reaches maturity and during sexual reproduction, include dogs, foxes, and other canids. The <b>cysticercus,</b> the larval form, travels and persists in the liver for 18 - 30 days, then burrows out into the peritoneal cavity and attaches to the viscera. When the sheep viscera is scavenged and the scavenger ingests the <b>cysticercus,</b> the protoscolex attaches to the small intestinal wall and the worm begins to form proglottids. Gravid proglottids, containing the eggs, move from the end of the worm and leave the body in the feces. The prepatent period is about 51 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of T asiatica is {{indirect}} and digenetic, and is completed in humans as the definitive host, and the intermediate host is mostly pigs (including wild boar in Taiwan), and possibly cattle on rare occasion. The complete life cycle is shortest among human taenids. Humans ingest the infective larvae called <b>cysticercus</b> from raw or undercooked meat, or viscera of pigs. The adult worm inhabits the small intestine where it gets attached to the mucosa using its suckers and rostellar hooklets. Upon sexual maturity it undergoes self-fertilisation. Fertilized eggs are released through the faeces along with the gravid proglottid which gets detached from the strobila. The number of proglottids released per day may vary from 0 to 35. <b>Cysticercus</b> grows into adult in about 2.5 to 4 months, by the time gravid proglottids are found in faeces.|$|E
50|$|When {{looking for}} signs of {{infection}} in the intermediate host or definitive host, the signs are not very externally seen. For the intermediate host there will be between two and 20 pea-sized cysts found inside the liver. The cysts that are found have one scolex inverted {{to the middle of the}} cyst. This shape is called a <b>cysticercus,</b> that is part of the metacestodes stage of life. The ones found in the liver form these bladders that are specifically called <b>Cysticercus</b> pisiformis for T. pisiformis. These signs can only be seen when a necropsy is done to the rabbit. When looking for an infection in dogs there is a more straightforward method. There will be gravid proglottids with striated eggs seen in the feces. This can be found using a fecal float on a sample that can easily be done by a vet.|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{removal of}} extraocular <b>cysticerci</b> {{is fraught with}} complications.

Marked clinical improvement was seen in all the cases in the treatment group at 4 weeks, with collapse of the cyst at 6 weeks (75 %), and complete disappearance at 3 months (100 %). No clinical or ultrasonographical change was noted in the control group. A trial of medical management with oral albendazole merits consideration in cases of extraocular <b>cysticerci...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore if each individual case of naturally acquired porcine cysticercosis, living in different geographic rural areas of central Mexico, is caused by one or more different specimens of Taenia solium tapeworm. The genetic variability among <b>cysticerci</b> from the same pig and that from different pigs was assessed by random amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs), through the percentage of polymorphic loci, the number of effective alleles, the expected heterozygosity and the Shannon index. The parasite population’s reproductive structure was estimated through the association index (IA), and the degree of genetic differentiation and variation was determined using AMOVA. Using six different random primers, and a total of 181 <b>cysticerci</b> from 14 pigs, 88 different loci were amplified: 85 % were polymorphic between pigs and 24 % within pigs. The phenogram grouped the <b>cysticerci</b> into eight major clusters, with differences in the genetic distances among all <b>cysticerci</b> from 14 pigs ranging from 0. 78 to 1. Most of the <b>cysticerci</b> grouped in accord with their different geographical origin and with their pig of origin. The similarity matrix produced from the phenogram (obtained by UPGMA) and the original similarity matrix yielded a good cophenetic correlation (r = 0. 82317, P = 0. 0004), which suggests that the phenogram accurately represents the original genetic similarities between isolates. The combination of IA (0. 0 – 0. 089) with the genetic diversity index (0. 009 – 0. 073) supports the idea that DNA diversity in T. solium <b>cysticerci</b> of naturally infected pigs is within the range expected from a recombination process occurring during sexual reproduction. The small genetic diversity found within the <b>cysticerci</b> of each pig (33. 81 %), when compared with that between pigs (66. 19 %), indicates that pigs are rarely infected by different tapeworms. It would then appear that porcine cysticercosis courses with effective concomitant immunity, as occurs in ovine cysticercosis...|$|R

50|$|T. asiatica causes {{intestinal}} taenisis {{in humans}} and cysticercosis in pigs. There is a suspicion {{that it may}} also cause cysticercosis in human. Like other taenids, humans are the definitive hosts, but in contrast, pigs, wild boars, as well as cattle can serve as intermediate hosts. Moreover, SCID mice and Mongolian gerbil can be experimentally infected. The life cycle is basically {{similar to those of}} other taenids. Humans contract the infection by eating raw or undercooked meat - a practice common in East and Southeast Asia - which are contaminated with the infective larva called <b>cysticercus.</b> <b>Cysticercus</b> develops into adult tapeworm in human intestine, from where it releases embryonated eggs along faeces into the external environment.

40|$|An ante mortem antigen-ELISA-based {{diagnosis}} of Taenia saginata cysticercosis was studied in artificially (n = 24) and naturally (n = 25) infected cattle {{with the objective}} of further validating the assay as a field diagnostic test. Based on total dissection as the definitive method of validity, the assay minimally detected 14 live <b>cysticerci</b> in artificially infected calves and 2 in naturally infected steers. In natural infections, the minimum number of live <b>cysticerci</b> consistently detected by Ag-ELISA was 5 while in artificial infections it was above 14. However, other animals with 12 and 17 live <b>cysticerci</b> in artificially infected calves, and 1 and 2 live <b>cysticerci</b> in naturally infected steers, escaped detection for unknown reasons. Animals harbouring dead <b>cysticerci</b> gave negative reactions in the assay {{as was the case in}} non-infected experimental control calves. There was a statistically significant positive linear correlation between Ag-ELISA optical density values and burdens of live <b>cysticerci</b> as obtained by total dissection of both artificially infected calves (r = 0. 798, n = 24; P &lt; 0. 05) and naturally infected steers (r = 0. 631, n = 25; P &lt; 0. 05). These results clearly show the potential effectiveness of ante mortem monoclonal antibody-based antigen detection ELISA in the {{diagnosis of}} bovine cysticercosis in cattle. Its value lies in the diagnosis of infection in cattle as a screening test in a herd, rather than as a diagnostic test at the individual level, due to false positive and negative reactions. In a herd of heavily infected cattle, the assay may, however, provide for individual diagnosis. Nevertheless, more work is recommended to increase its sensitivity so as to be able to diagnose light infections consistently in the field...|$|R
40|$|Taenia solium <b>cysticerci</b> {{recovered}} from naturally infected pigs from Mexico, Honduras and Tanzania show a clonal structure and local lineages with probable events of genetic recombination without genetic flow within them, as revealed by RAPD. To evaluate genetic polymorphism from <b>cysticerci</b> {{recovered from}} experimental infections, 4 pigs were infected with T solium eggs obtained from tapeworms released by 3 human carriers, a 10 -year-old female, a 25 -year-old female, and a 44 -year-old male, the 4 th pig was infected {{with a mixture}} of eggs from the 3 tapeworms. Each pig was orally inoculated with 50, 000 eggs. After 16 weeks pigs were humanely euthanized and <b>cysticerci</b> were excised. Parasites recovered from each pig were analyzed by RAPD. The proportion of polymorphic loci and the mean heterozygosity as well as a dendogram and an analysis of principal coordinate and minimum spanning tree were obtained. All four pigs developed viable cysticerci; the percent infection was obtained from the ratio of the number of eggs used for infection and the number of <b>cysticerci</b> counted in each pig after necropsy. Infection varied from 0. 2 to 4. 2 %. The values obtained for the proportion of polymorphic loci (0. 14 - 0. 55) and the average of expected heterozygosity (0. 06 - 0. 22) in the present experimental infection had a broader range than those reported in the literature from natural infections. The dendogram obtained clustered <b>cysticerci</b> into two main groups; the minimum spanning tree allowed to corroborate the data obtained in the dendogram and gave a better discrimination because in a three-dimensional plot it was easier to see that all <b>cysticerci</b> from each tapeworm were clustered amongst themselves. The results obtained could be hypothetically explained because environmental factors and genetic selection agents present in nature influence natural infections but do not participate in experimental ones.
