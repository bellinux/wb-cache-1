50|$|Wheels: White ABS plastic. Chrome {{plated on}} the Bullhead and Super <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Double Dare {{is smaller}} in size than the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster,</b> with {{narrower}} wheels and an overall smaller footprint. It weighs less and feels more sporty. While the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> uses dual gearbox attached {{by a simple}} 4-link suspension with shocks mounted directly on the links, the Double Dare has independent suspension all around and the gearboxes are solidly bolted to the chassis with chrome braces on the underside. <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> wheels are tall and very wide white plastic one piece units, but the Double Dare has chrome rims that are of a standard 2.2 size. They are two piece, making for easy tire changes. The Double Dare has water protection in mind, {{as evidenced by the}} sealed electronics section and the motor covers.|$|E
50|$|In February, 2004 the {{original}} <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> and Bullhead were discontinued, but {{owing to the}} model's continued popularity, Tamiya released a new version called the Super <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster.</b> The only {{differences between the two}} are the colors of various parts which were changed from red to blue, the removal of Chevrolet badging and emblems and the addition of the chromed wheels and chassis brace that were previously available only on the Bullhead.|$|E
50|$|So large is the {{aftermarket}} for the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> that it {{is possible}} to build one entirely of aftermarket parts with no Tamiya parts whatsoever.|$|E
50|$|Today the Double Dare and <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> {{are seen}} as pioneers of the radio control monster truck genre. The <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster,</b> sold en masse, {{is very easy to}} find and is a common base for rock {{crawlers}} with a seemingly never ending supply of spare parts and aftermarket upgrades. The Double Dare is still much less common, and it is especially hard to find one in good condition or with a decent body. Parts are hard to find, being resold individually in bags, as opposed to Tamiya's large parts trees.|$|E
5000|$|The Tamiya [...] "Bullhead" [...] {{which was}} {{released}} November 13, 1990 utilises {{the same basic}} chassis design as the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster,</b> albeit moulded in different coloured plastics. The most significant difference is that it carries a taller semi-tractor type body, likely inspired by fullsize semi-bodied monster trucks such as [...] "Super Pete". The other differences between the Bullhead and <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> (other than the body) lie mainly in {{the color of the}} plastic used for various parts. The Bullhead has a red chassis, while the Clod has a black chassis. The shocks, gearcase bumpers, end links and a few other small parts are yellow on the Bullhead; these same parts are red on the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster.</b> Other minor differences on the Bullhead are its chrome-plated wheels, chrome suspension bars and a chassis brace. Because tamiya discontinued the bullhead finding a mint condition bullhead in a factory sealed box is very rare. Some collectors have spent over 800 dollars for mint condition Bullhead today.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, the Double Dare {{was not as}} much of {{a success}} as the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster.</b> Tamiya had the US {{distributor}} MRC (Model Rectifier Corporation) on their side, and masses of the new Clod Busters sold. The Double Dare came out two years later, by the time everyone had a Clod already. Parts support was decent, but parts and hopups were in lower supply due to Kyosho's lack of a dedicated distributor. Several magazines did compare the two trucks, though, usually favoring the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster.</b> The introduction of a rival to Tamiya's truck started the development of newer and better monster truck designs.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> and its related models {{virtually}} spawned an aftermarket {{industry of}} modifications {{that could be}} done to it to improve performance and durability. Many small businesses have popped up over the years to cater to just the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> owner and a few have since gone on to have great success manufacturing parts for other R/C models. The model's body is a detailed replica of a Chevrolet pickup truck, but the current [...] "Super Clod Buster" [...] has a different grille and tailgate that makes no reference to Chevrolet, presumably for marketing and licensing purposes.|$|E
50|$|The truck's chevron-style {{tires are}} similar to those {{included}} with the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster,</b> yet are minutely changed in molding; the wheels are carryovers from the Juggernaut, except for enlarged circular pegs for keying into the widened hubs for improved durability.|$|E
50|$|The Tamiya <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> is a 1/10-scale radio {{controlled}} monster truck released September 21, 1987 by the Tamiya Corporation. With its four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, twin Mabuchi RS-540 {{motors and}} 165 mm tires {{it quickly became}} one of Tamiya's most popular radio controlled model kits.|$|E
50|$|The main {{competitor}} to the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> was the Kyosho Double Dare. The Double Dare {{was released}} {{two years later}} by Kyosho and had {{many of the same}} features with some improvements. It did not sell nearly as well, but the introduction of a challenger to the Clod started the move to improve the technology of radio controlled monster trucks. Today, both trucks are regarded as pioneers of the genre.|$|E
50|$|One {{area the}} Double Dare excelled {{in over the}} Clod was option parts. Kyosho's Option House {{division}} had a set of gold shocks for the Double Dare. Clod owners were limited to Tamiya CVA oil shocks. The <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> was never spec'd for any Tamiya motor upgrades, but the Double Dare was easily equipped {{with a pair of}} 22-turn Kyosho Mega Motors. Aftermarket parts, once they came out, upgraded both trucks' chassis.|$|E
50|$|The TXT-1 {{exhibits}} a straight-axle suspension system damped via silicone-filled shocks, the latter {{a departure from}} friction shocks used on the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster.</b> Of note is the fixed-ratio cantilever arrangement actuating the shocks which lengthens the effective range through which the shocks travel, increasing suspension articulation. By design the vehicle is somewhat prone to stability-degrading torque steer and body roll. The truck features zip-ties retaining metal anti-sway bars which significantly improve stability.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} as a contender with the Tamiya <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> which was released two years earlier. Both were 4WD monster trucks with four wheel steering and four wheel drive using twin motors, one to each gearbox. Both trucks used a single servo to steer and another to run a heavy duty mechanical speed controller, so they were easily controlled with a common two channel radio. Both trucks came with a set of eight friction type shocks and 27 turn RS-540 motors.|$|E
50|$|The two trucks {{came out}} {{at a time when}} {{realistic}} radio control monster trucks were rare. The only true MT at the time was the MRP High Roller, which {{was little more than a}} cool looking paperweight. Both trucks were designed to use standard R/C equipment and be as affordable as any other R/C car. The trucks both have an odd mix of realism and performance. The Tamiya <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> uses a thick plastic Chevrolet-based body with high detailing, but the Kyosho only has a Lexan one based on a Nissan light truck. Nevertheless, it features detail pieces such as chrome bumpers, a rollbar with detailed chrome spotlights, a grill with clear headlight lenses, and a detailed chromed plastic dummy motor.|$|E
50|$|The truck, {{available}} {{only as a}} kit, comes equipped with twin 540-J size sealed endbell stock motors wired in parallel when using the standard mechanical speed control. The motors feed power through a closed gear-reduction transmission terminating in a single dual-end output shaft which subsequently turn metal telescoping driveshafts running to each axle. The two axles feature the additional bracing and updated gear arrangement and specifications of the Juggernaut 2 truck which improve durability and lifespan while reducing the chance of gear misalignment under large torque loads. The 12mm hex {{at the end of}} each axle shaft keys into a widened 5-hole hub akin to the <b>Clod</b> <b>Buster</b> hub to increase track width. Main stress-bearing internal gear shafts in the transmission and axles are supported by metal shielded bearings, while the rest of the gears in the truck spin on metal bushings.|$|E
