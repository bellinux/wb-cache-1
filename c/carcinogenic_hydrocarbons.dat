As head of department he conducted research into purine metabolism and ketonuria, proving in 1921 that the carcinogen in coal was a cyclic hydrocarbon. In 1929 he discovered the first pure compound to show evidence of cancer-causing activity, 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene, and also discovered a series of other <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> including methylcholanthrene. In 1930, Kennaway and Izrael Hieger showed {{for the first time that}} single polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as dibenza,hanthracene, are tumorigenic in mouse skin. Between 1932 and 1942 he published six articles on these discoveries in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.|$|E
40|$|THE {{effect of}} giving croton oil before {{treatment}} with a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{has been studied}} previously by others (Berenblum, 1941; Mottram, 1944 a, 1944 b; Berenblum and Shubik 1947; Berenblum and Haran, 1955). Mottram claimed that pretreatment with croton oil increased the tumour yield obtained from 3 applications of 3, 4 -benzpyrene followed by further croton oil treatment. Berenblum and Shubik failed to confirm this and considered that croton oil only promotes tumour development when it is given after treatment with a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> Mottram produced a few malignant tumours in his experiments, but Berenblum {{and his colleagues have}} confined their studies to the induction of benign tumours. In the present paper the effect of reversal of order of treatments is examined primarily with regard to its possible effect on the incidence of malignant tumours. Previous studies (Roe, 1956 a) have established that malignant skin tumours appear in " S " strain mice several months after a single application of 9, 10 dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA), and that the incidence of such tumour...|$|R

40|$|WHILE {{repeated}} {{applications of}} a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{to the skin}} of the mouse leads to the local development of papillomas and ultimately of carcinomas, a single application usually induces only the " initiating phase " of carcinogenesis. Except for the appearance of epidermal hyperplasia at the site, which is hardly distinguishable from that produced by ordinary irritation, the evidence of a specific " initiating " effect is demonstrated by the fact that tumours are elicited in such pretreated skin by subsequent applications of a " promoting agent " such as croton oil (Berenblum and Shubik, 1947, 1949). The difference in mechanism between the two stages is best illustrated by the observation that reversal of the sequence of the two actions fails to elicit tumours (Berenblum and Haran, 1955 a). The current concept of the two-stage mechanism of carcinogenesis is that the initiating phase represents an irreversible transformation of a normal cell into a " dormant tumour cell ", and that the promoting phase arises through a delay in maturation of these dormant tumour cells until a critical sized colony is reached (Berenblum, 1954). When using a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> for initiating action a single application is necessary, otherwise the same compound would begin to act also as a promoting agent. However, the effect of urethane on the skin, even after long-repeated applications, is restricted to initiating action (Graffi, Vlamynch, Hoffman and Schulz...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{research}} on the cause of cancer was summarized by Haddow in 1958. [...] The first chemical carcinogen was identified in 1928-29 as 1:2-5:6-dibenzanthracene, and the carcinogeneic substance in pitch was identified as 3:4-benzopyrene in 1933. Haddow concluded that “there {{can be little doubt}} of the importance of their chemical combination with the genetical material” as the source of the chemical mechanism of action of carcinogens. Brookes and Lawley, in 1964, summarized ongoing research into the causes of cancer. [...] They referred to the competing hypotheses that carcinogens reacted mainly with proteins versus mainly with DNA. The direct research of Brookes and Lawley, testing <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> indicated that they react with DNA. McCann et al. in 1975 and McCann and Ames, in 1976, tested 175 known carcinogens for interaction with DNA sufficient to cause mutations in their new Salmonella/microsome test. This test uses bacteria as sensitive indicators of DNA damage. They found that 90% of known carcinogens caused mutations in their test. They indicated that the carcinogens that did not cause mutations in their assay were likely due to the need for the carcinogens to be activated by enzymes not available in their system.|$|E
40|$|The estrogens, a {{group of}} {{substances}} {{some of which are}} produced within the body, act much like the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> under some conditions. At least five types of tumor appear among estrogen-treated mice; namely, mammary, uterine, hypophyseal, testicular, and lymphoid. 8 ' " Other factors or influences are now known to be necessary for the realization of all of the above types of neoplasia in estrogen-treated mice except those of the uterine cervix. The additional factors or influences are those transmitted by parent or parents to their young; in other words, the tumors are strainlimited in their appearance. However, of the tumors mentioned only those of the mammary glands may appear frequently among the untreated control animals of the groups being considered at this time. 24 The intrinsic humoral environments in multiparous mice of the susceptible groups are adequate to provoke mammary neoplasia. The tumors of the other glands or tissues require, for their instigation, a more drastic or a different type of stimulation; hence their infrequent spontaneous appearance among the animals studied here. The <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> were thought at one time to provoke tumors only in the immediately adjacent or subjacent tissues. It is now known, however, that mammary, 4 ' 26 pulmonary, 2 ' hepatic, 25 or lymphoid 5 ' 19, 20, 23 tumors may occur among mice given subcutaneous or percutaneous applications of <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Interestingly, transmitted or inherited factors also determine the nature of the response in animals given <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Carcinogens induce lymphoid tumors in mice of some strains but not in mice of other strains. In mice of strains that show a tendency to acquire lymphoid tumors spontaneously the carcinogen may increase the incidence or decrease the average age of onset of the disease.

40|$|IT {{is now a}} well {{established}} fact that cigarette smoke contains many noncarcinogenic and <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (Cooper and Lindsey, 1955). In previous work the direct effects of several <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and of cigarette smoke condensates have been studied in two organs of the respiratory tract, grown in organ culture. Benzopyrene and condensates from cigarette smoke cause hyperplasia with pleomorphism of the newly formed cells in the bronchial epitheliuin of human foetal lung (Lasnitzki 1956, 1958) and benzopyrene, methycholanthrene and DMBA induce similar changes in rat tracheal epithelium (Crocker, Nielsen and Lasnitzki, 1965). Recently, it has become possible to concentrate the hydrocarbons in the cigarette smoke condensate (Whitehead, personal communication) and the action of this particular fraction has been examined in organ cultures of human foetal lung (Lasnitzki, 1968); it produces extensive basal cell hyperplasia with atypical cytological changes in all treated explants.

40|$|DIFFERENTIAL {{sensitivity}} of normal and neoplastic rodent fibroblasts growing in vitro to the toxic action of carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons, suggested long ago by Haddow (1938), {{has been demonstrated}} {{by a number of}} investigators (Starikova and Vasiliev, 1962; Berwald and Sachs, 1963; Alfred and collaborators, 1964; Diamond, 1966). Neoplastic cells were found to be much more resistant to these compounds than their normal counterparts. Resistance to the toxic effects of <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> was shown to be characteristic for the cells of sarcomas induced by various types of agents: carcinogenic chemicals, plastic films, SV 40 and polyoma viruses. Thus, decrease of the sensitivity to carcinogens regularly accompanied neoplastic transformation of these cells (see review and discussion in Vasiliev and Guelstein, 1963, 1966). The causes of the differential {{sensitivity of}} normal and neoplastic cells to <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> remain obscure. These compounds undergo various metabolic transformations in vivo (see review in Boyland and Weigert, 1947; Miller and Miller, 1965). In vitro they are rapidly accumulated by normal and neoplastic cells (Marimura, Kotin and Falk, 1964; Alfred et al., 1964; Diamond, 1966). It was not known, however, whether these substances might be metabolized by cells growing in vitro. The experiments described in this paper were performed in order to study the rate of metabolism of a carcinogenic hydrocarbon, 3, 4 -benzopyrene (BP), in cultures of normal and neoplastic fibroblasts of mice and hamsters. Similar experiments were made with cultures of fibroblasts from normal human embryos.

40|$|ONE current {{theory of}} {{carcinogenesis}} postulates {{that the process}} is divisible into an initiating phase and a promoting phase (Salaman, 1958). The initiating agents in the experiments that gave origin to this theory were the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>hydroca,rbons</b> when used as single applications to the skin in sub-carcinogenic doses. Ethyl carbamate (urethane), {{and a few other}} substances, are of special interest because, when applied to the skin of mice, or administered to mice by mouth or parenterally, they produce changes in the skin so that benign and sometimes malignant tumours appear only when the skin is subsequently painted repeatedly with a promoting agent such as croton oil (Roe and Salaman, 1954; Haran and Berenblum, 1956; Berenblum and Haran-Ghera, 1957). The effect of urethane on the skin is therefore restricted to initiating action.

40|$|Summary. -N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) induced {{a marked}} dose {{dependent}} leucopoenia which {{was associated with}} an increased survival of skin allografts in adult rats and in 2 strains of mice. The humoral immune response to NMU as assessed by haemolytic plaque formation and haemagglutination was also much reduced. Dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) which, like NMU is a powerful carcinogen and an alkylating agent, showed no immunosuppressive activity after a single dose in rats on either a normal diet or fed a protein-free diet which enhances kidney tumourigenesis. In mice DMN at a near LD 50 dose (14 mg/kg) had no effect on skin graft survival but did reduce the humoral response. At half this dose level, however, no immunosuppressive effect was seen. The results support the conclusion that the immunosuppressive activity of a chemical carcinogen is not necessarily associated with the expression of its carcinogenicity.
