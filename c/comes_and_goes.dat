5|$|The NSS {{is headed}} by Baek San (Kim Yeong-cheol), its {{standing}} deputy director only in title and {{the man responsible for}} the recruiting of Hyun-jun and Sa-woo. The named director of the NSS <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> with each change of power in the presidency, but it is the deputy director that oversees the organization. Baek San's motivations for many of his actions are mysterious, occasionally outright inconsistent with that of the general national interests. Due to the very existence of the organization being kept secret, he enjoys a state of personal protection that few others do.|$|E
5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of any blood or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E
5|$|Dot is {{introduced}} to EastEnders soon after its launch as the gossiping, chain smoking, Christian friend of Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Lou Beale (Anna Wing) {{who works with}} Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) at the Walford launderette. She has a difficult life with a criminal husband, Charlie, and their son Nick, who appeared in the first episode. Charlie <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes,</b> always treating Dot badly and stealing from her, until he dies in a lorry accident. Nick is also a criminal; he is involved in drugs, robberies and murder, and tries to cheat Dot out of her money. He attempts to poison her to inherit her bingo winnings, but is unsuccessful. Despite Nick's deeds, Dot believes he can be redeemed. Dot also associates herself as Walford's Good Samaritan, often taking in residents when they are homeless. Amongst these include Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) and Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), who becomes addicted to drugs. Dot believes that she can help Donna change for the better, but comes home one day to find Donna dead in her lounge. It is concluded that she died after choking on her own vomit, and Dot is devastated.|$|E

The people that are there forever that support you and love you. This song is all about holding onto those things." ...|$|R
25|$|Stuttering {{can also}} have its roots in development. Many {{toddlers}} and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal disfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal disfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, the stuttering usually <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> and is most noticeable {{when a child is}} excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.|$|E

Unlike Dot, Nick is scripted as a semi-regular character, one who <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> sporadically and, as authors Jill Marshall and Angela Werndly have observed, [...] "we know heartache is in store for Dot Cotton every time her son, 'Nasty Nick', turns up [...] The recurrence of generic elements means we derive pleasure from expectation and prediction." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] blends {{sounds of}} post-disco, rhythm and blues, funk, and dance-pop. The song {{opens with a}} {{standard}} drum beat along with a standard hi-hat, and it contains hardly any reverberation. After two more bars, a repetitive bassline enters. Each time it passes through the tonic, the note is doubled by a distorted synth bass. This accompaniment {{is followed by a}} repetitive three-note synth, played staccato with a deep reverb. The defining chord progression is then established. Jackson's quiet vocals enter, accompanied by a finger-snap, which <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> during the verses, as the rhythm and chord progression repeats.|$|E

500|$|The {{procession}} leaves. The squires eye Kundry with mistrust {{and question}} her. After a brief retort, she falls silent. Gurnemanz tells them Kundry has often helped the Grail Knights {{but that she}} <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> unpredictably. When he asks directly why she does not stay to help, she answers, [...] "I never help! (""). The squires think she is a witch and sneer that if she does so much, why will she not find the Holy Spear for them? Gurnemanz reveals that this deed is destined for someone else. He says Amfortas was given guardianship of the Spear, but lost it as he was seduced by an irresistibly attractive woman in Klingsor's domain. Klingsor grabbed the Spear and stabbed Amfortas. The wound causes Amfortas both suffering and shame, and will never heal on its own.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Aguilera compares {{her love}} to office equipment, from paperclips to rubber-bands, {{as a metaphor}} for a relationship. The lyric [...] "A rubber band is what I call your love for me, cause it <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> and pins me like a trampoline" [...] was spoken by Aguilera at the beginning. The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd try to set you straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, you can even say it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb". Toward the closing moments, she sings, [...] "Paper clips they couldn't even hold us together... when your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler." ...|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, HitFix's Melinda Newman {{felt the}} {{recording}} [...] "has the dated {{feel of a}} song from the '80s, {{perhaps because of the}} drum track." [...] The [...] "few chord changes" [...] reminded her of [...] "Wild Horses" [...] by The Rolling Stones. Newman also said that [...] "Against All Odds" [...] by Phil Collins would be a more suitable choice for the soundtrack than [...] "It Will Rain". Similarly, Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone also drew a comparison to [...] "Wild Horses" [...] by The Rolling Stones, feeling an [...] "overheated romantic dialogue" [...] and [...] "similarly melodramatic" [...] as in [...] "Grenade", adding that the [...] "real point is the song's desperately yearning melody." [...] Vozick-Levinson ranked the single three out of five stars. PopDust compared the recording to [...] "Grenade", [...] "yet somehow...more dramatic". [...] However, the song was [...] "nothing if not competent" [...] and Mars' vocals were praised. [...] It was Mars' fourth best single by that time, if released [...] "with no tie-in". The reviewer assured that the singer has done better in [...] "dramatic and romantic" [...] and by comparison it was [...] "a gentle drizzle that <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> with little impression." ...|$|E

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian commented that; [...] "Lyra is nicely played by 13-year-old newcomer Dakota Blue Richards, though with an Artful Dodger-ish 'urchin' accent that <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> a bit", while Empire noted that she [...] "struggles with lumpy dialogue".

2500|$|Harrison biographers such as Allison and Ian Inglis {{interpret}} {{his concept}} of maya love in this 1974 song as reflecting the failure of his marriage to Pattie Boyd, rather than a comment on love and human relationships in general. However, Eric Clapton, for whom Boyd left Harrison in July 1974, has spoken of Harrison's view that relationships were, like possessions, all maya. During an interview with Houston radio station KLOL, shortly before the song's release in December that year, Harrison elaborated on the concept: [...] "Maya love is something when it's 'I love you if, 'I love you when, 'I love you but. It's a type of love that <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> which we do tend to give to one another ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Landis {{rode the}} 2006 Tour with the {{constant}} pain from the injury, which he described: [...] "It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's a sharp pain. When I pedal and walk, it <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes,</b> but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down my leg into my knee. The morning {{is the best}} time, it doesn't hurt too much. But when I walk it hurts, when I ride it hurts. Most {{of the time it}} doesn't keep me awake, but there are nights that it does." [...] During the Tour, Landis was medically approved to take cortisone for this injury, a medication otherwise prohibited in professional cycling for its known potential for abuse. Landis himself called his win [...] "a triumph of persistence" [...] despite the pain.|$|E
2500|$|The WRT54G-TM (TM {{stands for}} T-Mobile) is {{also called the}} T-Mobile [...] "Hotspot@Home" [...] service. [...] It allows calls to be made via T-Mobile's GSM network or via Wi-Fi Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA), using the same {{telephone}} and phone number (a special dual-mode phone designed for the service is required e.g. Blackberry Pearl 8120). Additionally, once a call is in progress, one may transition from Wi-Fi to GSM (and vice versa) seamlessly, as Wi-Fi signal <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes,</b> such as when entering or exiting a home or business. A special router is not needed to use the service, but the T-Mobile branded routers are supposed to enhance the telephone's battery life.
