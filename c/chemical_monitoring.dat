50|$|The oyster {{industry}} {{along the}} West Coast of North America relies {{almost exclusively on}} the Pacific Oyster, Crassostrea gigas. There are only three locations on the West Coast of North America where natural recruitment of C. gigas takes place: Willapa Bay, WA, Hood Canal WA, and British Columbia, Canada. Recruitment elsewhere is limited by cold water temperatures that inhibit spawning and low residence time of water that flushes out larvae, making the oyster industry dependent on hatcheries to raise larvae. Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery, located in Netarts Bay, {{is one of the}} largest providers of larvae for the industry. In the late summer of 2007, the hatchery saw massive die offs in larvae, resulting in zero production for multiple months on end. Similar die offs and production failures occurred at other Pacific Northwest hatcheries and oyster farms. Water samples from Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery tested positive for a bacteria, Vibrio tubiashii, and this pathogen was suspected to be the cause of the mortality. However, after installing a new system to clean the water, another round of die-offs occurred.Researchers from Oregon State University and Hatchery employees were able to work together to make the connection between early larval mortality and upwelling conditions that negatively impacted the entire west coast shellfish industry. Using Hatchery records of larval performance and monitoring of incoming tidal water from Netarts Bay, low aragonite saturation states at the time of spawning were correlated with the high levels of larval mortality that heavily reduced hatchery production and negatively impacted the west coast oyster industry Further research from OSU, supported by Whiskey Creek, helped to identify the first 48 hours of larval life, in which the initial shell is built, as a window of vulnerability to ocean acidification due to the rapid rate of calcification and limited energetic budget. Experiments decoupling PCO2, pH demonstrated that aragonite saturation has the greatest impact on shell development of early bivalve larvae. These conclusions supported buffering of incoming water and <b>chemical</b> <b>monitoring</b> approach used by Whiskey Creek Hatchery to improve survival of larval oysters. Research at Whiskey Creek Hatchery contributed to the body of knowledge around ocean acidification and the immediate impacts it has on calcifying organisms.|$|E

30|$|Since biota cannot {{only take}} up but also {{accumulate}} <b>chemicals,</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>chemicals</b> in aquatic organisms {{is an essential}} part of various programs that assess the chemical status of water bodies. Chemicals including hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) and metals are taken up from the aquatic environment either via the water phase or the food which in turn may result in toxicity. In addition, chemicals that tend to partition to sediments can be taken up by direct contact with the sediments. Quantification of chemicals in biota is often analytically challenging. Furthermore, bioaccumulation depends on many abiotic (e.g. site specific water quality like hardness or pH) and biotic (e.g. lipid content, age or sex of an organism) factors that have to be considered in bioaccumulation assessment. As an alternative to measuring chemicals in organisms, the use of passive sampling devices that accumulate chemicals in a reference phase is discussed at the international level. Assessing bioaccumulation is further required for the authorisation of chemicals in many national and international legislative frameworks.|$|R
