[...] "This is accomplished through the use of credit support specified within the transaction structure to create securities with different risk-return profiles. The equity/first-loss tranche absorbs initial losses, followed by the mezzanine tranches which absorb some additional losses, again followed by more senior tranches. Thus, due to the credit support resulting from tranching, the most senior claims are expected to be insulated - except in particularly adverse circumstances - from default risk of the underlying asset pool through the absorption of losses by the more junior claims." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tranching {{refers to}} the {{creation}} of different <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> (typically with different credit ratings) from the same pool of assets. It is an important concept, because it is the system used to create different investment classes for the securities. Tranching allows the cash flow from the underlying asset to be diverted to various investor groups. The Bank for International Settlements Committee on the Global Financial System explains tranching as follows: [...] "A key goal of the tranching process is to create at least one class of securities whose rating is higher than the average rating of the underlying collateral pool or to create rated securities from a pool of unrated assets. This is accomplished through the use of credit support (enhancement), such as prioritization of payments to the different tranches." ...|$|E

It proposed amendments to the Securities Act and Commodity Futures Act, adding new <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> fraud for attempted market manipulation and attempted fraud, clarifying insider trading regulations, and allowing the Ontario Securities Commission to share information with regulatory and law enforcement agencies. It also repealed the sunset provision to the Retail Sales Tax Act to enable the government to collect or secure tax debts. Specifically, the government would withhold clearance certificates until resolution of debts associated with the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act (1996), Fuel Tax Act, Gasoline Tax Act, Race Tracks Tax Act, and Tobacco Tax Act. These are expected to generate about $300 million in additional tax revenues from 2013 to 2016.|$|E

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} empirically that financial price changes are distributed {{according to a}} power law, with cubic exponent. This is a fascinating regularity, as it holds for various <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> on various markets, and on various time scales. The universality of this law suggests {{that there must be}} some basic, general and stable mechanism behind it. The standard (neoclassical) paradigm implies no such mechanism. Agent-based models of financial markets, on the other hand, exhibit realistic price changes, but they involve relatively complicated, and often mathematically intractable, mechanisms. This paper identifies a simple principle behind the power law: the feedback intrinsic to the very idea of speculation, namely buying when one expects a price rise (and selling when one expects a price fall). By this feedback, price changes follow a random coefficient autoregressive process, and therefore they have a power law by Kesten theorem. Comment: 11 page...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the dilemma of}} a fiduciary acting for parties who, as among themselves, have conflicting commercial interests - an inquiry fundamentally {{different from that of}} the traditional study of conflicts between fiduciaries and their beneficiaries. Existing legal principles do not fully capture this dilemma because agency law focuses primarily on an agent’s duty to a given principal, not on conflicts among principals; trust law focuses primarily on gratuitous transfers; and commercial law generally addresses arm’s length, not fiduciary, relationships. The dilemma has become critically important, however, as defaults increase in the multitude of conflicting securities (e. g., <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> of the same issuer having different priorities or sources of payment) that are typical of modern finance. A fiduciary, such as a trustee, acting for investors in these securities faces the difficult task of trying to understand and balance the respective obligations owed to conflicting classes and the risk of being sued no matter how the balancing is performed...|$|E
40|$|Using data on {{repurchase}} agreements by primary securities dealers, {{we show that}} three <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> (Treasury securities, securities issued by government-sponsored agen-cies, and mortgage-backed securities) can be formally ranked {{in terms of their}} collateral values in the general collateral (GC) market. We then show that GC repurchase agreement (repo) spreads across asset classes display jumps and significant temporal variation, espe-cially at times of predictable liquidity needs, consistent with the “safe haven ” properties of Treasury securities: These jumps are driven almost entirely by the behavior of the GC repo rates of Treasury securities. Estimating the “collateral rents ” earned by owners of these se-curities, we find such rents to be sizable for Treasury securities and nearly zero for agency and mortgage-backed securities. Finally, we link collateral values to asset prices in a sim-ple no-arbitrage framework and show that variations in collateral values explain a signifi-cant fraction of changes in short-term yield spreads but not those of longer-term spreads. Our results point to securities ’ role as collateral as a promising direction of research to improve understanding of the pricing of money market securities and their spreads. (JEL G 12, G 23...|$|E

40|$|The {{capital market}} in which asset-backed {{securities}} are issued and traded {{is composed of}} three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs. The authors examined a total of 3, 466 loans (worth € 548. 51 billion) of which 1, 102 (worth € 163. 90 billion) have been classified as ABS. MBS issues represent 1, 782 issues (worth € 320. 83 billion), and 582 are CDO issues (worth € 64. 12 billion). The authors investigated how common pricing factors compare for the main <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b> Due to {{the differences in the}} assets related to these securities, the relevant pricing factors for these securities should differ, too. Taking these three classes as a whole, the authors documented that the assets attached as collateral for the securities differ between security classes, but that there are also important univariate differences to consider. They found that most of the common pricing characteristics between ABS, MBS and CDO differ significantly. Furthermore, applying the same pricing estimation model to each security class revealed that most of the common pricing characteristics associated with these classes have a different impact on the primary market spread exhibited by the value of the coefficients. The regression analyses the authors performed suggest that ABS, MBS and CDOs are in fact different instruments, as implied by the differences in impact of the pricing factors on the loan spread between these security classes...|$|E
40|$|A {{key feature}} of the 2007 - 2008 {{financial}} crisis is that for some <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> trade has ceased. And where trade does occur, it appears that market prices are well below what one might {{believe to be the}} intrinsic value for that class of security. This seems to be especially true for those securities where the payoff streams are particularly complex (for example, CDOs). One explanation for this is that information about these securities' intrinsic values is asymmetric, with the current holders having better information than potential buyers. We show how the resulting adverse selection problem can help explain why more complex securities trade at significant discounts to their intrinsic values or do not trade at all. To examine whether asymmetric information alone would suffice to shut down portions of the asset-backed securities (ABS) market, we append a simple "workhorse" model for pricing securities under asymmetric information into a Monte Carlo simulation that generates hypothetical securities backed by residential mortgages. We conduct a type of "stress test" on the ABS by making the distribution of payoffs to the underlying loans worse, and find that the intrinsic values of the securities further down the securitization chain become dispersed {{in such a way that}} the market for them may shut down under asymmetric information. We then consider the role for government intervention, and compare the effectiveness of different policies that aim to unclog these markets. Securities...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} average costs of raising {{external}} debt and equity capital for U. S. corporations from 1990 to 1994. For {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs) of equity, the direct costs average 11. 0 percent of the proceeds. For seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), the direct costs average 7. 1 percent. For convertible bonds, the direct costs average 3. 8 percent. For straight debt issues, the direct costs average 2. 2 percent, although they are strongly related to the credit rating of the issue. All <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> exhibit economies of scale, although they are less pronounced for straight debt issues. IPOs also incur a substantial indirect cost due to short-run underpricing. Most large equity offers include an international tranche, although debt issues do not. I. introduction In this article we present the average costs of raising external capital for US. corporations from 1990 to 1994. Specifically, we report the average spreads on public equity offerings and debt offerings, {{along with the other}} direct costs of raising capital, {{as a percentage of the}} proceeds. We find substantial economies of scale for initial public offerings (IPOs) of equity and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). We also find substantial economies of scale for both straight bond offerings and convertible bond offerings. Spreads on bond offerings are highly sensitive to the credit rating of the offering. This article is descriptive in nature; no theories are tested. Its purpose is to provide benchmark numbers for use by issuers of securities. We do not address why firms issue the securities they do.
