25|$|A serious {{difficulty}} arises if the variables are not {{measured in the}} same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the curve – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall be adding quantities measured in different units, and so this leads to meaningless results. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.|$|E

With the rapid industrial development in China, increased production and consumption both have dramatically caused severe environmental problems. Although the study of economics, sociology, and politics can contribute to understanding contemporary problems, environmental history makes it <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need as well to place those issues in a broader and longer historical context.|$|R

[...] "We were very <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't want {{to be associated with}} being a movie game", he commented. This desire {{led to the creation of}} James Sterling, a character that would fit the studio's needs and feel familiar to the characters featured in the films. An original music score was written for Armada of the Damned, while the musical themes from the films were [...] "treated tastefully and only used on occasion." [...] After the game's cancellation, the score was used in , which was released in 2011.|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} Irwin's death, {{at least ten}} stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of Queensland, with their tails cut off, prompting speculation {{as to whether they}} might have been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge, although, according to the chairman of the Queensland fishing information service, anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung. Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin and executive director of his Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings, saying that [...] "We just want to make it very <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will not accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution.

[...] The Pentagon had opposed the removal of Diệm and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Khánh later reflected: [...] "Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup." ...|$|E

[...] Luttinen explained that Laiho's role was critical: [...] "it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had finally two guitar players <b>that</b> <b>we</b> kind of like wanted to get away from that punky kind of writing style and started just wanting to get more back to the metal feeling".|$|R

500|$|There {{were a few}} {{positive}} {{efforts for}} the Trojans: Tight end Fred Davis caught fivepasses for a career-best 152yards, including a 63-yard touchdown; and nose tackle Sedrick Ellis had threesacks. [...] However, there were many more errors and substandard performances: quarterback John David Booty, who broke a bone in the middle finger of his throwing hand in the firsthalf, had fourpasses intercepted in the secondhalf. [...] The offensive line had been suffering since losing twostarters in oneplay during the previous week's game at Washington, but the effect was severe against Stanford; the offensive line gave up foursacks, one more than the Trojans had surrendered all season, and USC gained only 95yards rushing. [...] Key receiver Patrick Turner dropped several passes, the defense gave up 17points in the fourthquarter and USC had an extra-point attempt blocked, a point which became a crucial difference. [...] Like their previous game against Washington, USC out-gained Stanford by 224yards (459 to 235) but made many crucial turnovers and penalties. [...] In the press conference following the game, Coach Carroll summarized his concerns: [...] "It's real <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have fallen {{out of line with}} our philosophy that has guided this program for years; we're turning the ball over too much." ...|$|E
500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E

500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land [...] that this is a good company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this is not something we are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't want to be at war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from trying to get some money out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E
500|$|The summit was {{dominated}} by divisions over the Iraq war as NATO members were only able to agree to limited assistance {{in the form of}} training for Iraqi security forces. The NATO support given to Iraq troop training was in response to a request by the Iraqi Interim Government, and in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546, which requests international and regional organisations to contribute assistance to the multinational force. Even this limited agreement contained areas of contention, with France insisting that it would only help with training outside Iraq, while the United States favored that the training would take place inside Iraq. As a consequence, the deal was left deliberately vague and differences remained on whether NATO should train Iraqi officers inside Iraq, or limit itself to training outside the country and acting as a clearing house for national efforts. The commitment was also vague as it was not made clear what the size of the training mission would be or exactly when and where it would take place. German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, known for his earlier opposition to the Iraq War, commented: [...] "The engagement of NATO is reduced to training and only training. We have made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> don't want to see German soldiers in Iraq." [...] Despite outwardly optimistic statements by the US concerning NATO's commitment towards Iraqi troop training after the summit, France and Germany had refused to share the burden of responsibility for the situation in Iraq and did not support the US and British demand for sending NATO troops. Put differently, participation in the multinational forces in Iraq was left to the discretion of the particular alliance members and the USA relunctantly consented to troop training outside Iraq. Consequently, despite an outward show of NATO unity, the split over Iraq still persisted and tensions in interstate relations within the alliance were not resolved.|$|E
