5000|$|In {{his essay}} [...] "The new <b>christianophobia,</b> Why Have Christians Around the World Become Murder Targets?", Alexandre Del Valle {{explains}} the Christianity is today the religion most systematically and violently persecuted around the world. The specific {{nature of the}} new global <b>Christianophobia</b> consists mainly in its impunity and the silence that surrounds it. Indeed, a new litany of hateful atrocities is stirring up fanaticism in many nations against Christianity, {{the religion of the}} hated [...] "westerner white man", {{in the name of a}} desire for revenge and the [...] "right" [...] of colonized peoples [...] "humiliated" [...] by the West to be [...] "different." [...] This new teaching of contempt, which amalgamates Christians from all backgrounds with the western [...] "executioner," [...] is impervious to any blame. Totally uninhibited, driven by the global wave of anti-western sentiment and often exotically presented as anti-imperialism, it is the source of countless acts of violence against Christians, killed just because they are Christians, according to Alexandre del Valle (this book will be soon published in the USA and in Brasil).|$|E

And they chose Opus Dei. This is the latest mutation of a virus containing a black legend.|$|E
