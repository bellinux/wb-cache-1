50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into {{the eye of the}} small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|E
40|$|Main and {{connecting}} rod bearings along the crankshaft in a heavy-duty engine oil system requires efficient feed of oil flow to ensure the performance of lubrication, cooling and cleaning. The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main {{and connecting}} rod bearings have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main bearing and the connecting rod large end bearing loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for connecting rod large end bearing and at lower engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the upper and the lower bearing shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst connecting rod large end and small end bearing stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow. The feed of oil to main bearing and connecting rod large end bearing appears continuously whilst the feed of oil to <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing appears {{in the form of a}} few pulsations. Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|E

The cylinder head design is similar to the Ford FE tunnel-port head used in the GT40 and Can-Am series racing. So large are the intake ports that the pushrods run through the center of each port via pressed-in tubes, in addition to streamlined airfoils over the tubes themselves to improve port shape, and increase flow velocity.

It shared the 4.121 in bore of the 400, but with a 2.84 in stroke for a displacement of 303 cu in. The short deck engine weighed about 40 lb less than the other variants and had an 8000 rpm redline. Pontiac’s SCCA Trans-Am program was promising, with race-ready engines producing [...] to , however the series’ General Competition Rules required the manufacturer to produce no less than 250 vehicles with the 303. Plans were made to produce Firebirds and GTOs with advertised ratings of [...] and [...] respectively but concerns about emissions, the response of the automobile safety lobby, and the warranty implications of a high-revving street engine led to cancellation of the program [...] The total number of Ram Air V engines produced is not known and a handful of Ram Air V 303's may have made their way onto the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am assembly line. Only about 25 303 cu in engines were produced and about a dozen 428s and 366s. More 400 cu in engines were produced by Pontiac than the other versions - estimates range from 80 to 200 units. Quite a few 400s were dealer installed. Ram Air V engines are extremely rare and parts are not readily available.

The crosshead also houses the gudgeon pin on which the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> pivots. In this way, the transverse forces are applied only to the crosshead and its bearings, not to the piston itself.|$|R

A <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> transfers the thermal expansion to a strain gauge, which measures the shift. Since the measuring system (<b>connecting</b> <b>rod)</b> is exposed to the same temperature as the sample and thereby likewise expands, one obtains a relative value, which must be converted afterwards.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{computational}} modal {{analysis of the}} <b>connecting</b> <b>rod.</b> The objective of this project is to investigate {{the effect of the}} modal updating to the dynamic characteristic of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod,</b> and to develop a finite element model of structure. This project also studies the vibration of a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> in order to determine its natural frequencies and mode shapes. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> of the Modenas Kriss 110 cc engine has been considered as the model of the analysis. Structural modeling of <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> has been developed using SOLIDWORK software. The structural model then imported to the MSC. PATRAN software for generating mesh and the numerical analysis was performed using MSC. NASTRAN software. Mesh sensitivity have been done {{in order to determine the}} suitable mesh for further analysis. Result of the modal analysis show that first mode of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> occur at 77. 411 Hz with higher displacement equal to 16. 7 mm. Natural frequency of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> can be increase by improvement of the properties of the material. In modal updating analysis show that material with lower density and higher Modulus of Young’s will increase the natural frequency of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod...</b>|$|R
