50|$|An {{important}} local landmark originally part of {{the early}} Waverly community still exists in Abell. The Huntington Baptist Church, at {{the northeast corner of}} 31st Street and Barclay Street, was founded in 1836 as a small Sabbath school for convalescent soldiers. Throughout the early 19th century men from Ft. McHenry were moved to the higher and healthier atmosphere of the Abell area, near the intersection of Old and New York Roads, to escape the threat of malaria. Occasionally, convalescing soldiers from the barracks would attend Baptist services in private homes of the neighborhood. A Sabbath school was established nearby in an old barracks building in 1836. Alternate visiting ministers preached weekly sermons for soldiers and a few civilians. In 1846 James Wilson, a large landowner in the area, erected a small chapel which he called the Huntington Baptist Church. The congregation grew steadily until it required a new building in 1873. Modeled after Talmage's Tabernacle in Brooklyn, it was covered with <b>corrugated</b> <b>iron</b> <b>plates.</b> In service for fifty years, the old tabernacle landmark was replaced in 1922 with the present church.|$|R
