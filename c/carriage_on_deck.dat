The masts gave way.” It was about 11:30 PM and Peel, who was seated in his <b>carriage</b> <b>on</b> the main <b>deck,</b> {{explained}} “the vessel all {{of a sudden}} came into collision with another vessel. The carriage was cut in two, and I was thrown against the bulwarks of the vessel. I recovered from the shock in an instant, but it was a miracle that I was not killed.” The Ercolano had struck the Sicilia. The unnamed individual who had attempted to warn the helmsman got into a boat two sailors were launching and commented “this was how I was saved.” Meanwhile Edward Knight rushed to aid his wife, Charlotte, and their two young sons, but later wrote to his wife’s family “that I could not get there, the deck being crushed down before the door. I broke into the adjoining cabin, but found I could not get through to theirs. I then got a partition from the gentlemen’s cabin and climbed up <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> where I found the maids, one jammed up to the knees, among the ruins <b>on</b> the <b>deck.</b> I put her out and asked where was her mistress. She could not answer but the other maid pointed down into the cabin but only said, you can’t save them, save yourself. I then began tearing up the ruins of the deck to get down into the cabin, but the lantern went out and the next moment as I was moving a piece of timber fell from above and took off my left thumb at the first joint. I tied my neck handkerchief around it then finding that the ship was all broken up amid and the remains of the deck where I was only being just above water and seeing no more of the maids I went toward the quarter deck. As I got there all the remaining persons at that end of the ship jumped overboard, except one [...] [...] [...]” Charlotte Knight, the two young sons, and the servants were all lost. Another ten English passengers were lost as well. In addition to Edward Knight and Sir Robert Peel three other English men were among the survivors.

40|$|CIVINSModels are {{developed}} for a state-of-the-art time-domain ship motion program to predict ship motions during flooding and green water <b>on</b> <b>deck</b> events.

This research looks at the first two subproblems, both of which involve shallow water wave theory.
