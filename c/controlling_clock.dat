40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present an {{original}} neighborhood mechanism for WTM self-organizing Kohonen map implemented in CMOS 0. 18 μm process. Proposed mechanism is an asynchronous circuit {{and does not}} require <b>controlling</b> <b>clock</b> generator. Propagation of an enable signal from a winning neuron to neurons that belong to the winner’s neighborhood is very fast. For example radius (R) of the neighborhood equal to 15, total time that is required to start adaptation of all neighboring neurons is below 10 ns. This makes the proposed WTM network in practice {{as fast as the}} WTA Kohonen network. When compared to WTM networks implemented, for example in C++, the proposed solution can be even several hundreds times faster and consume much less power. ...|$|E

This feature renders an accurate signal processing unit. The system's main building blocks are an analog shift register and a switched current multiplier.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel discrete-time and fully programmable {{cellular neural network}} (CNN) suitable for processing one-dimensional (1 -D) signals. As 1 -D signals are typically very long sequences, the system consists of a linear analog shift register for data I/O coupled to a 1 ×n CNN array. In addition to the 1 -D CNN architecture, a unique feature of our implementation is {{that the number of}} multipliers needed to implement both CNN templates has been minimized. This is conceivable because the multipliers are multiplexed between the A*y and B*u products during alternating phases of the <b>controlling</b> <b>clock.</b> The CNN system has been implemented in current mode based on the S 2 I technique using MOSIS Orbit 2 µm CMOS technology.

40|$|Abstract Background With the {{completion}} of genome sequences belonging {{to some of the}} major crop plants, new challenges arise to utilize this data for crop improvement and increased food security. The field of genetical genomics has the potential to identify genes displaying heritable differential expression associated to important phenotypic traits. Here we describe the identification of expression QTLs (eQTLs) in two different potato tissues of a segregating potato population and query the potato genome sequence to differentiate between cis- and trans-acting eQTLs in relation to gene subfunctionalization. Results Leaf and tuber samples were analysed and screened for the presence of conserved and tissue dependent eQTLs. Expression QTLs present in both tissues are predominantly cis-acting whilst for tissue specific QTLs, the percentage of trans-acting QTLs increases. Tissue dependent eQTLs were assigned to functional classes and visualized in metabolic pathways. We identified a potential regulatory network on chromosome 10 involving genes crucial for maintaining circadian rhythms and <b>controlling</b> <b>clock</b> output genes. In addition, we show that the type of genetic material screened and sampling strategy applied, can have a high impact on the output of genetical genomics studies. Conclusions Identification of tissue dependent regulatory networks based on mapped differential expression not only gives us insight in tissue dependent gene subfunctionalization but brings new insights into key biological processes and delivers targets for future haplotyping and genetic marker development. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{circadian}} {{clock is}} an endogenous mechanism that coordinates biological processes with daily and seasonal {{changes in the}} environment. Heterodimerization of central clock components is an important way of <b>controlling</b> <b>clock</b> function in several different circadian systems. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA 1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) are Myb-related proteins that function in or close to the central oscillator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Single mutants of cca 1 and lhy have a phenotype of short-period rhythms. cca 1 lhy double mutants show an even shorter period phenotype than the cca 1 single mutant, suggesting that CCA 1 and LHY are only partially functionally redundant. To determine whether CCA 1 and LHY act in parallel or synergistically in the circadian clock, we examined their expression in both light-grown and etiolated seedlings. We have shown that LHY and CCA 1 bind to the same region of the promoter of a Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (Lhcb, also known as CAB). CCA 1 and LHY can form homodimers, and they also colocalize in the nucleus and heterodimerize in vitro and in vivo. In Arabidopsis, CCA 1 and LHY physically interact in a manner independent of photoperiod. Moreover, results from gel filtration chromatography indicate that CCA 1 and LHY {{are present in the}} same large complex in plants. Taken together, these results imply that CCA 1 and LHY function synergistically in regulating circadian rhythms of Arabidopsis...|$|E
