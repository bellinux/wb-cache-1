5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called <b>chromatin.</b> Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the <b>chromatin</b> structure or else by remodeling carried out by <b>chromatin</b> remodeling complexes (see <b>Chromatin</b> remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect <b>chromatin</b> and gene expression.|$|E
5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime may make the <b>chromatin</b> of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the <b>chromatin</b> of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} relaxation {{subsequent to}} DNA damage, followed by DNA repair, <b>chromatin</b> recovers to a compaction state {{close to its}} pre-damage level after about 20 min.|$|E
5|$|By intercalation, {{doxorubicin}} {{can also}} induce histone eviction from transcriptionally active <b>chromatin.</b> As a result, DNA damage response, epigenome and transcriptome are deregulated in doxorubicin-exposed cells.|$|E
5|$|Perichromatin fibrils {{are visible}} only under {{electron}} microscope. They are located {{next to the}} transcriptionally active <b>chromatin</b> and are hypothesized to be the sites of active pre-mRNA processing.|$|E
5|$|Some serpins {{are both}} {{protease}} inhibitors and perform additional roles. For example, the nuclear cysteine protease inhibitor MENT, in birds also {{acts as a}} <b>chromatin</b> remodelling molecule in a bird's red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as <b>chromatin,</b> and during cell division the <b>chromatin</b> can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>chromatin.</b> Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and {{contains}} genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the <b>chromatin</b> organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called chromosome territories. Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of <b>chromatin</b> organization, in particular, nucleosomes, have been {{associated}} with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromatin</b> {{structure}} inhibition is {{the process}} wherein the promoter is hidden by <b>chromatin</b> structure. <b>Chromatin</b> structure is controlled by post-translational modification of the histones involved and leads to gross levels of high or low transcription levels. See: <b>chromatin,</b> histone, and nucleosome.|$|E
25|$|The DNA + histone = <b>chromatin</b> definition: The DNA {{double helix}} {{in the cell}} nucleus is {{packaged}} by special proteins termed histones. The formed protein/DNA complex is called <b>chromatin.</b> The basic structural unit of <b>chromatin</b> is the nucleosome.|$|E
25|$|For {{additional}} information, see Histone {{modifications in}} <b>chromatin</b> regulation and RNA polymerase control by <b>chromatin</b> structure.|$|E
25|$|The heterotrimeric {{chaperone}} <b>chromatin</b> assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is a <b>chromatin</b> formation {{protein that}} {{is involved in}} depositing histones onto both newly replicated DNA strands to form <b>chromatin.</b> CAF-1 contains a PCNA-binding motif, called a PIP-box, that allows CAF-1 to associate with the replisome through PCNA {{and is able to}} deposit histone H3-H4 dimers onto newly synthesized DNA. The Rtt106 chaperone is also involved in this process, and associated with CAF-1 and H3-H4 dimers during <b>chromatin</b> formation. These processes load newly synthesized histones onto DNA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromatin</b> {{undergoes}} various {{structural changes}} during a cell cycle. Histone proteins {{are the basic}} packer and arranger of <b>chromatin</b> and can be modified by various post-translational modifications to alter <b>chromatin</b> packing (Histone modification). Most of the modifications occur on the histone tail. The consequences in terms of <b>chromatin</b> accessibility and compaction depend both on the amino-acid that is modified {{and the type of}} modification. For example, Histone acetylation results in loosening and increased accessibility of <b>chromatin</b> for replication and transcription. Lysine tri-methylation can either be correlated with transcriptional activity (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 4) or transcriptional repression and <b>chromatin</b> compaction (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 9 or 27). Several studies suggested that different modifications could occur simultaneously. For example, it was proposed that a bivalent structure (with tri-methylation of both Lysine 4 and 27 on histone H3) was involved in mammalian early development.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chromatin</b> {{changes are}} a {{plausible}} {{explanation for the}} co-regulation seen in clusters. <b>Chromatin</b> consists of the DNA strand and histones that {{are attached to the}} DNA. Regions were <b>chromatin</b> is very tightly packed are called heterochromatin. Heterochromatin consists very often of remains of viral genomes, transposons and other junk DNA. Because of tight packing the DNA is almost unreachable for the transcript machinery, covering deleterious DNA with proteins {{is the way in which}} the cell can protect itself. <b>Chromatin</b> which consists of functional genes is often an open structure were the DNA is accessible. However, most of the genes are not needed to be expressed all the time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromatin</b> is {{the complex}} of DNA and protein {{found in the}} {{eukaryotic}} nucleus, which packages chromosomes. The structure of <b>chromatin</b> varies significantly between different stages of the cell cycle, {{according to the requirements}} of the DNA.|$|E
25|$|The spatial {{arrangement}} of the <b>chromatin</b> within the nucleus is not random - specific regions of the <b>chromatin</b> {{can be found in}} certain territories. Territories are, for example, the lamina-associated domains (LADs), and the topological association domains (TADs), which are bound together by protein complexes. Currently, polymer models such as the Strings & Binders Switch (SBS) model and the Dynamic Loop (DL) model are used to describe the folding of <b>chromatin</b> within the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|MACC {{profiling}} (Micrococcal nuclease ACCessibility profiling) uses titration {{series of}} <b>chromatin</b> digests with micrococcal nuclease to identify <b>chromatin</b> accessibility {{as well as}} to map nucleosomes and non-histone DNA-binding proteins in both open and closed regions of the genome.|$|E
25|$|The {{assembly}} of the minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins function together as a complex in the cell. The {{assembly of}} the Mcm proteins onto <b>chromatin</b> requires the coordinated function of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1. Once the Mcm proteins have been loaded onto the <b>chromatin,</b> ORC and Cdc6 can {{be removed from the}} <b>chromatin</b> without preventing subsequent DNA replication. This suggests that the primary role of the pre-replication complex is to correctly load the Mcm proteins.|$|E
25|$|Cdc45 {{associates}} with <b>chromatin</b> after {{the beginning of}} initiation in late G1 stage and during the S phase of the cell cycle. Cdc45 physically {{associates with}} Mcm5 and displays genetic interactions with {{five of the six}} members of the Mcm gene family and the ORC2 gene. The loading of Cdc45 onto <b>chromatin</b> is critical for loading other various replication proteins, including DNA polymerase α, DNA polymerase ε, replication protein A (RPA) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto <b>chromatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are, however, many {{cells that}} do not follow this organisation. For example, {{spermatozoa}} and avian red blood cells have more tightly packed <b>chromatin</b> than most eukaryotic cells, and trypanosomatid protozoa do not condense their <b>chromatin</b> into visible chromosomes for mitosis.|$|E
25|$|Binding of Cdc45 to <b>chromatin</b> {{depends on}} Clb-Cdc28 kinase {{activity}} {{as well as}} functional Cdc6 and Mcm2, which suggests that Cdc45 associates with the pre-RC after activation of S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). As indicated by the timing and the CDK dependence, binding of Cdc45 to <b>chromatin</b> is crucial for commitment to initiation of DNA replication. During S phase, Cdc45 physically interacts with Mcm proteins on chromatin; however, dissociation of Cdc45 from <b>chromatin</b> is slower than that of Mcm's, which indicates that the proteins are released by different mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Pyknosis: {{the nucleus}} shrinks and the <b>chromatin</b> condenses.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptional {{inhibition}} through microRNA-mediated <b>chromatin</b> reorganization {{followed by}} gene silencing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromatin</b> immunoprecipitation with {{sequencing}} (ChIP-seq) is {{a method}} used to identify protein binding sites on DNA and assess histone modifications. This tool has enabled examination of epigenetic regulation of browning and helps elucidate the mechanisms by which protein-DNA interactions stimulate the differentiation of beige adipocytes. Studies observing the <b>chromatin</b> landscapes of beige adipocytes have found that adipogenesis of these cells results from the formation of cell specific <b>chromatin</b> landscapes, which regulate the transcriptional program and, ultimately, control differentiation. Using ChIP-seq {{in conjunction with other}} tools, recent studies have identified over 30 transcriptional and epigenetic factors that influence beige adipocyte development.|$|E
25|$|DNA with {{genes that}} aren’t needed can {{be covered with}} histones. When a gene must be {{expressed}} special proteins can alter the chemical that {{are attached to the}} histones (histone modifications) that cause the histones to open the structure. When the <b>chromatin</b> of one gene is opened, the <b>chromatin</b> of the adjacent genes is also until this modification meets a boundary element. In that way genes is close proximity are expressed on the same time. So, genes are clustered in “expression hubs”. In comparison with this model Gilbert et al. (2004) showed that RIDGEs are mostly present in open <b>chromatin</b> structures.|$|E
25|$|Some use {{the term}} {{chromosome}} in a wider sense, {{to refer to the}} individualized portions of <b>chromatin</b> in cells, either visible or not under light microscopy. However, others use the concept in a narrower sense, to refer to the individualized portions of <b>chromatin</b> during cell division, visible under light microscopy due to high condensation.|$|E
25|$|Transcription – actin is {{involved}} in <b>chromatin</b> reorganization. transcription initiation and interacts with transcription complex. Actin takes part in the regulation of <b>chromatin</b> structure interact with both the RNA polymerase I, II and III In Pol I transcription, actin and myosin (MYO1C, which binds DNA) act as a molecular motor. For Pol II transcription, β-actin is needed {{for the formation of}} the preinitiation complex. Pol III contains β-actin as a subunit. Actin can also be a component of <b>chromatin</b> remodelling complexes as well as pre-mRNP particles (that is, precursor messenger RNA bundled in proteins), and {{is involved}} in nuclear export of RNAs and proteins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromatin</b> {{diminution}} (founding father: Theodor Boveri). In this process, {{found in}} some copepods and roundworms such as Ascaris suum, portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells. This process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost. In A. suum, all the somatic cell precursors undergo <b>chromatin</b> diminution.|$|E
25|$|However Johnidis et al. (2005) {{have shown}} that genes in the same cluster can be very {{differently}} expressed. How eukaryotic gene regulation, and associated <b>chromatin</b> changes, precisely works is still very unclear {{and there is no}} consensus about it. In order to get a clear picture about the mechanism of gene clusters first the workings <b>chromatin</b> and gene regulation needs to be illuminated.|$|E
25|$|Polycomb-group {{proteins}} {{play a role}} {{in regulating}} genes through modulation of <b>chromatin</b> structure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromatin</b> {{structure}} oriented factors. Based on histone post translational modifications - phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquination.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{may affect}} the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other <b>chromatin</b> remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive <b>chromatin,</b> termed heterochromatin. This link between DNA methylation and <b>chromatin</b> structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer.|$|E
25|$|During {{metazoan}} spermiogenesis, the spermatid's <b>chromatin</b> is remodeled {{into a more}} spaced-packaged, widened, almost crystal-like structure. This {{process is}} associated with the cessation of transcription and involves nuclear protein exchange. The histones are mostly displaced, and replaced by protamines (small, arginine-rich proteins). It is proposed that in yeast, regions devoid of histones become very fragile after transcription; HMO1 an HMGB protein helps in stabilizing nucleosomes-free <b>chromatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In fission yeast and Xenopus, <b>chromatin</b> {{licensing}} and DNA replication factor 1 (Cdt1) protein {{is required for}} the licensing of <b>chromatin</b> for DNA replication. Cdt1 is essential for DNA replication and performs its role during the formation of the pre-replicative complex by loading the minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm) onto the chromosome. Cdt1 has been shown to associate with the C terminus of Cdc6 to cooperatively promote the association of Mcm proteins to the <b>chromatin.</b> Cdt1 activity during the cell cycle is tightly regulated by its association with the protein geminin, which both inhibits Cdt1 activity during S phase in order to prevent re-replication of DNA and prevents it from ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis.|$|E
