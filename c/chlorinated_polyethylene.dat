40|$|ABSTRACT: Systematic {{electrical}} and physicomechanical {{studies have been}} carried out on natural rubber (NR) blended with synthetic rubber ethylene– propylene diene monomer (EPDM) as non-polar rubber. The permittivity (" 0) and dielectric loss (" 0 0) of this blend have been measured over a wide range of frequencies (42 Hz– 5 MHz) at room temperature (25 C). Compatibility of NR–EPDM can be enhanced by the addition of compatibilizers, such as polybutadiene (BR), <b>chlorinated</b> rubber, chloro-sulfonated <b>polyethylene</b> (SPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and graft copolymerization of EPDM with metallic anhydride [EPDM-g-MAH].

50|$|Plasticizers make it {{possible}} to achieve improved compound processing characteristics, while also providing flexibility in the end-use product. Ester plasticizers are selected based upon cost-performance evaluation. The rubber compounder must evaluate ester plasticizers for compatibility, processibility, permanence and other performance properties. The wide variety of ester chemistries that are in production include sebacates, adipates, terephthalates, dibenzoates, gluterates, phthalates, azelates, and other specialty blends. This broad product line provides an array of performance benefits required for the many elastomer applications such as tubing and hose products, flooring, wall-coverings, seals and gaskets, belts, wire and cable, and print rolls. Low to high polarity esters provide utility {{in a wide range of}} elastomers including nitrile, polychloroprene, EPDM, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> and epichlorohydrin. Plasticizer-elastomer interaction is governed by many factors such as solubility parameter, molecular weight, and chemical structure.

40|$|Objectives. The {{degradation}} of maxillofacial prosthetic elastomers that occurs during physical weathering is usually {{responsible for the}} replacement of prostheses. In this study the mechanical behavior of 4 non-pigmented facial prosthetic elastomers, exposed to outdoor weathering for 1 year, was investigated. The hypothesis investigated was that irradiation time {{did not affect the}} properties measured. Methods. The samples were exposed to solar radiation for 1 year in Thessaloniki (Greece). Three different types of polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CPE) samples were tested in this study. Mechanical tests (compressive-tensile) were performed using a universal type testing machine. Hardness tests were evaluated using a durometer tester. Simple mathematical models were developed to correlate the measured properties with irradiation time. The stress-strain data of compression and tensile tests were modeled using parameters such as maximum stress (sigma(max)), maximum strain (epsilon(max)), elasticity parameter (E), and non-linearity parameter (p), while the mathematical model used for hardness data involves initial hardness of materials (H- 0). Results. Two of the silicone prosthetics (Elastomer 42, TechSil 25) seem to become harder and more brittle contrary to the other silicone (M 511) and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CPE) samples that become softer and more ductile. Duration of exposure increases these phenomena. Conclusion. The effect of irradiation time on the mechanical behavior was introduced through its effect on the models' parameters.

Purpose: This {{study investigated the}} physical properties of an experimental, facial prosthetic after immersion for 6 months in simulated sebum, and perspiration at 37 degrees C. Material and Methods: <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (CPE) specimens were immersed in simulated perspiration {{as well as in}} sebum. Compression tests were conducted on a Zwick testing machine. Shore A hardness measurements were carried out in a CV digital Shore A durometer. Melting and glass transition temperatures were evaluated with a differential scanning calorimeter. Weight changes were measured and color changes were determined in the CIE LAB system using a MiniScan XE spectrophotometer. Simple mathematical models were developed to correlate the measured properties with immersion time. The data were also subjected to analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey multiple range tests at a level of alpha = 0. 05. Results: Specimens immersed in perspiration became harder due to facilitation of the propagation of cross-linking reaction that probably occurred during aging of the CPE samples. Some weight increase was observed for the specimens immersed into the aqueous solutions, whereas for those immersed in sebum, weight loss was recorded, probably because of extraction of some compounds. The color change was higher for the specimens immersed in sebum than that corresponding to simulated perspiration.

Toughening and fracture mechanism in acrylate-modified PVC were also investigated. The results show that all the acrylate rubber-toughened PVC blends have successfully shifted the ductileâ€“brittle transition points to a lower temperature. However, the impact modifiers were found to differ in their efficiency to shift the ductile to brittle transition. The findings from the SEM study shows that the fibrous yielding phenomenon observed is an indication of the transition of the brittle stage to ductile stage and correlates well with the large increases of the impact strength. ...|$|E
40|$|PVC-U is an {{important}} material nowadays because of its widely used in construction and manufacturing as an alternative materials beside to wood and metal. The impact properties of PVC-U will become brittle once it is exposed to low temperature, subjected to high strain rate and occurrence of notching. The effects of using acrylic and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>polyethylene</b> impact modifiers, white rice husk ash (WRHA) and LICA 38 in PVC-U composites were presented in this research. Mixing {{was carried out by}} using a blender. PVC-U composites of different impact modifier and filler loading were compounded using two-roll mill and the specimens for impact strength testing was prepared using hot-press. Impact strength was measured according to Izod mode. The dimension for the specimens was according to ASTM D 256 A on an Izod mode. Different composition of acrylic, CPE and WHRA were used in this study. As the impact modifier content was increased from 0 to 8 phr, impact strength increased steadily for both impact modifiers. As the filter content was increased from 10 to 30 phr, impact strength decreased steadily. It is interesting to observe that titanate-coupling agent (LICA 38) is successful in increasing PCV composites with 20 phr WRHA by 58. 3 % for acrylic modified PVC-U and by 21 % by CPE modified PVC-U. This shows that LICA 38 is effective in enhancing the interfacial adhesion between WRHA and PVC-U matrix...|$|E
