25|$|The park's {{management}} team during the mid-1990s {{was a source}} of controversy among fans and employees. In an effort to boost profits, various changes were begun by then-executives Cynthia Harriss and Paul Pressler. While their initiatives provided a short-term increase in shareholder returns, they drew widespread criticism for their lack of foresight. The retail backgrounds of Harriss and Pressler led to a gradual shift in Disneyland's focus from attractions to merchandising. Outside consultants McKinsey & Company were brought in to help streamline operations, resulting in many changes and cutbacks. After nearly a decade of deferred maintenance, the original park was showing signs of neglect. Fans of the park decried the perceived decline in <b>customer</b> <b>value</b> and park quality and rallied for the dismissal of the {{management team}}.|$|E

40|$|Customers can {{interact}} with and create value for firms {{in a variety}} of ways. This article proposes that assessing the <b>value</b> of <b>customers</b> based solely upon their transactions with a firm may not be sufficient, and valuing this engagement correctly is crucial in avoiding undervaluation and overvaluation of customers. We propose four components of a <b>customer’s</b> engagement <b>value</b> (CEV) with a firm. The first component is <b>customer</b> lifetime <b>value</b> (the <b>customer’s</b> purchase behavior), the second is <b>customer</b> referral <b>value</b> (as it relates to incentivized referral of new customers), the third is <b>customer</b> influencer <b>value</b> (which includes the customer’s behavior to influence other customers, that is increasing acquisition, retention, and share of wallet through word of mouth of existing customers as well as prospects), and the fourth is <b>customer</b> knowledge <b>value</b> (the value added to the firm by feedback from the customer). CEV provides a comprehensive framework that can ultimately lead to more efficient marketing strategies that enable higher long-term contribution from the customer. Metrics to measure CEV, future research propositions regarding relationships between the four components of CEV are proposed and marketing strategies that can leverage these rela-tionships suggested.

50|$|There {{are four}} common and {{critical}} challenges that managers face {{when attempting to}} design and implement a marketing strategy that best relates to <b>customer</b> <b>values.</b> The first issue that managers face is the challenge of understanding exactly what <b>customers</b> <b>value</b> in a global supply chain5. Understanding <b>customer</b> <b>values</b> in a global supply chain focuses {{on the task of}} identifying what supply streams <b>customers</b> <b>value</b> most. The second challenge is having to understand the constant changes in <b>customer</b> <b>values</b> throughout global supply chains5. Since customers are constantly changing what they value, staying ahead of the trend and attempting to predict changing values is increasingly difficult.The third challenge is having to deliver values in a new environment that has never seen this level of marketplace5. The global market is becoming increasingly prevalent which companies are taking advantage of, therefore the challenge of attempting to deliver values in a country/region that has never been exposed to a marketplace such as this before arises.The final challenge is creating and staying committed to the solutions designed to address these issues5. Solutions to these challenges are implemented and it is a challenge within itself to stick to these solutions especially as businesses have increased emphasis on cost reduction efforts.|$|R
