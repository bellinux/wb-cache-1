5|$|Experimental work in 1986 {{showed that}} Suillus bovinus could metabolise {{proteins}} and peptides directly, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> drop in nitrogen in growth media, which suggested the species has some saprophytic activity.|$|E
50|$|Considerable {{force is}} needed to <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> {{cervical}} fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common <b>causes.</b> <b>A</b> severe, sudden twist to the neck or a severe {{blow to the head}} or neck area can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> cervical fracture.|$|R

5|$|In some rare cases, {{a single}} amino acid {{change in a}} serpin's RCL alters its {{specificity}} to target the wrong protease. For example, the Antitrypsin-Pittsburgh mutation (M358R) causes the α1-antitrypsin serpin to inhibit thrombin, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> bleeding disorder.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} for the clot to break off and migrate (embolise) to the lungs, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> pulmonary embolism. An analysis of earlier case reports concludes that this occurs in about 10% of cases, but has a very poor prognosis.|$|E
50|$|From Newton, {{force can}} be defined as an {{exertion}} or pressure which can <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> object to accelerate. The concept of force is used to describe <b>an</b> influence which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> free body (object) to accelerate. It can be a push or <b>a</b> pull, which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object to change direction, have new velocity, or to deform temporarily or permanently. Generally speaking, force <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object's state of motion to change.|$|R
50|$|The anti-RhE {{antibody}} {{is quite}} common especially in the Rh genotype CDe/CDe; It usually only <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> mild hemolytic disease, but can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe condition in the newborn. It can occur with other antibodies, usually the anti-Rhc antibody, which can also <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe hemolytic disease.|$|R

50|$|Alkalis {{added to}} indium sulfate {{solutions}} precipitate basic salts. For example, potassium hydroxide produces either a basic sulfate, 2 In2O3.SO3•nH2O, or KIn3(OH)6(SO4)2 depending on pH. Sodium pyrophosphate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> slimy precipitate of indium pyrophosphate, In4(P2O7)3•3H2O. Potassium periodate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of a basic indium periodate, 2 InO5•In(OH)3•6 H2O. Oxalic acid <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of indium oxalate, In2(C2O4)3•10 H2O. Alkali oxalates <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of the alkali dioxalatoindate to form: MIn(C2O4)2•3 H2O where M=Na, K or NH4.|$|R

5|$|A Malaysian {{species of}} ant in the Camponotus cylindricus group has {{enlarged}} mandibular glands that extend into their gaster. When disturbed, workers rupture the membrane of the gaster, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> burst of secretions containing acetophenones and other chemicals that immobilise small insect attackers. The worker subsequently dies.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprophytic}} fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains {{nutrients from}} forest litter and decomposing wood, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> brown rot {{on the wood}} upon which it grows. A Finnish field study on tree stumps in a forest near Helsinki found that the species colonised them after 6–7 years.|$|E

Five countries entered the maximum of five athletes per race: Ethiopia, Japan, Kenya, South Africa, and the United States. British runner Andrew Lemoncello was scheduled to be his country's sole representative in the men's race, but he was refused entry into the country without explanation, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> dispute between UK Athletics and the Chinese Athletic Association.|$|E
5|$|According to the Montour County Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan, a {{major failure}} in the Lake Chillisquaque Dam could cause damage to several nearby communities, such as Strawberry Ridge and Washingtonville. It {{could also result in}} a {{decrease}} in the output of the Montour Power Plant, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> brownout in the area. A severe failure of the dam is considered by the Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan to be the most dangerous threat to Montour County.|$|E

5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E
5|$|As the {{understanding}} of geodynamics improves, these models {{will be subject to}} revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, <b>causing</b> <b>a</b> supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the temple}} {{farthest}} from the door was a substantial monument to Robert Petre, a renowned 18th-century horticulturist.

50|$|If an {{aircraft}} in flight suffers a disturbance in pitch that <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> increase (or decrease) in angle of attack, {{it is desirable}} that the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> decrease (or increase) in angle of attack so that the disturbance does not <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> continuous increase (or decrease) in angle of attack.
