5|$|Megabat species {{often have}} {{eyesight}} as good as, {{if not better}} than, human vision. Their eyesight, unlike that of their microbat relatives, is adapted to both night and daylight vision including some <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|E
5|$|Our {{visual system}} is {{supposed}} to throw away information about the illuminant and extract information about the actual reflectance... but I've studied individual differences in <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> for 30 years, {{and this is one}} of the biggest individual differences I've ever seen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently we {{have shown}} that children's ability to {{perceive}} motion-defined forms shows an asymmetry in {{the left and right}} visual half-fields which disappears in adulthood. The present study is focused on the visual half-field development of <b>colour</b> contrast <b>vision</b> in the same group of subjects. It was found that colour contrast thresholds for the detection of colour-contrast-defined forms decrease with age to reach adult values around puberty. This improvement of <b>colour</b> contrast <b>vision</b> with age is attributed to the maturation of cortical mechanisms. However, in contrast to a visual half-field asymmetry for motion detection during childhood, no visual half-field differences were observed for colour contrast detection in children...|$|R
5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, {{the cornea}} becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and {{associated}} glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were {{a first step}} in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive {{to a wide range of}} wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{entire plant}} is toxic (including {{the roots and}} seeds). Mortality is rare, but case reports do exist. Most plant {{exposures}} occur in children younger than six years and are usually unintentional and without associated significant toxicity. More serious toxicity occurs with intentional ingestions by adolescents and adults. Early symptoms of ingestion include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, wild hallucinations, delirium, and severe headache. Depending on {{the severity of the}} toxicosis, the victim may later suffer irregular and slow pulse, tremors, various cerebral disturbances, especially of a visual nature (unusual <b>colour</b> <b>visions</b> (see xanthopsia) with objects appearing yellowish to green, and blue halos around lights), convulsions, and deadly disturbances of the heart. For a case description, see the paper by Lacassie. Vincent van Gogh's [...] "Yellow Period" [...] may have been influenced by digitalis therapy which, at the time, was thought to control seizures. As noted above, other oculotoxic effects of digitalis include generalized blurry vision, as well as seeing a [...] "halo" [...] around each point of light.|$|R

5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have small}} rounded ears {{so as to}} {{minimise}} heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have <b>colour</b> <b>vision,</b> perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better {{than that of the}} dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of light. <b>Colour</b> <b>vision</b> appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E
5|$|The photo {{originated}} from a washed-out colour {{photograph of a}} dress posted on the social networking service Tumblr. In the first week after the surfacing of the image alone, more than 10 million tweets mentioned the dress, using hashtags such as #thedress, #whiteandgold and #blackandblue. Although the actual colour of the dress was eventually confirmed to be black and blue, the image prompted discussions surrounding the matter across various platforms, with users discussing their opinions on the colour and why they perceived the dress as being a certain colour. At the same time, members {{of the scientific community}} began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|E
5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during the breeding season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage. The breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve <b>colour</b> <b>vision.</b> In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so {{may be even more}} prominent to other fairywrens, whose <b>colour</b> <b>vision</b> extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E
