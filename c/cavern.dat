Skanska/Traylor were still installing waterproofing and steel reinforcement, as well as putting concrete around the underground <b>cavern,</b> entrances, and ancillaries. , entrances 1 and 2 were being built, and excavation was 100% complete; , the station shell was complete, bringing the total Second Avenue Subway project progress to three-fourths completion.|$|E
5|$|Space <b>Cavern</b> was {{developed}} by Games by Apollo. Company founder Pat Roper had flown programmer Ed Salvo to a Consumer Electronics Show to show him the Imagic video game Demon Attack.

Space <b>Cavern</b> was released in 1982. Game publisher Panda rereleased an identical version of Space <b>Cavern</b> under the name Space Canyon the following year, and an Atari 5200 port was started but not completed.|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a series}} of three-dimensional simulations for the Bayou Choctaw Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The U. S. Department of Energy plans to leach two new <b>caverns</b> and convert one of the existing <b>caverns</b> within the Bayou Choctaw salt dome to expand its petroleum reserve storage capacity. An existing finite element mesh from previous analyses is modified by changing the locations of two <b>caverns.</b> The structural integrity of the three expansion <b>caverns</b> and the interaction between all the <b>caverns</b> in the dome are investigated. The impacts of the expansion on underground creep closure, surface subsidence, infrastructure, and well integrity are quantified. Two scenarios {{were used for the}} duration and timing of workover conditions where wellhead pressures are temporarily reduced to atmospheric pressure. The three expansion <b>caverns</b> are predicted to be structurally stable against tensile failure for both scenarios. Dilatant failure is not expected within the vicinity of the expansion <b>caverns.</b> Damage to surface structures is not predicted and there is not a marked increase in surface strains due to the presence of the three expansion <b>caverns.</b> The wells into the <b>caverns</b> should not undergo yield. The results show that from a structural viewpoint, the locations of the two newly proposed expansion <b>caverns</b> are acceptable, and all three expansion <b>caverns</b> can be safely constructed and operated...|$|R

The remaining matches were played at the larger Håkons Hall in Lillehammer. In March 1995, the operator announced that the ice would remain throughout the year. Because of the natural cooling of the mountain, the operator saved 1,000 kilowatts in heating costs by reusing the cooling system to heat {{the rest of the}} <b>cavern</b> hall. On 4 April 1995, the venue was used to host an international match between Norway and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain <b>cavern</b> halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a <b>cavern</b> hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E

40|$|The {{conditions}} and occurrence of gas in crude oil stored in Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, <b>caverns</b> is characterized in this report. Many <b>caverns</b> in the SPR show that gas has intruded into the {{oil from the}} surrounding salt dome. Historical evidence and the analyses presented here suggest that gas will continue to intrude into many SPR <b>caverns</b> in the future. In considering why only some <b>caverns</b> contain gas, it is concluded that the naturally occurring spatial variability in salt permeability can explain the range of gas content measured in SPR <b>caverns.</b> Further, {{it is not possible}} to make a one-to-one correlation between specific geologic phenomena and the occurrence of gas in salt <b>caverns.</b> However, gas is concluded to be petrogenic in origin. Consequently, attempts have been made to associate the occurrence of gas with salt inhomogeneities including anomalies and other structural features. Two scenarios for actual gas intrusion into <b>caverns</b> were investigated for consistency with existing information. These scenarios are gas release during leaching and gas permeation through salt. Of these mechanisms, the greater consistency comes from the belief that gas permeates to <b>caverns</b> through the salt. A review of historical operating data for five Bryan Mound <b>caverns</b> loosely supports the hypothesis that higher operating pressures reduce gas intrusion into <b>caverns.</b> This conclusion supports a permeability intrusion mechanism. Further, it provides justification for operating the <b>caverns</b> near maximum operating pressure to minimize gas intrusion. Historical gas intrusion rates and estimates of future gas intrusion are given for all <b>caverns...</b>|$|R
