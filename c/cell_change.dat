5000|$|LTD affects hippocampal synapses {{between the}} Schaffer {{collaterals}} and the CA1 pyramidal cells. LTD at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses {{depends on the}} timing and frequency of calcium influx. LTD occurs at these synapses when Schaffer collaterals are stimulated repetitively for extended time periods (10-15 minutes) at a low frequency (approximately 1 Hz). Depressed excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) result from this particular stimulation pattern. The magnitude of calcium signal in the postsynaptic cell largely determines whether LTD or LTP occurs; LTD is brought about by small, slow rises in postsynaptic calcium levels. When Ca2+ entry is below threshold, it leads to LTD. The threshold level in area CA1 is on a sliding scale {{that depends on the}} history of the synapse. If the synapse has already been subject to LTP, the threshold is raised, increasing the probability that a calcium influx will yield LTD. In this way, a [...] "negative feedback" [...] system maintains synaptic plasticity. [...] Activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, which belong to a class of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), is required for calcium entry into the CA1 postsynaptic <b>cell.</b> <b>Change</b> in voltage provides a graded control of postsynaptic Ca2+ by regulating NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ influx, which is responsible for initiating LTD.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clear <b>cell</b> <b>change,</b> {{which may}} {{occur in a}} variety of thyroid neoplasms, is an {{uncommon}} finding. A fine needle aspirate of a follicular neoplasm showing extensive clear cell morphology is even more rarely described in the literature. CASE: We report the fine needle aspiration cytology of a case of follicular neoplasm undergoing clear <b>cell</b> <b>change</b> due to intracellular accumulation of lipid and mucin. The cytology showed cohesive sheets of nondescript, round to oval cells having ample, pale-staining cytoplasm. Many of the tumor cells tended to cluster around branching capillaries. Adipocytelike cells with discrete cell borders, eccentric nuclei and cytoplasm distended by fat globules were frequently found. The cell block sections also showed scattered ghost outlines of these adipocytelike cells in a mucoid background. Similar findings were noted in the crush preparation of the freshly excised surgical specimen. Histologic examination confirmed the presence of a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma with clear <b>cell</b> <b>change.</b> CONCLUSION: Though the cytologic features of this peculiar morphologic variant of follicular neoplasm may mimic those of mesenchymal lesions or metastatic tumors, recognition of other subtle changes, together with ancillary investigations, is useful in arriving at a correct preoperative diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Columnar <b>cell</b> <b>change</b> {{in breast}} {{epithelium}} is frequently encountered in biopsies performed {{for evaluation of}} radiographically detected microcalcifications. While columnar <b>cell</b> <b>change</b> by itself is typically of no clinical consequence, on occasion cytologic atypia may be present, a finding now termed “flat epithelial atypia (FEA) ”. Morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic associations between FEA and low grade in situ and invasive breast carcinomas provide compelling evidence that FEA represents a precursor lesion in the spectrum of low grade breast neoplasia. Despite this information, the ultimate clinical impact of FEA and, thus, the best management strategy for it remains unknown. Herein, current concepts regarding FEA are reviewed, including pathologic definition, evidence supporting {{its role as a}} neoplastic precursor, and suggested management strategies...|$|E
