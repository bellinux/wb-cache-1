40|$|Abstract. Divided-period method {{based on}} multi-fractal <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameter</b> was {{proposed}} to confine the switching times of control devices {{in the regional}} power system. Using the fractal theory, we can predict fluctuations of the load and calculate the multi-fractal <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameter</b> of different times. Considering the maximum allowable daily switching times of control devices, the demanded times are classified adaptively using hierarchical clustering method by clustering different times which had the similar multi-fractal <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameter.</b> This method not only reduces the switching times of control devices, but also improves the efficiency of compensation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{have studied}} the {{detection}} of epileptic seizure by EEG signals based on embedding dimension as the input <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameter</b> of artificial neural networks has been studied in the research before. The results of the experiments showed that the overall accuracy as high as 100 % can be achieved for distinguishing normal and epileptic EEG time series. In this paper, classification of multi-types of EEG time series based on embedding dimension as input <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameter</b> of artificial neural network will be studied, and the probabilistic neural network (PNN) will be also employed as the classifier for comparing the results with those obtained before. Cao’s method is also applied for computing the embedding dimension of normal and epileptic EEG time series. The results show that different types of EEG time series can be classified using the embedding dimension of EEG time series as <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameter</b> {{when the number of}} feature points exceed some value, however, the accuracy were not satisfied up to now, some work need to be done to improve the classification accuracy...|$|R

50|$|The Earth, {{and almost}} all living things on it, are {{constantly}} bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside our solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an air shower of secondary ionising radiation, including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, and electrons. Ionization from this secondary radiation ensures that the atmosphere is weakly conductive, and that the slight current flow from these ions over the Earth's surface balances the current flow from thunderstorms. Ions have <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameters</b> such as mobility, lifetime, and generation rate that vary with altitude.|$|E

We also show that for all values of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameter</b> of the state, coherent information is always less than zero, so that the state can never used in dense coding protocols. We conjectured the existence of witnesses which can categorize dense codeable states. Comment: The Paper is withdrawn due to a major error in the wor...|$|R

5000|$|Production of many metals (cast iron, grey iron, ductile iron, {{compacted}} graphite iron, 3000 series aluminium alloys, copper alloys, silver, {{and complex}} steels) are {{aided by a}} production technique {{also referred to as}} thermal analysis. A sample of liquid metal is removed from the furnace or ladle and poured into a sample cup with a thermocouple embedded in it. The temperature is then monitored, and the phase diagram arrests (liquidus, eutectic, and solidus) are noted. From this information chemical composition based on the phase diagram can be calculated, or the crystalline structure of the cast sample can be estimated especially for silicon morphology in hypo-eutectic Al-Si cast alloys. [...] Strictly speaking these measurements are cooling curves and a form of sample controlled thermal analysis whereby the cooling rate of the sample is dependent on the cup material (usually bonded sand) and sample volume which is normally a constant due to the use of standard sized sample cups.To detect phase evolution and corresponding characteristic temperatures,cooling curve and its first derivative curve should be considered simultaneously. Examination of cooling and derivative curves is done by using appropriate data analysis software. The process consists of plotting, smoothing and curve fitting as well as identifying the reaction points and <b>characteristic</b> <b>parameters.</b> This procedure is known as Computer-Aided Cooling Curve Thermal Analysis.|$|E
