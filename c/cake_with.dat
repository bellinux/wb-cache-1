They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, <b>cake,</b> <b>with</b> compliments. As they left the fort, the Hessians stripped the American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake {{tends to}} be moist due to the liquid content present in the apple sauce. However, using a chunky-style apple sauce {{can result in a}} <b>cake</b> <b>with</b> less moisture, {{compared}} to using standard apple sauce. Letting it sit for one or two days before serving can increase its flavor, as this allows time for the ingredients to intermingle within the cake.|$|E

5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal <b>cake</b> <b>with</b> black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
5|$|A luncheon at the U.S.Capitol {{has been}} part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the {{outgoing}} President and First Lady).

40|$|Orange <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> {{addition}} of inulin and oligofructose {{to justify a}} prebiotic claim (minimum of 3 g of fructans in a 60 g serving of cake) were investigated regarding sensory aspects. The sensory profile of <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> inulin, with inulin/oligofructose and without prebiotics (standard cake) was evaluated using descriptive quantitative analysis. Preference mapping was assessed using multidimensional scaling on data obtained through an acceptability test with a nine-point hedonic scale. The <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> prebiotics presented greater crust brownness, dough beigeness, hardness and stickiness than the standard cake and lower crumbliness. Principal Component Analysis (69. 5 and 10. 7 % of explanation to {{the first and second}} principal components, respectively) showed that crust brownness, dough beigeness, hardness and stickiness contributed to distinguish the <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> prebiotics from standard cakes. The sensory acceptability was similar for the three cakes and higher when compared to three commercial cakes, but the preference mapping showed that <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> prebiotics were preferred to commercial cakes. Addition of prebiotics in orange cakes is feasible, based on the sensory results, which may facilitate marketing of this functional food with sensorial qualities equivalent to conventional products. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The two then enlist actor Kelsey Grammer to assist them in a bigger scam. Jenna and Kenneth submit a sketch to TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) in Liz's name that requires dozens of cakes. Grammer orders the cakes and later gets refunds for all of them. The gang has now collected money from both TGS and Carvel for 21 free cakes, a windfall of nearly 800 dollars.

5|$|Ranked {{lieutenant}} in the Permanent Military Force (PMF), Pollard was appointed adjutant/quartermaster of the 17th Battalion (Citizens Military Forces), headquartered at North Sydney, in July 1925. He married Daisy Ethel Potter, a typist, at St Andrew's Anglican Church, Strathfield, on 31 October; The Bathurst Times reported that Daisy cut the <b>cake</b> <b>with</b> her husband's Sword of Honour. Pollard departed for India on attachment to the British Army in September 1927, serving with the Royal Fusiliers and the York and Lancaster Regiment. He returned to Sydney in November the following year and was posted as adjutant/quartermaster to, successively, the 18th Battalion (CMF) and, in September 1932, the 44th Battalion (CMF). In December 1932, while serving with the 44th in Western Australia, {{he was promoted to}} captain. Pollard was camp commandant of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia from 1934 to 1936. He was transferred to Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in October 1936. His next posting, in July 1938, was as General Staff Officer Grade3, Training and General Duties, at the 2nd District Base, Sydney. In November 1938, Pollard travelled to England to attend Staff College, Camberley; he graduated in September 1939, the planned two-year course having been curtailed owing to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{selected}} spices {{included in the}} recipe of rye-buckwheat cakes on sensory quality, nutritional value, and Maillard reaction (MR) products formation was addressed in this study. The <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> cloves, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, vanilla, and spice mix addition revealed the highest overall quality values. <b>Cakes</b> enriched <b>with</b> cloves, allspice, and spice mix showed the highest rutin content and almost threefold higher available lysine contents whereas <b>cakes</b> enhanced <b>with</b> mix, cloves, and cinnamon were the richest source of phenolic compounds. The highest antioxidant capacity showed <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> cloves and spice mix. The furosine, a marker of early stage of MR, was decreased in <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> cloves, allspice, spice mix, and vanilla whereas fluorescent intermediatory compounds were reduced in <b>cakes</b> enhanced <b>with</b> cloves, allspice, and cinnamon. In contrast, browning index was increased as compared to cakes without spices. The FAST index was significantly lowered in all <b>cakes</b> enriched <b>with</b> spices, especially with cloves, allspice, and mix addition. The presence of cloves, allspice, and vanilla in cake formula was the most efficient in acrylamide strategy. It can be suggested that cloves, allspice, and vanilla might be used for production of safety and good quality cakes...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} {{effects of}} lipase (0. 003 and 0. 006 g/ 100 g of flour) and emulsifier (0. 5 and 1 g/ 100 g of flour) on fat-replaced (0 %, 50 % and 70 %) batters and <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> inulin (0, 7. 5 and 10 g/ 100 g/of flour, respectively) were studied. Emulsifier addition significantly lowered the relative {{density of the}} batter. Emulsifier incorporation increased the viscoelastic properties of the batter. In contrast, lipase incorporation decreased the degree of system structuring. The evolution of the dynamic moduli and complex viscosity with rising temperatures were studied. Batters with 1 g/ 100 g emulsifier displayed a significantly lower complex viscosity during heating, resulting in collapsed cakes. Differential scanning calorimetry results revealed that the thermal setting in the control cakes occurred at higher temperatures, and accordingly, greater cake expansion was observed. <b>Cakes</b> <b>with</b> 0. 003 g/ 100 g lipase or 0. 5 g/ 100 g emulsifier displayed volume and crumb cell structure that {{were similar to those}} of control cakes. Higher concentrations of both improvers gave rise to <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> lower volume, higher hardness and lower springiness. During storage time, <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> lipase displayed lower hardness. Both improvers, at low concentrations, could improve certain physical characteristics, such as crumb structure, of fat-replaced <b>cakes</b> <b>with</b> inulin...|$|R
