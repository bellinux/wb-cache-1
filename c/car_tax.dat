5|$|Biofuel cars {{in general}} get strong tax {{incentives}} in France, including a 0 or 50% reduction {{on the tax}} on new vehicles, and a 40% reduction on CO2 tax for new cars. For company cars there is a corporate <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> free for 2 years and a recovery of 80% of the value added tax (VAT) on E85 vehicles. Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at € 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per liter, as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85, even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps by year end 2007. French automakers Renault and PSA (Citroen & Peugeot) announced they will start selling FFV cars beginning in the summer 2007.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} established several {{incentives for}} E85 flex-fuel vehicles. These include a fuel duty rebate on E85 fuel of 20 p per liter, until 2010; a £ 10 to 15 {{reduction in the}} vehicle excise duty (VED); and a 2% annual company <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> discount for flex-fuel cars. Despite {{the small number of}} E85 pump stations available, limited to the Morrisons supermarket chain stations, most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market. In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006. Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70. Other models available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel, and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 bioethanol.|$|E

50|$|Mr Swift was {{dismissed}} {{when one of}} the company's <b>car's</b> <b>tax</b> discs was found in his vehicle. Mr Swift was convicted of a crime, and the employer dismissed him. Mr Swift claimed the dismissal was unfair.|$|R
50|$|Taxation can modify {{incentives}} and tax horsepower is no exception. Large capacity (displacement) engines are penalized, so engineers working where engine capacity is taxed {{are encouraged to}} minimize capacity. This rarely happened in the USA, where license plate fees, even adjusted for horsepower ratings, were comparatively much lower than European <b>car</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|R
25|$|During the campaign, the National Coalition made up {{some ground}} but the Fianna Fáil {{manifesto}} of give away promises (no rates, no <b>car</b> <b>tax,</b> and so forth) {{was far too}} attractive for the electorate and the National Coalition was heavily defeated, with Fianna Fáil winning an unprecedented massive parliamentary majority. Fianna Fáil won unexpected second seats in many Dublin constituencies, in particular.|$|E
25|$|The first {{production}} automobile from Honda was the T360 mini pick-up truck, {{which went}} on sale in August 1963. Powered by a small 356-cc straight-4 gasoline engine, it was classified under the cheaper Kei <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> bracket. The first production car from Honda was the S500 sports car, which followed the T360 into production in October 1963. Its chain-driven rear wheels pointed to Honda's motorcycle origins.|$|E
25|$|EVs {{are fully}} exempt {{from both the}} Vehicle Tax due upon {{purchase}} (Imposto Sobre Veículos) and the annual Circulation Tax (Imposto Único de Circulação). Personal income tax provides an allowance of EUR 803 upon the purchase of EVs. EVs are exempt from the 5%-10% company <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> rates which {{are part of the}} Corporation Income Tax. The Budget Law provides for an increase of the depreciation costs related to the purchase of EVs for the purpose of Corporation Income Tax.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycle {{couriers}} {{are especially}} common {{in countries like}} Singapore because the cost of car ownership is very high due to <b>car</b> <b>taxes</b> and a Certificate of Entitlement (COE). Most courier companies make use of motorcycle couriers since the distance between places is relatively short as well {{when it comes to}} making deliveries.|$|R
50|$|The TABOR Foundation has {{partnered with}} Mountain States Legal Foundation to sue to enforce TABOR in Colorado, {{challenging}} <b>car</b> <b>taxes</b> and sales taxes enacted without {{a vote of}} the people.

50|$|A new {{streamlined}} body {{was announced in}} October 1935 and the engine was enlarged 22 per cent by lengthening its stroke by 14 mm. Although the cubic capacity was raised from 2110 cc to 2576 cc this {{did not affect the}} <b>car's</b> <b>tax</b> rating because the RAC formula takes no account of an engine's stroke.|$|R
25|$|Drivers of HEVs in the United Kingdom {{benefit from}} the lowest band of vehicle excise duty (<b>car</b> <b>tax),</b> {{which is based on}} carbon dioxide emissions. In central London, these {{vehicles}} are also exempt from the £11.5 daily London congestion charge. Due to their low levels of regulated emissions, the greenest cars are eligible for 100% discount under the current system. To be eligible the car must be on the current Power Shift Register. At present, these include the cleanest LPG and natural gas cars and most hybrid-, battery- and fuel cell-electric vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Warner {{worked with}} Democratic and {{moderate}} Republican legislators {{and the business}} community to reform the tax code, lowering food and some income taxes while increasing the sales and cigarette taxes. His tax package effected a net tax increase of approximately $1.5 billion annually. Warner credited the additional revenues with saving the state's AAA bond rating, held at the time by only five other states, and allowing the single largest investment in K-12 education in Virginia history. Warner also entered into an agreement with Democrats and moderate Republicans in the Virginia Senate to cap state <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> reimbursements to local governments.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{crisis of the}} late 1970s was fuelled by the Fianna Fáil government's budget, {{the abolition of the}} <b>car</b> <b>tax,</b> excessive borrowing, and global economic instability including the 1979 oil crisis. There were significant policy changes from 1989 onwards, with economic reform, tax cuts, welfare reform, an increase in competition, and a ban on borrowing to fund current spending. This policy began in 1989–1992 by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat government, and continued by the subsequent Fianna Fáil/Labour government and Fine Gael/Labour/Democratic Left government. Ireland became one of the world's fastest growing economies by the late 1990s in what was known as the Celtic Tiger period, which lasted until the global Financial crisis of 2007–08. However, since 2014, Ireland has experienced strong economic growth.|$|E
5000|$|Cars (or more often, motorbikes) with {{seasonal}} number plates {{have two}} numbers {{at the end}} of the plate indicating the months between which they are registered to drive, with the licence being valid from the start of the upper month until the end of the lower month. This results in lower <b>car</b> <b>taxes,</b> as well lower insurance premiums.|$|R
50|$|The {{name of the}} car {{described}} the engine and followed the widely followed German convention of the time whereby the first digit - here “7” or “8” - identified the <b>car’s</b> <b>tax</b> horsepower (Steuer-PS) (effectively, {{in the case of}} German cars of the period, a linear function of the engine capacity) and the second digit represented the manufacturer’s figure for the actual horsepower.|$|R
50|$|A {{motorised}} quadricycle is a four-wheeled {{vehicle that}} can be registered as a motorcycle. They are analogous to mopeds or light motorcycles rather than cars. Consequently, they can be driven by underage drivers (14-18-year-olds) {{or in some cases}} even without a license, and they are free of <b>car</b> <b>taxes.</b> Their speed is usually limited to ca. 45 km/h either through a speed or power limit.|$|R
25|$|In 2009, Tri-Rail {{service was}} nearly cut drastically, {{with the threat}} of being shut down {{altogether}} by 2011, even as ridership was at a record high, as Palm Beach County withheld its funding of the system and looked to cut its funding from $4.1million to $1.6million per year. This would mean that Broward and Miami-Dade counties would also have had to cut their support to $1.6million each to match. The state, which was also running a budget shortfall and did not pass a rental <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> increase to help fund Tri-Rail, would have had to cut its support as well. This would have caused an immediate cut from 50 to 30 daily trains and a complete cutting weekend service, followed by additional cuts and possible shut down two years later. Schedules were decreased slightly, but service was never cut altogether, as dedicated federal funding was attained through the $2.5million grant as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his first}} year as governor, Gilmore pushed for <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> {{reduction}} legislation that was eventually passed by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly. [...] The legislation reduced car taxes on all cars valued less than $1,000, and phased out the tax on auto values over $1,000 as follows: 12.5% reduction in 1998; 25% reduction in 1999; 47.5% reduction in 2000; 70% reduction in 2001; 100% reduction in 2002. [...] Beginning in 2001, Virginia's economy slowed and tax revenues flattened. [...] In addition to a downturn in the national economy in 2001, Northern Virginia's economy was severely impacted after terrorists flew a hijacked airplane into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, on September 11, 2001, resulting in the closure of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport for 23 days. [...] Despite the economic downturn, Gilmore insisted on advancing the <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> phase out from a 47.5% reduction of each taxpayer's bill in 2000 to the scheduled 70% reduction in 2001. [...] Gilmore signed an executive order, which was passed by Congress, reducing state spending by all agencies, except for education, to keep the state's budget balanced during the economic downturn. [...] Democrats criticized the spending reductions and <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> cut. According to the Washington Post, [...] "Virginia's politicians struggled to balance car-tax relief against demands for public services." [...] When Gilmore left office in January 2002, the state's [...] "rainy day fund," [...] or revenue stabilization fund, had fallen to $900 million.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of [...] "light cars", a tax {{was placed on the}} size of these vehicles called the Light Motor Vehicle Tax. The amount charged for the size of [...] "passenger cars" [...] (the largest of the three classifications recognized in Japan) is ¥29,500, with passenger cars and trucks with a load-carrying capacity of 1,000kg or more at ¥13,200. The <b>car</b> <b>tax</b> on [...] "light cars" [...] below 1,000 cc is ¥7,200, or ¥4,000 for commercial vehicles (some local governments may charge more based on local regulations).|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, the Federal Government {{offers no}} direct {{incentives}} for electric vehicle ownership and imposes a substantial financial disincentive {{by way of}} a Federal Luxury <b>Car</b> <b>Tax</b> that is applied on new vehicles valued over a certain threshold (in 2014–15, this was A$61,884). [...] The application threshold for this tax is increased to A$75,375 for fuel efficient vehicles - defined as those with a fuel consumption rating under 7 litres per 100 kilometres. [...] By definition, electric vehicles which do not use conventional fuel sources are covered by this classification.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we study the {{taxation}} of car ownership, car use and public transport {{in the presence}} of externalities within the framework of a discrete/continuous choice model. We first derive optimal taxes in a simplified setting, emphasizing the specific role of fixed <b>car</b> ownership <b>taxes</b> and the relevance of public transport demand by non-car owners for the optimal tax structure. A numerical optimisation model is then constructed to study welfare-optimal public transport fares and two-part tariffs on ownership and use of gasoline and diesel cars in Belgium. Results are as follows. First, the current differences in tax treatment between diesel and gasoline car ownership and car use cannot be justified on the basis of external cost and budgetary considerations. Efficient pricing requires substantial increases in the relative user <b>tax</b> on diesel <b>cars</b> as compared to gasoline cars; optimal fixed taxes are substantially below current levels and only marginally differ between car fuel types, implying a very large decrease in the <b>tax</b> on diesel <b>cars.</b> Second, large differences in fixed <b>car</b> <b>taxes</b> do result (i) if for political or technical reasons variable <b>car</b> <b>taxes</b> cannot be optimally adjusted, and (ii) if optimal taxes are implemented but the government uses kilometre taxes as the main variable tax instrument. Third, the results of a series of marginal tax reform exercises suggest that a shift form gasoline towards diesel taxation is welfare improving, both for fixed and variable taxes. Somewhat surprisingly, a shift from fixed towards variable taxes is not necessarily welfare-improving: it is for diesel, but not for gasoline cars...|$|R
