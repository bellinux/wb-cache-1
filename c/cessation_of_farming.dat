40|$|Demersal, non-cryptic, {{wild fish}} were counted in {{replicate}} 100 m 2 transects beneath a floating sea-cage fish farm and two nearby sandy locations at Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, eastern Atlantic) four times {{before and after}} the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming.</b> <b>Cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> involved the removal of farmed fish and ceasing of the daily feeding, although farm structures (cages and moorings) remained. A “beyond-BACI” sampling design provided the framework to detect the effect of the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> which produced qualitative and quantitative changes in the composition and structure of the fish assemblages beneath the sea-cage fish farm compared with two nearby controls. The aggregative effect on wild fish due to the existence of the farm decreased from approximately 50 times compared to nearby controls when the farm was in full operation to 3 ̆c 2 times when only the farm structures remained. Abundances of POM feeders 3 ̆e(large-sized mugilids), large benthic chondrichthyid rays and Pagellus spp. declined markedly at the fish farm after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> suggesting that the removal of daily feeding was responsible for their disappearance. In contrast, abundances of herbivores, benthic macro- and meso-carnivores were similar beneath the fish farm both {{before and after the}} <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming.</b> Benthic macro-carnivores, however, were more abundant beneath the sea-cages compared to control locations, supporting the hypothesis that the increase in the physical structure beneath farms plays a role in aggregating these species. Sparids occurred beneath the sea-cages only after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> while the two natural control locations did not show differences from before to after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming.</b> Overall, the results show that the wild fish assemblage beneath the farm partially changed after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> to a more natural state, approaching the assemblages observed at the control sites...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Mid to late 20 th century {{expansion}} of Dracophyllum scrub into tussock grassland on subantarctic Campbell Island has {{been attributed to}} the collective effects of global warming, <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> in 1931, and continued grazing by feral sheep. To determine the importance of these, we dated the timing of scrub expansion by aging 241 Dracophyllum plants in 17 plots chosen to sample the range of environments this shrub/ small tree occupies on Campbell Island. Three plots, in lowland, well-drained, locations were dominated by large, old Dracophyllum that had established between 1846 and 1940. Virtually all shrubs in the remaining plots had established after 1940, with peaks in 1970 and 1985. The pattern of establishment does not coincide with any marked change in the temperature regime, although a prolonged period of relatively dry winters (c. 1970 – 1990) coincides with a late surge of regeneration on very wet sites. The removal of feral sheep from different parts of the island at different times is also unrelated to the pattern of establishment. In contrast, Dracophyllum spread follows farm abandonment in 1931 when regular burning ceased, suggesting that Dracophyllum is invading sites from which it was excluded by fire. However, the earliest reports from the mid 19 th century indicate that tussock grassland was previously the dominant vegetation cover on the island, with limited Dracophyllum scrub.

40|$|Mariculture in Croatia {{could play}} a more {{important}} role in development of rural communities along coastline. However, by increase of fish farming, public concern over environmental issues has been raised, {{and the need for}} more responsible mariculture development and management has been asked. There are opportunities and challenges for effectively integrating mariculture into coastal zone management with equal rights and obligations. This is primarily because of its social and economic mission consisting in preventing de-population of rural coastal areas and islands and meeting the growing needs of tourist market for seafood. Although intensive mariculture production is accused of producing negative environmental effects, many of these effects still need to be scientifically documented. The effect of nitrogen and phosphorous releases from farmed fish faeces or uneaten food is not of significant issues for marine ecosystem, and it is generally of little importance compared to the inflow of nutrients from other coastal sources. The impact on sediment and benthic communities is mainly local and short-term ones, and depends on the number and extent of the farms and their location. Recovery of some benthic communities after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> activities may be delayed over several years (i. e. Posidonia beds) due to the accumulated organic matter. Bluefin tuna farming if not properly located and managed might cause pollution problems, either from uneaten feed and metabolic waste or from harvesting and processing the fish. In most cases the problem comes from smell pollution during the summer time and the oily water surface that may be widespread much outside of the farm areas. It will be important for sustainable development of Croatian mariculture to offer a healthy and good quality product in the quantities required by the market, while not degrading the marine environment...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{effects of}} land-use changes {{driven by the}} {{implementation}} of the "Grain for Green" project and the corresponding changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is important in evaluating the environmental benefits of this ecological restoration project. The goals of this study were to quantify the current soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in different land-use types [cultivated land, abandoned land (<b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming),</b> woodland, wild grassland and orchards] in a catchment of the loess hilly and gully region of China to evaluate the benefits of SOC sequestration achieved by vegetation restoration in the past 10 years as well as to discuss uncertain factors affecting future SOC sequestration. Based on soil surveys (N =  83) and laboratory analyses, the results show that the topsoil (0 - 20 cm) SOCD was 20. 44 Mg/ha in this catchment. Using the SOCD in cultivated lands (19. 08 Mg/ha) as a reference, the SOCD in woodlands and abandoned lands was significantly higher by 33. 81 % and 8. 49 %, respectively, whereas in orchards, it was lower by 10. 80 %. The correlation analysis showed that SOC and total nitrogen (TN) were strongly correlated (R 2  =  0. 98) and that the average C∶N (SOC∶TN) ratio was 9. 69. With increasing years since planting, the SOCD in woodlands showed a tendency to increase; however, no obvious difference was observed in orchards. A high positive correlation was found between SOCD and elevation (R 2  =  0. 395), but a low positive correlation was found between slope and SOCD (R 2  =  0. 170, P =  0. 127). In the past 10 years of restoration, SOC storage did not increase significantly (2. 74 % or 3706. 46 t) in the catchment where the conversion of cultivated land to orchards was the primary restoration pattern. However, the potential contribution of vegetation restoration to SOC sequestration in the next several decades would be massive if the woodland converted from the cropland is well managed and maintained...|$|E

40|$|Fish {{farming is}} an {{important}} source of organic matter input in coastal waters, which contributes to eutrophication. In this study, the macrofaunal benthic community was studied after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>farming</b> with the aim of improving our understanding of benthic succession and sediment recovery in a marine ecosystem. The results showed that the best environmental variables for assessing organic pollution were acid-volatile sulfides (AVS) and redox potential. Succession and recovery was best explained by macrofaunal analysis based on community composition as well as on trophic groups. The patterns of recovery differed between each impacted station. For this reason, succession could not be accurately predicted due to the unique environmental parameters and the singular community functional structure of each location. The Azti Marine Benthic Index (AMBI) proved its validity for assessing pollution but did not distinguish between successional stages.

40|$|In the Mediterranean {{mountains}} and hills spontaneous reforestation {{occurred in the}} last fifty years at the expenses of open habitats. This process was triggered by depopulation and <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>farming.</b> In this paper we investigate landscape changes in one such area in central Apennines (Italy), which is currently almost uninhabited after centuries of human presence; we give a quantitative description of the changes that occurred between 1955 and 2006, and we discuss their management implications in a multidisciplinary context. To do this, we used aerial photos and field surveys to map land-use/land-cover classes in 1955, 1978 and 2006; we then employed a transition matrix model based on Markov chains, together with landscape and class metrics, to analyze gains and losses of each class over time. Our results show that almost all classes were replaced directly by woodlands: no “shrub stage” was observed and a surprisingly brief interval of about 25 years was sufficient for canopy closure on abandoned open lands; furthermore, some classes increased their transformation rate from period 1 (1955 – 1978) to period 2 (1978 – 2006), while others did not. Metrics show that reforestation is accompanied by simplification and homogenization of the original mosaic, with no intermediate fragmentation process. We discuss current management plans and propose strategies that take into account the presence of endangered species: management should exploit the spontaneous reforestation and promote the creation and preservation of mature forests; concurrently, it should plan to maintain the last “islands” of grasslands, even if small...|$|R

40|$|Organic farms face {{numerous}} challenges {{unique to}} organic production {{that can lead}} to <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>farm</b> business or conversion to conventional production. In California, one of the leading U. S. states for organic production, all producers of commodities marketed as organic are required to register with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Organic Program. The purpose of this survey study was to compare farmers who had recently discontinued their registration with the program with farmers still registered, to determine whether deregistered farmers leave farming altogether or convert to conventional production, and to shed light on the main challenges faced by organic farmers. Results indicate 26 % of those identified as deregistered were mistakenly identified as such (due to late submissions, name changes, or other reasons), and 35 % had stopped farming altogether. Significantly fewer actually deregistered farmers owned their own land than still registered producers, and a significantly higher percentage had farm revenues lower than US$ 100, 000. Deregistered producers considered regulatory issues as the most problematic, especially paperwork requirements, while registered producers ranked production issues as most problematic. Accordingly, registered farmers were more likely to request technical production assistance in the form of organic-focused research and extension, while deregistered farmers responded that financial assistance with certification and registration costs and more streamlining and clarification of the certification process and organic rules would have helped them more as organic farmers. These results point to a continuing need for certification cost share programs, especially for small <b>farms,</b> and streamlining <b>of</b> regulatory procedures. Additional strategies to retain more organic farmers include trained organic advisors who can facilitate between farmers and certifying and regulatory agencies, more organic-focused research, and producer cooperatives for small organic farms to pool information and labor resources and marketing efforts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{predation}} and fish prey selection of otters Lutra lutra L. living by eutrophic fish ponds on agricultural land {{and in a}} protected area of temperate climate in Hungary were investigated. The correlations between fish in the diet of the otters (by spraint analysis involved 1942 and 1280 samples for the two habitats) and the fish stock available (by harvest and sample fishing) were generally close. Prey selection {{was significantly related to}} selected species of a particular size range (p < 0. 01). The preference calculations were performed with Ivlev's index of preference (E-i, minimum - 1. maximum + 1). Regardless of species, the otters avoided (E-i= - 0. 51) fish heavier than 1000 g, with a preference for individuals weighing between 500 and 1000 g (E-i = 0. 79). No substantial or clear preference was observed in the weight range below 500 g (E-i = - 0. 02 - 0. 38). The preference for fish in accordance with their characteristic sites of occurrence within the body of water was also significant (P < 0. 0 1). They avoided fish living primarily in open water (E-i= - 0. 64) and to a lesser degree those occurring near the pond bed (E-i= - 0. 22). They favoured fish inhabiting the area with a covering of aquatic plants (E-i = 0. 46), and showed a preference to a lesser degree for fish living in the shallow littoral regions (E-i = 0. 14).
