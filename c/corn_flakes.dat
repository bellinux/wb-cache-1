5|$|A {{native of}} Indiana, Sadler moved to Michigan as a {{teenager}} {{to work at the}} Battle Creek Sanitarium. There he met the physician and health-food promoter John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of <b>corn</b> <b>flakes</b> breakfast cereal, who became his mentor. Sadler married Kellogg's niece, Lena Celestia Kellogg, in 1897. He worked for several Christian organizations and attended medical school, graduating in 1906. Sadler practiced medicine in Chicago with his wife, who was also a physician. He joined several medical associations and taught at the McCormick Theological Seminary. Although he was a committed member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church for almost twenty years, he left the denomination after it disfellowshipped his wife's uncle in 1907. Sadler and his wife became speakers on the Chautauqua adult education circuit in 1907, and he became a highly paid, popular orator. He eventually wrote over 40 books on a variety of medical and spiritual topics advocating a holistic approach to health. Sadler extolled the value of prayer and religion but was skeptical of mediums, assisting debunker Howard Thurston, and embraced the scientific consensus on evolution.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, <b>corn</b> <b>flakes,</b> popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{of this research was}} to develop a fundamental understanding of the <b>corn</b> <b>flaking</b> process and determine how processing conditions (i. e. tempering) affect the final product in terms of quality and starch fragmentation. With the assistance of a cereal company, studies were designed and performed to show the effects of cooking, drying, tempering, and milling on <b>corn</b> <b>flaking</b> grits during the <b>corn</b> <b>flaking</b> process. The development, application, and verification of a novel rheometry device to monitor and measure the mechanical properties of a single corn grit during the processes of cooking, drying, and tempering was used in this study. It was proposed from this work that this method may find suitable applications in industrial online/at-line systems due to its non-invasiveness, little to no modification of testing samples, and its ability to obtain quick and instantaneous measurements. The process of tempering <b>corn</b> <b>flaking</b> grits was more thoroughly investigated with the novel rheometry device and mechanisms were identified that were shown to promote a reorganization of structure after gelatinization. State diagrams of the viscoelastic properties of <b>corn</b> <b>flaking</b> grits during the process of tempering were obtained and shown to be affected by moisture, temperature, and time. Tempered grit rheology was shown to greatly influence the milling process in terms of flake thickness, process-induced fragmentation, and glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the milled flakes prior to toasting. A relationship with Tg and overall product quality in terms of percent water uptake of the cereals and sensory quality characteristics was also obtained. The quality of the finished food was assessed through sensory evaluations, as well as, a new developed procedure related to the concept/measurement of bowl-life. Additionally, the effect of storage and the mechanisms involved in the aging of toasted flakes were investigated. ...|$|R

5000|$|C. W. Post {{established}} his company in Battle Creek, Michigan, having lived there since 1891, {{when he was}} a patient at a holistic sanitarium operated by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. Dr. Kellogg, with his brother W.K. Kellogg, had developed a dry <b>corn</b> <b>flake</b> cereal that was part of their patients’ diet. Post's first product, introduced in 1895, was not a cereal, however, but a roasted, cereal-based beverage, Postum. Having developed an aversion to coffee during his time in the sanitarium, Post positioned Postum as a healthy alternative. Its advertising slogan, which he coined himself, was [...] "There's a Reason". Postum's main ingredients were naturally caffeine-free wheat grain, bran, and molasses. Initially, Postum had to be brewed like coffee, but in 1911, Post introduced a powdered, instant formulation. This version of the product was manufactured in Battle Creek until it was discontinued in 2007.|$|R

In 1891 he acquired a patent and then in 1895 he launched the Cornflakes brand, which overnight captured a national market. Soon there were forty rival manufacturers in the Battle Creek area. His brother William K.

40|$|Foram utilizados 116 tourinhos da raça Nelore (373 Kg) distribuídos aleatoriamente em 20 baias, com o objetivo de comparar dietas com níveis crescentes de bagaço de cana de açúcar (0, 3, 6 % da MS) com grãos de milho inteiro do tipo duro ou flint (69, 5 % de vitreosidade). Também foi incluso um tratamento com maior teor de proteína bruta por meio da adição de nitrogênio de liberação lenta (Optigen ®) e um quinto tratamento com milho floculado, ambos com 6 % de bagaço. Os dados foram analisados em delineamento em blocos completos ao acaso, análises de regressão foram {{realizadas}} para os tratamentos que continham níveis crescentes de forragem e aplicação de contrastes ortogonais entre os tratamentos com milho inteiro com 6 % de forragem Nas dietas com milho inteiro a inclusão de bagaço na dieta, aumentou a IMS (ingestão de matéria seca) de forma quadrática (P 0, 05) na eficiência alimentar (GPD/IMS). O aumento do teor de proteína da dieta com a adição de fonte de nitrogênio de liberação lenta não melhorou (P> 0, 05) o desempenho dos animais alimentados com grãos inteiro de milho. A floculação do milho melhorou (P 0, 05) o GPD, o PF, e as características de carcaça, mas aumentou (P 0, 05) os teores observados de energia das dietas. No entanto, a floculação aumentou (P 0. 05) pelos tratamentos e a incidência de abscessos hepáticos foi insignificante. Com base nos resultados conclui-se que a inclusão de forragem em dietas com milho inteiro melhora o desempenho dos animais e a digestibilidade do amido. A floculação do milho do tipo flint propicia maior energia nas dietas e maior eficiência alimentar dos animais. Tourinhos Nelore não respondem ao aumento no teor de proteína bruta da dieta com a inclusão de nitrogênio de liberação lenta. One hundred sixteen yearling Nellore bulls (373 kg IBW) were allotted randomly to 20 pens {{in order}} to compare diets with increasing sugarcane bagasse levels (0, 3, 6 % DM) and whole flint corn grains (69, 5 % vitreousness). A treatment with higher crude protein level containing a slow release urea source (Optigen ®) and another containing steam <b>flaked</b> <b>corn,</b> both with 6 % bagasse, were also included. The data were analyzed in randomized block design, regression analysis was performed for the treatments that contained various levels of forage and application of orthogonal contrasts between treatments with 6 % of forage and whole corn against treatments with 6 % of forage with addition of slow-release nitrogen source and against steam <b>flaked</b> <b>corn</b> with 6 % of forage. Bagasse inclusion to diets containing whole corn quadraticaly (P 0, 05) feed efficiency (ADG/DMI). Increasing diet protein level with inclusion of slow release urea didn´t improve (P> 0, 05) the performance of animals fed whole <b>corn.</b> Steam <b>flaking</b> <b>corn</b> significantly improved (P< 0, 05) performance compared to whole corn. Compared to the whole corn and no bagasse diet, steam <b>flaked</b> <b>corn</b> didn´t affect DMI but increased ADG, FBW, HCW and feed efficiency. In relation to the whole corn and 6 % bagasse diet steam <b>flaking</b> <b>corn</b> decreased DMI, didn´t affect ADG, FBW and carcass parameters and increased feed efficiency. Bagasse inclusion to whole corn diets as well as slow release urea source didn´t affect diets´ observed energy concentration. However, steam <b>flaking</b> <b>corn</b> expressively increased diet energy content compared to whole corn, with or without bagasse.
