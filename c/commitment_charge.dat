Largely motivated by the observation that industries for which chains typically use uniform pricing are also industries for which {{a large proportion of}} establishments are chain-run, I argue that a chains <b>commitment</b> to <b>charge</b> a uniform price across all heterogeneous markets induces it to crowd out the locally run stores when uniform pricing e¤ectively softens price competition.

40|$|This paper investigates {{price and}} quality {{competition}} {{in a market}} where consumers seek variety and habit formation. Variety seeking is modeled as {{a decrease in the}} willingness to pay for product purchased on the previous occasion while habitual consumption may increase future marginal utility. We compare two competing strategies: price commitment and quality commitment. With a three-stage Hotelling-type model, we show that variety seeking intensifies while habitual consumption softens the competition. With price commitment, firms supply lower quality levels in period 1 and higher quality levels in period 2, while, with quality <b>commitment,</b> firms <b>charge</b> higher prices in period 1 and lower prices in period 2. However, the habitual consumption brings the opposite effect. In addition, with quality commitment variety seeking leads to a lower profit and a higher consumer surplus, while habitual consumption leads to the opposite results. On the other side, with price commitment these behaviors have no effect on the consumer surplus, although they still lower down the firm profits. Finally, we also identify conditions under which one strategy outperforms the other...|$|R
40|$|Integrating {{renewable}} energy into built environments requires additional {{attention to the}} balancing {{of supply and demand}} due to their intermittent nature. Demand Side Response (DSR) has the potential to make money for organisations as well as support the System Operator as the generation mix changes. There is an opportunity to increase the use of existing technologies in order to manage demand. Company-owned standby generators are a rarely used resource; their maintenance schedule often accounts for a majority of their running hours. DSR encompasses a range of technologies and organisations; Sustainability First (2012) suggest that the System Operator (SO), energy supply companies, Distribution Network Operators (DNOs), Aggregators and Customers all stand to benefit from DSR. It is therefore important to consider impact of DSR measures to each of these stakeholders. This paper assesses the financial implications of organisations using existing standby generation equipment for DSR in order to avoid peak electricity charges. It concludes that under the current GB electricity pricing structure, there are several regions where running diesel generators at peak times is financially beneficial to organisations. Issues such as fuel costs, Carbon Reduction <b>Commitment</b> (CRC) <b>charges,</b> maintenance costs and electricity prices are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{key to the}} Coase {{conjecture}} is the monopolist's {{inability to}} commit to a price, which leads consumers {{to believe that a}} high current price will be followed by low future prices. This paper studies the robustness of the Coase conjecture with respect to these beliefs of consumers. In particular, there is uncertainty over whether the monopolist is committed to a price (i. e. she may be a commitment type). Consequently, consumers are no longer certain that the price will change over time. I consider two kinds of commitment types. A behavioral <b>commitment</b> type <b>charges</b> an exogenously given price, while the rational commitment type optimally chooses a price. I show that the Coase conjecture is robust with regard to uncertainty over the monopolist's commitment. When the probability of behavioral types is sufficiently small, as in the original Coase conjecture, the monopolist earns the competitive profit. When the probability of behavioral types is positive, unlike in the original Coase conjecture, there is positive delay. But the delay disappears as the probability approaches zero. When the commitment type is rational, unless the probability of the commitment type is sufficiently high, both normal and committed monopolists charge the competitive price, and thus there is no delay.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} Housing Commission's {{perspective}} and recommendations on management of interest-rate risks in housing finance, and considers the relative advantages of various techniques by which institutions {{on the supply}} side of mortgage markets can absorb or shift such risks. It is argued that exchange-based options can provide a more reliable way than cash forward contracting for originators or purchasers of mortgages to manage commitment-period risk, but that <b>commitment</b> fees <b>charged</b> household borrowers should not fully correspond to premiums for put options "traded" on the exchanges. It also is argued that exchange-based futures can provide a more effective and economical way than asset-liability maturity matching in cash markets for thrift institutions to manage portfolio interest-rate risks; in particular, futures trading can permit these institution to meet the maturity preferences of liquidity-conscious creditors and risk-averse borrowers, to reduce the risk associated with unexpected shifts of the yield curve, and to maintain a higher degree of asset quality. The capacity of futures markets to handle large-scale hedging by mortgage market participants will depend upon heavy participation by highly leveraged speculators who are willing to take long positions without the receipt of substantial risk premiums from hedgers.

We use the Texas power system, which has a mix of coal- and natural gas-fired generation and {{has been shown to}} yield higher emissions from PHEVs than CVs, as a case study. Our results show that imposing the emissions constraint results in most of the PHEV charging loads being shifted from coal- to cleaner natural gas-fired generators.

40|$|Private {{operation}} of port facilities {{is becoming increasingly}} common worldwide. We investigate the effect of port privatization in a setting with two ports located in different countries, each serving their home market but also competing for the transshipment traffic from a third region. Each government chooses whether to privatize its port or to keep port operations public. We show that there exist equilibria {{in which the two}} governments choose privatization and the national welfare of each port country is higher relative to a situation where ports are public. This is because privatization is a <b>commitment</b> to increase <b>charges</b> relative to public port charges, which allows for a better exploitation of the third region. For some parameter regions, port countries non-cooperatively choose public port operations, while they {{would be better off if}} both ports were private. However, customers of the third region are always better off if port operations are public. We further show that the port country with the smaller home market has a relatively strong incentive to choose private port operation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} an online preemptive scheduling problem where jobs with deadlines arrive sporadically. A commitment requirement is imposed {{such that the}} scheduler has to either accept or decline a job immediately upon arrival. The scheduler’s decision to accept an arriving job constitutes {{a contract with the}} customer; if the accepted job is not completed by its deadline as promised, the scheduler loses the value of the corresponding job and has to pay an additional penalty depending on the amount of unfinished workload. The objective of the online scheduler is to maximize the overall profit, i. e., the total value of the admitted jobs completed before their deadlines less the penalty paid for the admitted jobs that miss their deadlines. We show that the maximum competitive ratio is 3 − 2 √ 2 and propose a simple online algorithm to achieve this competitive ratio. The optimal scheduling includes a threshold admission and a greedy scheduling policies. The proposed algorithm has direct applications to the charging of plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles (PHEV) at garages or parking lots.

40|$|This volume brings {{together}} thoroughly reworked {{versions of a}} selection of papers presented at the conference The Notion of Commitment in Linguistics, held at the University of Antwerp in January 2007. It is the companion volume to {{a collection of essays}} in French to be published in Langue Française and devoted to La notion de prise en <b>charge.</b> <b>Commitment</b> is a close counterpart to prise en charge, and two contributors, Celle and Lansari, use it essentially as a translation of the French term. However, commitment and its verbal cognates (to commit NP to and to be committed to) do not cover the exact same range of meanings as prise en charge. For a thorough assessment of the French term, we refer readers to the introduction to the Langue Française volume. In the present article, we focus entirely on commitment. The term is widely used in at least three major areas of linguistic enquiry: 1 studies on illocutionary acts, studies on modality and evidentiality, and the formal modelling of dialogue/argumentation. In spite of its frequent use, the notion has rarely been theorised and has never been the subject of a monograph or a specialised reader. In keeping with this is the fact that none of the many dictionaries and encyclopaedias of linguistics or philosophy that we have consulted devotes a separate entry to it. Section 1 of this introduction briefly reviews what commitment means in the three fields just mentioned. Now and then, with respect to a particular issue, pointers are given to which articles in this collection {{have something to say about}} the issue. In section 2, we take a lexical and syntactic look at the ways in which the contributors to the present volume use the term. In section 3, we outline each of the contributions, with a focus on the role that commitment plays in them. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on games with incomplete information. Among many issues that arise due to information asymmetry, I focus on, and shed some lights on, commitment, reputation, and information transmission. ^ In Chapter 1, I investigate the effects of commitment and reputation in the classic dynamic durable goods monopoly setting. It is well-known that the Coase conjecture holds in the underlying environment, that is, the monopolist offers the competitive price immediately {{and there is no}} delay. I observe that a key to the Coase conjecture is the monopolist 2 ̆ 7 s inability to commit to price, which leads consumers to believe that a high current price will be followed by low future prices. This paper studies the robustness of the Coase conjecture with respect to these beliefs of consumers. In particular, there is uncertainty over whether the monopolist is committed to a price (i. e. she may be a commitment type). Consequently, consumers are no longer certain that the price will change over time. I consider two kinds of commitment types. A behavioral <b>commitment</b> type <b>charges</b> an exogenously given price, while the rational commitment type optimally chooses a price. I show that the Coase conjecture is robust with regard to uncertainty over the monopolist 2 ̆ 7 s commitment. When the probability of behavioral types is sufficiently small, as in the original Coase conjecture, the monopolist earns the competitive profit. When the probability of behavioral types is positive, unlike in the original Coase conjecture, there will be positive delay. But the delay disappears as the probability approaches zero. When the commitment type is rational, unless the probability of the commitment type is sufficiently high, both the normal and committed monopolists charge the competitive price, and thus there is no delay. ^ In Chapter 2, I explore the possibility of endogenous segmentation in a market where asymmetric information about the quality of goods may result in only low-quality goods trading (lemons problem). I consider a model in which there are multiple ex ante identical submarkets, agents costlessly choose a submarket to join, and exchange takes place in each submarket. In a submarket, each buyer randomly selects a seller and makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer. I demonstrate that a market suffering from the lemons problem can be endogenously segmented and high-quality goods, that cannot trade without segmentation, do trade with segmentation. The result has implications for applied works, such as the structure of multiple marketplaces or platforms, the informativeness of costless advertisement for experience goods, and the role of non-binding list prices in decentralized markets. ^ In Chapter 3, together with Jonathan Pogach, I examine the effects of commitment on information transmission. We study and compare the behavioral consequences of honesty and white lie in communication. An honest agent is committed to telling the truth, while a white liar may manipulate information but only {{for the sake of the}} principal. We identify the effects of honesty and white lie on communication and show that, even though a white lie is intended to be beneficial to the principal, the principal is often better off with a possibly honest agent than with a potential white liar. This result provides a fundamental rationale on why honesty is thought to be an important virtue in many contexts. ...|$|R
5000|$|Membership {{constitute}} an agreement whereby the customer agree {{to purchase a}} minimum number of movies at regular list price. To join, or enter a legal obligation, the customer agree to purchase one discounted movie at the beginning, which is sent out {{as part of a}} [...] "welcome package." [...] Over the term of the agreement the minimum number of list price movies must be bought. Twenty-one times per year, the company informs each customer of the [...] "Director's Selection" [...] movie. The customer is asked to respond within 10 days whether or not he or she wants to buy this movie, which is offered at a discount provided that the response is received by Columbia House [...] "within the specified time." [...] Failure to respond results in having that movie shipped at full list price. If the customer responds negatively but in time, the idea is that the movie is not sent or charged to the customer's account. In specified circumstances, [...] "memberships" [...] are available, whereby the customer is not required to respond to Director Selection mailings unless he or she wants to buy the movie. When such memberships expire, the old rules return where a response is required in time to prevent shipping of full price movies without customer input. Customers are not reminded when those rules change. The customer also has access to a large variety of other movies, which are advertised by mail and online towards the customer. Only full price purchases deplete that minimum purchase obligation. Purchases are not cumulative, meaning that two movies bought at ten dollars each do not deplete the minimum list price movie purchases by one movie. If the minimum number of movies has not been purchased {{by the end of the}} term, the monetary worth of those movies is charged to the customers' accounts. If any purchases have been made using Columbia House's point of sale device, either credit cards or debit cards linked to credit card accounts, then those accounts are automatically debited. The company will either mail or email a reminder notice prior to the commitment expiring, giving the customer the opportunity to purchase the required purchase obligation before they are <b>charged</b> for any <b>commitment</b> or contract <b>charges.</b> Likewise, backordered movies are automatically debited to those accounts when they become available, without further notification to the customers. Failure to clear such purchases result in collections efforts by Columbia House against the customers.|$|R
