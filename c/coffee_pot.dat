25|$|A coffee {{percolator}} {{is a type}} of pot used to brew coffee. In {{the case}} of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma.

25|$|With Al Lang's support, {{the city}} {{replaced}} <b>Coffee</b> <b>Pot</b> Park with St. Petersburg Athletic Park (also known as Waterfront Park) {{on the present}} site of Al Lang Stadium in 1923. It served as the spring training home for Major League Baseball teams the Boston Braves and the New York Yankees until after World War II, hosting baseball greats such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, and Stan Musial.|$|E
25|$|Professional {{baseball}} grew {{throughout the}} United States {{at the beginning}} of the twentieth century, and clubs sought additional facilities to accommodate their spring training. Al Lang, a businessman in St. Petersburg, Florida, saw a huge potential to attract northeastern teams to his city to take advantage of the warm weather during the early months of the year. Lang and city officials created an incentives package that covered teams' travel expenses and other amenities, which drew in the city's first spring training tenant, the St. Louis Browns, in 1914. The club trained at <b>Coffee</b> <b>Pot</b> Park, a small ballpark located beside <b>Coffee</b> <b>Pot</b> bayou about a mile north of the current site of Al Lang Stadium. Subsequently, other Major League Baseball clubs such as the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Yankees came to St. Petersburg for spring training, and Lang continued promoting the city when he was elected Mayor of St. Petersburg in 1916. After his term, Lang devoted his life to building a successful connection between Florida and baseball, and was instrumental in marketing St. Petersburg as a desirable sports site.|$|E

Rationale and Scope There is coffee all over the world. Increasingly, {{in a world in}} which computing is ubiquitous, the computists want to make coffee. Coffee brewing is an art, but the distributed intelligence of the webconnected world transcends art. Thus, there is a strong, dark, rich requirement for a protocol designed espressoly for the brewing of coffee. Coffee is brewed using <b>coffee</b> <b>pots.</b> Networked <b>coffee</b> <b>pots</b> require a control protocol if they are to be controlled. Increasingly, home and consumer devices are being connected to the Internet. Early networking experiments demonstrated vending devices connected to the Internet for status monitoring [COKE]. One of the first remotely _operated _ machine to be hooked up to the Internet, the Internet Toaster, (controlled via SNMP) was debuted in 1990 [RFC 2235]. The demand for ubiquitous appliance connectivity that is causing the consumption of the IPv 4 address space.
