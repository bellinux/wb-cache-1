In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity.

25|$|Even before {{contributing}} to the formation pathway, Blaschko had discovered a destruction mechanism. An enzyme tyramine oxidase described in 1928 also oxidized dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. It was later named monoamine oxidase. This seemed to clarify {{the fate of the}} catecholamines in the body, but in 1956 Blaschko suggested that, because the oxidation was slow, “other mechanisms of inactivation … will be found to play an important part. Here is a gap in our knowledge which remains to be filled.” Within a year, Axelrod narrowed the gap by showing that dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline were O-methylated by <b>catechol-O-methyl</b> <b>transferase.</b> To fill the gap completely, however, the role of membranes had to be appreciated (see below).|$|E
25|$|Certain genes {{have been}} {{identified}} with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman et al. (2008), the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) with 7'-repeating polymorphism (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD. The <b>catechol-o-methyl</b> <b>transferase</b> gene (COMT) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set shifting) {{and the experience of}} reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in children with ADHD. Both the DRD4/7R and COMT/Val158Met polymorphisms are also correlated with executive dysfunction in schizophrenia and schizotypal behaviour.|$|E

Not metabolism but uptake through cell membranes therefore {{is the primary}} means of their clearance from the extracellular space. The mechanisms were deciphered beginning in 1959. Axelrod’s group in Bethesda wished to clarify the in vivo fate of catecholamines using radioactively labelled catecholamines of high specific activity, which had just become available. 3H-adrenaline and 3H-noradrenaline given intravenously to cats were partly O-methylated, but another part was taken up in the tissues and stored unchanged.-epinephrine and its metabolite metanephrine|journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|volume =127 |pages = 251–256}}-norepinephrine in animals |journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume =132 |pages = 193–201|pmid=13784801 }} Erich Muscholl (born 1926) in Mainz, {{who had worked with}} Marthe Vogt in Edinburgh, wished to know how cocaine sensitized tissues to catecholamines – a fundamental mechanism of action of cocaine discovered by Otto Loewi and Alfred Fröhlich in 1910 in Vienna. Intravenous noradrenaline was taken up into the heart and spleen of rats, and cocaine prevented the uptake, ″thus increasing the amount of noradrenaline available for combination with the adrenergic receptors″. The uptake of 3H-noradrenaline was severely impaired after sympathectomy, indicating that it occurred mainly into sympathetic nerve terminals. In support of this, Axelrod and Georg Hertting (born 1925) showed that freshly incorporated 3H-noradrenaline was re-released from the cat spleen when the sympathetic nerves were stimulated. A few years later, Leslie Iversen (born 1937) in Cambridge found that other cells also took up catecholamines. He called uptake into noradrenergic neurones, which were cocaine-sensitive, uptake1 and uptake into other cells, which were cocaine-resistant, uptake2. With the reserpine-sensitive uptake from the cytoplasm into the storage vesicles there were thus three catecholamine membrane passage mechanisms. Iversen’s book of 1967 “The Uptake and Storage of Noradrenaline in Sympathetic Nerves” was successful, showing the fascination of the field and its rich pharmacology.|$|E

For instance, polymorphism has been identified in genes associated to the metabolism of estrogens and/or carcinogens (Cytochrome P450, family 1, member A1, CYP1B1, CYP17A1, CYP19, <b>Catechol-O-methyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> N-acetyltransferase 2, Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1, GSTP1, GSTT, [...] [...] [...] [...] ), to estrogen, androgen and vitamin D action (ESR1, AR, VDR), to co-activation of gene transcription (AIB1), to DNA damage response pathways (CHEK2, HRAS1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC5). Sequence variants of these genes that are relatively common in the population {{may be associated with}} a small to moderate increased relative risk for breast cancer. Combinations of such variants could lead to multiplicative effects. Sporadic cancers likely result from the complex interplay between the expression of low penetrance gene(s) (risk variants) and environmental factors. However, the suspected impact of most of these variants on breast cancer risk should, in most cases, be confirmed in large populations studies. Indeed, low penetrance genes cannot be easily tracked through families, as is true for dominant high-risk genes.|$|E

50|$|Ritodrine is a short-acting β2 {{adrenoreceptor}} agonist — a {{class of}} medication used for smooth muscle relaxation (other similar drugs are used in asthma or other pulmonary diseases such as salbutamol (albuterol)). Since ritodrine has a bulky N-substituent, it has high β2 selectivity. Also, the 4-hydroxy group on the benzene ring is important for activity as it is needed to form hydrogen bonds. However, the 4-hydroxy group makes it susceptible to metabolism by <b>catechol-O-methyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (COMT). Since it is β2-selective it is used for premature labor.|$|E
50|$|Th {{influence}} of drugs is determined {{not only by}} their pharmacodynamics, especially the existence of receptors, but also their pharmakokinetics, their fate in living tissue. This aspect was studied in Porto as well. Metabolizing enzymes, namely monoamine oxidase und <b>catechol-O-methyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (COMT), as well as carrier proteins for the transport through cell membranes contributed to the removal of catecholamines from the extracellular space, thus from the neighbourhood of the receptors, and hence to loss of effect. The role played by these processes differed between the various catecholamines and the various tissues.|$|E
