The mechanisms by which pneumothorax occurs in lung cancer is not clear, resulting in different views being expressed. Case presentation Here we present {{a case in which}} pneumothorax occurred as a first manifestation of lung cancer. The chest x-ray of a 68 year old man revealed a right partial pneumothorax. VATS was then performed: the visceral pleura lying over segment S 3 was destroyed and air leaks were found in this section. Pathologic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed non-small cell carcinoma. Thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis was performed.

A <b>common</b> <b>possibility</b> to further improve strength and creep behavior of such β-solidifying TiAl alloys is e. g. alloying with β-stabilizing substitutional solid solution hardening elements Nb, Mo, Ta, W {{as well as the}} addition of interstitial hardening elements C and N which are also carbide and nitride forming elements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to argue for libertarian freedom on the basis of {{weakness}} of will as a <b>common</b> <b>possibility</b> for human agents. The phenomenon of weakness of will is widely acknowledged as a human possibility. Few contemporary philosophers, however, are proponents of libertarian freedom. I argue first that the possibility of weakness of will is implied by human agency. I then describe several sets of conditions philosophers have proposed to explain the apparent freedom necessary for weakness of will and show that one proposal seems more adequate than the rest. The proposal I argue for is that the freedom needed for weakness of will is the freedom to act on a resistible desire. Acting on a resistible desire is then defined and defended. I provide two ways of looking at acting on a resistible desire and show why one of these is more promising than the other. In conclusion I show that two contemporary compatibilist approaches to describing freedom conditions fail to work in the context of weakness of will and show that the freedom condition I have proposed works better. On the basis of these results I claim that all compatibilist freedom conditions will fail in similar ways. I claim, then, that libertarian freedom is the freedom necessary for weakness of will. ...|$|E
40|$|OS&H {{appears to}} be {{particularly}} complex {{in the case of}} large public facilities (Ministries, public offices, [...] .) open to the patrons, due to a number of typical characteristics, such as the often very large number of workers and patrons and the wide range of patrons' typologies, the age and historical/artistic value of many Italian settlements, the <b>common</b> <b>possibility</b> of internal/external interference of functional volumes. As a consequence, the usual approaches to the OH&S problems in industrial activities or secondary educational institutions can prove quite inadequate in many cases. The task of Occupational Risk Assessment and Management analysts becomes even more demanding where the attention is focused on activities which are institutionally involved in both high degree university education and in advanced research, the latter carried on in laboratories where also special devices, often of original or somehow modified design, are used. On the basis of literature findings, no very helpful suggestion based on real case histories are available, and in many cases the approach is limited to general purpose references on a limited number of Hazard Factors, integrated with spots on demand interventions, whilst both Prevention through Design general approaches to the OS&H problems, and quality approaches (e. g. according to OHSAS 18000) in the Residual Risk Assessment and Management are not common. The present thesis discusses with particular reference to Universities in general and to the Italian situation in particular, the results achieved in a multidisciplinary work -made exhaustive thanks to the presence of highly qualified experts among the staff- carried out in cooperation by Politecnico di Torino and Università degli Studi di Torino. The most important outcome was the definition of a Guideline for the Occupational Risk Assessment and Management of workers and users of large public facilities, specially conceived to provide for each involved person an effective evaluation of the actual residual exposure to the total number of Hazard Factors, systematically identified by means of a consistent Job Analysis. The Guideline, focalized in particular on the universities, stresses the paramount importance of a detailed and unambiguous definition, since the very first step of the study, of the Line and Staff Organization, upon which to base the discussion of the three basic Occupational Safety topics in the following hierarchic order: a) the workplace general safety characteristics, b) the workers OS&H along their activity in terms of involved residual risks, taking into account the available equipment (tools, machines and fittings), and c) the quality management of the OS&H system. The technique, carefully tested both in its general approach and in a number of sub-applications for special aspects, can moreover play an effective role in the continuous process of assisted training of the subjects operating in the various Areas (Departments, Services, [...] .) who, thanks to the detailed knowledge of their area, will be able to provide a capillary contribution in the phases of Hazards Factors Identification, and of suitable OH&S conditions -as defined in the Risk Management process- conservation and improvement.

40|$|The {{integration}} of the voices of other researchers is central to displaying scholarship in a doctoral thesis. It entails complex negotiation of prior texts {{in the context of}} one 2 ̆ 7 s own study. While, there is an expectation that such work results in an 2 ̆ 7 objective 2 ̆ 7 tone, self-representation or identity is rarely absent in theses in most disciplines. For international students, who use English as an Additional Language (EAL), being objective and yet projecting an identity and a voice can pose considerable challenges. The present study draws on findings from a qualitative inquiry that has involved interviews with three international students and analysis of excerpts from drafts of their doctoral writing to examine how identity is constructed in the act of textual engagement. The term 2 ̆ 7 textual engagement 2 ̆ 7 embraces acts such as {{integration of}} quotations in texts using conventions of citations and the evaluation of the quoted text/s as evident in the drafts. In the present thesis 2 ̆ 7 identity 2 ̆ 7 has been discussed using Ivanič 2 ̆ 7 s (1998) concept of self-representation. Ivanič‘s (1998) construct of a writer 2 ̆ 7 s identity in terms of the autobiographical self, possibilities of selfhood, the discoursal self and the self as author dimensions in academic writing has been applied as the overarching theoretical framework in the present study. The thesis explores issues faced by international EAL students as they negotiate other texts and simultaneously project an identity of their own. It particularly focuses on how EAL writers position themselves in relation to other texts to construct a discoursal self and how they negotiate with other texts, consciously or unconsciously, to project the self as author dimension in their doctoral writing. The literature on the incorporation of prior studies in academic writing is rich in studies on plagiarism. However, many of these studies do {{not take into account the}} complexities that quoting from source texts involve, particularly for students writing in EAL. Other strands of the literature point out that using the voices of others‘ to negotiate space for one‘s own research or engaging with other texts to construct one‘s argument requires an understanding of the discursive practices of a discipline. Scholarship becomes the basis on which an original contribution to a discipline can be made. Displaying this scholarship can be challenging for many EAL doctoral writers who may have had limited exposure to reading in English prior to undertaking doctoral studies. Consequently, in incorporating other texts, they may struggle to present an appropriate voice in their writing. Drawing on the larger theory of intertextuality and the tools afforded by genre theory to analyse the construction of arguments, the present study seeks to understand these difficulties. The exploration of evaluation to deconstruct the self as author in the student writers‘ texts has involved the use of the APPRAISAL theory (Martin and White, 2005). The findings of the study suggests that in the writing of a thesis, a <b>common</b> <b>possibility</b> of selfhood is envisioned by the writers – that of being bilingual scholars and original contributors to the field. The autobiographical selves that the writers bring to the act of writing shape every aspect of the writing. In the context of the present study, where textual engagement and identity projection are investigated, interviews and the examination of the participants‘ texts suggested that the doctoral writers were not naïve about the demands of engaging with other texts in their work. However, the imperative to be objective and to take up a stance in relation to other texts was confusing. This issue in conjunction with anxieties about their competence in English is responsible for the varying degrees of self-assurance evident in the texts analysed in the study. The textual analysis suggests that textual transformation is seen as a major difficulty. However, positioning oneself in relation to the collective voices in the discipline is less so. Nevertheless, despite these infelicities in their work, the discoursal self projected is that of emerging scholars attempting to make an original contribution in their field. In all three texts, a non-adversarial stance is adopted. However, the self as author is different in each text and is related to the reading positions adopted by the individual writers. Surface irregularities in terms of grammar, syntax, semantics, inappropriate citation practices and the lack of critical analysis may diminish the quality of doctoral writing produced by EAL users. Nevertheless, the struggle to be bilingual scholars and original contributors is evident in the texts analysed. Pedagogical responses to difficulties in the area of textual engagement need to be addressed in the larger context of critical inquiry, knowledge construction, disciplinary practices and self-representation/identity discussions in texts. A triple-layered doctoral writing pedagogy is suggested. Harnessing linguistic theory and providing opportunities for social interaction and meaning negotiation is crucial in helping students develop rhetorical knowledge that would enable them to project a confident identity and facilitate competent textual engagement...|$|E

Methods: A total of 250 cases of non-syndromic CLAP in children of both sexes were studied over a period of one year at the pediatric surgery department of a tertiary care children’s hospital in Kolkata. The rural and urban residen-tial status of the respective families was carefully ascertained. Descriptive analysis was done. Results: Of 250 cases, 47 (18. 80 %) were affected with cleft lip, 139 (55. 60 %) with cleft lip and palate and 64 (25. 60 %) with cleft palate alone. Of the studied cases, 171 (68. 40 %) came from rural areas. The affected rural families were socioeconomically weaker than their urban counterparts. The distribution of CLAP types differed significantly between rural and urban population with the frequency of cleft lip being higher in urban but that of cleft lip and palate higher in the rural population (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Although {{advances}} in diagnostic imaging, surgical technique, asepsis, and antibiotics have improved outcomes in most surgical diseases {{over the last}} several decades, mesenteric ischemia remains a highly morbid condition. Fortunately it remains a rare occurrence, accounting for less than 1 in every 1000 hospital admissions [1]. Likewise, mortality rates remain elevated at 30 % to 90 %, depending on the etiology [2 – 6], and may in fact be even higher if deaths in patients who have undiagnosed mesenteric ischemia are considered. In one review, only one third of patients who had acute mesen-teric ischemia were correctly diagnosed before surgical exploration or death [5]. Another review of autopsy cases in Sweden suggested true mortality rates may exceed 90 % for mesenteric ischemia, and in only 33 % was the di-agnosis even considered before death [7]. Despite its relative infrequency, the high morbidity and mortality rates thus underscore the need for surgeons to be acutely aware of the presentation and management of this disease process. Mesenteric ischemia occurs when visceral tissues receive inadequate blood flow. This may be a consequence of an arterial embolus or thrombo-sis, venous thrombosis limiting arterial inflow, or even extrinsic compression of mesenteric vessels. Smooth muscle tone within the mesenteric vessels is heavily autoregulated, increasing splanchnic blood flow after a large meal from 10 % of cardiac output at rest to up to 35 % [8]. When demand exceeds the capacity of the mesenteric circulation because of intrinsic or extrinsic lesions, the bowel becomes ischemic, with the mucosa being most vulnerable to inadequate blood flow. The diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia is often one of exclusion, made after Surg Clin N Am 87 (2007) 1115 – 1134 eliminating more <b>common</b> <b>possibilities.</b> Patients most often present with abdominal pain, unfortunately a vague complaint common to scores of other diagnoses.

In my thesis I tried to clarify physical conditions associated with emergence and specific spread of shock waves in various media and other physical principles which explain behavior and effects of shock waves passing through different types of tissues. From the results of expert studies and articles I made a survey of the most <b>common</b> <b>possibilities</b> of use of shock waves in medicine - especially in physiotherapy. In the practical part I evaluate the effects and course of shockwave therapy in three randomly selected patients diagnosed with epicondylitis radialis humeri (tennis elbow). Patients were treated by a series of applications of radial shock waves, when one session amounted to 1500 - 2000 shocks of varying frequency of 4 - 21 Hz and the pneumatic pressure of 2 - 3. 2 bar. The results show that the patient may respond differently to shockwave therapy. Due to the fact that in a relatively small research sample quite disparate results have been recorded - the first patient significantly improved, the second improved slightly and the third got worse on the contrary - we can better understand the diversity of opinions of the professional public on the meaningfulness of the shock waves use in orthopedic diagnoses.

METHODS: Sixteen-year-old girl presented with two-month history of slow growing, painless lump at the back of her neck without any other symptoms. X-ray showed erosion of C 2 spinous process. MRI also suggested an abscess. RESULTS: Patient underwent incision and drainage of abscess and debridement of involved bone. Cultures and histopathology confirmed TB. Patient responded to antituberculous therapy. CONCLUSION: Posterior element TB is a rare condition but in countries where TB is <b>common,</b> its <b>possibility</b> should always be considered. Isolated TB of parts of posterior elements can occur in absence of disease elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Activating {{mutations}} in the KCNJ 11 gene encoding for the Kir 6. 2 subunit of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel {{have recently been}} shown to be a common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. In 80 % of probands, these are isolated cases resulting from de novo mutations. We describe a family in which two affected paternal half-siblings were found to be heterozygous for the previously reported R 201 C mutation. Direct sequencing of leukocyte DNA showed that their clinically unaffected mothers and father were genotypically normal. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the father's leukocyte DNA detected no trace of mutant DNA. These results are consistent with the father being a mosaic for the mutation, which is restricted to his germline. This is the first report of germline mosaicism in any form of monogenic diabetes. The high percentage of permanent neonatal diabetes cases due to de novo KCNJ 11 mutations suggests that germline mosaicism may be <b>common.</b> The <b>possibility</b> of germline mosaicism should be considered when counseling recurrence risks for the parents of a child with an apparently de novo KCNJ 11 activating mutation...|$|R
