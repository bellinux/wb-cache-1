40|$|At {{each stage}} of the product {{development}} process, the designers are facing an important task which consists of decision making. Two cases are observed: the problem of concept selection in <b>conceptual</b> design <b>phases</b> and, the problem of pre-dimensioning once concept choices are made. Making decisions in <b>conceptual</b> design <b>phases</b> on a sound basis {{is one of the}} most difficult challenges in engineering design, especially when innovative concepts are introduced. On the one hand, designers deal with imprecise data about design alternatives. On the other hand, design objectives and requirements are usually not clear in these phases. The greatest opportunities to reduce product life cycle costs usually occur during the first <b>conceptual</b> design <b>phases.</b> The need for reliable multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) methods is thus greatest at early <b>conceptual</b> design <b>phases.</b> Various MCDA methods are proposed in the literature. The main criticism of these methods is that they usually yield different results for the same problem [22, 23, 25]. In this work, an analysis of six MCDA methods (weighed sum, weighted product, Kim & Lin, compromise programming, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE I) was conducted. Our analysis was performed via an industrial case of solar collector structure development. The objective is to define the most appropriate MCDA methods in term of three criteria: (i) the consistency of the results, (ii) the ease of understanding and, (iii) the adaptation of the decision type. The results show that TOPSIS is the most consistent MCDA method in our case...|$|R
50|$|Estimates for {{the cost}} of {{facility}} construction are {{a major part of the}} cost estimate domain. A construction general contractor or subcontractor must normally prepare definitive cost estimates to prepare bids in the construction bidding process to compete for award of the contract. Although many estimators participate in the bidding and procurement processes, those are not a necessary function of cost estimate preparation. Earlier estimates are prepared by differing methods by estimators and others to support the planning process and to compare with bids. One way to make those estimates is by determining the resources needed (e.g., the amount of construction material quantities that are required) and then multiplying the estimated construction material quantities by the corresponding unit cost. One advantage of making estimates in this way is that it allows for the segregation of quantities and costs. This way they can be updated separately as new information becomes available. They can also be tracked separately allowing decision makers to make better decisions about the project during its <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E

40|$|NASA is {{responsible}} for developing much of the nation's future space technology. Cost estimates for new programs are required early in the planning process so that decisions can be made accurately.

The system design in <b>conceptual</b> <b>phases</b> of a program is usually only vaguely defined and the technology used is so often state-of-the-art or beyond.

40|$|Incomplete {{knowledge}} flow between {{architects and}} mechanical/electrical engineers engenders large expense and untimely delivery of building projects. It {{is essential to}} consider mechanical/electrical requirements from {{the early stages of}} design; and many experienced architects acknowledge this knowledge entities and the necessity for considering them at the right time. Therefore, inefficient knowledge flow among professionals during architectural conceptual design is emphasized as a problem for this study. For overcoming this problem, the study intends to improve knowledge capture during <b>conceptual</b> design <b>phase</b> of building projects by formalizing the fundamental requirements of necessary mechanical/electrical knowledge during this phase. To achieve this goal, this research develop three objectives: 1) Specify an appropriate knowledge capture technique for tacit dominated conceptual design phase; 2) Identify fundamental mechanical/electrical requirements to consider by architects during conceptual design phase; and 3) Develop a framework for formalizing tacit mechanical/electrical knowledge during <b>conceptual</b> design <b>phase.</b> Firstly, the study selects an appropriate technique to capture expert’s tacit knowledge based on a literature survey by matching existing knowledge capture techniques with conceptual design characteristics. Secondly, mechanical/electrical knowledge is obtained through a case study during conceptual design of a green building project. The mechanical/electrical knowledge and activities are matched in the McMillan Framework (2001) for the <b>conceptual</b> design <b>phase.</b> Later, mechanical/electrical knowledge is matched and assigned to the architectural concept design activities. At the conclusion of the exercise, the study developed a mechanical/electrical knowledge-based framework for the <b>conceptual</b> design <b>phase.</b> Validation of the results was obtained by using computational organizational theory simulation. This study contributes in extending McMillan’s Framework to include explicit fundamental required mechanical/electrical knowledge during the conceptual design phase; developing a tacit knowledge capture technique by combining tacit observation and explicit repertory grid documentation; and improving Nissen’s (2006) multidimensional model (MDM) by integrating knowledge into Macmillan’s framework for conceptual design activities.

As part of their presentation to the Preliminary Systems Review Board (the Board being the Technical Directors), Don Wade and Syromyatnikov included all the test data, specifications, and drawings for the docking system, as well as a design evaluation for the mechanism. After hearing their report, Lunney and Bushuyev felt three problem areas needed further study. First, the requirement for a spring thruster designed to help separate the two spacecraft had caught their attention, since the failure of this thruster to compress properly could prevent completion of docking. Second, Lunney and Bushuyev emphasized the importance of an indicator that would verify that the structural latches were properly in place. The American system provided information on the functioning of each latch but did not indicate that the interface seals were compressed, while the Soviet system gave data on compression of the seals but none for the latches. To assure the structural integrity of the transfer tunnel, it was important to know that all eight latches were closed. The third problem area was whether it was possible for the structural latches be inadvertently released. Bushuyev and Lunney called for a thorough re-evaluation of all these issues and advised the group to present their specific recommendations to them in December and January.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Construction projects comprise holistic and organic processes of the conceptual, detailed engineering, construction and start-up phases. The <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase</b> is the most critical phase in a project's life-cycle where the main strategic decisions are made. The success of other phases depends upon the decisions made during the <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase.</b> Although the <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase</b> presents the greatest opportunity for productivity improvement during the construction phase, it has been given relatively little attention. The main aim {{of this research was}} to establish the <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase</b> tasks and associated best practices for major projects that ensure good site productivity through decisions made in the <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase.</b> The aim was realised through the following five objectives: define tasks performed in the conceptual phase; rank the impact of <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase</b> tasks on site productivity; determine the impact of <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase</b> tasks on productivity in terms the main site resources of time, labour, plant, material and finance; establish the sequence with which tasks are performed in the conceptual phase; and establish Best Practices associated with each of the <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase</b> tasks. The research findings were based upon literature, an industry-wide postal questionnaire survey and case studies. The survey comprised a substantial twenty-page questionnaire containing 184 questions. The questionnaire was posted to 144 companies including clients, consultants, contractors and financial institutions throughout the European Union. A return of 37 per cent was achieved. The industry-wide survey was then followed by detailed case studies of six projects: a power plant; a chemical plant; a sewerage treatment plant; an offshore-structure; a motor way; and, a substantial building project. These case studies underpinned the survey and specific differences and similarities were highlighted among the six projects and the processes adopted during the conceptual stages. The industry-wide survey and complementary case studies formed the basis of recommendations for <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase</b> tasks and associated best practices achieving enhanced site productivity. It was concluded that the <b>conceptual</b> <b>phase</b> of construction projects comprised ten tasks: Consents and Permits; Project Definition; Financial Strategy; Project Planning; Contract Strategy; Project Management Organisation; Construction Philosophy; Procurement Strategy; Design of Temporary Works; and, Design of Permanent Structures.
