40|$|A {{study of}} the drying of Buna-S in crumb form (designated as GR-S) is {{presented}} in which investigations of vacuum and air drying are made. The drying characteristics are presented {{and the effect of}} drying on the quality is evaluated. Vacuum drying is investigated using a shelf and a rotary type unit. The individual effects of temperature, vacuum, thickness of <b>crumb</b> <b>layer,</b> and size of crumb particles are studied. Data are correlated by means of drying rate curves. Comparisons {{of the effects of the}} variables are made using these curves. Air drying is studied by the use of a shelf unit with air blowing across the crumb. Air drying also is investigated with air directed through the bed of crumb. The variables studied are: temperature, humidity, air velocity, thickness of <b>crumb</b> <b>layer,</b> size of crumb, and shrinkage of the crumb during drying. The results are presented as drying rate curves and comparisons are made showing the effect of variables. A {{study of the}} temperature of the rubber during drying is presented showing the trend as the moisture content changes. The quality of the dried rubber is determined by means of an evaluation of the 2 ̆ 2 gel 2 ̆ 2 content. The gel content is defined as the per cent of the rubber insoluble in benzene. The results of several studies of the effect of temperature on the formation of gel are presented...|$|E
40|$|Pound cake, {{a common}} European cake type, is {{prepared}} from equal portions of flour, sugar, fat and eggs. During baking, both starch and egg components form a gel. This results in water binding and structure setting. Temperature gradients during conventional pound cake batter baking cause structure setting {{to take place}} at different times in {{different regions of the}} batter. As a result, crumb of conventional cake is heterogeneous in terms of moisture content and starch and protein properties. During storage, cake crumb firms through mechanisms that, when this work started, were still poorly understood. Still, most authors agreed that crumb to crust moisture migration has a large impact on crumb firming. We here set out to study the mechanisms by which crumb firming occurs. In a first experimental chapter, model systems of different complexities, i. e. flour-water, flour-sugar-water, egg-water, egg-sugar-water and flour-egg-sugar-water models, were analyzed by proton (1 H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to provide a basis for studying proton mobility in pound cake and its crumb. Crumb proton populations were assigned to (A) non-exchanging CH protons of crystalline starch, proteins and crystalline fat, (B) and (C) non-exchanging CH protons of amorphous starch and gluten, which are in little contact with water, (D) exchanging protons of water, starch, gluten, egg proteins and sugar and (E) protons of lipids from margarine and egg yolk. In a next chapter, electrical resistance (ER) heating was used to produce cakes with minimal moisture gradients. In the further experimental work, this technique was applied to study processes other than moisture migration during storage of cakes. The baking process in an electrical resistance oven (ERO) was first compared with that in a conventional oven. In an ERO, the structure setting of cakes, which is the result of both starch and egg gel formation, progressively and uniformly takes place throughout the entire cake batter and ultimately results in homogeneous cake crumb. For conventional cakes, a batter moisture content of 26. 9 % was sufficient to gelatinize all starch in the center crumb. More moisture evaporation during baking in the ERO resulted in the need to increase the batter moisture content to 30. 0 % to allow all starch to gelatinize in these cakes (further referred to as ERO cakes). Minimal temperature gradients during baking in the ERO resulted in cakes with minimal moisture gradients. Furthermore, starch gelatinization and protein network formation by covalent linkage formation occurred in a similar way during both conventional and ERO baking. All in all, ERO baking allows producing homogeneous cake samples, with starch and protein properties {{similar to those of the}} center of conventional cakes. Only in the outer <b>crumb</b> <b>layer,</b> i. e. at a distance of up to 1 cm from the side walls in the ERO, starch and protein properties may be slightly different because of the small temperature gradient close to the surface. Moisture migration from crumb to crust contributes to firmingof crumb of conventional cakes and evidently not to that of ERO cakes. DSC and 1 H NMR measurements showed that the contribution of amylopectin retrogradation to crumb firming was rather small but significant in both cake types. To further study the importance of amylopectin retrogradation for pound cake crumb firming, amylases were included in the recipe. The texture of the resultant ERO cakes was monitored during storage. First, activity of amylases with varying modes of action, i. e. maltogenic, maltotetraose forming and endo-amylases, was measured in different sucrose concentrations and at different temperatures. To work properly during cake baking, the amylases should be active at high temperature (85 &# 176;C) and in high sucrose concentrations. Our results showed that the maltotetraose forming amylase was the least sensitive to both high temperature and high sucrose concentrations. Based on the results, different amylases with varying working mechanisms, i. e. two maltogenic amylases, an endo-amylase and a maltotetraose forming amylase, were selected for cake making and enzyme dosages appropriate for cake making were determined based on dose-response curves for cake volume. In the last part of this study, the amylases selected in the previous chapter were added to the recipe of ERO cakes in doses determined as described above. The crumb texture evolution of these cakes during storage was monitored and related to changes in amylopectin retrogradation and proton mobility. The impact of amylases on cake firming during storage depends on their mode of action and the effects on cake crumb firming resemble those found for bread crumb firming. Since starch in cake batter is much more diluted than in bread dough, and because of the high levels of sugar in cake batter, it is hypothesized that starch in pound cake is present in more or less intact swollen granules, surrounded by a limited amount of leached amylose, and embedded in a protein network. Exo-amylases limit crystallization of the side chains of amylopectin inside the granular structures. In contrast, endo-amylases had only a limited impact on amylopectin retrogradation. The anti-firming effect of exo-amylases was more pronounced than that of endo-amylases in line with what is known for bread systems. All in all, we conclude that some exo-amylases are effective anti-firming agents in cake. Their anti-firming properties very likely result from inhibition of amylopectin retrogradation. Although amylopectin retrogradation was reduced to a great extent in cakes baked with (some) amylases, crumb firming of these cakes was much less affected. Therefore, we conclude that the firming of ERO cakes during storage is also influenced by processes other than amylopectin retrogradation. In conclusion, comparison of the changes in crumb properties of conventional and ERO cakes during storage allowed putting forward a crumb firming mechanism maintaining that crumb to crust moisture migration is the dominant and amylopectin retrogradation is only a minor factor in cake crumb firming. Further work will be needed to unravel the role of other components such as amylose, protein and lipids in cake crumb firming during storage. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|According to prognoses milder winters {{with more}} precipitation, warmer and dry summers, and extreme {{fluctuations}} in the precipitation and temperature should be expected in the Pannonian region from the 2 nd decade of the 21 st century. The first {{aim of this study}} was to discuss the predicted climate phenomena endangering regional soils and deploying methods of measures in the alleviation. Examples of soils deterioration to be typical in seasons and confirmation that tillage should be an important tool realising soil preservation solutions in the practice are presented. Considering the predicted climate extremes most of classical beliefs are to be supervised. The effects of the rain stress e. g. washing dust and clay colloids down, surface siltation, soil settlement, extension of the existing compact <b>layer</b> and deteriorating <b>crumb</b> fraction in regional soils are demonstrated. Negative impacts of the drought stress on soils are also presented, among others, soil desiccation, unutilised water below serious pan <b>layers,</b> <b>crumb</b> reduction and increased dust and crust formation. The first evidence of the investigation is that climate will be more incalculable in the next decades, and for this reason applying mitigation methods is really urgent. The second evidence refers to the soil tillage which could take part in the degree of climate induced damages through soil condition modification. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the future}} {{the amount of}} farm {{subsidies}} is no more yield dependent. As a following the optimum of the production function is shifted from yield optimisation to costs minimisation. This forces organic farmers to reduce production costs, because marginal profit of yield increase {{is lower than the}} costs of the marginal factor input to raise the yield. Direct drilling proofed to save costs in mainstream cereal production under application of chemical weed and pest control. Expensive weed control in organic farming is the main reason why direct drilling technique in organic farming is hardly applied. The aim of the project is to develop a suitable direct drilling technology for organic cereal production under Finnish conditions that guarantees 1. Reasonable weed control, 2. Reduced traffic, 3. Improved soil structure, 4. Cost savings, 5. High cereal quality. Material and methods: Cereals will be drilled into white clover at the organic research farm of MTT Agricultural Engineering Research in Vihti. Some annual subcrop will also be tested. The experiment will be conducted with spring and winter cereals. At least the following four variants are tested: Direct drilling after ploughing, direct drilling after mowing of white clover, mowing of white clover after direct drilling and direct drilling without mowing of white clover. The project is divided into five work packages: 1. Direct drilling technology: Within this work package all technical aspects of the project are handled. Both spring cereal and winter cereal experiments will be established at Vihti. Four treatments are applied with five replications on 25 m* 3 m sized plots. The knowledge, which is obtained in MTT's project: "Direct drilling of spring cereals", will be utilized during this study. 2. Weed control: Within this work package quantity and distribution of weeds is recorded. Perennial weeds are regarded as major threat in cereal production, particularly in organic farming in Finland. The most common and harmful species are Elymus repens, Cirsium arvense and Sonchus arvensis. During the growing period weed survey is conducted, weeds are counted and their dry matter mass is measured. 3. Soil structure: Within this work package quality of soil structure is recorded: Profile of tilled soil, soil odour, soil colour, soil <b>crumb,</b> soil <b>layers,</b> organic material, root development, soil surface and earth worm activities. 4. Crop management and quality: Organic cereal (mainly barley) production often suffers from protein quality. Beside a carefully planned crop rotation under sowing of legumes or legume blends e. g. during row harrowing can solve the problem. Because nitrogen is considered as the limiting factor in respect of quality and yield of organically produced cereals, simultaneous cultivation of cereals and legumes may support nitrogen nutrition. The following data will be collected: Growing stages and root development, yield, harvest index and grain quality in terms of protein quantity, thousand-grain weight, hectolitre weight and falling number, biological activity in terms of mass of edaphon, respiration, mineralisation of organic material, activity of enzymes, amino acid concentration, number of earthworms, environmental pollution in terms of N 2 O and NH 4 emission, biodiversity in terms of weed societies and diversity of fauna. 5. The economy of direct drilling in organic farming: The production costs of cereals will be calculated in direct drilling, in conventional tillage and also in minimum-tillage. This cannot be done untill yield and weed data has been obtained. All parameters above are recorded and analysed and concluded for further development of direct drilling techniques. Organic farmers and direct drilling equipment manufacturers will apply the results...|$|R
