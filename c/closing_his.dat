At Jinnah's request, Liaquat discussed the return with a large number of Muslim politicians and confirmed his recommendation to Jinnah.

5|$|Horvath, {{who worked}} as a dentist in the offseason in Los Angeles, was {{released}} by the Rams in 1949. He signed with the Browns a week later, <b>closing</b> <b>his</b> dental office and moving to Cleveland to reunite with Brown. Horvath, who was used primarily on defense early in the season, had an 84-yard fumble return for a touchdown in a game against the New York Yankees, and ran for two touchdowns in a November game against the Chicago Hornets. Cleveland finished the season with a 9–1–2 record and won a fourth straight AAFC championship. The AAFC disbanded after the season and the Browns were absorbed by the NFL, but Horvath decided to quit football to practice dentistry back in California.|$|E
5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte Grappa with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, <b>closing</b> <b>his</b> deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E

25|$|In most civil trials, the {{plaintiff}} begins the proceedings {{by making a}} speech opening his or her case. After {{the plaintiff}} has presented all the evidence {{on his or her}} behalf, the defendant must {{decide whether or not to}} adduce evidence.

However, if the defendant elects to adduce evidence, he or she proceeds to open his or her case, present the evidence on his or her behalf, and make a speech closing the case. The plaintiff may then make a speech in reply. If any party in his or her final speech raises a fresh point of law or cites any authority not previously cited, the other party may make a further speech in reply to that point of law or authority.|$|E
25|$|In March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became MD PIA {{and also}} open skies from Karachi to Dubai were {{declared}} and 12 private air lines {{were allowed to}} operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance. Farooq Umar to meet the challenge, fought the battle of open skies and opened up six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries along with tourists attraction 'air safari'. He also made major changes in routes and schedules and started non stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada. PIA added Jakarta, Fujairah, Baku and Al-Ain to its destinations in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: Sabre, Galileo and Amadeus. 'Air Safari' flights were launched in 1994 using Boeing 737–300 aircraft that used to fly over the Karakoram mountain range. Farooq Umar handed over PIA to another MD in March 1996, <b>closing</b> <b>his</b> tenure with great success and leaving PIA profitable with a profit for the previous six months of more than 55 million PKR. After his departure PIA started to nose dive. PIA purchased a Boeing 747 flight simulator to train its pilots. It also purchased another used Airbus A300 aircraft. A Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 {{to cope with a}} surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well.|$|E

[...] "His task", Krueger wrote to Swift, [...] "was undoubtedly a difficult one, but did not, in my judgment, warrant the nervousness apparent {{in some of his}} despatches.

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, stating that the episode had [...] "its moments, [...] but as a whole, it was {{somewhat}} lacking." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN {{found it to be}} [...] "one of the most bizarre and tasteless episodes of the season." [...] Furthermore, Haque noted, [...] "as with almost every episode of Family Guy, the plot takes many strange twists and turns. That often this leads to a muddled story with no sense of direction." [...] Haque also stated, that he was [...] "amused by Peter's static shocking escapade" [...] and [...] "liked the restaurant themed story angle," [...] saying that it was well executed. Overall, Haque finally noted that the episode managed to recapture some of the show's [...] "so-offensive-you-have-to-groan" [...] feel that was prevalent during the first few seasons. The fight with the Cripple-Tron ranked tenth position on IGN's Top 10 [...] Fights in the show. Brett Love of TV Squad found the cultural references to be a [...] "mixed bag," [...] but noted his enjoyment of the restaurant scenes, as well as Quagmire's brief appearance. In <b>closing</b> <b>his</b> review, Love stated, [...] "Overall, this one just didn't work for me. It's worth a look for a couple of the bits, but not an episode I'll watch when it gets repeated.

Handlen wrote that [...] "it’s hard to ask for more from an hour of television", despite noting that he was [...] "glad the series got cancelled". Handlen noted that he would [...] "look forward to their next projects". Handlen concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of [...] "B". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a positive review and claimed {{that there were some}} [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] scenes in the episode. Fowler also opined that the episode was [...] "thrilling", [...] "frustrating", [...] "fascinating", and [...] "terrible" [...] to see Hannah [...] "crying over an arrested Britten". Fowler wrote that he [...] "love the open ending". Noting that Awake was [...] "one of the good ones", Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9.5 out of 10" [...] classifying it as [...] "amazing". Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a positive review. He opined that Michael [...] "has a unique ability to dream in a way that feels real, why not recreate what was once lost". McHatton found it [...] "fitting that the show ended with Michael <b>closing</b> <b>his</b> eyes.
