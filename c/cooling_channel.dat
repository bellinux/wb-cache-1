To identify the differences, two kinds of three-dimensional numerical models are designed by the design method of <b>cooling</b> <b>channel</b> layout proposed in our previous research. The results show that, when the <b>cooling</b> <b>channel</b> layout is required so as to rapidly cool down and make temperature distribution of the plastic materials uniform, distinct <b>cooling</b> <b>channel</b> layouts are obtained because of different flow rates of coolant in the <b>cooling</b> <b>channel</b> between them.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{injection}} moulding process, productivity and part quality depend {{largely on the}} cooling system of {{the injection}} mould. Several cooling methods are being adopted by the mould industry, with the straight-drilled <b>cooling</b> <b>channels</b> method being the most popular. Many reported research activities {{have been based on}} this method, but the method has several limitations that prevent it from achieving e¤cient and uniform cooling. In the present work, a U-shape milled groove method was proposed for large and complicated parts, especially for parts with large free-formed surfaces. Simulations were made to compare the cooling eVect of U-shape milled grooves with that of straight <b>cooling</b> <b>channels</b> using COSMOS/DESIGNSTAR, an analysis software based on the ®nite element method (FEM). The heat ¯ux was calculated on a cycle-averaged basis and the natural convection between ambient air and the exterior mould surface was ignored. A mouse cover was used as a case study. The U-shape milled grooves were found to have better temperature control than straight <b>cooling</b> <b>channels.</b> The temperature distributions of the core and cavity with U-shape milled grooves were more uniform than with straight <b>cooling</b> <b>channels.</b> Moreover, the U-shape milled grooves removed the heat e¤ciently; the mould temperature was lower than that with straight <b>cooling</b> <b>channels.</b> The U-shape milled grooves method has demonstrated its advantages in mould cooling. Although U-shape milled grooves need to be machined using computer numerical control (CNC) machines and more machining time is required, making them more expensive than straight <b>cooling</b> <b>channels,</b> their potential bene®ts will be explored for practical applications...|$|R
