50|$|A <b>compression</b> <b>seal</b> fitting, unlike an {{epoxy seal}} or gasket, uses {{mechanical}} components and an axial force to compress a soft sealant inside a body which then creates a seal. An epoxy seal differs {{in that it}} is composed of some type of compound which is poured into a mold in an attempt to create a seal.|$|E
5000|$|... "Compression seals" [...] {{occur when}} the glass and the metal have {{different}} coefficients of thermal expansion such that the metal compresses around the solidified glass as it cools. <b>Compression</b> <b>seals</b> can withstand very high pressure and are used {{in a variety of}} industrial applications.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{cable or}} {{hydraulic}} hose connection is made {{through one of}} the stationary shafts and is <b>sealed</b> with <b>compression</b> <b>seals.</b> Shaft and connection sealing is made using high quality materials such as; NBR, FPM or carbon. Lubrication is achieved with oil or grease. Oil also helps to cool the motor, or motors can be air cooled.|$|R
50|$|Most {{automotive}} pistons {{have three}} rings: The top two while also controlling oil are primarily for <b>compression</b> <b>sealing</b> (<b>compression</b> rings); the lower ring is for controlling {{the supply of}} oil to the liner which lubricates the piston skirt and the compression rings (oil control rings). At least two piston rings are found on most piston and cylinder combination. Typical compression ring designs will have an essentially rectangular cross section or a keystone (right angled trapezoidal) cross section. The periphery will then have either a barrel profile (top compression rings) or a taper napier form (second compression rings or scraper rings). There are some taper faced top rings and on some old engines simple plain faced rings were used.|$|R
50|$|A single <b>compression</b> <b>seal</b> fitting may seal on {{a single}} or {{multiple}} elements. Sealing glands designed to seal on single elements consist of a body, cap, sealant and follower. When sealing on multiple elements, gland designs also include a seat and an anti-rotation pin to prevent wires or conductors from twisting and shearing. One or more insulators may also be included when electrical isolation is required.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possibility}} of seal construction is the <b>compression</b> <b>seal.</b> This type of glass-to-metal seal {{can be used}} to feed through the wall of a metal container. Here the wire is usually matched to the glass which is inside of the bore of a strong metal part with higher coefficient of thermal expansion. Compression seals can withstand extremely high pressures and physical stress such as mechanical and thermal shock. Because glass is extremely strong in compression, compression seals can withstand very high pressures.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that the presence of chlorine and chloramine compounds in municipal water (often deliberately added to retard bacterial growth) will cause deterioration of the internal chemical structure of polybutylene piping and the associated acetal fittings. The reaction with chlorinated water appears to be greatly accelerated by tensile stress, and is most often observed in material under highest mechanical stress such as at fittings, sharp bends, and kinks. Localized stress whitening of the material generally accompanies and precedes decomposition of the polymer. In extreme cases, this stress-activated chemical [...] "corrosion" [...] can lead to through perforation and leakage within a few years, but it also may not fail for decades. Fittings with a soft <b>compression</b> <b>seal</b> can give adequate service life.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for microbial contamination {{associated with a}} recently developed needleless closed luer access device (CLAD) (Q-Syte™ Becton Dickinson, Sandy, UT, USA) was evaluated in vitro. <b>Compression</b> <b>seals</b> of 50 multiply activated Q-Syte devices were inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis NCTC 9865 in 25 % (v/v) human blood and then disinfected with 70 % (v/v) isopropyl alcohol followed by flushing with 0. 9 % (w/v) sterile saline. Forty-eight of 50 (96 %) saline flushes passed through devices that had been activated up {{to a maximum of}} 70 times remained sterile. A further 25 Q-Syte CLADs that had undergone multiple activations were challenged with prefilled 0. 9 % (w/v) sterile saline syringes, the external luer tips of which had been inoculated with S. epidermidis NCTC 9865 prior to accessing the devices. None of the devices that had been accessed up to 70 times allowed passage of micro-organisms, despite challenge micro-organisms being detected on both the syringe tip after activation and the <b>compression</b> <b>seals</b> before decontamination. These findings suggest that the Q-Syte CLAD may be activated up to 70 times with no increased risk of microbial contamination within the fluid pathway. The device may also offer protection from the external surface of syringe tips contaminated with micro-organisms. © 2005 Hospital Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, connector insert and body. A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting rubber gaskets and <b>compression</b> <b>seals</b> at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|R
50|$|For ICCP on ships, the anodes {{are usually}} {{constructed}} {{of a relatively}} inert material such as platinised titanium. A DC power supply is provided within the ship and the anodes mounted {{on the outside of}} the hull. The anode cables are introduced into the ship via a <b>compression</b> <b>seal</b> fitting and routed to the DC power source. The negative cable from the power supply is simply attached to the hull to complete the circuit. Ship ICCP anodes are flush-mounted, minimizing the effects of drag on the ship, and located a minimum 5 ft below the light load line in an area to avoid mechanical damage. The current density required for protection is a function of velocity and considered when selecting the current capacity and location of anode placement on the hull.|$|E

40|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>seals</b> {{based on}} metal/mica {{composites}} were investigated under solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operating conditions. Since a compressive force {{has to be}} permanently applied in this sealing concept, the mechanical properties of the sealing materials and the SOFC components also became important for maintaining gas tightness. Leakage tests with a sandwich arrangement of mica paper and embossed metallic profiles show leak rates of < 1 x 10 (- 4) mbar l/mm s under an applied normalized compressive load of 2. 7 N/mm (0. 7 MPa). Also under thermal cycles between ambient temperature and 800 degreesC this leak rate does not change due to the elastic response of the <b>seal.</b> <b>Compression</b> tests with the seals in contact with SOFC membranes reveal no damage to the membranes. First results of leakage tests with SOFC stacks are presented, which {{may serve as a}} reference for future leakage tests of alternative sealing systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] than 1. 2 million people worldwide require regular hemodialysis therapy to treat end stage renal failure. Current hemodialysis systems are too expensive to support at-home hemodialysis where more frequent and longer duration treatment can lead to better patient outcomes. The key cost driver for hemodialysers is the cost of the hemodialysis membrane. Microchannel hemodialysers are smaller providing the potential to use significantly less membrane. Prior work has demonstrated the use of sealing bosses to form <b>compression</b> <b>seals</b> in microchannel hemodialysers. In this paper, estimates show that the percentage of the membrane utilized for mass transfer is highly dependent on the design and registration accuracy of adjacent blood and dialysate laminae. Efforts here focus on the development of a self-registration method to align polycarbonate laminae compatible with <b>compression</b> <b>sealing</b> schemes for membrane separation applications. Self-nesting registration methods were demonstrated with average registration accuracies of 11. 4 ± 7. 2 μm measured over a 50 mm scale. Analysis shows that the registration accuracy is constrained by tolerances in the embossing process. A dialysis test article was produced using the self-nesting registration method showing a measured average one-dimensional misregistration of 18. 5 μm allowing a potential 41. 4 % of the membrane to be utilized for mass transfer when considering both microchannel and header regions. Mass transfer results provide evidence of a twofold to threefold increase in membrane utilization over other designs in the existing literature...|$|R

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} drive towards {{improvements}} and achieving success in effective and long term sealing of portland cement concrete pavement contraction joints. A variety of joint sealing products and procedures have been applied in Iowa in search of improvements in seal performance. Hot poured rubberized asphalt products were mainly used for sealing all joints in earlier years for highways. In the 1980 s, silicone sealant products were becoming popular, especially for the major highways. As {{a high level of}} sealant performance was not achieved from silicones in Iowa conditions, other sealing products were tried. Preformed neoprene <b>compression</b> <b>seals</b> are being tried as a substitution for silicone sealants. Due to high costs of materials and installation with neoprene seals, the search for improvements through other joint sealing products and procedures continued.

2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed <b>compression</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R

Oil supplies associated with certain gas <b>compression</b> <b>sealing</b> systems are further exposed to potential dilution with lighter hydrocarbons, and gaseous dilutants such as H?S. Excess water and acquired hydrocarbon constituents which adversely influence the viscosity and other characteristics of turbomachinery lube oils must be removed periodically, if machinery distress is to be avoided. As part of a determined effort to maintain the reliability of critically important turbomachinery, a major petrochemical complex has implemented a lube oil quality assurance program. Vacuum distillation equipment is used for oil purification, and periodic analysis of 36 reservoirs is employed to quantify lube oil condition.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Almost 600, 000 {{people in}} the United States were treated for End Stage Renal Disease in 2010. A {{majority}} of those people received hemodialysis from central medical facilities. It has been reported a better treatment option for these patients would be realized if the patients had more frequent hemodialysis treatments. A major limiting factor in realizing home hemodialysis treatments is the capital cost of hemodialysis systems and the unit cost of hemodialysers. Microchannel hemodialysers show promise for reducing the size and cost of hemodialysis systems. Cost-effective and reliable sealing techniques for microchannel hemodialysers are required. This paper develops a reliable <b>compression</b> <b>sealing</b> method using sealing bosses in conjunction with an AN 69 ST hemodialysis membrane for enabling microchannel hemodialysis. The mechanical properties of the AN 69 ST membranes are determined and used to establish limits on the dimensional tolerances of the polycarbonate laminae and sealing bosses needed to hermetically seal a microchannel hemodialyser. A mathematical relationship is derived for determining the clamping force needed to seal the laminae for a given set of operating parameters and experiments are {{used to evaluate the}} model.
