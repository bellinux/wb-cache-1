In some cases, tone mapped images are produced from a single exposure which is then manipulated with <b>conventional</b> <b>processing</b> tools to produce the inputs to the HDR image generation process. This avoids the artifacts that can appear when different exposures are combined, due to moving objects in the scene or camera shake. However, when tone mapping is applied to a single exposure in this way, the intermediate image has only normal dynamic range, {{and the amount of}} shadow or highlight detail that can be rendered is only that which was captured in the original exposure.|$|E

50|$|Two-dimensional fibreglass-reinforced polymer is {{characterized}} by a laminated structure in which the fibers are only aligned along the plane in x-direction, and y-direction of the material. This means that no fibers are aligned in the through-thickness or the z-direction, this lack of alignment in the through thickness can create a disadvantage in cost and processing. Costs and labor increase because <b>conventional</b> <b>processing</b> techniques used to fabricate composites, such as wet hand lay-up, autoclave and resin transfer molding, require a high amount of skilled labor to cut, stack and consolidate into a preformed component.|$|E

50|$|Heap {{leaching}} is {{an industrial}} mining process to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore via {{a series of}} chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and then re-separates them after their division from other earth materials. Similar to in situ mining, heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner, then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the ore, whereas in situ mining lacks these liners and pulls pregnant solution up to obtain the minerals. Most mining companies, favor the economic feasibility of the heap leaching, considering that heap leaching is a better alternative to <b>conventional</b> <b>processing</b> (such as flotation, agitation, and vat leaching).|$|E

Bob Alvarez, former DOE official, stated that the long-term ramifications of the WIPP issue as being grounded {{in the fact that}} the DOE has [...] of transuranic waste that has not been disposed of due to the fact that there are no long-term disposition plans in order for transuranic waste, including 5 tons of plutonium that are in-situ at the Savannah River Site, as well as water from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State. In an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Alvarez wrote that [...] "Wastes containing plutonium blew through the WIPP ventilation system, traveling 2,150 feet to the surface, contaminating at least 17 workers, and spreading small amounts of radioactive material into the environment." [...] The URS Corporation, who oversees WIPP removed and demoted the contracted manager of the repository. Alvarez ponders the notion of [...] "contract handling" [...] of radioactive waste because it deploys <b>conventional</b> <b>processing</b> practices that do not take into consideration the tens of thousands of containers buried before 1970 at several Department of Energy sites.

A significant improvement compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>processing</b> was obtained. All advanced approaches {{lead to an increase}} in open circuit voltage and short circuit current.

The optimal processing window for the advanced approaches has lower fill factor than the <b>conventional</b> <b>processing.</b> However, the reduction does not result in lower conversion potential. Finally, the PERC type devices deliver a significant increase of more than 0. 4 % absolute in conversion efficiency. The structure which proved best was based on laser fired contacts (LFC).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare <b>conventional</b> <b>processing</b> with {{nonlinear}} frequency compression (NLFC) in hearing aids for young children with bilateral hearing loss. Methods: Sixty-four children aged between 2 and 7 years with bilateral hearing aids were recruited. Evaluations of cortical responses, speech intelligibility rating, consonant perception and functional performance were completed with the children wearing their personal hearing aids with <b>conventional</b> <b>processing.</b> The children were then refitted with new hearing aids with NLFC processing. Following a six-week familiarization period, they were evaluated again while using their hearing aids with NLFC activated. Results: The mean speech intelligibility rating and the number of cortical responses present for /s/were significantly higher when children were using NLFC processing than <b>conventional</b> <b>processing</b> in their hearing aids (p < 0. 05). Parents judged the children's functional real life performance with the NLFC hearing aids to be similar or better than that with the children's own hearing aids in both quiet and noisy situations. The mean percent consonant score was higher with NLFC processing compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>processing,</b> but the difference did not reach the 5 % significance level (p = 0. 056). An overall figure of merit (FOM) was calculated by averaging the standardized difference scores between processing schemes for all measures. Regression analysis revealed that, on average, greater advantage for NLFC processing was associated with poorer hearing at 4 kHz. Conclusions: Compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>processing,</b> the use of NLFC was, on average, effective in increasing audibility of /s/as measured by cortical evaluations, and higher ratings on speech intelligibility and functional performance in real life by parents.
