60|$|Every day {{and every}} day this unending battle goes on. Ukiukiu {{is the name of}} the trade-wind that comes raging down out of the north- east and hurls itself upon Haleakala. Now Haleakala is so bulky and tall that it turns the {{north-east}} trade-wind aside on either hand, so that in the lee of Haleakala no trade-wind blows at all. On the contrary, the wind blows in the <b>counter</b> <b>direction,</b> in the teeth of the north-east trade. This wind is called Naulu. And day and night and always Ukiukiu and Naulu strive with each other, advancing, retreating, flanking, curving, curling, and turning and twisting, the conflict made visible by the cloud-masses plucked from the heavens and hurled back and forth in squadrons, battalions, armies, and great mountain ranges. Once in a while, Ukiukiu, in mighty gusts, flings immense cloud-masses clear over the summit of Haleakala; whereupon Naulu craftily captures them, lines them up in new battle-formation, and with them smites back at his ancient and eternal antagonist. Then Ukiukiu sends a great cloud-army around the eastern-side of the mountain. It is a flanking movement, well executed. But Naulu, from his lair on the leeward side, gathers the flanking army in, pulling and twisting and dragging it, hammering it into shape, and sends it charging back against Ukiukiu around the western side of the mountain. And all the while, above and below the main battle-field, high up the slopes toward the sea, Ukiukiu and Naulu are continually sending out little wisps of cloud, in ragged skirmish line, that creep and crawl over the ground, among the trees and through the canyons, and that spring upon and capture one another in sudden ambuscades and sorties. And sometimes Ukiukiu or Naulu, abruptly sending out a heavy charging column, captures the ragged little skirmishers or drives them skyward, turning over and over, in vertical whirls, thousands of feet in the air.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. This work presents a three-dimensional geometric optimisation of conjugate cooling channels in forced convection with internal heat generation within the solid for an array of circular cooling channels with different flow orientations based on constructal theory. Three flow orientations were studied: Firstly, an array of channels with parallel flow; secondly, an array of channels in which flow of the every second row is in a <b>counter</b> <b>direction</b> {{to one another and}} thirdly, with the every flow in the array of channels in <b>counter</b> <b>direction</b> to one another. The geometric configurations and the flow orientations were optimised {{in such a way that}} the peak temperature was minimised subject to the constraint of fixed global volume of solid material. The cooling fluid was driven through the channels by the pressure difference across the channel. The system had hydraulic diameter and channel to channel spacing as degrees of freedom of the design variables. A gradient-based optimisation algorithm was applied to search for the best optimal geometric configurations that improve thermal performance by minimising thermal resistance for a wide range of dimensionless pressure differences. This optimiser adequately handles the numerical objective function obtained from numerical simulations. The effect of porosities, applied pressure difference, flow orientation and heat generation rate on the optimal hydraulic diameter and channel to channel spacing were reported. Results obtained show that the effects of dimensionless pressure drop on minimum thermal resistance were consistent with those obtained in the open literature. dc 201...|$|E

The measured ECCD switches from the co to the <b>counter</b> <b>direction</b> as the toroidal injection angle is varied with a profile width that is in accordance with ray tracing calculations. Tests of electron trapping in low beta plasmas show that the ECCD efficiency decreases rapidly as the deposition is moved off-axis and towards the outboard side of the plasma, but the detrimental effects of electron trapping on the current drive are greatly reduced in high beta plasmas. Overall, the measured ECCD is in good agreement with theoretical calculations using a quasilinear Fokker-Planck code {{over a wide range}} of injection angles and plasma parameters...|$|E

The tilt in characters contributes a major share in affecting {{the efficiency of the}} recognition algorithms. This paper presents a technique to estimate and correct the vertical tilt in printed characters of English in order to make an OCR to read the text more efficiently. The input characters are assumed to be segmented from the document image and free from noise. Initially, the direction of tilt of the characters is detected using a heuristically constructed knowledgebase. Next, the inclination of the character to its base is estimated using line drawing algorithm. Finally, the estimated tilt is corrected through rotation in <b>counter</b> <b>direction</b> of the tilt. The method has been tested with sufficient samples and readability analysis is performed with an OCR.

The {{toroidal}} flow generation by the ICRF minority heating is {{investigated in}} the Alcator C-mod like plasma applying GNET code, {{in which the}} drift kinetic equation is solved in 5 D phase-space. An asymmetry of distribution function in the parallel direction is found and two kinds of toroidal flow are observed. One is the sheared flow near the RF power absorption region depending on the sign of kk. The other is the toroidal flow, which {{is larger than the}} previous one, independent of the sign of kk. Additionally the toroidal flow reversal from co to <b>counter</b> <b>direction</b> is obtained when we change the toroidal current to the opposite direction. These facts indicate that there exists two kinds of the driving mechanism of toroidal flow. Two models to explain the obtained toroidal flow are studied. We find that the toroidal motions of energetic tail ions caused by the finite banana effect in the finite magnetic shear and, also, by the poloidal magnetic drift plays important role in the generation of the toroidal flow. 1...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{models on}} {{improved}} confinement with peaked density profile and on H-mode are discussed. A model theory of inward pinch and peaked density profile of ohmic discharges in tokamak is presented. Ion anomalous viscosity {{in the presence}} of sheared toroidal rotation causes the drift across the magnetic field. The ratio of viscosity to diffusion coefficient, Prandtl number, determines structures of E_gamma and density profile in a stationary state. In viscous plasmas, peaked profiles of both density and rotation velocity are possible without central particle/momentum sources. Resultant rotation of the core relative to the edge is in the <b>counter</b> <b>direction</b> to plasma current. Reduction of edge neutrals can induce further density peaking. H-mode transition model is further developed. The radial derivative of E_gamma, E_gamma 2 ̆ 7, changes ion losscone loss through squeezing poloidal gyroradius and electron loss by affecting micro-instabilities. Charge neutrality condition predicts cusp type catastroph in the relation between the gradient and flux at edge. At the transition, E_gamma 2 ̆ 7 jumps to negative and fluctuations and anomalous fluxes reduce simultaneously. Combined model predicts that the core density profile is flattened during H-phase. ...|$|E
