40|$|One {{hundred and}} seven {{patients}} with neurosurgical disease {{treated in a}} combined neurosurgical, neurological, and psychiatric unit within a psychiatric service were reviewed retrospectively. Most patients had acute <b>confusional</b> <b>states</b> or dementia without gross localizing signs and in only three cases did the neurosurgical illness closely resemble a non-organic psychiatric syndrome. The great majority showed abnormalities on physical examination and simple investigations. A past history of alcoholism and/or other psychiatric illness was common. Many apparently had been referred to psychiatric hospitals simply because they presented problems of management. Consequently, {{the staff of the}} psychiatric hospitals must be aware of neurosurgical disease and have free access to facilities for its investigation and management. If these requirements are fulfilled, the referral of patients with acute <b>confusional</b> <b>states</b> and dementia to psychiatric hospitals may indeed be preferable to their management in general hospitals, where their disturbed behaviour presents a variety of problems with which these hospitals are not usually equipped to cope...|$|R
50|$|Organic brain {{syndrome}} can {{be divided}} into 2 major subgroups: acute (delirium or acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state)</b> and chronic (dementia). A third entity, encephalopathy (subacute organic brain syndrome), denotes a gray zone between delirium and dementia; its early course may fluctuate, but it is often persistent and progressive. Damage to brain functioning could be due not only to organic (physical) injury (a severe blow to the head, stroke, chemical and toxic exposures, organic brain disease, substance abuse, etc.) and also to non-organic means such as severe deprivation, abuse, neglect, and severe psychological trauma.|$|E
50|$|Most {{patients}} with severe TBI who recover consciousness suffer from cognitive disabilities, including {{the loss of}} many higher-level mental skills. Cognitive deficits that can follow TBI include impaired attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive functions such as abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20-79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. Post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), a <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> with impaired memory, is characterized by loss of specific memories or the partial inability to form or store new ones.|$|E
50|$|Oneirophenia and {{schizophrenia}} {{are often}} confused {{although there are}} distinct differences between the conditions. Oneirophrenia {{has some of the}} characteristics of simple schizophrenia, such as a <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> and clouding of consciousness, but without presenting the dissociative symptoms which are typical of that disorder. Oneiophrenia often begins with the inability to focus on things while schizophrenia frequently starts with a traumatic event. Persons affected by oneirophrenia have a feeling of dream-like derealization which, in its extreme form, may progress to delusions and hallucinations. Therefore, it is considered a schizophrenia-like acute form of psychosis which remits in about 60% of cases within a period of two years. It is estimated that 50% or more of schizophrenic patients present oneirophrenia at least once.|$|E

50|$|A {{case study}} {{involving}} two patients {{who suffered from}} acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> and aboulia was conducted to see if these symptoms {{were the result of}} an infarct in the capsular genu. Using clinical neuropsychological and MRI evaluations at baseline and one year later showed that the cognitive impairment was still there one year after the stroke. Cognitive and behavioral alterations due to a genu infarct are most likely because the thalamo-cortical projection fibers that originate from the ventral-anterior and medial-dorsal nuclei traverse the internal capsule genu. These tracts are part of a complex system of cortical and subcortical frontal circuits through which the flow of information from the entire cortex takes place before reaching the basal ganglia. Cognitive deterioration could have occurred through the genu infarcts affecting the inferior and anterior thalamic peduncles. The interesting thing about this case study was that the patients did not show any functional deficit at the follow-up one year after the stroke and were not depressed but did show diminished motivation. This result supports the idea that aboulia may exist independently of depression as its own syndrome.|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of cognitive rehabilitative {{treatment in the}} acute stages after brain injury seems questionable because patients in severe acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> early after coma clinically seem unable to learn and store new information. Therefore, the capability of patients in acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> to learn and retain associative information was assessed. On two occasions pairs of simple nouns were presented to six patients in severe acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state.</b> Stimuli were presented repeatedly either in written form only or with additional pictorial representations. Immediate and 20 minutes delayed recall was measured. Patients in acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> were able to learn progressively more word pairs across several presentations. They retained some information over an interval of 20 minutes. In addition, they learned and remembered pictorially supported associations better than pure verbal associations. Patients in severe acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> may retain some explicit information and may profit from an imagery mnemonic aid. These results were not expected {{on the basis of}} clinical findings alone and they have potential implications for the care of patients in acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state.</b> ...|$|E

50|$|Fatal {{familial}} insomnia (FFI) is {{an extremely}} rare autosomal dominant inherited prion disease of the brain. It is almost always caused by a mutation to the protein PrPC, but can also develop spontaneously in patients with a non-inherited mutation variant called sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI). FFI has no known cure and involves progressively worsening insomnia, which leads to hallucinations, delirium, <b>confusional</b> <b>states</b> like that of dementia, and eventually, death. The average survival time for patients diagnosed with FFI after the onset of symptoms is 18 months.|$|R
