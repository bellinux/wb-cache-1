50|$|Built to the {{original}} specification, the covered market is built of cast iron pillars and lattice work iron roof structure supporting a wood and glass roof. It has a 90-foot span free from internal pillars, and the roof ridge slope drops 13 feet from Lancaster Road to Market Street. Perhaps the most unusual feature is the rainwater drainage. Water from the roof is collected in a <b>concealed</b> <b>gutter</b> and transferred via the structure to drain {{down the center of}} the hollow pillars.|$|E
50|$|Low-pitched {{corrugated}} iron roofs are {{hidden from view}} behind brick parapet walls. Rainwater, collected in <b>concealed</b> box <b>gutters,</b> is discharged through the parapet walls into painted metal rainwater heads and downpipes. Metal ladders bolted to external walls provide access to the roofs.|$|R
50|$|Tall masonry buttresses {{formed by}} the building's {{concrete}} frame punctuate the elevation between the towers and frame tall metal-framed windows with truncated tops. Transoms decorated with horizontal banding divide each of the window bays. Two secondary entrances are sheltered by smaller cantilevered awnings. The hall is set on a solid masonry plinth and is separated from the footpath by a low garden bed. Metal rain-heads drain from <b>gutters</b> <b>concealed</b> behind the parapet.|$|R
50|$|The World War I {{memorial}} pavilion {{stands on}} {{the southern edge of}} the rough-formed carpark of the ex-bowling clubhouse, near a palm-lined pedestrian path running diagonally from Honour Avenue to Ipswich Road. The square pavilion is rendered in concrete. The corner pilasters with ornamental capitals carry a thin encircling entablature, with a heavy projecting cornice above. A low parapet <b>conceals</b> a <b>gutter</b> for the domed roof. Standing on a plinth of concrete steps, each of the four arched entrances contains a decorative iron gate and fence. The pavilion shelters a square, polished stone pillar on a rough sandstone plinth. Marble tablets {{on each side of the}} stone pillar record the names of the dead from Stephens Shire, in World War I. A plaque also notes: July 1921- Erected by the residents of Stephens Shire and District in appreciation of our boys who sacrificed their lives in the Great War 1914-1919. A small sandstone flaming urn crowns the pillar. A World War II memorial stone stands to the west of the pavilion.|$|R
