INFANT MORTALITY FROM VIRAL INFECTION REMAINS A MAJOR GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERN: viruses causing acute infections in immunologically mature hosts often follow a more severe course in early life, with prolonged or persistent viral replication. Similarly, the WE strain of {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD 8 (+) T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-α supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which {{have been identified as}} one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment.

40|$|SummaryEffector CD 4 + T cell subsets, whose {{differentiation}} is {{facilitated by}} distinct cytokine cues, amplify the corresponding type of inflammatory response. Regulatory T (Treg) cells integrate environmental cues to suppress particular types of inflammation. In this regard, STAT 3, a transcription factor essential for T helper 17 (Th 17) cell differentiation, {{is necessary for}} Treg cell-mediated control of Th 17 cell responses. Here, we showed that anti-inflammatory interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), and not proinflammatory IL- 6 and IL- 23 cytokine signaling, endowed Treg cells {{with the ability to}} suppress pathogenic Th 17 cell responses. Ablation of the IL- 10 receptor in Treg cells resulted in selective dysregulation of Th 17 cell responses and colitis similar to that observed in mice harboring STAT 3 -deficient Treg cells.

Moreover, miR 155 deficiency in Treg cells resulted in increased suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS 1) expression accompanied by impaired activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT 5) transcription factor in response to limiting amounts of interleukin- 2.

Although comprised of several phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets, the differentiation of specialized Treg cell populations within the periphery is poorly characterized.

Additionally, delayed induction of the IL- 12 Rβ 2 receptor component after STAT 1 activation helped ensure that Treg cells do not readily complete STAT 4 -dependent Th 1 cell development and lose their ability to suppress effector T cell proliferation.
