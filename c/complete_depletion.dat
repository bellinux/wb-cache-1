5000|$|During {{the second}} year of Videnov's term, Bulgaria {{experienced}} a severe economic crisis and declining quality of living standard. One element of this was the grain crisis. In mid-1996, the first reports appeared that the country's grain reserves were near <b>complete</b> <b>depletion</b> due to excessive exports, and bread did actually become scarce for some time in the winter of 1996-1997. At the same time, the postponement of the payment of interest on Bulgaria's foreign debt, which had been negotiated by the Filip Dimitrov government (Union of Democratic Forces, UDF) in 1992, ran out and no further postponement was granted despite Bulgaria' continuing inability to pay. The government also failed to negotiate a loan to relieve the situation. This decreased the country's credit rating and initiated the destabilization of the finance system. In a short period of time, more than half of Bulgaria's commercial banks went bankrupt, with {{hundreds of thousands of people}} losing their savings, while the so-called [...] "credit millionaires" [...] profited enormously from the situation because their immense debts to the banks were reduced to nothing. Simultaneously, inflation skyrocketed, with the lev's value plummeting from 70:1 USD in early 1996 to 3,000:1 in early 1997, causing a sharp decline in purchasing power. According to the Bulgaria-based Institute for Market Economics, the hyperinflation was caused by the government's inept finance policy. Videnov himself blamed the Bulgarian National Bank's incompetent actions, and abuses committed during the previous coalition government headed by Lyuben Berov. Despite its initial refusal in order to save its reputation during the presidential elections campaign in 1996, the government was forced by the crisis to accept eventually the currency board proposed by the International Monetary Fund, a decision that was officially implemented by the next government in July 1997.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neutrophils are {{involved}} in thrombus formation. We investigated whether specific features of neutrophil activation characterize patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) compared to stable angina and to systemic inflammatory diseases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The myeloperoxidase (MPO) content of circulating neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry in 330 subjects: 69 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), 69 with chronic stable angina (CSA), 50 with inflammation due to either non-infectious (acute bone fracture), infectious (sepsis) or autoimmune diseases (small and large vessel systemic vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis). Four patients have also been studied before and after sterile acute injury of the myocardium (septal alcoholization). One hundred thirty-eight healthy donors were studied in parallel. Neutrophils with normal MPO content were 96 % in controls, > 92 % in patients undergoing septal alcoholization, 91 % in CSA patients, but only 35 and 30 % in unstable angina and AMI (STEMI and NSTEMI) patients, compared to 80 %, 75 % and 2 % of patients with giant cell arteritis, acute bone fracture and severe sepsis. In addition, in 32 / 33 STEMI and 9 / 21 NSTEMI patients respectively, 20 % and 12 % of neutrophils had <b>complete</b> MPO <b>depletion</b> during the first 4 hours after the onset of symptoms, a feature not observed in any other group of patients. MPO depletion was associated with platelet activation, indicated by P-selectin expression, activation and transactivation of leukocyte β 2 -integrins and formation of platelet neutrophil and -monocyte aggregates. The injection of activated platelets in mice produced transient, P-selectin dependent, <b>complete</b> MPO <b>depletion</b> in about 50 % of neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: ACS are characterized by intense neutrophil activation, like other systemic inflammatory syndromes. In the very early phase of acute myocardial infarction only a subpopulation of neutrophils is massively activated, possibly via platelet-P selectin interactions.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Leukocyte {{depletion}} {{has been}} shown to ameliorate the effects of reperfusion injury in many organ systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of leukocyte depletion on functional and endothelial markers of pulmonary performance after cold ischemic injury. Method: Groups of 6 rat lungs were flushed with University of Wisconsin solution and then stored at 4 °C for 4 hours. They then underwent sanguine reperfusion for 30 minutes, during which time functional measures (gas exchange, pulmonary artery, and airway pressures) were made and after which the lungs underwent estimation of endothelial permeability by measurement of the capillary filtration coefficient (in grams per centimeter of water per minute per grams of wet lung tissue) by a gravimetric technique. Four groups were studied: group 1 underwent no reperfusion, group 2 underwent 30 minutes of reperfusion, group 3 underwent 30 minutes of leukocyte-deplete reperfusion with an in-line leukocyte filter (PALL), and group 4 underwent 10 minutes of leukocyte-depleting reperfusion followed by 20 minutes of normal reperfusion. Results: The capillary filtration coefficient increased between group 1 and group 2 animals (1. 05 ± 0. 32 to 3. 07 ± 0. 47 [mean ± SEM]; P <. 01). <b>Complete</b> leukocyte <b>depletion</b> caused the greatest diminution in the capillary filtration coefficient (0. 392 ± 0. 07, P <. 001), but initial leukocyte depletion (group 4) also showed a significant diminution (0. 74 ± 0. 3, P <. 01). Complete or initial leukocyte depletion caused no significant change in functional measures of pulmonary performance. <b>Complete</b> leukocyte <b>depletion</b> produced less pulmonary leukostasis, as assessed by means of myeloperoxidase activity.

The contributions of CD 8 + and CD 20 + lymphocytes in suppressing the replication of the attenuated SHIVDH 12 R-Clone[*] 8 and maintaining a prolonged asymptomatic clinical course was assessed by treating animals with monoclonal antibodies that deplete each lymphocyte subset {{at the time of}} virus inoculation. The absence of either CD 8 + or CD 20 + cells during the SHIVDH 12 R-Clone[*] 8 acute infection resulted in the rapid, complete, and irreversible loss of CD 4 + T cells; sustained high levels of postpeak plasma viremia; and symptomatic disease in Mamu-A* 01 -negative Indian rhesus monkeys.
