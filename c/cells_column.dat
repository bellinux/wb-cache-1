(b) An Aibo-like robot dog with a soft tail, a soft body, and two soft ears interactively posed to walk and stand up. (b) Complex mesh models of man-made objects often consist of multiple components connected by various types of joints. We propose a joint-aware deformation framework that supports the direct manipulation of an arbitrary mix of rigid and deformable components. First we apply slippable motion analysis to automatically detect multiple types of joint constraints that are implicit in model geometry. For single-component geometry or models with disconnected components, we support user-defined virtual joints. Then we integrate manipulation handle constraints, multiple components, joint constraints, joint limits, and deformation energies into a single volumetric-cell-based space deformation problem. An iterative, parallelized Gauss-Newton solver is used to solve the resulting nonlinear optimization. Interactive deformable manipulation is demonstrated {{on a variety of}} geometric models while automatically respecting their multi-component nature and the natural behavior of their joints...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the mammalian neocortex requires radial and tangential migration of cells. Radial migration of differentiated neurons from the ventricular zone (VZ) is well established. It is hypothesised that an earlier phase of tangential migration of mitotically active cells lays down a widespread periodically spaced set of progenitors that generate radial arrays of postmitotic neurons. We use a transgenic cell lineage marker to label and observe the behaviour of progenitors {{before and during the}} early stages of neurogenesis. Using optical projection tomography (OPT), we show that individual progenitor cells generate many radially arrayed columns of periodically spaced <b>cells.</b> <b>Column</b> positions indicate the paths taken by these progenitor cells as they migrate, often over long distances, through the proliferative zone. Clonally related cells can be distributed in both hemispheres, suggesting progenitor cells cross the midline in the anterior neural plate.

30|$|Over {{the past}} 30  years, many {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} gain a better prediction of the complex interactions occurring in weathering mine spoils via a variety of techniques and some of the more notable examples are discussed below. Caruccio et al.

They concluded that the leaching columns provided the best approximations of field weathering conditions. Historically, column leaching studies have been favored for the more accurate prediction of pH/acidity generation via pyrite oxidation, TDS release from mine spoil, and the kinetics of trace metal leaching (Hood and Oertel 1984; Halverson and Gentry 1990; Caruccio et al. 1993; Daniels et al. 2009; Orndorff et al. 2010).

The proper formation of these structures is crucial to pregnancy outcome as they {{play a vital role in}} anchoring the embryo/fetus to the decidua. At the same time, they provide a route by which CTBs enter the uterine wall. The mechanism by which the integrity of the columns is maintained while allowing cell movement is unknown. Here, we present evidence that the interactions of L-selectin with its carbohydrate ligands, a specialized adhesion system that is activated by shear stress, play an important role. CTBs in <b>cell</b> <b>columns,</b> particularly near the distal ends, stained brightly for L-selectin and with the TRA- 1 - 81 antibody, which recognizes carbohydrate epitopes that support binding of L-selectin chimeras in vitro.

40|$|Fish fins are {{appendages}} {{which represent}} the limbs in higher vertebrates. In general, fish {{moves in the}} water by body undulation {{with the assistance of}} fins. To date, most of the studies focused on the innervations of limbs especially in mammals, such as rats, cats and monkeys. On the contrary, understanding on the innervations of the fish fin is still at its infancy as studies on the relevant field are relatively scarce. Hence, this study aimed to fill the knowledge gap, i. e. to investigate the organisation of spinal motor neurons in relation to the distribution of the median fins. For comparison purposes, four species of juvenile fishes utilised in this study were divided into two groups, namely (i) fish with long and continuous dorsal fin (Channa micropeltes, toman and Clarias sp., keli), and (ii) fish with short and non-continuous dorsal fin (Mystus nemurus, baung and Pangasius sp., patin). Spinal cord tissue obtained from three different representative segments along the rostro-caudal axis were processed histologically and stained using three neurohistological staining techniques including H&E, Nissl as well as Lillie’s Variant of the Weil-Weigert prior to light microscopy level observation. The organisation of motor neurons was correlated with the distribution of fins. <b>Cell</b> <b>column</b> organisation characterised the location of motor neurons into seven <b>cell</b> <b>columns,</b> namely intermediolateral (IL), dorsomedial (DM), ventromedial (VM), central (C), ventrolateral (VL), dorsoventral (DV) and retrodorsolateral (RDL) <b>cell</b> <b>columns.</b> It was observed that median motor neurons (IL, DM and VM <b>cell</b> <b>columns)</b> outnumbered central (C <b>cell</b> <b>column)</b> and lateral motor neurons (VL, DL and RDL <b>cell</b> <b>columns)</b> at all rostral, median, and caudal region of the fish body trunk.

The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by 1 D-NMR, 2 D-NMR, and FAB-mass spectroscopy. A substance, named M 4 - 3, was purified from the leaves of P. thunbergiana using various chromatography methods, and the absorbance of the substance was measured. The absorbance was highest at 410 nm, suggesting that the M 4 - 3 substance was a different compound from chlorophyll a and b, which absorb at 410, 502, 533, and 607 nm. Further analyses revealed that the M 4 - 3 compound was a 13 2 -hydoxy pheophorbide, a methyl ester with a molecular weight of 662. M 4 - 3 was identified as a derivative compound of pheophorbide, with a structure that magnesium comes away from the porphyrin ring. The results of the analysis of the cytotoxicity of the M 4 - 3 substance against the SK-HEP- 1 cells revealed that it in-hibited rates of cell growth by 40 % and 80 % at a concentration of 0. 04 μM and 0. 08 μM, respectively. The M 4 - 3 compound was found to be a photosensitizer for cytotoxicity because it was appeared only in light condition as examining activity in different irradiation conditions (light condition and nonlight condition) under the same concentration. Analysis of morphological changes in the cells following cell death induced by exposure to the M 4 - 3 substance reveled representative phenomena of apoptosis (nuclear condensation, vesicle formation, and fragmentation of DNA).

40|$|Cleavage of {{eukaryotic}} translation {{initiation factor}} 4 GI (eIF 4 GI) {{is required for}} shutoff of host cell translation during poliovirus (PV) infection of HeLa cells. Reports published by several groups have led to confusion whether this cleavage is mediated by viral 2 A protease (2 Apro) or a putative cellular enzyme (termed eIF 4 Gase) which is activated by 2 Apro or other aspects of viral infection. Here we have further investigated eIF 4 Gase activities in PV-infected <b>cells.</b> <b>Column</b> purification of eIF 4 GI cleavage activity separated two activities which generated N-terminal cleavage products of different lengths. Both activities were detected using either native eIF 4 G or radiolabeled recombinant eIF 4 G as the substrate. Analysis of cleavage products formed by each activity on native and mutant substrates suggests that one activity cleaves eIF 4 G 1 at or very near the 2 Apro cleavage site and the other activity cleaves approximately 40 residues upstream of the 2 Apro cleavage site. When PV infections in HeLa cells were supplemented with 2 mM guanidine, which indirectly limits expression of 2 Apro, two distinct C-terminal cleavage fragments of eIF 4 GI were detected. These C-terminal cleavage fragments of eIF 4 GI were purified from infected cells, and a new eIF 4 GI cleavage site was mapped to a unique site 43 amino acids upstream of the known 2 Apro cleavage site. Further, eIF 4 GI cleavage in vivo could be blocked by addition of zVAD to PV-guanidine infections. zVAD is a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor which {{had no effect on}} 2 Apro cleavage activity or PV polyprotein processing. Lastly, similar types of eIF 4 Gase cleavage activities were also detected in uninfected cells under various conditions, including early apoptosis or during cell cycle transit. The data suggest that the same types of eIF 4 GI cleavage activities which are generated in PV-infected cells can also be generated in the absence of virus. Taken together, the data support a model in which multiple cellular activities process eIF 4 GI in PV-infected cells, in addition to 2 Apro...|$|E

The L-region, through direct projections, excites urethral sphincter motoneurons. The present study investigated whether there are interconnections between the M- and L-regions.
