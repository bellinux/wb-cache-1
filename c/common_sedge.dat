5000|$|Carex lyngbyei is {{a species}} of sedge known by the common name Lyngbye's sedge. It is native {{to the west coast}} of North America from Alaska to California, where it [...] "is the <b>common</b> <b>sedge</b> of the Pacific coastal salt marshes." [...] It is also known from Greenland and Iceland. It prefers to grow in silty {{sediment}} rather than sand and in habitat with brackish water, such as salt marshes. This sedge produces stems 25 centimeters to well over one meter tall from a network of long rhizomes. The leaves have reddish brown sheaths which do not have spots. The inflorescence produces stiff, nodding spikes on peduncles. The fruit is coated in a leathery yellowish brown sac called a perigynium. This is a pioneer species, one of the first plants to colonize the mud of tidal flats in its range.|$|E
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to maintain water-table depths at a constant level in outdoor mesocosms. The system included a water treatment reservoir, where tap water was microbially deoxygenated and denitrified; an adjustable-level control chamber that set desired water table-depths and plant growing mesocosms. The soil water status was evaluated by constant monitoring using tensiometers, pressure transducers and dipwells. The robustness of the system was tested by inducing sudden incidents of flooding and drainage. The system was able to revert to the original set water-table depths within 5 and 10 minutes respectively. It also reliably sustained consistent water-table depths throughout the growing season {{without the need for}} maintenance. As an example, the method was used to grow plants at five set water-table depths: 50, 150, 250, 350, and 450 mm below ground surface. Two wet grassland species Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue), and Carex nigra (<b>common</b> <b>sedge)</b> were grown and dry biomass production recorded. Results showed differences in growth response between the two species to subjected water-table depths. In monoculture, F. pratensis production followed the order 50 = 150 = 350 > 250 = 450 mm (p 50 = 350 = 450 mm (p F. pratensis did not show a significant trend (p C. nigra showed 50 = 150 > 250 > 350 = 450 mm (p< 0. 001). The ease of the system to establish constant and or dynamic water-table depths and its reliability outdoors renders it useful {{for a wide variety of}} studies involving plant growth...|$|E
