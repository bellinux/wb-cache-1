5|$|Referring to {{the cases}} in which the High Court had upheld the wartime {{legislation}} allowing indefinite administrative detention, Kirby said that equivalent decisions in other countries had come to be regarded as embarrassing and incorrect, and should be likewise regarded in Australia. While <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> the scope of the Parliament's powers with respect to defence will be greater in wartime than in peacetime, Kirby said that they could not extend so far as to displace fundamental constitutional requirements such as those in Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|In late 1985, Jones {{announced}} his candidacy for lieutenant {{governor in the}} 1987 election, <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> he sought the office because {{he would like to}} serve as governor in the future. He convincingly won in the Democratic primary against Paul E. Patton, who later became governor, and David L. Armstrong, the sitting Attorney General and later Mayor of Louisville. Wallace G. Wilkinson, winner of the Democratic gubernatorial primary, praised Jones and said that, if elected, he would make Jones the head of a blue-ribbon economic development council. Wilkinson and Jones {{went on to win the}} general election; Jones defeated Republican nominee Lawrence R. Webster by a convincing vote of 517,811 to 186,321.|$|E
5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is said to}} be {{the founder}} of Jainism by the {{different}} Jain sub-traditions. Jain chronology places Rishabhanatha in ahistorical terms, as someone who lived millions of years ago. He is stated to have lived for 8,400,000 purva years. His height is described in the Jain texts to be 500 arc lengths (800 ells), or about 1,200 feet. Such descriptions of non-human heights and age are also found for the next 21 Tirthankaras in Jain texts, and according to Kristi Wiley – a scholar at University of California Berkeley known for her publications in Jainism, most Indologists and scholars consider all the first 22 of 24 Tirthankaras to be prehistorical, or ahistorical and a part of Jain mythology. However, among Jain writers and some Indian scholars, some of the first 22 Tirthankaras are considered to reflect historical figures, with a few <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> the inflated biographical statistics as mythical.|$|E

5|$|There was however one British {{squadron}} {{that had}} maintained {{contact with the}} French: since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805, the Admiralty had stationed a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth off Cadiz to watch {{the remnants of the}} combined fleet. In November 1805, reports reached Duckworth of a French squadron operating against British convoys off the Savage Islands between Madeira and the Canary Islands. This squadron, which belonged to Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, had left France in July 1805. Immediately sailing to investigate, Duckworth abandoned Cadiz, leaving just two frigates to watch the Allied fleet at anchor. Passing the Savage and Canary Islands, Duckworth continued to the Cape Verde Islands before <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> the French had escaped him and turning northwards again. Allemand was already far to the north. He eventually returned to France without incident on 23 December.|$|E
5|$|Rationalizing hermeneutics of myth {{became even}} more popular under the Roman Empire, thanks to the physicalist {{theories}} of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy. Stoics presented explanations of the gods and heroes as physical phenomena, while the Euhemerists rationalized them as historical figures. At the same time, the Stoics and the Neoplatonists promoted the moral significations of the mythological tradition, often based on Greek etymologies. Through his Epicurean message, Lucretius had sought to expel superstitious fears from the minds of his fellow-citizens. Livy, too, is skeptical about the mythological tradition and claims {{that he does not}} intend to pass judgement on such legends (fabulae). The challenge for Romans with a strong and apologetic sense of religious tradition was to defend that tradition while <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> it was often a breeding-ground for superstition. The antiquarian Varro, who regarded religion as a human institution with great importance for the preservation of good in society, devoted rigorous study to the origins of religious cults. In his Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum (which has not survived, but Augustine's City of God indicates its general approach) Varro argues that whereas the superstitious man fears the gods, the truly religious person venerates them as parents. According to Varro, there have been three accounts of deities in the Roman society: the mythical account created by poets for theatre and entertainment, the civil account used by people for veneration {{as well as by the}} city, and the natural account created by the philosophers. The best state is, adds Varro, where the civil theology combines the poetic mythical account with the philosopher's.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} interlude {{was provided}} by Hibs' participation as the Toronto-based franchise in the United Soccer Association. The team was known as Toronto City and eventually finished a 13-game summer league third in their division. Hibs opened the season by drawing 1–1 against Cerro Porteno at Yankee Stadium. Pat Stanton later praised the organisation and facilities provided by the league, although <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a long}} trip, causing some tiredness (it was played between domestic league seasons) and homesickness.|$|E

25|$|Giorgio Petrosyan was {{initially}} due {{to take on}} Yohan Lidon at Thai Boxe Mania 2011 in Turin on January 29, 2011 but the Frenchman withdrew in advance after <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> he {{would be unable to}} make the -70kg/154lb weight limit. Sudsakorn Sor Klinmee stepped in as his replacement and ran the Petrosyan relatively close in match that showed why both men are where they are in the sport but the Italian nonetheless had the upper hand throughout the fight and was able to pull off the unanimous decision victory. He then defeated Cosmo Alexandre by UD at the Fight Code: Dragon Series 2011 - Round 2 in Milan on March 12, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The Nashville sit-ins {{reached a}} turning point when the house of Z. Alexander Looby, a {{prominent}} African-American attorney and leader, was bombed. Although no one was killed, thousands of protesters spontaneously marched to Nashville City Hall to confront Mayor Ben West. The mayor had offered only weak half-measures and vacillated toward segregation. Meeting the mass of protesters outside city hall, West informally debated with them and concluded by <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> segregation was immoral. The bombing, the march, and Mayor West's statement helped convince downtown lunch counters to desegregate. Although segregation and Jim Crow {{were by no means}} over, the episode served {{as one of the first}} successful events of nonviolent protest, and as a significant example to the rest of the nation.|$|E

25|$|Western Pennsylvania {{leaders and}} {{most notably the}} {{designer}} of the 1992 modernization of Pittsburgh International, Tasso Katselas, {{pointed out that the}} reason fees and payments were higher than average is expressly because US Airways requested the most modern and advanced airport in the world in return for basing its hub there. Katselas has also been vocal that the issue of negotiable fees and payments are irrelevant when compared to the three biggest costs of any airline: fuel, time and labor, all of which his redesign of PIT from 1987–1992 helped to reduce. In fact, those changes created the most efficient, least costly and least financially wasteful airfield in the world. Although <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> those updates cost more, he argued they were more than offset by Pittsburgh's vast built-in nonnegotiable fuel and time, and to a lesser degree, labor savings.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{very little}} was {{returned}} {{except for a}} few ships. Since the Lend-Lease agreement did not provide any practical mechanism for allied nations to make good on any materials or equipment destroyed in the war, the United States government was in fact implicitly <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> it did not expect the return of every piece of material and equipment that it was loaning to its allies. Any suggestion otherwise in the part of the administration was intended more as political rhetoric to keep public opinion on its side as opposed to serious foreign policy. The intended and actual commitment the United States expected from its allies was to prevent the ravages of the conflict from reaching the North American continent. This in turn helped to ensure that the United States would be the world's strongest most prosperous industrial power {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{suffered}} a reversal in the 1983 general election, when the SDLP contested the seat. Maginnis won {{and held the}} seat for the UUP for the next eighteen years until he retired. By this point boundary changes had resulted in a broad 50:50 balance between unionists and nationalists and {{it was expected that}} a single unionist candidate would hold the seat in the 2001 general election. James Cooper was nominated by the UUP. On this occasion, however, both the nationalist and unionist votes were to be split. Initially, Maurice Morrow of the DUP was nominated to stand, with the DUP fiercely opposing the UUP's support for the Good Friday Agreement. Morrow then withdrew in favour of Jim Dixon, a survivor of the Enniskillen bombing who stood as an Independent Unionist opposed to the Agreement. Tommy Gallagher of the SDLP ran, but his intervention did not do enough damage to Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin's Michelle Gildernew won by 53 votes over Cooper. Subsequently, the result was challenged amid allegations that a polling station had been kept open by force for longer than the deadline, allowing more people to vote, but the courts—while <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> this happened—did not uphold the challenge, because it held that the votes cast after the legal closing time would not have affected the outcome.|$|E
