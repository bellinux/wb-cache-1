5|$|The use of {{scientific}} themes mark the play's position {{at a major}} turning-point in Verne's ideology. In Verne's earlier works, knowledgeable heroes aim to use their skills to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> for the better; in his later novels, by contrast, scientists and engineers often apply their knowledge toward morally reprehensible projects. The play, by exploring science in {{both positive and negative}} lights, shows Verne in transition between the two points of view.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Judaism, {{his fourth}} major {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors {{that resulted in the}} early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity. He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy.|$|E

Symbols were also used to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> Anglo-Saxons used symbols to differentiate between groups and people, status and role in society.|$|E
