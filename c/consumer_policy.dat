2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and <b>Consumer</b> <b>Policy</b> Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states {{to take a hard look}} at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} complementarities {{and tensions}} between competition <b>policies</b> and <b>consumer</b> protection <b>policies.</b> The paper argues that markets will often supply adequate customer protection {{without the need}} for extra public intervention. Special areas where intervention might be needed are discussed, including the need to combat deceptive marketing and the need to provide additional market transparency (about both headline prices and shrouded product attributes). A few instances are presented of how more intense competition can worsen the outcomes for (some) consumers. Situations in which poorly designed <b>consumer</b> <b>policies</b> can harm <b>consumers</b> are discussed, including how they can be used to protect incumbent suppliers, how they can relax competition between oligopolists, how they can reduce consumer choice, how they can focus on one aspect of market performance at the expense of others, and how they can lead consumers to take insufficient care in the market. ...|$|R
