5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are more <b>closely</b> related to particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of}} the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more <b>closely</b> related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more <b>closely</b> related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more <b>closely</b> related to Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|Archaeopteryx is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur <b>closely</b> {{related to}} the birds. Since the late 19th century, it has been accepted by palaeontologists, and celebrated in lay reference works, as being the oldest known bird, though a study in 2011 has cast doubt on this assessment, suggesting instead {{that it is a}} non-avialan dinosaur <b>closely</b> {{related to the}} origin of birds.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{striking}} {{differences in}} appearance, S.parthenopion {{may be most}} <b>closely</b> related to S.nicholsi. Like the diminutive S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, is very small. The geographic range of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two <b>closely</b> related populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E

5|$|In August 2011, {{militant group}} al Shabaab made a {{strategic}} withdrawal from Mogadishu {{to return to}} hit-and-run tactics. Mayor Mohamed Nur recognized the opportunity as critical to stabilizing and rebuilding the city by any means necessary. Working <b>closely</b> with the UN, USAID, and DRC, Nur's administration also started large-scale rehabilitation of roads and general infrastructure, with residents <b>closely</b> cooperating with the civil and police authorities to tighten up on security. Nur recognized the opportunity to transform Mogadishu although resources were limited. Working <b>closely</b> with urban strategist Mitchell Sipus, the Benadir government sought to design and deploy a data-driven approach to post-war reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} shows that Antrodia leucaena, A.infirma, A.primaeva, and A.variiformis are <b>closely</b> related species.|$|E

5|$|The P. rebeli is most <b>closely</b> {{related to}} both {{species of the}} Maculinea alcon (the M. alcon alcon and the M. alcon kondakovi) with the M. alcon alcon being more <b>closely</b> related to the P. rebeli than to the M. alcon kondakovi.|$|E
5|$|The fairywrens are {{a family}} of small, insectivorous {{passerine}} birds endemic to Australia and New Guinea. Most <b>closely</b> related to honeyeaters and pardalotes, they are more <b>closely</b> related to crows than to true wrens of the Northern Hemisphere. Two species are native to Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more <b>closely</b> related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more <b>closely</b> related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more <b>closely</b> related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the gold}} coins were {{certainly}} the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was <b>closely</b> controlled by the Aksumite state, as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes, and other precious metals were undoubtedly also <b>closely</b> controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency.|$|E

5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and the find {{was published in}} 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is <b>closely</b> similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and associated species like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, {{because they are not}} <b>closely</b> related to the type species O.palustris, but kept O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the sloth lemurs were more <b>closely</b> related to today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more <b>closely</b> resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled {{with the discovery of}} new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were more <b>closely</b> related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most <b>closely</b> related to mouse lemurs {{within the family}} Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or more <b>closely</b> related to sportive lemurs (Lepilemur).|$|E

5|$|During her directorship, Cosima opposed {{theatrical}} innovations and adhered <b>closely</b> to Wagner's original {{productions of}} his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with antisemitism. This was {{a defining feature of}} Bayreuth for decades, into the Nazi era which <b>closely</b> followed {{her death in}} 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.|$|E

5|$|Frank Womack {{holds the}} record for Birmingham league appearances, having played 491 matches between 1908 and 1928, <b>closely</b> {{followed}} by Gil Merrick with 485 between 1946 and 1959. If all senior competitions are included, Merrick has 551, less <b>closely</b> followed by Womack's 515 which is {{the record for}} an outfield player. The player who won most international caps while at the club is Maik Taylor with 58 for Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} of shapes and sizes, and {{in the range from}} <b>closely</b> resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between <b>closely</b> related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E
5|$|Harding's death {{came as a}} great {{shock to}} the nation. The {{president}} was liked and admired, and the press and public had followed his illness <b>closely,</b> and been reassured by his apparent recovery. Harding was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed <b>closely</b> in the newspapers. Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and after services there, home to Marion, Ohio, for burial.|$|E
