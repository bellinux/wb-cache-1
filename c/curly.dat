They have also been used for combined driving, western riding, ranch horses, trail horses, and companions for other horses. Some <b>Curlies</b> have been crossbred to gaited horses.

5|$|Donald Montgomery Hutson (January 31, 1913 – June 26, 1997) was a {{professional}} American football player and assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played as a split end and spent his entire eleven-year professional career with the Green Bay Packers. Under head coach <b>Curly</b> Lambeau, Hutson led the Packers to four NFL Championship Games, winning three: 1936, 1939, and 1944.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{was a key}} {{contributor}} to the club’s success and helped guide the team through several critical periods, including the NFL absorption of teams from the All-America Football Conference, <b>Curly</b> Lambeau’s resignation in 1950 and the important stock sale that same year.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} saved <b>Curly</b> Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, {{and that they}} were not the killer robots who {{slaughtered}} Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access {{to the top of the}} island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved <b>Curly</b> and restored her memories, they may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where <b>Curly</b> can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos - creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother - is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and <b>Curly</b> take his life.|$|E

5|$|It is {{the palms}} {{that are the}} {{signature}} plants of the island as the kentia and <b>curly</b> palms especially dominate the landscape in many places, the kentia being of special economic importance. All four species are endemic to the island, often occurring in dense pure stands, {{the one that has}} proved such a worldwide success as an indoor plant being the kentia or thatch palm (Howea forsteriana). This is a lowland palm with drooping leaflets and seed branches in 'hands' of 3–5 while the <b>curly</b> palm (Howea belmoreana), which occurs on slightly higher ground, has upwardly directed leaflets and solitary 'hands'. Natural hybrids between these species occur on the island and there is a mature specimen of one growing in the island nursery. On the mountain sides higher than about 350 m there is the big mountain palm (Hedyscepe canterburyana); it has large golf-ball-sized fruits while the little mountain palm (Lepidorrhachis mooreana) has marble-sized fruits and is only found on the mountain summits.|$|E

Further, Python has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.|$|E
