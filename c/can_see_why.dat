Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything.

In the film, a murderous and morally bankrupt psychopath named Frank Booth (played by Dennis Hopper) is obsessed with the song and demands it be played over and over, calling it [...] "Candy Colored Clown". In one scene it is lip-synced by a flamboyantly effeminate character played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth becomes enraged and beats the protagonist. Lynch later stated, [...] "it is a beautiful song and it was written by Roy... Those lyrics, that feel meant something to him. And it just so happened that a song in a certain situation could mean something else. And the way that Frank Booth used that song in two different places, it is just kind of unbelievable.

[...] Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor was officially released on September 19, 2006. The album featured production from Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mike Shinoda, The Neptunes, Prolyfic, among others. The record spawned the singles [...] "Kick, Push", [...] "I Gotcha" [...] and [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] featuring Jill Scott. The critically lauded album was later nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Rap Album. Fiasco won [...] "Best Urban/Alternative Performance" [...] for [...] "Daydreamin'". In the same year, he was voted by GQ magazine as the [...] "Breakout Man of the Year." [...] He also received four BET Hip Hop Award nominations, and it made it to number eight on Billboard 200 and number two on Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. That same year he participated in the first Cypher at the BET Hip-Hop Awards.|$|E
500|$|Star Cops was {{broadcast}} on Monday nights at around 8:30pm starting on 6 July 1987 on BBC2. Competition was provided on BBC One by sitcom Terry and June and The Nine O'Clock News. The fifth episode, [...] "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years", {{was broadcast}} at the later time of 9.55pm. The BBC listings magazine Radio Times promoted the series, {{giving it the}} front cover of the 4–10 July 1987 edition accompanied by a four-page article by Johnny Black inside. Star Cops performed poorly in the ratings with an average audience across the series of only 2.2million viewers. Chris Boucher has blamed the poor ratings on the timeslot the show was given, stating: [...] "There is nothing that has ever gone out on BBC 2 at half-past eight until twenty-past nine; it's a grotesque period. It doesn't synch with anything on BBC 1; it just doesn't work in relation to anything. You had to badly want to see Star Cops in order to watch it because you had to sacrifice {{at least two hours}} of viewing to see it. I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> people didn't want to have that problem.". He has also commented that the poor timeslot and the decision to air the series in July and August (a time when viewing figures are traditionally lower due to the summer) reflected the fact that Star Cops didn't have the confidence of the BBC management. This view is echoed by star David Calder who has described the timeslot as [...] "an act of sabotage and absurdity".|$|E

[...] Two reviews of Honey on the website Anime Jump greatly diverged: site maintainer Mike Toole rated the series 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "tons of fun, a light, tasty action-comedy that's... spirited and silly and tongue-in-cheek", and praised its character designs as [...] "letter-perfect to Go Nagai's original (quite appealing!) character designs"; Jason Carter praised Calvello's voice work in his review of the 2004 ADV release, but rated it 1.5 out of 5 stars, said that much of Cosplay City [...] "goes back and forth between looking like an ordinary modern metropolis and resembling some sort of Smurf town built of polluted marshmallows", and concluded [...] "The characters are largely annoying, the plot is , the nudity is absurd, the fighting is rarely more than average, and the whole thing is ultimately pointless - as the series' later attempts at developing Honey as a person make all too clear." [...] Sandra Dozier of DVD Verdict was also unimpressed with Honey: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> it is popular—the glossy animation, the well-endowed chicks, the scant clothing. If that isn't your thing, however, there is very little to draw you to this series." ...|$|E

500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that he has tried to downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible.

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E
500|$|MacDermot {{followed}} Hair {{with three}} successive rock scores: Two Gentlemen of Verona (1971); Dude (1972), a second collaboration with Ragni; and Via Galactica (1972). [...] While Two Gentlemen of Verona found receptive audiences and a Tony for Best Musical, Dude failed after just sixteenperformances, and Via Galactica flopped after a month. [...] According to Horn, {{these and other}} such [...] "failures {{may have been the}} result of producers simply relying on the label 'rock musical' to attract audiences without regard {{to the quality of the}} material presented." [...] Jesus Christ Superstar (1970) and Godspell (1971) were two religiously themed successes of the genre. [...] Grease (1971) reverted to the rock sounds of the 1950s, and black-themed musicals like The Wiz (1975) were heavily influenced by gospel, R and soul music. [...] By the late 1970s, the genre had played itself out. [...] Except for a few outposts of rock, like Dreamgirls (1981) and Little Shop of Horrors (1982), audience tastes in the 1980s turned to [...] with pop scores, like Les Misérables (1985) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986). [...] Some later rock musicals, such as Rent (1996) and Spring Awakening (2006), as well as jukebox musicals featuring rock music, like We Will Rock You (2002) and Rock of Ages (2009), have found success. [...] But the rock musical did not quickly come to dominate the musical theatre stage after Hair. [...] Critic Clive Barnes commented, [...] "There really weren't any rock musicals. [...] No major rock musician ever did a rock score for Broadway. ... You might think of the musical Tommy, but it was never conceived as a Broadway show. ...

60|$|We can {{understand}} {{how it is that}} all the forms of life, ancient and recent, make together a few grand classes. We {{can understand}}, from the continued tendency to divergence of character, why the more ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those now living. Why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms, sometimes blending two groups, previously classed as distinct into one; but more commonly bringing them only a little closer together. The more ancient a form is, the more often it stands in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent. Extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through other extinct and different forms.
