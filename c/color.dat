5|$|A yellowish-brown pigment is {{diffused}} {{through the}} cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in <b>color</b> {{just below the}} cuticle of the cap.

5|$|According to {{quantum chromodynamics}} (QCD), quarks possess a {{property}} called <b>color</b> charge. There are {{three types of}} <b>color</b> charge, arbitrarily labeled blue, green, and red. Each of them is complemented by an anticolor – antiblue, antigreen, and antired.

5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target <b>color.</b> Other times, cubes change <b>color</b> every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target <b>color</b> once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{commonly}} studied {{variations of}} vertex <b>coloring</b> {{have also been}} extended to edge colorings. For instance, complete edge <b>coloring</b> is the edge-coloring variant of complete <b>coloring,</b> a proper edge <b>coloring</b> in which each pair of <b>colors</b> must be represented {{by at least one}} pair of adjacent edges and in which the goal is to maximize the total number of <b>colors.</b> Strong edge <b>coloring</b> is the edge-coloring variant of strong <b>coloring,</b> an edge <b>coloring</b> in which every two edges with adjacent endpoints must have different <b>colors.</b> Strong edge <b>coloring</b> has applications in channel allocation schemes for wireless networks.|$|R

5|$|Commercial sashimi tuna steaks {{may have}} their {{coloration}} fixated {{by the use}} of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO is pumped into bags containing the tuna, which is then stored at 4° Celsius. The duration of time for <b>color</b> fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a two-inch tuna steak takes twenty-four hours for <b>color</b> fixation to be completed using this process. When utilized, <b>color</b> fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, <b>color</b> fixation using CO is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Eye <b>color</b> is {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat <b>color</b> definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye <b>color</b> will also affect the coat <b>color</b> or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on <b>color</b> terminology, with easily {{discernible}} {{differences between}} perception and vocabulary, Brown and Lenneberg published in 1954 {{a study of}} Zuni <b>color</b> terms that slightly support a weak effect of semantic categorization of <b>color</b> terms on <b>color</b> perception.

40|$|The Petersen <b>coloring</b> of 3 -regular graph G is {{equivalent}} to the normal <b>coloring</b> by five <b>colors.</b> The normal <b>coloring</b> is a good <b>coloring</b> of edges such that every edge and its four neighbours have together three or five different <b>colors.</b> Jaeger conjectures that every bridgeless 3 -regular graph has a Petersen <b>coloring.</b> If the conjecture were true, it would imply other interesting statements about 3 -regular graphs. In this text we investigate normal <b>coloring</b> by more than five <b>colors.</b> Jaeger theorem about nowhere-zero Z 2 3 -flow implies that every bridgeless graph has normal <b>coloring</b> by seven <b>colors.</b> Independently on the Jaeger theorem, we prove the existence of normal <b>coloring</b> by nine <b>colors</b> for graphs with a bridge, a cut of size two or with a triangle.
