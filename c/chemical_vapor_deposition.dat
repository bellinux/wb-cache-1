In this paper, the {{adhesive}} properties of hard coatings(TiN, TiCN) made by plasma <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>depositions</b> on non-nitrided and nitrided substrates was estimated using the scratch test, where adhesion {{was measured by}} the critical load (Lc).

30|$|Graphene can be {{produced}} {{in a variety of}} ways including a scotch tape method, <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>depositions</b> (CVD), and chemical oxidations/exfoliation/reduction of graphite using Hummers’ methods [3, 32 – 37]. Each method has its own advantages and challenges. Using mechanical exfoliation, on one hand, it is difficult to obtain large quantities of graphene, but the small yield of product is of a high quality [3]. CVD could also produce high quality graphene, but it requires specially designed instruments and well-controlled synthesis conditions [32, 38, 39]. On contrary, chemical oxidation/exfoliation/reduction methods could yield a large amount of graphene although resulting graphene, which can also be called reduced graphene oxide (RGO), could have defective sites and functional groups on graphene sheets [37]. Even though electrical conductivity of RGO is lower than others, chemical production of graphene based upon Hummers’ method followed by reduction is particularly suitable for mass production of nanostructured graphene because graphene oxide (GO) is a good basic building block to create a wide range of porous structures using bottom-up approaches [37, 40 – 42].|$|R

The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and is still widely used because of its relatively low cost.

5|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a {{hydrocarbon}} gas mixture.

Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E

Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
30|$|CNTs can be {{synthesized}} by {{a variety}} of techniques, such as arc discharge, laser ablation, and plasma-enhanced and thermal <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>depositions</b> (CVDs) [10 – 13]. Although the former two techniques are suitable for large-scale production of CNTs, they cannot be used for self-assembly on material surfaces. CNTs synthesized by CVD are known to be longer than those obtained by other processes. It is possible to grow dense arrays of aligned CNTs by CVD [14], as well. Therefore, CVD is one of the prominent methods for synthesizing high-purity, high-yield CNTs for practical applications. Meanwhile, control of the CNT structure has a technical advantage in that the structural diversity leads to different electronic and mechanical characteristics. Several {{attempts have been made to}} control the structure of CNTs by various methods, including the pretreatment of the metal films on which CNTs are grown [15] and the direct control of structure by varying synthesis parameters [16]. In particular, plasma etching can be used to transform a catalytic layer into catalytic nanoparticles, which might be applied to the density control of CNTs. In addition, however, to avoid the formation of metal silicide at a high temperature, a buffer layer was adopted in the annealing process [17].|$|R
40|$|Hafnium based high-κ dielectrics are {{considered}} potential candidates to replace SiO 2 or SiON as the gate dielectric in complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) devices. Hydrogen {{is one of the most}} significant elements in semiconductor technology because of its pervasiveness in various deposition and optimization processes of electronic structures. Therefore, it is important to understand the properties and behavior of hydrogen in semiconductors with the final aim of controlling and using hydrogen to improve electronic performance of electronic structures. Trap transformations under annealing treatments in hydrogen ambient normally involve passivation of traps at thermal SiO 2 /Si interfaces by hydrogen. High-κ dielectric films are believed to exhibit significantly higher charge trapping affinity than SiO 2. In this thesis, study of hydrogen trapping in alternate gate dielectric candidates such as HfO 2 during annealing in hydrogen ambient is presented. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) were used to characterize these thin dielectric materials. It was demonstrated that hydrogen trapping in bulk HfO 2 is significantly reduced for pre-oxidized HfO 2 prior to forming gas anneals. This strong dependence on oxygen pre-processing is believed to be due to oxygen vacancies/deficiencies and hydrogen-carbon impurity complexes that originate from organic precursors used in <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>depositions</b> (CVD) of these dielectrics...|$|R

Moreover, surface treatments, as hardening, coating or <b>chemical</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>depositions,</b> can be reliably carried out in fluidized beds. The surface-to-bed heat, mass and erosion rates control the actual efficiency {{as well as the}} velocity of the aforementioned industrial processes, and this explains the paramount importance of experimental and modeling studies to support a reliable design and operation of industrial processes. The fluid dynamic field around the immersed surface presents different peculiarities respect to the average characteristics of the fluidized bed. These peculiarities are responsible for the actual values of the mass and heat transfer between the surfaces and the fluidized beds. Similarly, they governed the momentum transfer, whose main aspect is the surface erosion caused by the impacts with the fluidized particles. This chapter aims to analyze the transport phenomena among surfaces immersed in fluidized beds in light of the most recent experimental and modeling results reported in literature. The main goal of this contribution is to shed light on the characteristics of each transport phenomena and to point out the real analogies among them...|$|R
