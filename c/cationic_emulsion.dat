40|$|AbstractDry {{eye disease}} (DED) is a complex, multifactorial {{pathology}} characterized by corneal epithelium lesions and inflammation. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion</b> of cyclosporine A (CsA) in a mouse model that mimics severe dry eye. Eight to 12 -week-old female C 57 BL/ 6 N mice with tail patches of scopolamine were housed in controlled environment chambers to induce dry eye. At day three, following dry eye confirmation by corneal fluorescein staining (CFS, score 0 – 15) and phenol red thread (PRT) lacrimation test, the mice (n =  10 /gp) were either treated 3 times a day in both eyes with drug-free <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion,</b> a 0. 1 % CsA <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion,</b> or 1 % methylprednisolone (positive control), or non-treated. Aqueous tear production and CFS scores were evaluated at baseline and throughout the treatment period. The lacrimation test confirmed the scopolamine-induced decrease in aqueous production by the lacrimal gland. A reduction of 59 % in induced-CFS was observed following topical treatment with 0. 1 % CsA. The beneficial effect of the <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion</b> vehicle itself on keratitis was also clearly evidenced by its better performance over 1 % methylprednisolone, - 36 %, vs. - 28 % on the CFS scores, respectively. This study indicates that the <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion</b> of CsA (0. 1 %) was a very effective formulation for the management of corneal epithelium lesions in a severe DED mouse model. In addition, it performed better than a potent glucocorticosteroid (1 % methylprednisolone). This <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion</b> of CsA (0. 1 %), combining CsA and a tear film oriented therapy (TFOT), i. e. with vehicle properties that mechanically stabilize the tear film, represents a promising new treatment strategy for the management of the signs of dry eye...|$|E

Sections included seawater in both layers of slurry, in the top only, and in the bottom only, as well as control sections using fresh water. After 18 years under traffic {{there was no significant}} difference between the performance of the sections made with seawater and those made with fresh water. It is concluded that salt water at least as saline and of similar composition to the seawater used (3, 2 % total salts, dominantly sodium chloride with some sulphate) can safely be used to make cationic slurries. It is uncertain whether this finding can be extrapolated to anionic slurries.

Measurement of the viscosity behavior of several emulsions by rotational viscometer, {{shows that the}} viscosity decreases under constant shear until an equilibrium viscosity is attained. A first-order kinetic model is {{used to analyze the}} viscosity data and to obtain rate constants for each emulsion. Based on their rate to attain an equilibrium viscosity, emulsions were ranked as follows: CRS- 2 R> CMS- 2 P> CRS- 1 P ~ CMS- 2 s> CRS- 2 > CRS- 2 P> HFRS- 2 > HFRS- 2 P. From the rate constants, relaxation times were obtained for each emulsion. Anionics had the longest relaxation times compared to the <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsions.</b> The steady-state viscosity ηss, initial viscosity ηo, and the viscosity η at any time were used to obtain the rate constants. The <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsions</b> attained their equilibrium viscosity at a faster rate that the anionics. This is attributed to the different type of interaction between droplets and aggregate microstructure. The different rates are consistent with the observation that pumping and stirring (shearing) of emulsions in the field result in a reduction of their viscosity...|$|R
40|$|A stable slow setting <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion</b> {{has been}} developed, {{suitable}} to coat dense graded mixtures high in fine aggregate content, in particular gap graded rolled asphalt type and dense graded macadam mixtures. The slow setting emulsion, NH- 10, is {{the outcome of}} an investigation into five different formulations using two surfactants, two adhesive agents and a water shading compound. The rheological studies of the NH- 10 emulsion have shown that it possesses a thixotropic behaviour. The thixotropic behaviour has been justified by the "complex flow" coefficient, a technique proposed by Traxler for bitumens. The viscosity of the emulsion is greatly influenced {{by the amount of}} binder and level of temperature. The hardness of binder does not change appreciably the viscosity value of the emulsion.

40|$|International audienceWhen a {{caustic soda}} {{solution}} is slowly {{added up to}} a <b>cationic</b> oil-in-water <b>emulsion,</b> prepared with dodecylamine as surfactant, the chemical equilibrium is altered. As a consequence, a progressive viscosity diminution is observed until complete <b>emulsion</b> destabilization. Original <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsions</b> are stable thanks to the droplet electrical double layer formed by the ionized surfactant adsorption on the liquid interface at very low pH values. However, the alkali addition changes the chemical equilibrium in different ways, such as reducing the hydronium ion concentration, allowing for dodecylamine deionization and increasing the ionic species concentration. These changes {{and the fact that}} the emulsion's droplet size and distribution remain constant (noticed by granulometric measurements) during the process, let us assuming that viscosity decreases as a consequence of the overall positive layer charge diminution. However, emulsion destabilization can be explained in terms of some formulation parameters such like SAD or HLD. Our system evolves from a very negative to a positive HLD value passing through the optimal formulation when destabilization is observed.

The non-ionic surfactant Tween 20 is particularly effective at producing uniformly sized lipid droplets by premix membrane emulsification, but the droplets produced have a low net charge. The interfacial characteristics of emulsion droplets initially coated by Tween 20 could be made either negative or positive (without altering droplet size) by adding controlled amounts of either anionic emulsifiers (SDS) or cationic emulsifiers (DTAB or β-lactoglobulin) to the continuous phase after homogenisation.

40|$|An {{important}} flavor {{component of}} citrus oils is limonene. Since limonene is lipid soluble, {{it is often}} added to foods as an oil-in-water emulsion. However, limonene-containing oil-in-water emulsions are susceptible to both physical instability and oxidative degradation, leading to loss of aroma and formation of off-flavors. Proteins {{have been found to}} produce both oxidatively and physically stable emulsions containing triacylglycerols. The objective of this research was to determine if whey protein isolate (WPI) could protect limonene in oil-in-water emulsion droplets more effectively than gum arabic (GA). Limonene degradation and formation of the limonene oxidation products, limonene oxide and carvone, were less in the WPI- than GA-stabilized emulsions at both pHs 3. 0 and 7. 0. These data suggest that WPI was able to inhibit the oxidative deterioration of limonene in oil-in-water emulsions. The ability of WPI to decrease oxidative reactions could be due to the formation of a <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion</b> droplet interface at pH 3. 0, which can repel prooxidative metals, and/or the ability of amino acids in WPI to scavenge free radical and chelate prooxidative metals...|$|E

According to cationic emulsifier, a quaternary ammonium salt was used. The different emulsions have been studied. Macroscopic and microscopic observations as well as size distribution measurements have been performed to evaluate the emulsion destabilisation.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present work were to prepare castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing cationic droplets stabilized by poloxamer–chitosan emulgator film and to assess the kinetic stability of the prepared <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion</b> after subjecting it to thermal processing and freeze–thaw cycling. Presence of cryoprotectants (5 %, w/w, sucrose + 5 %, w/w, sorbitol) improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling. After storing the emulsion at 4 °C, 25 °C, and 37 °C {{over a period of}} up to 6  months, no significant change was noted in mean diameter of the dispersed oil droplets. However, the emulsion stored at the highest temperature did show a progressive decrease in the pH and zeta potential values, whereas the emulsion kept at the lowest temperatures did not. This indicates that at 37 °C, free fatty acids were formed from the castor oil, and consequently, the liberated free fatty acids were responsible for the reduction in the emulsion pH and zeta potential values.

Degradation of citral was equal to or less in GA- than WPI-stabilized emulsion at pH 3. 0 and 7. 0.

Marshall stability results of mixes with 10 % Type C fly ash showed optimum emulsion contents of 6. 8, 7. 3 and 7. 8 % for 2, 4 and 6 % rubber, respectively. The Marshall stability values decreased for increasing rubber contents. The target Marshall stability value of a suitable cold mix at 43 ºC was required to be 2225 N.

Our results indicated that (0. 1 % w/w) chitosan adsorbed to a 20 % w/w phosphatidylcholine-stabilized anionic primary emulsion to form a secondary <b>cationic</b> <b>emulsion</b> by electrostatic attraction forces under conditions resembling the stomach (pH 2). Bile salts (6 mM) were added to simulate secretion in the small intestine and pH increase. Bile salts adsorbed to the chitosan secondary emulsion, which resulted in aggregation of oil droplets followed by coalescence due to close packing of droplets. Increased viscosity (267 – 2531 cp) and increased degree of deacetylation (40 – 92 % DDA) of chitosan enhanced emulsion breakdown. Increasing the pH to 7. 5 without addition of bile salts yielded little aggregation. Pronounced aggregation is thought to decrease the accessibility of lipase to the oil resulting in lower bioavailability and reduced caloric intake. Understanding how chitosan interacts with oil droplets in the digestive tract is vital to developing a comprehensive model of the influence of chitosan on the bioavailability of dietary lipids.

These galloyl derivatives exhibited both antioxidative free radical scavenging and prooxidative Fe 3 +-reducing activity. Initial metal-reduction rate by the galloyl derivatives was higher at pH 3 than 7. Galloyl derivatives did not associate with SDS-stabilized emulsion but partition into Brij-stabilized emulsion droplets. Galloyl derivatives did not alter iron-droplet association by chelation. Charge status of the galloyl derivatives influenced their ability to partition into Brij-stabilized emulsion. ^ Strong association of iron with emulsion droplets is responsible for the low oxidative stability of SDS-stabilized emulsions. The amount of iron commonly found as a contaminant in emulsion can significantly accelerate oxidation. The prooxidant activity of contaminating iron can be controlled by use of chelators and nonionic or cationic emulsifiers. The net antioxidant/prooxidant effect of galloyl derivatives in emulsions is a balance between their free radical scavenging and metal-reducing activity. This balance is influenced by factors including pH, emulsifier type, galloyl derivative concentration and physical location. This study shows that surface property of the emulsion droplets and interactions among emulsion droplets, antioxidants, prooxidants and other co-existing substances are critical to oxidative stability of food emulsions. ...|$|E
40|$|Cold {{bituminous}} mixes as emulsion treated {{materials are}} considered as high potential development {{products for the}} future safe and environmentally friendly road materials. Laboratory asphalt mix design methodologies are aimed at predicting on site behaviour and determining the mechanical characteristics of mixes. The emulsion design method cold mixes is currently based on specifications which are used for hot mix asphalt. In some cases, laboratory behaviour fail to predict the on site one. In order to achieve laboratory optimization rules and design pavements including cold asphalt mixes, complementary test methods are required. This paper presents a methodology based on four tests to improve emulsion treated materials mix design and optimise mix components choice and proportioning by : - assessing the coating quality and the mix consistency, - monitoring the mix hardening versus time, - characterizing the chemical reactivity of aggregates in presence of <b>cationic</b> bituminous <b>emulsion,</b> - assessing the mix ability to drain water from manufacturing up to implementation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{investigation on}} {{the performances of}} cold asphalt emulsion mixes (CAEMs). The type of emulsion used was a <b>cationic</b> asphalt <b>emulsion.</b> The investigation was carried out at Leeds University, United Kingdom (UK). The objective of the experiments was to evaluate and to improve the performances of cold mixes and compared with hot mixes. For optimising the performances of the cold mixes, a target porosity of five to ten percent and indirect tensile stiffness modulus (ITSM) value of 2000 MPa was selected, suitable for low to medium trafficked roads. A simplified mix design procedure was used for producing the cold mixes. It was found that when properly designed, at full curing conditions, the stiffness (ITSM) of CAEMs {{were found to be}} very comparable to those of hot mixes. Test results also show that the addition of cement in the amount of one to two percent by mass of aggregates significantly improved the mechanical performance of cold asphalt mixes...|$|R
