40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> has increased since many companies have reduced their inventories of finished goods to decrease unnecessary tied-up capital. At the same time, these companies {{want to have}} the possibility to respond to fluctuations in demand. The fluctuations that previously were absorbed by the inventories have now been transferred upstream to the production sites. As a result of this transfer, high performance of the <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> is essential and problems have to be mitigated. Many companies believe in lean as an approach to improve processes and thereby gain competitive advantage. However, it is unclear if lean can be an approach to mitigate problems in a <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> process. With this background, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how companies can apply lean principles in their <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> process. This thesis was conducted as a case study at Nobel Biocare. Three research questions were formulated. The first question concerns the identifying of problems in the <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> process. In order to answer this question, 11 interviews were conducted at Nobel Biocare. Research question two investigates how lean principles can be used to mitigate the identified problems in the <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> process. Inspiration from three reference companies that have implemented lean principles in their <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> process were used as input to answer this question. The last research question was formulated to assess how the solutions could be applied into a model. A structure of the <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> process was used as a basis for categorising the solutions into three parts; preconditions for planning, planning hierarchy and planning cycle. The result of this thesis is that 17 problems were identified in Nobel Biocare’s <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> process. 13 out of these 17 problems could be mitigated with the use of lean principles. The conclusion is that companies will become more customer-focused by applying lean principles in their <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> processes. The findings of this analysis have been summarised in a model called the lean <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> process. Based on this model recommendations to Nobel Biocare have been given. The thesis’s contribution to theory is a starting point for closing the gap of how lean principles and <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> can be combined.

A computer program that mimics a concurrent ETO operation environment was written to validate the proposed methodology and test a set of rules that affect the performance of a concurrent ETO operation. ^ This study takes a systems engineering approach to the problem and employs systems engineering concepts and tools for the modeling and analysis of the problem, as well as for developing a practical solution to this problem. This study depicts a concurrent ETO environment in which <b>capacity</b> is <b>planned.</b> The <b>capacity</b> <b>planning</b> problem is modeled into a mixed integer program and then solved for smaller-sized applications to evaluate its validity and solution complexity.

40|$|We {{consider}} the capacity planning problem during a product transition in which {{demand for a}} new-generation product gradually replaces that for the old product. Capacity for the new product can be acquired both by purchasing new production lines and by converting existing production lines for the old product. Furthermore, in either case, the new product capacity is “retro-fitted ” to be flexible, i. e., {{to be able to}} also produce the old product. This capacity planning problem arises regularly at Intel, which served as the motivating context for this research. We formulate a two-product capacity planning model to determine the equipment purchase and conversion schedule, considering (i) time-varying and uncertain demand, (ii) dedicated and flexible capacity, (iii) in-ventory and equipment costs, and (iv) a chance-constrained service level requirement. We develop a solution approach that accounts for the risk-pooling benefit of flexible capacity (a closed-loop planning approach) and compare it with a solution that is similar to Intel’s current practice (an open-loop planning approach). We evaluate both approaches with a realistic but disguised example and show that the closed-loop planning solution leads to savings in both equipment and inventory costs, and matches more closely the service level targets for the two products. Our numerical exper-iments illuminate the cost tradeoffs between purchasing new capacity and converting old capacity, and between a level <b>capacity</b> <b>plan</b> versus a chase <b>capacity</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|E
40|$|Most modern {{companies}} {{are part of}} international economic networks, where goods are produced under different strategies, then transported over long distances and stored for variable periods of time at different locations along the considered network. These activities are often performed by first consolidating goods in appropriate bins, which are then stored at warehouses and shipped using multiple vehicles through various transportation modes. Companies thus face the problem of planning for sufficient capacity, e. g., negotiating it with third party logistic firms (3 PLs) that specify both the capacity to be used and the logistical services to be performed. Given the time lag that usually exists between the capacity-planning decisions and the operational decisions that define how the planned capacity is used, the common assumption that all information concerning {{the parameters of the}} model is known is unlikely to be observed. We therefore propose a new stochastic problem, named the Variable Cost and Size Bin Packing Problem with Stochastic Items. The problem considers a company making a tactical <b>capacity</b> <b>plan</b> by choosing a set of appropriate bins, which are defined according to their specific volume and fixed cost. Bins included in the <b>capacity</b> <b>plan</b> are chosen in advance without the exact knowledge of what items will be available for the dispatching.
