50|$|An {{activity}} in many unit record shops was sorting card decks into the order {{necessary for the}} next processing step. Sorters, like the IBM 80 series <b>Card</b> <b>Sorters,</b> sorted input <b>cards</b> into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter's settings. The 13th pocket was for blanks and rejects. Sorting an input card deck into ascending sequence on a multiple column field, such as an employee number, was done by a radix sort, bucket sort, {{or a combination of}} the two methods.|$|R

50|$|When {{the full}} time {{operation}} closed {{the service was}} taken over by volunteers. A new studio was constructed in two converted garages under a tower block in Plumstead, atop of which was the Cablevision receiving aerial. One garage contained the single camera studio, while the other housed the control room. There was a large glass window between the control room and studio so presenters waiting to do their spot could keep an eye on proceedings. Although paid-for advertising was not allowed the service did run a card advertising service whereby an automatic <b>card</b> <b>sorter</b> would show a continuous programme of postcard adverts. Unfortunately the machine used for this service was very unreliable and the <b>card</b> <b>sorter</b> would often get jammed.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{operation}} of a <b>card</b> <b>sorter</b> {{is to take a}} punched card, examine a single column, and place the card into a selected pocket. There are twelve rows on a punched card, and thirteen pockets in the sorter; one pocket is for blanks, rejects, and errors.|$|E
5000|$|A set {{of cards}} could be rapidly sorted by drawing number or other punched data using a <b>card</b> <b>sorter.</b> Machines are now {{available}} that scan aperture cards and produce a digital version. [...] Aperture card plotters are machines that use a laser to create {{the image on the}} film.|$|E
5000|$|Ballot cards punched on a Votomatic {{could be}} {{tabulated}} by standard punched card tabulating machines or sorted on <b>card</b> <b>sorters.</b> The machines cost only $185 each in 1965 dollars, and weighed only 6 pounds. This {{was one of}} the first machines to attract serious thinking about accessibility; John Ahmann filed for a patent on a punching stylus for the Votomatic adapted for use by voters with motor disabilities in 1986. [...] IBM marketed the Votomatic until 1968, when it spun off Computer Election Systems Inc. to produce and market the system. By 1980, the Votomatic system was used by over 29% of U.S. voters. By 1992, the Votomatic had replaced mechanical voting machines as the dominant voting system used in the United States. The dominance of the Votomatic ended abruptly following the Florida election recount of 2000.|$|R

50|$|A {{peripheral}} first {{offered on}} the Model 20 is the IBM 2560 Multi-Function Card Machine (MFCM). Because of its reliability problems, often involving card jams, the acronym was frequently interpreted as referring to many less favorable names. Nevertheless, the 2560 combines {{the functions of}} a card reader, card punch, interpreter, and <b>card</b> <b>sorter,</b> allowing the Model 20 to replace several separate pieces of punched-card equipment.|$|E

Cards are fed into a hopper below the operator's chin and are sorted {{into one of the}} machine's 13 output baskets, based on the data punched into one column on the cards. The crank near the input hopper is used to move the read head to the next column as the sort progresses. The rack in back holds cards from the previous sorting pass.|$|E
50|$|An IBM <b>card</b> <b>sorter</b> is {{a machine}} for sorting decks of punched {{cards in the}} format popularized by the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which {{dominated}} the punched card data processing industry {{for much of the}} twentieth century. Sorting was a major activity in most facilities that processed data on punched cards using unit record equipment. The work flow of many processes required decks of cards to be put into some specific order as determined by the data punched in the cards. The same deck might be sorted differently for different processing steps. The IBM 80 series sorters sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter's settings.|$|E
5000|$|Many early {{programming}} languages, including Fortran, Cobol and {{the various}} IBM assembler languages, used only the first 72 columns of a card — a tradition that traces back to the IBM 711 card reader used on the IBM 704/709/7090/7094 series (especially the IBM 704, the first mass-produced computer with floating point arithmetic hardware), which could only read 72 of the 80 columns in one pass. Columns 73-80 were ignored by the compilers and {{could be used for}} identification or a sequence number so that if the card deck was dropped it could be restored to its proper order using a <b>card</b> <b>sorter.</b> (An alternative, imperfect but commonly employed technique to maintain proper card order was to draw one or more diagonal stripes across the top edge of all the cards in a deck.) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>card</b> <b>sorter</b> of the 4A/CTS (Number 4A Crossbar / Card Translator System) allowed six digit {{translation}} of the central office code number dialed by the customer. This determined the proper trunk circuits to use, where separate circuit groups were used for different cities {{in the same area}} code, {{as in the case of}} Oakland and San Francisco. The new device used metal cards similar in principle to computer punched cards, and they were rapidly scanned as they fell past a light beam. On busy days, it sounded like a machine gun firing. CTS machines were called 4A (Advanced) if the translator was included in the original installation, and 4M (Modified) if it was added later. A 1970s version of 4XB, the 4A/ETS, used a computer to translate. For international dialing, Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) provided the extra computer power.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{at the end}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, well before the advent of {{electronic}} computers, data processing was performed using electromechanical machines called unit record equipment, electric accounting machines (EAM) or tabulating machines.Unit record machines came to be as ubiquitous in industry and government in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century as computers became in the last third. They allowed large volume, sophisticated data-processing tasks to be accomplished before electronic computers were invented and while they were still in their infancy. This data processing was accomplished by processing punched cards through various unit record machines in a carefully choreographed progression. This progression, or flow, from machine to machine was often planned and documented with detailed flowcharts that used standardized symbols for documents and the various machine functions. All but the earliest machines had high-speed mechanical feeders to process cards at rates from around 100 to 2,000 per minute, sensing punched holes with mechanical, electrical, or, later, optical sensors. The operation of many machines was directed by the use of a removable plugboard, control panel, or connection box. Initially all machines were manual or electromechanical. The first use of an electronic component was in 1940 when a gas triode vacuum tube replaced a relay in an IBM <b>card</b> <b>sorter.</b> Electronic components were used on other machines beginning in the late 1940s.|$|E
40|$|Indexing with {{computers}} {{is a far}} cry from indexing with the first indexing tool, the manual <b>card</b> <b>sorter.</b> With the aid of computer-aided lexicography, both indexing and indexing tools can provide standardization, consistency, and accuracy, resulting in greater quality control than ever before. A brief survey of computer activity in indexing is presented with detailed illustrations from NASA activity. Applications from techniques mentioned, such as Retrospective Indexing (RI), can be made to many indexing systems. In addition to improving the quality of indexing {{with computers}}, the improved efficiency with which certain tasks can be done is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|This {{package of}} {{programs}} {{is a result}} of the U. S. U. Library incorporating an automated control on the circulation of their books, which would provide the library with a daily record of all books in circulation, or not available for circu­lation, and send notices when books were overdue. Because of the long-range program of the Data Processing Department of the University, it was decided to develop the software for this project rather than purchase the hardware. The then existing hardware included the IBM 1401 computer (4 K), 1402 card reader, 1403 on line printer, and a <b>card</b> <b>sorter.</b> The only additional hardware required by the Data Processing Department was the 2 ̆ 2 read punch feed 2 ̆ 2 feature on the card reader. This report includes information for operating the programs involved in pro­cessing the data. Any information required in setting up the data collection system may be obtained from the U. S. U. Library. These programs were developed to be compatible with the previously mentioned hardware and were used until the data processing facilities of the University were updated. All programs were written in the SSPS II symbolic language...|$|E
40|$|For decades, the {{information}} industry {{has relied on}} traditional designs for information delivery. Typically these designs are dependent upon techniques and skills that have become limiting factors in their usage. With the dawning of an information enabled society, it is incumbent on our industry to develop comprehensive solutions to information problems and move beyond our traditional markets. We are an industry that is well positioned to create "killer applications.

40|$|The {{illustration}} on {{the cover}} and the header of each chapter depicts a relatively early attempt at classifying ‘documents ’ in different classes based on their content: the IBM Type 82 punched <b>card</b> <b>sorter</b> (mid-Sixties). “The Type 82 Electric Punched Card Sorting Machine groups all cards of similar classification {{and at the same}} time arranges such classifications in numerical sequence. “The operator places the cards in the feed hopper, sets the sorting brush on the column to be sorted, and presses the starting key. The sorting operation is accomplished at a speed of 650 cards per minute, per column sorted. The card feeding mechanism allows refilling of the card hopper while the sorter is in operation, eliminating stopping of the machine. “The pockets into which the cards are sorted have a capacity of 800 cards and the machine stops when the limit is reached in any pocket. By means of a selecting feature, all cards punched with any hole or holes in a single column may be sorted out while the remaining cards are passed into the reject pocket without disturbing their sequence. “After the card hopper is empty, the sorter continues to run long enough to allow all cards to be sorted into the correct pockets without the necessity for pressing the start key. “Alphabetical sequence sorting can be accomplished with this model by an extra sort, in which case the machine is equipped with alphabetical switch and pocket designations. “The Type 82 Electric Punched Card Sorting Machine can be specified for operation either from alternating or direct current. ...|$|E
40|$|SIO Refrence 62 - 13. A {{collection}} of 3, 465 detailed reports of sightings of surface vessels from aircraft of the U. S. Coast Guard are analyzed by pro-bit analysis to determine visual thresholds {{and measures of}} variance of the thresholds. Each of seventeen conditions affecting the sighting range is studied separately to determine its effect. Empirical functions are developed to describe the threshold effects of e~ch of the eleven following oonditions in decreasing order of importance: (1) meteorological visibility, (2) altitude of aircraft, (3) ship size, (4) height of major swells, (5) cloud cover, (6) wind velocity, (7) relative bearing of target, (8) sun altitude, (9) relative bearing of sun, (10) wake size, and (11) wind azimuth. Thresholds are developed for the six following discrete conditions in decreasing order of importance: (12) visual aid, (13) range determination method, (H) type of observing unit, (15) time of day, (16) observer, (17) station. In each case, tables of probit results and graphs are inoluded. Only wind azimuth is found to have an insignificant effect. Classification of data ia made by mechanical <b>card</b> <b>sorter,</b> probit analysis by electronic computer and {{the remainder of the}} calculations by desk calculator. Measures of precision are listed and 2 X, F and t tests are used at the 0. 05 level.
