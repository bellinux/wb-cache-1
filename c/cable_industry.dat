5|$|Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's {{chairman}} and {{former chief executive}} officer, first conceived the concept of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the Washington, D.C. {{bureau chief of the}} <b>cable</b> <b>industry</b> trade magazine Cablevision. It was a time of rapid {{growth in the number of}} cable television channels available in the United States, and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed nonprofit network for televising sessions of the U.S. Congress and other public affairs event and policy discussions. Lamb shared his idea with several cable executives, who helped him launch the network. Among them were Bob Rosencrans who provided $25,000 of initial funding in 1979 and John D. Evans who provided the wiring and access to the headend needed for the distribution of the C-SPAN signal.|$|E
25|$|After {{stepping}} {{down as a}} lobbyist for the <b>cable</b> <b>industry,</b> Freeport, Illinois native Robert L. Johnson decided to launch his own cable television network. Johnson would soon acquire a loan for $15,000 and a $500,000 investment from media executive John Malone to start the network. The network, which was named Black Entertainment Television, launched on January 25, 1980. Initially broadcasting for two hours a week as a block of programming on Nickelodeon (it would not be until 1983 that BET became a full-fledged channel), the network's lineup consisted of music videos and reruns of popular black sitcoms.|$|E

25|$|Novi Sad {{had always}} been a {{relatively}} developed city within Yugoslavia. In 1981 its GDP per capita was 172% of the Yugoslav average. In the 1990s, the city (like the rest of Serbia) was severely affected by an internationally imposed trade embargo and hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar. The embargo and economic mismanagement lead to a decay or demise of once big industrial combines, such as Novkabel (electric <b>cable</b> <b>industry),</b> Pobeda (metal industry), Jugoalat (tools), Albus and HINS (chemical industry). Practically the only viable remaining large facility is the oil refinery, located northeast of the town (along with the thermal power plant).|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} a {{financial}} success for Comedy Central and helped the network transform into [...] "a <b>cable</b> <b>industry</b> power almost overnight". Despite this, critics gave the season mixed reviews. Parents Television Council rated it so offensive that it [...] "shouldn't have been made": [...] "it doesn't just push the envelope; it knocks it off the table", while another critic {{thought of it as}} [...] "coming pretty damn close" [...] to being a [...] "perfect" [...] television series season.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} report seeks {{to estimate the}} value of the UK subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry,</b> considering its value to 1) the digital economy, and 2) the electricity industry. An initial estimate of the economic value of the UK telecommunications subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry</b> to the digital economy values it at £ 62. 8 billion per annum. The impact of the UK electricity subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry</b> is smaller but still significant at £ 2. 8 billion per annum. The economic value of the UK subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry</b> both for the telecommunications and energy sectors is then measured in more detail using the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling approach that has increasingly overtaken the more traditional Cost Benefit Analysis approach to computing economic values. This analysis also provides estimates of the impact of changes in the industry on various sectors of the economy, {{as well as on the}} macro economy. Yet first a qualitative research methodology, namely a Comprehensive Impact Evaluation Framework is applied to identify benefits of the UK subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry</b> to multiple stakeholders in the telecommunications and energy sectors. By identifying the relevant direct and indirect stakeholders, this ensures that the CGE models developed are as accurate as possible. The stakeholder analysis also allows us to going beyond a monetary analysis of the potential benefits of the subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry,</b> by identifying the range of stakeholders positively impacted by the presence of the UK subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry.</b> In the telecommunications sector there are benefits to businesses and households from better quality and speed of digital communication, as well as improved reliability of Internet connectivity. These benefits translate into improved business efficiency, improved ability to manage people and processes, as well as improved opportunities for the international communication of product and process innovations. In the electricity sector, the use of subsea cables is vital for the import and export of electricity, as well as to connect offshore electricity production to the mainland electricity grid system. Hence, subsea cables ensure improved reliability and security of electricity supplies, as well as access to international markets. Given that offshore electricity production is a vital part of renewables electricity production in the UK, this production has environmental benefits and contributes to reduced pollution and the UK’s better ability to meet pollution reduction targets. The qualitative and quantitative analyses combine to highlight the positive value of the UK subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry</b> both on the telecommunications and electricity market sectors. The impact on the telecommunications sector is larger as was to be expected given the importance of this sector on the UK economy as a whole, while subsea cables are of importance in the electricity market predominantly in terms of electricity imports and exports, and the production of electricity from off-shore wind farms. Not only is the UK subsea cables market important in terms of its impact on the telecommunications and electricity sectors, but the quantitative analysis has highlighted the benefits of future growth in the UK subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry</b> on UK macroeconomic variables including GDP; consumer income; capital formation; exports and imports and government revenues. Growth in the UK telecommunications subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry</b> is likely positively to impact the UK financial and insurance sector the most, while growth in the UK electricity subsea <b>cables</b> <b>industry</b> is expected to have its greatest positive impact on the UK manufacturing industry...|$|R

Non-political coverage includes historical programming, programs dedicated to non-fiction books, and interview programs with noteworthy individuals associated with public policy. C-SPAN is a private, nonprofit organization, funded by a 6¢ per subscriber affiliate fee paid by its cable and satellite affiliates, and does not have advertisements on any of its networks, radio stations, or websites, nor does it ever solicit donations or pledges. The network operates independently, and neither the <b>cable</b> <b>industry</b> nor Congress has control of the content of its programming.|$|E
2500|$|Comcast {{has been}} criticized for {{multiple}} reasons; the company's customer satisfaction often ranks among the lowest in the <b>cable</b> <b>industry.</b> In addition, Comcast has violated net neutrality practices in the past; and, despite Comcast's commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality, critics advocate a definition which precludes any distinction between Comcast's private network services {{and the rest of the}} Internet. Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service area; there is limited competition among cable providers. Furthermore, given Comcast's negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that Comcast could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds. And its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and content distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns. These issues, in addition to others, led to Comcast being dubbed [...] "The Worst Company in America" [...] by The Consumerist in 2010 and 2014.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1992, the team could {{demonstrate}} portions of the new platform, including the Green OS, the Oak language, the libraries, and the hardware. Their first demonstration, on September 3, 1992, focused on building a personal digital assistant (PDA) device named Star7 that had a graphical interface and a smart agent called [...] "Duke" [...] to assist the user. In November of that year, the Green Project was spun off to become Firstperson, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, and the team relocated to Palo Alto, California. The Firstperson team {{had an interest in}} building highly interactive devices, and when Time Warner issued a request for proposal (RFP) for a set-top box, Firstperson changed their target and responded with a proposal for a set-top box platform. However, the <b>cable</b> <b>industry</b> felt that their platform gave too much control to the user, so Firstperson lost their bid to SGI. An additional deal with The 3DO Company for a set-top box also failed to materialize. Unable to generate interest within the television industry, the company was rolled back into Sun.|$|E

2500|$|South Park premiered in August 1997 and {{immediately}} {{became one of}} the most popular shows on cable television, averaging consistently between 3.5 and 5.5 million viewers. The show transformed the then-fledgling Comedy Central into [...] "a <b>cable</b> <b>industry</b> power almost overnight". At the time, the cable network had a low distribution of just 21 million subscribers. Comedy Central marketed the show aggressively before its launch, billing it as [...] "why they created the V-chip." [...] The resulting buzz led to the network earning an estimated $30 million in T-shirts sales alone before the first episode was even aired. Due to the success of the series' first six episodes, Comedy Central requested an additional seven; the series completed its first season in February 1998. An affiliate of the MTV Network until then, Comedy Central decided, in part due to the success of South Park, to have its own independent sales department. By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls. Over the next few years, Comedy Central's viewership spiked largely due to South Park, adding 3 million new subscribers in the first half of 1998 alone and allowed the network to sign international deals with networks in several countries.|$|E
