50|$|Later on, {{the show}} {{reduced the number}} of <b>competitors</b> to 20, and then 12 in current shows. With the rules format changing, the <b>competitors</b> don't get {{eliminated}} throughout the show, but instead work as a team. The <b>competitors</b> are given, by Shogun Takeshi, 10 carts and the Shogun has no guard carts {{at the beginning of the}} episode. The <b>competitors</b> then play 5 challenges before the Showdown. In the first challenge, usually involved all the <b>competitors</b> playing at the same time, every single <b>competitors</b> must pass the challenge, while the subsequent challenges needs at most 5 passes in order to be credited as a win. Winning a challenge will cause the situation remaining unchanged, while losing the first challenge takes one cart away from the <b>competitors</b> team and one cart added to Shogun's team in Showdown. In subsequent challenges, one car is taken away and added to Shogun's team if less than 5 <b>competitors</b> passed, two cars are taken if less than 3 <b>competitors</b> passed. In current shows, with 12 <b>competitors,</b> two cars are taken away if less than 3 <b>competitors</b> passed, while 3 passes are credit with a win, and no cars are taken away. Losing a challenge also results in a punishment for the <b>competitors</b> in various ways, usually messy and painful. In Showdown, the team sends out two <b>competitors</b> per one cart they have to battle with Shogun's guards. Succeeding in Battle awards all <b>competitors</b> a share of 5,000,000 baht cash prize, but the prize is remain the same in all episodes.|$|R

5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} <b>competitor</b> negatively affected foraging efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a <b>competitor</b> on cryptic seeds remained low even after the <b>competitor</b> had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E

5|$|Then, late in 1983, the U.S. {{government}} made a financial commitment to help Israel develop its own new fighter, the IAI Lavi. Northrop objected to this, as the Lavi {{would be a}} potential <b>competitor</b> to the F-20 in the export market; while Northrop had to privately fund the F-5G, the government was directly subsidizing a foreign <b>competitor.</b> Congressional support for Israel overruled Northrop's complaints along with complaints from other branches of the government.|$|E

5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The <b>competitor</b> must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The <b>competitor</b> has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the <b>competitor</b> misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one <b>competitor</b> remains, that <b>competitor</b> may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each <b>competitor.</b> After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E
