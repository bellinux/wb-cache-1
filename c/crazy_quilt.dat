[...] "Me and My Shadow" [...] is a solo by Caan, covering the original version which was written by Dave Dreyer, Al Jolson, and Rose.

50|$|<b>Crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> {{became popular}} in the late 1800s, likely due to the English {{embroidery}} and Japanese art that was displayed at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. American audiences were drawn to the satin stitches used in English embroidery, which created a painterly surface, which is reflected in many <b>Crazy</b> <b>Quilts.</b> The displays shown at the Japanese pavilion of silk-screened work and Japanese pottery with a cracked-glaze inspired the American audiences. Similar aesthetics began {{to show up in}} <b>Crazy</b> <b>Quilts,</b> including unique patterns, and stitching that resembled spider webs and fans.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> {{differ from}} [...] "regular" [...] quilts {{in other ways}} as well. Because the careful {{geometric}} design of a quilt block is much less important in <b>crazy</b> <b>quilts,</b> the quilters are able to employ much smaller and more irregularly shaped pieces of fabric. In comparison to standard <b>quilts,</b> <b>crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> {{are far more likely}} to use exotic pieces of fabric, such as velvet, satin, tulle, or silk, and embellishments such as buttons, lace, ribbons, beads, or embroidery. Crazy quilting as a textile art is extremely creative and free-flowing by nature, and crazy quilters will often learn as much about specific embellishments as they will about crazy quilting itself.|$|R
40|$|Human {{artefacts}} {{in general}} are highly structured and often display ordering principles such as translational, reflectional or rotational symmetry. In contrast, human artefacts that are intended to appear random and non symmetrical are very rare. Furthermore, many studies show that humans find it extremely difficult to recognize or reproduce truly random patterns or sequences. Here, we attempt to model two-dimensional decorative spatial patterns produced by humans that show no obvious order. "Crazy quilts" represent a historically important style of quilt making that became popular in the 1870 s, and lasted about 50 years. <b>Crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> are unusual because unlike most human artefacts, they are specifically intended to appear haphazard and unstructured. We evaluate {{the degree to which}} this intention was achieved by using statistical techniques of spatial point pattern analysis to compare <b>crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> with regular quilts from the same region and era and to evaluate the fit of various random distributions to these two quilt classes. We found that the two quilt categories exhibit fundamentally different spatial characteristics: The patch areas of <b>crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> derive from a continuous random distribution, while area distributions of regular quilts consist of Gaussian mixtures. These Gaussian mixtures derive from regular pattern motifs that are repeated and we suggest that such a mixture is a distinctive signature of human-made visual patterns. In contrast, the distribution found in <b>crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> is shared with many other naturally occurring spatial patterns. Centroids of patches in the two quilt classes are spaced differently and in general, <b>crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> but not regular quilts are well-fitted by a random Strauss process. These results indicate that, within the constraints of the quilt format, Victorian quilters indeed achieved their goal of generating random structures...|$|R

60|$|He led {{me where}} the ravine opened wide. I felt, rather than saw, a steep slope beneath. Far down was a great patch of fire. It was like a <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt,</b> here dark, there light, with streaks and stars and streams of fire shining out of the blackness. Masses of slow-moving smoke {{overhung}} the brighter areas. The night robbed the forest fire of its fierceness and lent it a kind of glory. The fire had ceased to move; it had spent its force, run its race, and was now dying.

5000|$|In {{terms of}} quilts the latter {{years of the}} 19th century is best remembered for the [...] "Crazy quilting" [...] craze. <b>Crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> were made of {{abstract}} shapes sewn randomly together. Usually the quilt maker then used embroidery to embellish the quilt. Fancy stitches were sewn along the seams and often, embroidered motifs were added, including flowers, birds and sometimes a spider and web for good luck. Magazines encouraged making [...] "crazies". These simple, organic quilts were seldom used as bed-coverings, instead they were made smaller and without batting {{to be used as}} decorative throws.|$|R
5000|$|The motifs used in redwork were {{specific}} to the item embroidered: water motifs would be used on [...] cloths, the words [...] "good night" [...] and [...] "good morning" [...] used on quilts, and chairs on upholstered items. The most popular designs found in early redwork (prior to 1900) include Japanese inspired imagery, children, toys, animals and insects, and elaborately-coiffed women, {{some of which were}} adapted from designs made for <b>crazy</b> <b>quilts.</b> After the turn of the 20th century, Beatrix Potter characters and animals were the most popular. In the 1910s, tea-towel motifs were adapted into redwork designs, including calendrical themes and kitchenware. The following decade saw the predominance of state birds and state flowers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> are {{so named}} because their pieces are not regular, and they are {{scattered}} {{across the top of}} the quilt like [...] "crazed" [...] (cracked or crackled) pottery glazing. They were originally very refined, luxury items. Geometric pieces of rich fabrics were sewn together, and highly decorative embroidery was added. Such quilts were often effectively samplers of embroidery stitches and techniques, displaying the development of needle skills of those in the well-to-do late 19th-century home. They were show pieces, not used for warmth, but for display. The luxury fabrics used precluded frequent washing. They often took years to complete. Fabrics used included silks, wools, velvet, linen, and cotton. The mixture of fabric textures, such as a smooth silk next to a textured brocade or velvet, was embraced. Designs were applied to the surface, and other elements such as ribbons, lace, and decorative cording were used exuberantly. Names and dates were often part of the design, added to commemorate important events or associations of the maker. Politics were included in some, with printed campaign handkerchiefs and other preprinted textiles (such as advertising silks) included to declare the maker's sentiments.|$|R
6000|$|About noon {{of the day}} of Mr Croft's accident, Uncle Isham had {{occasion}} {{to go to the}} cabin of the venerable Aunt Patsy, and, of course he told her {{what had happened to the}} gentleman whom he and Aunt Patsy still supposed to be Miss Annie's husband. The news produced a very marked effect upon the old woman. She put down the <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt,</b> upon the unfinished corner of which she was making a few feeble stitches, and looked at Uncle Isham with a troubled frown. She was certain that this was the work of old Mrs Keswick, who had succeeded, at last, in conjuring the young husband; and the charm she had given him, and upon which she had relied to avert the ill will of [...] "ole miss," [...] had proved unavailing. The conjuring had been accomplished so craftily and slyly, the bewitched plank in one place, and Mrs Keswick far off in another, that there had been no chance to use the counteracting charm. And yet Aunt Patsy had thought it a good charm, a very good one indeed.|$|E
6000|$|Plez {{was quite}} {{ready for a}} {{reckless}} dash of this kind, and in less than twenty minutes old Patsy was informed that Mr Null had arrived. The old woman was much affected by the information. She was uneasy and restless, and talked a good deal to herself, occasionally throwing out a moan or a lament {{in the direction of}} her [...] "son Tom's yaller boy Bob's chile." [...] The <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt,</b> which was not yet finished, though several pieces had been added since we last saw it, was laid aside; and by the help of the above mentioned great granddaughter the old hair trunk was hauled out and opened. Over this hoard of treasures, Aunt Patsy spent nearly two hours, slowly taking up the various articles it contained, turning them over, mumbling over them, and mentally referring many of them to periods which had become historic. At length she pulled out from one of the corners of the trunk a pair of very little blue morocco shoes tied together by their strings. These she took into her lap, and, shortly afterward, had the trunk locked, and pushed back into its place. The shoes, having been thoroughly examined through her great iron-bound spectacles, were thrust under the mattress of her bed.|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} day, old Aunt Patsy was buried. Mrs Keswick and Annie {{attended}} the ceremonies in the cabin, {{but they did}} not go to the burial. After a time, it might be in a week or two, or it might be in a year, the funeral sermon would be preached in the church, and they would go to hear that. Aunt Patsy never finished her <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt,</b> several pieces being wanted to one corner of it; but in the few days preceding her burial two old women of the congregation, with trembling hands and uncertain eyes, sewed in these pieces, and finished the quilt, in which the body of the venerable sister was wrapped, according to her well-known wish and desire. It is customary among the negroes to keep the remains of their friends a very short time after death, but Aunt Patsy had lived so long upon this earth that it was generally conceded that her spirit would not object to her body remaining above ground until all necessary arrangements should be completed, and until all people who had known or heard of her had had an opportunity of taking a last look at her. As she had been so very well known to almost everybody's grandparents, a good many people availed themselves of this privilege.|$|E

40|$|When I {{began to}} {{research}} needlework {{in the early}} 1980 s the Library of Congress Catalogue directed me not to needlework, or even embroidery, but to the letter “W” – Women’s Work – {{the first step in}} a long and tangled journey. When I recently came across an 1890 s photograph of a Canadian woman and her embroidery by Hannah Maynard all I had to do was turn to Google to be directed to the BC Archives. My first reaction was glee – my second dismay – with 300 + hits how could I not know Mrs. Maynard? To date, Hannah Maynard (1834 - 1918), remains a relative unknown. Her work came under scrutiny in the late 1970 s – for what one author described as its “freakish, goofy, and often grotesque quality” and the designation “eccentric” continues to be used in describing both the artist and her photographs. Most of these references are limited to books on Canadian photography. However, eccentric suggests that she deviated from conventional practices or patterns and as a textile historian I disagree. There is a pattern here. It is my intention to show that Maynard’s photographs, with their repeated images and lavish embellishments, are closely linked to contemporary needlework – fashionable domestic embroidery and <b>crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> – and to suggest that it was this familiarity with the decorative and the domestic that allowed Hannah Maynard to move between the private and public spheres. While the British Columbia Archives in Victoria hold a large collection of Maynard negatives and several original photographs there are few business or personal documents to provide insights into the life and work of this artist. Of the images themselves, the majority fulfil contemporary expectations regarding portraiture and photography. I have identified these as her public images and include the studio portraits, group portraits, documented events, and landscapes. That these were truly in the public domain is underscored by an American journal of 1887 which proposed that “Photographers would not lose anything were they to send to [Mrs. Maynard] and secure a set of these views, and frame and hang them in their reception rooms…...|$|R
40|$|PREFACE In early America most quilts {{were made}} for {{utilitarian}} purposes. Later, when time and fabrics became more plentiful, quilt making developed into an art form which flourished during the 19 th century and continues to do so today. Within the broad definition of 2 ̆ 2 patchwork, 2 ̆ 2 three types are represented in this exhibition-pieced, applique and <b>crazy.</b> Pieced <b>quilts</b> are made from materials cut in geometric shapes and put together in pattern blocks. These blocks are repeated to form the quilt top. The designs were often of political, historical or religious events, but many also were associated with abstract visual ideas and images. 2 ̆ 2 Rocky Road to California 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Lincoln Quilt 2 ̆ 2 are examples of the first category; 2 ̆ 2 Indiana Puzzle 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Log Cabin 2 ̆ 2 the second; 2 ̆ 2 Star of Bethlehem 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Jacobs Ladder 2 ̆ 2 the third. Names, however, varied for the identical pattern in different localities. Applique quilts are made by cutting patterns and sewing them to a base cloth. Usually these were not made for regular household use, but rather tended to be the 2 ̆ 2 pretty 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 quilts and had flowers, trees, birds or fruit as motifs. <b>Crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> are made of odd-shaped {{bits and pieces of}} material put together in a random pattern. These reached their artistic height in the Victorian era when fabrics such as silks and velvets replaced cottons and flannels. Creative stitchery fills in certain patches and lines the edges of others. <b>Crazy</b> <b>quilts</b> were often used as decorative throws on couches. All the quilts in this exhibition belong to either museums or individuals in Nebraska and many were made by native Nebraskans. Of special note are the five quilts created by Mrs. Grace Snyder of North Platte. Almost three hundred examples were assembled for consideration and from this number fifty-five were selected solely on their merits as works of art. Their patterns, colors and materials illustrate the wide range quilting provides for individual creativity. Considerations relating to workmanship, condition and age were not used as criteria of primary importance. From this selective sampling {{it can be seen that}} 2 ̆ 2 quilt making 2 ̆ 2 is an art form of quality and importance. INTRODUCTION A quilt is a bedcover, that 2 ̆ 7 s for sure, but it is not a coverlet nor is it a counterpane. It is usually made of two thicknesses of fabric, the top or front pieced together from a variety of materials in a number of colors; the back or lining is generally of one piece in one color, the two frequently but not invariably sandwich a layer of soft padding and the whole thing is stitched through from front to back in a pattern which may conform tei the pieced design or may, on the contrary, follow its own pattern in a kind of visual counterpoint. The pattern can be further embellished with needlework of various kinds, ornamental or commemorative, and, after generations of practice and invention, quilt making has achieved an iconography of its own reflecting the domestic inspirations of uncounted, anonymous, female artists. One has only to recite the names of the traditional patterns to sense the interplay of skill and imagination which makes a quilt into a work of art. At their functional level they have kept the sleeper warm. In addition they have filled the role of social coordinator. They have been the inspiration of virtuoso needlework as well as creative invention. They have been valued elements in a dowry and part of an inheritance handed down through the generations of a family. At their most extraordinary levels of accomplishment they have been status symbols, entirely divorced from the vulgarity of use. Nowadays they are apt to hang on a wall like a painting and to even hang on the walls of an art gallery, their apotheosis achieved. All these considerations have come into play in the organization of this exhibition and it is more than a pleasure to acknowledge the hard work of the members of the Lincoln Quilters Guild and the staff of the Sheldon Gallery in bringing to public attention the achievements of this traditional anonymous art as it exists in the public and private collections of Nebraska. Fortunately, some of the makers are known to us, some of them are giving the art its contemporary form, and we are happy to give them the recognition they deserve. As a gallery-community collaboration it is a pleasure to acknowledge in particular Mrs. Velda Coffey, who first brought the idea of the exhibition to our consideration, Mrs. Mary Ghormley, Mrs. Louise Howey, Mrs. Jean Harnsberger, Mrs. Sally Campbell all of whom provided the knowledge, energy and enthusiasm which is so necessary to the realization of such projects. Our thanks as well to Mrs. Imelda DeGraw of the Denver Museum, who brought a trained curatorial eye to the selection of examples to be shown, to Jon Nelson whose installation took full advantage of the visual amenities of the Sheldon Gallery and to Mrs. Beth Gutcheon who brought to the opening workshop the essential warmth of the creative process itself. Lastly, the catalogue which provides a permanent record of the event, is in no small way the result of the fastidious professionalism of Kaz Tada and Paul Bateman...|$|R

He would remove his coat, sit upon a macadamized lounge and read, in the evening paper, of Russians and Japs {{slaughtered}} by the deadly linotype. For dinner there would be pot roast, a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather, stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label. After dinner Katy would show him the new patch in her <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt</b> that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four-in-hand. At half-past seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises.

5000|$|A unique form of {{patchwork}} quilt is the <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt.</b> Crazy quilting {{was popular}} during the Victorian era (mid-late 19th century). The <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt</b> {{is made up}} of random shapes of luxurious fabric such as velvets, silks, and brocades and buttons, lace, and other embellishments left over from the gowns they had made for themselves. The patchwork pieces are stitched together forming [...] "crazy" [...] or non-repeat, asymmetric compositions. Fancy embroidery embellishes the seam lines between the individual, pieced shapes. The <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt</b> was a status symbol, as only well-to-do women had a staff to do all the household work, and had the time to sew their <b>crazy</b> <b>quilt.</b> Traditionally, the top was left without lining or batting. Many surviving crazy quilts still have the newspaper and other foundation papers used for piecing.|$|E
60|$|To Bradley's {{left was}} a {{triangular}} niche in the wall {{of one of the}} houses and into this he dodged, thus concealing himself from the sight of the Wieroo. Beside him was a door painted a vivid yellow and constructed after the same fashion as the other Wieroo doors he had seen, being made up of countless narrow strips of wood from four to six inches in length laid on in patches of about the same width, the strips in adjacent patches never running in the same direction. The result bore some resemblance to a <b>crazy</b> patchwork <b>quilt,</b> which was heightened when, as in one of the doors he had seen, contiguous patches were painted different colors. The strips appeared to have been bound together and to the underlying framework of the door with gut or fiber and also glued, after which a thick coating of paint had been applied. One edge of the door was formed of a straight, round pole about two inches in diameter that protruded at top and bottom, the projections setting in round holes in both lintel and sill forming the axis upon which the door swung. An eccentric disk upon the inside face of the door engaged a slot in the frame when it was desired to secure the door against intruders.|$|R
