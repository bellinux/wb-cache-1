The compressor stages have been developed from GE's [...] "GE1/9 core" [...] (namely a single-turbine, nine-compressor stage design) which was designed in a compact core rotor. The small span of the compressor radius meant that the entire engine could be lighter and smaller, as the accessory units in the system (bearings, oiling systems) could be merged to the main fueling system running on aviation fuel. As design evolved HPC design improved through better airfoil design.

5000|$|A {{common form}} of {{refrigeration}} economizer is a [...] "walk-in cooler economizer" [...] or [...] "outside air refrigeration system". In such a system outside air that is cooler than the air inside a refrigerated space is brought into that space and {{the same amount of}} warmer inside air is ducted outside. The resulting cooling supplements or replaces the operation of a compressor-based refrigeration system. If the air inside a cooled space is only about 5°F warmer than the outside air that replaces it (that is, the ∆T>5°F) this cooling effect is accomplished more efficiently than the same amount of cooling resulting from a compressor based system.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Eskom {{is under}} {{increasing}} pressure to provide reliable and sustainable electricity. Demand Side Management (DSM), offers a short– to medium–term {{solution to this}} problem. During 2009, the mining sector consumed approximately 16 % of the domestic electricity supplied by Eskom. This made the mining sector {{one of the major}} targets for Eskom–initiated DSM programmes. The mining industry uses compressed air {{for a wide variety of}} applications and production purposes. This creates many opportunities to reduce electricity consumption and operating costs. Reducing the airsystem demand may however not result in significant electrical energy savings, unless the compressed–air supply is accurately managed to meet the reduced demand. Until recently, compressor control in the mining sector generally consisted of operating the compressors continuously, regardless of the actual demand for compressed air. Excessive compressed air is blown off into the atmosphere resulting in energy loss. This usually occurs when the compressors are operated manually. A computer–controlled compressor management solution, which optimises the efficiency potential of the compressed–air supply, is required to obtain significant electrical energy savings. The need for such a solution was addressed by the development of an energy management solution for mine <b>compressor</b> <b>systems.</b> This solution is referred to as Energy Management System (EMS) and is capable of starting, stopping, loading and unloading compressors. In addition to this, compressor output can be controlled to maintain a desired pressure set–point. In this study, the development and implementation of EMS on ten different mine <b>compressor</b> <b>systems</b> is presented. Automatic compressor capacity control was implemented, while an operator manually initiated compressor starting; stopping; loading and unloading, according to EMS control schedules. Centralised compressor control is one of the main advantages offered by EMS, especially for compressed–air <b>systems</b> with multiple <b>compressor</b> <b>systems</b> at different geographic locations.
