40|$|One of the {{concerns}} about environmental pollution in the asphalt paving is the volatile organic compounds, whose main pollution source is the <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalts</b> frequently applied to the priming of base layers. The use of <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalts</b> has been restricted in some countries in which the environmental legislation is stricter. That reality has awoken the search for alternative materials to substitute the conventional <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalts.</b> Therefore, we conducted this research with the main objective to investigate {{the use of the}} cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), a crop largely cultivated in the State of Ceará, Brazil, as an asphalt diluent. A mixture was produced (AC/CNSL) for priming services based on the addition of 40 % of CNSL to 60 % of AC 50 / 60 (petroleum asphalt cement). We studied the interaction among four sandy soils belonging to the A- 1 class of TRB (Transport Research Board) and three different binder types (<b>cutback</b> <b>asphalt,</b> asphalt emulsion and AC/CNSL) based on the conduction of priming tests. The soil samples were compacted with five different moisture contents and primed at a rate of 1. 0 l/m 2 {{for each of the three}} binders, producing a total of sixty test specimens. The results obtained indicated the technical viability of using the mixture of CNSL and AC as an alternative solution for bituminous priming, since those products, besides producing a homogeneou...|$|R

The emulsified asphalts are increasingly used in lieu of <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalts</b> because of environmental regulations and safety. Consequently, development of a new stabilization material, which is environmentally safe and non-flammable, is desired for replacing <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalts.</b> In this study a petroleum-resin-based (PRB) material was tested to investigate its physical and mechanical characteristics as an alternative bituminous soil stabilizer in terms of replacing the <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalts</b> because the PRB material has been proved an environmentally safe material. Based on various laboratory tests, including an unconfined compressive strength test, a soil suction test, dielectric measurements, a resilient modulus test, and an optical microscopy test, it has been verified that the PRB material affects base-layer waterproofing, but significant strength gain was not found. When mixed with mostly granular base materials, the PRB material coated soil or aggregate particles and decreased the volume of voids, which can be thought as potential water flow channels. Consequently, the PRB material is expected to reduce permeability...|$|R

This paper is a review of research and development as-sociated with application, methods, and amounts of mulch types-crop residues, chemical soil stabilizers, and feedlot wastes (manure) -required to control wind erosion. An effective wind erosion control treatment is one that can resist a 38. 0 m/s wind as measured at 15. 2 m. Any crop residue, either grown in place or hauled in and spread, can control wind erosion. Hauled-in residues must be spread and anchored to the soil surface by a packer or an anchoring agent, Le., <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalt</b> or asphalt emulsion. Depending on residue type, minimum amounts needed to control wind erosion are 4. 5 to 11 t/ha.

A number of conclusions were reached: 1. The minus # 200 sieve material for the macadam stone should be held to a minimum. For the emulsion used on this project, the minus # 200 material had less than 4 percent to achieve satisfactory coating of the macadam stone. 2. The placement of the emulsion treated macadam required no additional equipment or time than the plain macadam placement. 3. Emulsion treating the macadam stone for the shoulder base appears unnecessary. 4.

40|$|Interface bonding between hot-mix asphalt (HMA) {{overlays}} and Portland {{cement concrete}} (PCC) pavements {{is one of}} the most significant factors affecting overlay service life. This study was performed to quantify the effects of HMA type, tack coat type, tack coat application rate, and PCC surface texture on the interface bonding and overlay performance through laboratory testing, accelerated pavement testing (APT), and numerical modeling. This report presents the outcomes of the APT, as well as the numerical modeling of pavement interfaces. The results of the laboratory testing are covered in a companion report. The APT built on and validated previously completed laboratory tests where an HMA overlay was placed on top of an existing PCC pavement having various surface textures including smooth, transverse tined, longitudinal tined, and milled. In addition, zebra sections were included to evaluate the effect of non-uniform tack coat application. Asphalt emulsion SS- 1 hP and <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalt</b> RC- 70 were applied at three residual application rates, 0. 02, 0. 04, and 0. 09 gal/yd 2 (0. 09, 0. 18, and 0. 41 L/m 2); asphalt binder PG 64 - 22 was applied at 0. 04 gal/yd 2 (0. 41 L/m 2). Two HMA designs, standard binder mix and moisture sensitive binder mix, were used along with the three tack coats. Twenty-five pavement test sections were constructed and loaded with the Accelerated Transportation Loading ASsembly (ATLAS) at the centerline. The tensile strains at the bottom of HMA, to quantify potential interface slippage, were measured for selective sections, and primary HMA rutting was analyzed for all sections. The APT results validated laboratory determined optimum tack coat application rate, which provided the lowest interface strain and surface rutting in the field. Both PG 64 - 22 and SS- 1 hP showed better rutting resistance than RC- 70. Milled PCC surface provided lower rutting than transverse-tined and smooth surfaces. The field testing also showed that PCC cleaning methods play an important role in the HMA-PCC bonding. Higher rutting depth was measured in sections with uneven tack coat distribution compared to that with uniform tack coat distribution. Field testing results don???t show enough evidence to prove that using a moisture-sensitive mix will result in higher HMA surface rutting.

40|$|Interface bonding between hot-mix asphalt (HMA) {{overlays}} and Portland {{cement concrete}} (PCC) pavements {{can be one}} of the most significant factors affecting overlay service life. Various factors may affect the bonding condition at the interface, including HMA material,tack coat material, tack coat application rate, PCC surface texture, temperature, and moisture conditions. The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of these parameters on the permanent deformation of the HMA overlay. This study includes three major components to achieve the objective: laboratory testing, numerical modeling, and accelerated pavement testing. This report presents and analyzes the laboratory testing results. A direct shear test device was built and utilized to investigate the characteristics of the HMA-PCC interface and to determine the interface shear strength in the lab. Tests were run in monotonic mode at a constant loading rate of 0. 47 in/min (12 mm/min). Test specimens were prepared using field PCC cores, laboratory prepared HMA, and tack coat materials provided by the supplier. Parameters affecting the interface performance that were evaluated include HMA material type (SM- 9. 5 surface mix and IM- 19. 5 A binder mix), tack coat type (SS- 1 h and SS- 1 hP emulsions, and RC- 70 cutback), tack coat application rate, PCC surface texture, temperature, and moisture conditions. Test results showed that the asphalt emulsions SS- 1 h and SS- 1 hP produced greater interface bonding strength than the <b>cutback</b> <b>asphalt</b> RC- 70. The SM- 9. 5 surface mix was found to have better interface strength than the IM- 19. 0 A binder mix. The HMA tested produced the same trend of interface shear strength with tack coat application rate for various tack coat types. The optimum residual tack coat application rate for the SS- 1 hP emulsion using IM- 19. 0 A binder mix was 0. 04 gal/yd 2 (0. 18 L/m 2) in the lab. The direction of tining on the PCC produced no effect on interface shear strength at 20 oC. However, the milled concrete surface provided greater interface shear strength than both tined and smooth PCC surfaces for the same tack coat application rate. At the optimum tack coat application rate, the smooth PCC surface produced higher interface shear strength than the tined surface. As temperature increased, interface bonding strength decreased. Moisture conditioning significantly decreased the interface shear strength. This reduction was more pronounced when a stripping-vulnerable binder mix IM- 19. 0 B was used.

5000|$|Warm mix asphalt {{concrete}} (commonly abbreviated as WMA) {{is produced by}} adding either zeolites, waxes, asphalt emulsions, or sometimes even water to the asphalt binder prior to mixing. This allows significantly lower mixing and laying temperatures and results in lower consumption of fossil fuels, thus releasing less carbon dioxide, aerosols and vapors. Not only are working conditions improved, but the lower laying-temperature also leads to more rapid availability of the surface for use, which is important for construction sites with critical time schedules. The usage of these additives in hot mixed asphalt (above) may afford easier compaction and allow cold weather paving or longer hauls. Use of warm mix is rapidly expanding.
