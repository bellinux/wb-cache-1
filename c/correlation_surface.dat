40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper {{that it is not}} only possible, but indeed {{expedient}} and advisable, to perform a simultaneous calibration of a log-normal BGM interest-rate model to the percentage volatilities of the individual rates and to the <b>correlation</b> <b>surface.</b> One of the contributions of the paper it to show that the task can be accomplished in two separate and independent steps: {{the first part of the}} calibration (i. e. to cap volatilities) can always be accomplished exactly thanks to straightforward geometrical relationships; the fitting to the <b>correlation</b> <b>surface,</b> thanks to a simple theorem, can then be carried out in a numerically efficient way so that the calibration to the volatilities is not spoiled by the second part of the procedure. The ability to carry out the two tasks separately greatly simplifies the overall task. Actual calculations are shown for a 3 - and 4 -factor implementation of the approach, and the quality of the overall agreement between the target and model correlation surfaces is commented upon. Finally, the dangers of overparametrization, i. e. of forcing (near) exact fitting to certain portions of the correlation matrix, are analysed by looking at the cases of a trigger swap, a Bermudan swaption and a oneway floater (resettable cap). ...|$|E

The six zone convention was adopted because it yields smooth, well behaved, yet uniformly sensitive relationships between the measured pressure ratios and the parameters sought.

40|$|We {{calculated}} transport coefficients in {{thin films}} {{in which the}} particle wavelength {{is comparable to the}} thickness of the film, and the motion across the film is quantized. The perturbative calculations are analytical almost to the very end, and result in explicit transparent expressions for the transport coefficients via the <b>correlation</b> function of <b>surface</b> inhomogeneities, density of particles, and film thickness. The final results are given for Gaussian <b>correlations</b> of the <b>surface</b> inhomogeneities. The discrete nature of the spectrum leads to a non-analyticity of transport coefficients as a function of particle density and film thickness, especially for degenerate fermions. Surface inhomogeneity causes both in-band scattering and interband transitions; the role of interband transitions is determined by the <b>correlation</b> radius of <b>surface</b> inhomogeneities. The shape of the curves for the dependence of transport coefficients on the number of particles and film thickness is determined by the <b>correlation</b> of <b>surface</b> inhomogeneities and is not very sensitive to their amplitude. For short-range correlations, the interband transitions lead to a saw-like shape of the curves. With an increasing correlation radius, the interband transitions become suppressed, and the saw teeth gradually decrease, reducing, in the end, to small kinks on otherwise monotonic curves. Careful analysis of the transition from quantum to semiclassical and classical regimes allowed us to improve the accuracy of our previous classical calculations...|$|R

The investigation involved {{the analysis of}} groundwater quality and the estimations of leachate or contaminants movement which included the flow direction and velocity.

Groundwater level and water quality were monitored from August of 2003 to June of 2004 in nine wells (SI to S 9) located upstream and downstream of the study area. The measured water quality parameters were pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), sulfate, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Contaminants concentration distribution in groundwater has been mapped or contoured using geostatistical analysis. Groundwater and contaminant movement or flow characteristics were estimated using water table contours, <b>correlation</b> <b>surface</b> analysis, and numerical models. The numerical modeling was conducted by using MODFLOW in conjunction with MODPATH and MT 3 D.
