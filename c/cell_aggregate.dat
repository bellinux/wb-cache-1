40|$|AbstractThe {{differential}} adhesion hypothesis (DAH), {{advanced in}} the 1960 s, {{proposed that the}} liquid-like tissue-spreading and cell segregation phenomena of development arise from tissue surface tensions that in turn arise from differences in intercellular adhesiveness. Our earlier measurements of liquid-like <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> surface tensions have shown that, without exception, a <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> of lower surface tension tends to envelop one of higher surface tension to which it adheres. We here measure the surface tensions of L cell aggregates transfected to express N-, P- or E-cadherin in varied, measured amounts. We report that in these aggregates, in which cadherins are essentially the only cell–cell adhesion molecules, the aggregate surface tensions are a direct, linear function of cadherin expression level. Taken together with our earlier results, the conclusion follows that the liquid-like morphogenetic cell and tissue rearrangements of cell sorting, tissue spreading and segregation represent self-assembly processes guided by the diminution of adhesive-free energy as cells tend to maximize their mutual binding. This conclusion relates to the physics governing these morphogenetic phenomena and applies independently of {{issues such as the}} specificities of intercellular adhesives...|$|E
40|$|Human {{meniscus}} {{cells have}} a predominantly fibrogenic pattern of gene expression, but like chondrocytes they proliferate in monolayer culture and lose {{the expression of}} type II collagen. We have investigated the potential of human meniscus cells, which were expanded with or without fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2), to produce matrix in three-dimensional <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> cultures with a chondrogenic medium at low (5 %) and normal (20 %) oxygen tension. The presence of FGF 2 during the expansion of meniscus cells enhanced the re-expression of type II collagen 200 -fold in subsequent three-dimensional <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> cultures. This was increased further (400 -fold) by culture in 5 % oxygen. Cell aggregates of FGF 2 -expanded meniscus cells accumulated more proteoglycan (total glycosaminoglycan) over 14 days and deposited a collagen II-rich matrix. The gene expression of matrix-associated proteoglycans (biglycan and fibromodulin) was also increased by FGF 2 and hypoxia. Meniscus cells after expansion in monolayer can therefore respond to chondrogenic signals, and this is enhanced by FGF 2 during expansion and low oxygen tension during aggregate cultures...|$|E

40|$|Expanding cell populations {{extracted}} from patients or animals {{is essential to}} the process of tissue engineering and is commonly performed in laboratory incubation devices known as bioreactors. Bioreactors provide a means of controlling the chemical and mechanical environment experienced by cells to ensure growth of a functional population. However, maximising this growth requires detailed knowledge of how cell proliferation is affected by bioreactor operating conditions, such as the flow rate of culture medium into the bioreactor, and by the initial cell seeding distribution in the bioreactor. Mathematical modelling can provide insight into the effects of these factors on cell expansion by describing the chemical and physical processes that affect growth and how they interact over different length- and time-scales. In this thesis we develop models to investigate how cell expansion in bioreactors is affected by fluid flow, solute transport and cell seeding. For this purpose, a perfused single-fibre hollow fibre bioreactor is used as a model system. We start by developing a model of the growth of a homogeneous cell layer on the outer surface of the hollow fibre in response to local nutrient and waste product concentrations and fluid shear stress. We use the model to simulate the cell layer growth with different flow configurations and operating conditions for cell types with different nutrient demands and responses to fluid shear stress. We then develop a 2 D continuum model to investigate the influence of oxygen delivery, fluid shear stress and cell seeding on <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> growth along the outer surface of the fibre. Using the model we predict operating conditions and initial aggregate distributions that maximise the rate of growth to confluence over the fibre surface for different cell types. A potential limitation of these models is that they do not explicitly consider individual cell interaction, movement and growth. To address this, we conclude the thesis by assessing the suitability of a hybrid framework for modelling bioreactor <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> growth, with a discrete cell model coupled to a continuum nutrient transport model. We consider a simple set-up with a 1 D <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> growing along the base of a 2 D nutrient bath. Motivated by trying to reduce the high computational cost of simulating large numbers of cells with a cell-based model, and to assess the validity of our previous continuum description of <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> growth, we derive a continuum approximation of the discrete model in the large cell number limit and determine whether it agrees with the discrete model via numerical simulations. </p...|$|E

CEACAM 1 expression was increased on peripheral blood B cells and CEACAM 1 ^+ B cells were present in brain infiltrates of MS patients. Administration of the anti-CEACAM 1 antibody T 84. 1 was efficient in blocking aggregation of B cells derived from MS patients. Along these lines, application of the monoclonal anti-CEACAM 1 antibody mCC 1 was able to inhibit CNS B <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> formation and significantly attenuated established MS-like disease in mice {{in the absence of any}} adverse effects.

Overall, these data identify CEACAM 1 as a clinically highly interesting target in MS pathogenesis and open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the disease...|$|E

Various types of cell death such as necrosis, apoptosis and anoikis are implemented.

Several examples are presented demonstrating the potential of the modelling framework. The behaviour of a synchronised <b>cell</b> <b>aggregate</b> under ideal circumstances is simulated, clearly showing the different stages of the cell cycle and the resulting growth of the aggregate.

Two nonlinear phenomena were observed. First, the hydraulic resistance varied in direct relation to and reversibly with flow rate. Second, in constant flow-rate experiments the hydraulic resistance increased with time at a faster rate than could be attributed to cell growth. Both of these phenomena were dependent upon and could be explained by the ability of cells to move with respect to one another, under the influences of Brownian motion and of convection. Such relative motion could allow changes in net alignment of cells in the direction of flow and in the volume fraction of cells in the aggregate. This explanation is consistent with image analysis data. The observed sensitivity of hydraulic resistance to flow rate was inconsistent with a model that assumed elastic deformation of individual cells, and no evidence of cell deformation was found in electron micrographs...|$|E
