40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the deformed configuration and free vibration around the deformed configuration of <b>clamped</b> <b>buckled</b> beams by co-rotational finite element formulation. The principle of virtual work, d'Alembert principle and the consistent second order linearization of the nonlinear beam theory are used to derive the element equations in current element coordinates. The governing equations for linear vibration are obtained by the first order Taylor series expansion of the equation of motion at the static equilibrium position of the buckled beam. Numerical examples are studied to investigate the natural frequencies of <b>clamped</b> <b>buckled</b> beams with different slenderness ratios under different axial compression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} the k-th {{eigenvalue}} of the Dirichlet Laplacian is strictly less than the k-th eigenvalue of the classical Stokes operator (equivalently, of the <b>clamped</b> <b>buckling</b> plate problem) for a bounded do-main in the plane having a locally Lipschitz boundary. For a C 2 bound-ary, we show that eigenvalues of the Stokes operator with Navier slip (friction) boundary conditions interpolate continuously between eigen-values of the Dirichlet Laplacian and of the classical Stokes operator. 1...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} new index for damage {{detection}} based on nonlinear features extracted from prediction errors computed by multiple convolutions using the discrete-time Volterra series. A reference Volterra model is identified with {{data in the}} healthy condition and used for monitoring the system operating with linear or nonlinear behavior. When the system has some structural change, possibly associated with damage, the index metrics computed could give an alert to separate the linear and nonlinear contributions, besides provide a diagnostic about the structural state. To show {{the applicability of the}} method, an experimental test is performed using nonlinear vibration signals measured in a <b>clamped</b> <b>buckled</b> beam subject to different levels of force applied and with simulated damages through discontinuities inserted in the beam surface...|$|R
30|$|For larger loads local {{buckling}} occurs. This {{is due to}} the high compressive stresses {{at the bottom of the}} beam. The load deflection curve in Fig. 11 depicts the nonlinear behaviour and the final deformation of the beam for a mesh with T 2 -A 1 -P elements. The deformed configuration of the beam (no scaling) shows clearly near the <b>clamping</b> local <b>buckles</b> that in the end led to the large deflection of the beam. This is related to a bending torsion state which is triggerd by the {{local buckling}}.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the elastic buckling of triangular plates under uniform compression. Different edge conditions involving free, simple support and clamped have been considered. Moreover, the plates may have internal line supports at prescribed locations. The buckling analysis {{is performed using}} the so-called pb- 2 Rayleigh-Ritz method where the Ritz function {{has been defined as}} the product of: firstly, a two-dimensional complete polynomial function; secondly, equations of the internal line supports and; thirdly, the equations of the three edges with each equation raised to power of either 0, 1 or 2 corresponding to a free, simply supported or <b>clamped</b> edge. <b>Buckling</b> factors are obtained for right-angled and isosceles triangular plates of various height-to-base ratios. These very comprehensive results should be of considerable value and practical significance in design applications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} new method to detect damages in {{structures}} vibrating with nonlinear behavior. The approach proposed {{is based on}} Volterra series and can separate the linear and nonlinear contributions of the responses. An alert of damage is given based on level of contribution {{of the difference between}} the linear and nonlinear behavior identifed using experimental time-series. Tests are performed involving a <b>buckled</b> <b>clamped</b> beam to illustrate the steps and the advantages of the approach to detect damages using vibrating in nonlinear regime of motion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} control the sound {{radiation}} by a structure, one aims to control vibration of radiating modes of vibration using " Energy Pumping " also named " Targeted Energy Transfer ". This principle is here applied to a simplified model of a double leaf panel. This model is made of two beams coupled by a spring. One of the beams is connected to a nonlinear absorber. This nonlinear absorber is made of a 3 D-printed support on which is <b>clamped</b> a <b>buckled</b> thin small beam with a small mass fixed at its center having two equilibrium positions. The experiments showed that, once attached onto a vibrating system to be controlled, under forced excitation of the primary system, the light bistable oscillator allows a reduction of structural vibration up to 10 dB for significant amplitude and frequency range around the first two vibration modes of the system...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that the non-contact buckling response of long rectangular plates subjected to compressive or shearing loadings is {{solely dependent on}} material and section properties, as well as boundary conditions along the two unloaded side edges. In addition, the boundary conditions at the loaded ends do not influence the critical load. The above rule was also applied to the analysis and design of plates in unilateral contact with elastic or rigid mediums although without any reasonable verification. The results contained in this paper reveal that the boundary condition at the loaded edges (end conditions) significantly affects the contact buckling performance. To investigate the end condition effect, a transfer function method is employed herein to study the initial buckling behaviour of thin plates with different boundary conditions resting on tensionless elastic or rigid foundations. For very long plates with both ends <b>clamped,</b> the <b>buckling</b> mode {{can be considered as}} a series of periodically repeating buckling waves and an infinite plate model with only one buckle wave being effective to predict the buckling behaviour. However, for long plates with simply supported loaded ends, local effects dominate the buckling mode and the buckling loads can be reduced by up to 18 % compared to long plates with clamped loaded ends. Experimental tests and ABAQUS modelling also verify that the critical stresses for plates with simply supported loaded ends are lower than those for plates with clamped loaded ended plates...|$|R
40|$|Buckling of {{load-carrying}} column structures is {{an important}} failure scenario in light-weight structures as it may result {{in the collapse of}} the entire structure. If the actual loading is unknown, stability becomes uncertain. To investigate uncertainty, a critically loaded beam-column, subject to <b>buckling,</b> <b>clamped</b> at the base and pinned at the upper end is considered, since it is highly sensitive to small changes in loading. To control the uncertainty of failure due to buckling, active forces are applied with two piezoelectric stack actuators arranged in opposing directions near the beam-column’s base to prevent it from buckling. In this paper, active buckling control is investigated experimentally. A mathematical model of the beam-column is built and a model based Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is designed to stabilize the system. The controller is implemented on the experimental test setup and a statistically relevant number of experiments is conducted to prove the effect of active stabilization. It is found that the load bearing capacity of the beam-column could be increased by more than 40 % for the experimental test setup using different controller parameters for three ranges of axial loading...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} coated first mirrors under very harsh erosion conditions. Mock-up mirrors were exposed to high-flux hydrogen/argon plasma in the linear plasma facility Magnum-PSI. Rhodium (Rh) and molybdenum (Mo) coated mirrors of different coating thicknesses, with or without water cooling, exhibited different responses to this exposure. Failures of Rh films were demonstrated for 5 micron thick film, 1 micron film revealed 10 % decrease in the specular reflectivity only in the exposed area. In comparison, water cooled Mo mock-ups showed a significant diffuse reflectivity on the entire surface leading to more than 50 % specular reflectivity losses in the visible range. The losses for non-cooled Mo samples did not exceed 7 % in the whole studied wavelength range of 250 - 2500 nm. Three phenomena were proposed to explain these results. First the mechanical properties of the films as characterized by scratch and hardness measurements as well as residual stress analysis measured by x-ray diffraction. Rh films showed a high compressive stress value of 2. 5 +/- 0. 4 GPa leading to poor adhesion of the thick films deposited on stainless steel substrate due to the high amount of available energy per area stored in the unbuckled film i. e. G(0) > 30 J m(- 2). It was confirmed by ANSYS simulation that the von Mises stress for the Rh coating was {{twice as high as}} that for the Mo coating due to different mechanical properties. Moreover, the maximum stress for thick Rh film (261 MPa) was higher than the critical buckling stress calculated with a <b>buckle</b> <b>clamped</b> Euler column model demonstrating the failure mode of the film. The second phenomenon was roughening of the mirror surface which was flux and temperature dependent, i. e. at low temperatures the surface would roughen randomly without any oriented surface morphology and at higher temperatures the surface diffusion constants would dominate the process and smoothen the surface. The last phenomenon was the significant oxidation and carbidization of the Mo surface even on the non-exposed area, as detected by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, leading also to a decrease in the reflectivity in the entire measured range, which was not observed for Rh film...|$|R
