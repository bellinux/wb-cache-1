40|$|In {{the spirit}} of the {{sustainable}} buildings, and with the goal of protection of river courses, in the near future an already announced directive ordering closing down {{of a large number of}} river aggregate dredging operations will be adopted. For that reason, usage of <b>crushed</b> <b>mineral</b> aggregate in concrete mixes is increasing. Irrespective of downsides of the fined <b>crushed</b> <b>mineral</b> aggregate, such as the presence of fine particles bordering the upper permissible limit and the unfavorable shape of the grain of the course aggregate for obtaining liquid consistency required for the pumpable concrete, the demanded pumpability of concrete during transport and placement has been achieved. By adding admixtures to concrete, the required concrete properties, such as: frost resistance, simultaneous frost and salt resistance and water tightness have been achieved.

40|$|China is {{the largest}} {{non-metallic}} mineral producer {{in the world and}} one of the key consumers of four major non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products,</b> including cement, refractories, plate glass and ceramics. The non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industry’s rapid growth has brought about a large demand for energy. The present study provides an overview of China’s non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industry in terms of production, energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. In this industry, the energy efficiency is relatively low and the level of carbon dioxide emission is much higher than developed countries’ average. This study interprets the effects of some newly issued policies and analyses the influential factors in achieving energy conservation and emission reduction goals. It also discusses the prospects for saving energy and emission reduction in the industry. Retrofitting facilities and using new production technologies is imperative. Additionally, implementing market-based policies, promoting industrial transformation and effective international cooperation would help decrease carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption...|$|R
