40|$|Oncogenic KRAS {{is central}} to several cancer types {{including}} pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but has been determined to be “undruggable”. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} oncogenic KRAS is not constitutively active but relies on a feed-forward stimulatory mechanism involving inflammation. In the current study we investigated the mechanisms by which, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) affects and maintains KRAS activity. We observed that RAGE levels were elevated and there was a shift in the levels of specific isoforms upon inflammation in pancreatic cells and PDAC. Furthermore, RAGE agonists were found to increase Ras activity and downstream signaling in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Likewise, inhibition of RAGE decreased Ras signaling activity and downstream signals in multiple PDAC cell lines. In vivo, inhibition of RAGE activity using an antagonist inhibited tumor progression and increased survival rate. These data indicate that RAGE plays a central role in maintaining the activity of oncogenic KRAS and supporting tumor growth. These data raises the possibility of new approaches to inhibit the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>actions</b> of KRAS indirectly by blocking the mechanisms through which, RAGE maintains its activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Breast {{tissue is}} among the most {{sensitive}} tissues to the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>actions</b> of ionizing radiation and epidemiological studies have linked radiation exposure to breast cancer. Currently, molecular understanding of radiation carcinogenesis in mammary gland is hindered due to the scarcity of in vivo long-term follow up data. We undertook this study to delineate radiation-induced persistent alterations in gene expression in mouse mammary glands 2 -month after radiation exposure. Methods Six to eight week old female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were exposed to 2 Gy of whole body γ radiation and mammary glands were surgically removed 2 -month after radiation. RNA was isolated and microarray hybridization performed for gene expression analysis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for biological interpretation of microarray data. Real time quantitative PCR was performed on selected genes to confirm the microarray data.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that using time-resolved two-photon excitation endogenous fluorescence microscopy, the cadmium (Cd) induced cellular toxic level {{can be assessed}} by the free- to protein-bound reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (free/bound NADH) ratio in a living cell. NADH fluorescence excited at 730 nm is captured at different times following exposure to cadmium {{at a variety of}} concentrations. The temporal characteristics of NADH fluorescence from mitochondrial and nuclear compartments are analyzed, respectively. The results show that cadmium induces a significant increase of the free/bound NADH ratio in mitochondria and nucleus, caused by the inhibition effect on the electron transport chain (ETC) and the stimulating effect on the glycolysis pathway, respectively. It is found that induction of metallothionein (MT) in cells occurs after 4 h of exposure to a sublethal concentration of Cd and reaches a peak at 6 h. More importantly, the increase in MT level can effectively suppress the elevation of the free/bound NADH ratio caused by a subsequent exposure to a higher concentration of Cd, indicating that MT {{plays a key role in}} protecting cells from Cd-induced toxicity. Our findings show that the free/bound NADH ratio can potentially be used as a sensitive indicator of toxic and <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>actions</b> induced by Cd.

40|$|The {{xenoestrogen}} diethylstilbestrol (DES) {{is commonly}} believed {{to mimic the}} action of the natural estrogen 17 β-estradiol (E 2). To determine if these two estrogens exert similar actions in prostate carcinogenesis, we elevated circulating levels of estrogen in Noble (NBL) rats with E 2 /DES-filled implants, while maintaining physiological levels of testosterone (T) in the animals with T-filled implants. The two estrogens induced dysplasia in a lobe-specific manner, with E 2 targeting only the lateral prostate (LP) and DES impacting only the ventral prostate (VP). Gene expression profiling identified distinct and common E 2 -disrupted versus DES-disrupted gene networks in each lobe. More importantly, hierarchical clustering analyses revealed that T + E 2 treatment primarily affected the gene expression pattern in the LP, whereas T + DES treatment primarily affected the gene expression profile in the VP. Gene ontology analyses and pathway mapping suggest that the two hormone treatments disrupt unique and/or common cellular processes, including cell development, proliferation, motility, apoptosis, and estrogen signaling, which may be linked to dysplasia development in the rat prostate. These findings suggest that the effects of xenoestrogens and natural estrogens on the rat prostate are more divergent than previously suspected and that these differences may explain the lobe-specific <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>actions</b> of the hormones...|$|R

40|$|Cigarette smoke {{has always}} been the single most {{preventive}} cause of death in the world. In 2011, over 460, 000 died from cigarette smoke-related diseases in US. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoke on human beings are due to the presence of many carcinogens and other components (e. g. nicotine and tar). Nicotine is now accepted as one of the major components responsible for gastrointestinal disorders. Cigarette smoking, nicotine and a nicotine-derived nitrosamine, 4 -(Methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK) are considered as risk factors for gastrointestinal cancer, however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Previous studies reported that cigarette smoke and nicotine aggravated inflammation not only in the stomach, but also in the colon. The <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>actions</b> of cigarette smoke, nicotine and NNK on gastrointestinal cancers development have been widely studied. The strong association of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) with gastrointestinal diseases has been extensively studied, however, due to the unresolved cardiovascular risk, it is of great importance to develop other new anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of cancers.

The results {{were compared with}} quartz dust as the known fibrogenic dust and emery dust (Corundum) {{was used as a}} control dust. Agate increased the wet and dry weight of lungs and induced increased collagen formation and a non-reversible fibrotic reaction in the lungs. The tissue response and lung changes were of milder intensity than seen in rats exposed to quartz. In vitro, the extent of dye-uptake and haemolysis yielded results {{similar to those of the}} in vivo studies. Release of lactic dehydrogenase into the culture medium was similar in both the agate and emery exposed cells but significantly less when compared with quartz treated cells. The effects of mineral dusts on lungs have been stud-ied experimentally by exposing animals to dusts by inhalation, by the instillation of dust into the lungs intratracheally, and by investigating dust-cell inter-actions in vitro, using erythrocytes, macrophages, and tissue culture cells lines.

Based on existing carcinogenicity and genotoxicity data and chemical class information, 90 chemicals were identified as primary candidates for use in the validation study. From these 90 chemicals, 46 secondary candidates and then 40 final chemicals were selected based on a sufficiency of carcinogenic and genotoxic data, differences in chemical class or genotoxic or <b>carcinogenic</b> mode of <b>action</b> (MOA), availability, price, and ease of handling. These 40 chemicals included 19 genotoxic carcinogens, 6 genotoxic non-carcinogens, 7 non-genotoxic carcinogens and 8 non-genotoxic non-carcinogens. “Genotoxicity” was defined as positive in the Ames mutagenicity test or in one of the standard in vivo genotoxicity tests (primarily the erythrocyte micronucleus assay). These chemicals covered various chemicals classes, MOAs, and genotoxicity profiles and were considered to be suitable for the purpose of the validation study. General principles of chemical selection for validation studies are discussed. JRC. I. 5 -Systems Toxicolog...|$|R
