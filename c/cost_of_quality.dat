500|$|Despite {{the falling}} demand and price for sheep {{products}} in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages {{when compared with}} other livestock. They do not require expensive housing, such as that used in the intensive farming of chickens or pigs. They are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse. Sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate. Also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied {{to the price of}} feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn. Combined with the [...] lower <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower overhead for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the small farmer. Sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry {{is one of the few}} types of animal agriculture that has not been vertically integrated by agribusiness.|$|E

Product differentiation arises under all the scenarios considered, contrasting previous findings <b>of</b> symmetric <b>quality</b> choices under Cournot behavior. However, to relax harsher market competition, firms differentiate more under Bertrand than under Cournot. A simple welfare measure also indicates that the economy is better-off when firms compete on prices-with fixed <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality,</b> not only consumer but also producer surplus is higher under price competition.

40|$|Familiarity {{with quality}} loss {{reduction}} models and methods {{should be a}} priority for many U. S. manufacturers because <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> represent {{a significant percentage of}} total sales each year. This thesis provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>costs,</b> models, and control techniques based on selected readings. <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> include failure, appraisal, and prevention costs. Focused attention should be given to prevention expenditures as a means to reduce quality failure and appraisal losses. However, U. S. manufacturers have only recently started to recognize this strategy. One model available to assist companies in establishing quality loss goals and strategic planning is Joseph Juran's Model <b>of</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Costs.</b> This model recognizes the concepts <b>of</b> continuous <b>quality</b> improvement and zero losses as means for obtaining increased market share in today's global economy. Many quality tools and techniques are available to facilitate continuous improvement, but a very significant tool is control charts. Control charts enable companies to identify and reduce variability in production processes. Reduction of variability equates to reduction in the total <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality.</b> This, in turn, represents increased profitability for the corporation.
