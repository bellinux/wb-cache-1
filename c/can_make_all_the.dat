25|$|Death of a {{child can}} {{take the form of}} a loss in infancy such as {{miscarriage}} or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS, or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it. Intervention and comforting support <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.|$|E

Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC {{is working with the}} characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1923, when Adams was 76, the {{following}} newspaper story appeared in The Salt Lake Tribune, telling of his whereabouts:Perhaps you old fellows, too, thought Yank had passed on, {{but he turned}} up in New York {{the other day and}} is now spending his last days in a Bronx flat. There was a time when Yank Adams was known in every billiard room in America. He was as much at home in Eddie Graney's room at San Francisco as at Tom Foley's in Chicago of Maurice Daly's in New York, and he knew all the billiard players and big and little room keepers from coast to coast. When the history of billiards is written and the names of Willie Hoppe, old and young Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran are included with others of the great exponents of the indoor sport, there will be a distinct division for one man—the man who did the impossible, who could make the ivories travel the wrong way, or, {{in the language of the}} billiard realm, [...] "make 'em talk all languages."

2500|$|The {{function}} of genes {{is to provide}} the information needed to make molecules called proteins in cells. Cells are the smallest independent parts of organisms: the human body contains about 100 trillion cells, while very small organisms like bacteria are just one single cell. A cell is like a miniature and very complex factory that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> parts needed to produce a copy of itself, which happens when cells divide. There is a simple division of labor in cells—genes give instructions and proteins carry out these instructions, tasks [...] like building a new copy of a cell, or repairing damage. Each type of protein is a specialist that only does one job, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein to do this job. Similarly, if a cell needs to do something faster or slower than before, it makes more or less of the protein responsible. Genes tell cells what to do by telling them which proteins to make and in what amounts.|$|E
