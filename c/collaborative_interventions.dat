40|$|Background: Chronic pain {{is costly}} to {{individuals}} and the healthcare system, and is often undertreated. Collaborative care models show promise for improving treatment of patients with chronic pain. The objectives of this article are to report the incremental benefit and incremental health services costs of a <b>collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> for chronic pain from a veterans affairs (VA) healthcare perspective. Methods: Data on VA treatment costs incurred by participants {{were obtained from the}} VA 2 ̆ 7 s Decision Support System for all utilization except certain intervention activities which were tracked in a separate database. Outcome data were from a cluster-randomized trial of a <b>collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> for chronic pain among 401 primary care patients at a VA medical center. Intervention group participants received assessments and care management; stepped-care components were offered to patients requiring more specialized care. The main outcome measure was pain disability-free days (PDFDs), calculated from Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. Results: Participants in the intervention group experienced an average of 16 additional PDFDs over the 12 -month follow-up window as compared with usual care participants; this came at an adjusted incremental cost of 364 per PDFD for a typical participant. Important predictors of costs were baseline medical comorbidities, depression severity, and prior year 2 ̆ 7 s treatment costs. Conclusion: This <b>collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> resulted in more pain disability-free days and was more expensive than usual care.

40|$|Quality of care is {{identified}} as {{a major problem in}} the current health care system. Multidisciplinary teamwork has been proposed to address quality-of-care problems because, theoretically, a health-care team can expand knowledge and follow up patients more efficiently. However, questions about how to successfully implement team-based care in ambulatory settings and its long-term costs are still unanswered. The first objective of this dissertation is to estimate the marginal effects of process measures including number of counseling sessions about lifestyle modification and number of specified-dose antihypertensive medications provided by a physician-pharmacist <b>collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> and usual care on blood pressure reduction and direct treatment costs by comparing the results from as-treated and instrumental variable methods. The second objective is to estimate the long-term cost changes attributable to the physician-pharmacist <b>collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> by considering costs related to coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. To accomplish both objectives, data from two prospective, clustered randomized controlled clinical trials implementing a physician-pharmacist <b>collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> in the Midwest were used. In the first study, multiple linear regression models included blood pressure reduction and costs as outcome variables, and the two process measures and other control variables as explanatory variables. As-treated methods revealed insignificant associations between the two process measures and blood pressure reduction outcomes. On the other hand, both process measures were significantly associated with the costs. By using instrumental variable methods, utilizing two instruments of randomization and the trial indicator, the models were unidentified and showed no significant associations between the process measures and all of the outcomes. However, the post-hoc analysis of the instrumental variable models, evaluating one process measure at a time without controlling for the other process measure, showed significant associations between the process measures and all of the outcomes. The estimates from instrumental variable methods were larger than the estimates from the as-treated methods. The second study used a Markov model cohort simulation in a 10 -year timeframe, transition probabilities estimated by several risk estimation systems and published statistics, and published event costs. The reference case employed a sample of patients aged 30 to 74 years from the trials and assumed that blood pressure after the intervention was constant. The total costs of the intervention for hypertension care and the costs related to the vascular diseases in the intervention group were shown to be lower than the usual care group at 6. 5 years. However, cost-savings by the intervention were sensitive to patient risk profiles and sustainability of blood pressure after the intervention. To conclude, from the first study, combining multiple studies and using instrumental variable methods may be useful for evaluating marginal effects of the care process but {{further research is needed to}} address under-identification problems. The results of the second study suggested that it was likely that the physician-pharmacist <b>collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> to treat hypertension was appropriate for high-risk patients...|$|R

METHODS: We recruited 11 rheumatology sites from across the US and randomized them into the following two groups: one received the Learning <b>Collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> in Phase 1 (month 1 - 9) and the second formed a wait-list control group to receive the intervention in Phase 2 (months 10 - 18). The Learning <b>Collaborative</b> <b>intervention</b> was designed using the Model for Improvement, consisting of a Change Package with corresponding principles and action phases. Phase 1 intervention practices had nine learning sessions, collaborated using a web-based tool, and shared results of plan-do-study-act cycles and monthly improvement metrics collected at each practice. The wait-list control group sites had no intervention during Phase 1. The primary trial outcome is the implementation of TTT as measured by chart review, comparing the differences from baseline to end of Phase 1, between intervention and control sites. RESULTS: All intervention sites remained engaged in the Learning Collaborative throughout Phase 1, with a total of 38 providers participating. The primary trial outcome measures are currently being collected by the study team through medical record review.

40|$|Background <b>Collaborative</b> care <b>interventions</b> {{to treat}} {{depression}} {{have begun to}} be tested in settings outside of primary care. However, few studies have expanded the collaborative care model to other settings and targeted comorbid physical symptoms of depression. Purpose The aims of this report were to: (1) describe the design and methods of a trial testing the efficacy of a stepped <b>collaborative</b> care <b>intervention</b> designed to manage cancer-related symptoms and improve overall {{quality of life in}} patients diagnosed with hepatobiliary carcinoma; and (2) share the lessons learned during the design, implementation, and evaluation of the trial. Methods The trial was a phase III randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a stepped <b>collaborative</b> care <b>intervention</b> to reduce depression, pain, and fatigue in patients diagnosed with advanced cancer. The intervention was compared to an enhanced usual care arm. The primary outcomes included the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale, Brief Pain Inventory, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) -Fatigue, and the FACT-Hepatobiliary. Sociodemographic and disease-specific characteristics were recorded from the medical record; Natural Killer cells and cytokines that are associated with these symptoms and with di sease progression were assayed from serum. ResultsandDiscussion The issues addressed include: (1) development of collaborative care in the context of oncology (e. g., timing of the intervention, tailoring of the intervention, ethical issues regarding randomization of patients, and changes in medical treatment {{over the course of the}} study); (2) use of a website by chronically ill populations (e. g., design and access to the website, development of the website and intervention, ethical issues associated with website development, website usage, and unanticipated costs associated with website development); (3) evaluation of the efficacy of intervention (e. g., patient preferences, proxy raters, changes in medical treatment, and inclusion of biomarkers as endpoints); and (4) analyses and interpretation of the intervention (e. g., confounding factors, dose and active ingredients, and risks and benefits of <b>collaborative</b> care <b>interventions</b> in chronically ill patients). Limitations The limitations to the study, although not fully realized at this time as the trial is ongoing, include: (1) heterogeneity of the diagnoses and treatments of participants; and (2) inclusion of caregivers as proxy raters but not as participants in the <b>intervention.</b> Conclusions <b>Collaborative</b> care <b>interventions</b> to manage multiple symptoms in a tertiary cancer center are feasible.

All the studies were original articles selected manually and used randomized control trials generating results of self-management education in people with type 2 diabetes referring to diabetic control. Relevant data were divided and tabulated into factors of population characteristics, interventions and outcomes. Interventions were classified into three sections as <b>collaborative</b> information <b>intervention,</b> lifestyle intervention, and skills teaching intervention based on the patterns of education. Outcomes were categorized into glycemic control, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and nephropathy risk factors. Results: A total of 24 studies were identified of initial 41 articles for this review. Effects of self-management education on glycemic control were demonstrated to be positive both in short-term (10 months) follow-up, but more positive effects in short-term follow-up. The same effectiveness happens to CVD risk factors, including lipids, weight and blood pressure. On the other hand, with short-term follow-up, teaching skills intervention of self-management education {{is more effective than}} <b>collaborative</b> information <b>intervention</b> and lifestyle intervention on reducing glycemic control and CVD risk factors. Also with long-term follow-up, teaching skills intervention of self-management education had more effectiveness than <b>collaborative</b> information <b>intervention</b> and lifestyle intervention on reducing glycemic control.

Increases in parenting efficacy appeared to be the mechanism through which INSIGHTS reduced child disruptive behavior. C © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Collaborative</b> care <b>interventions</b> for {{psychiatric}} disorders combine several components {{integrated into the}} medical setting: (1) systematic psychiatric assessment, (2) use of a non physician care manager to perform longitudinal symptom monitoring, treatment interventions, and care coordination, and (3) specialist-provided stepped-care recommendations. <b>Collaborative</b> care <b>interventions</b> have now been evaluated in {{a wide spectrum of}} care settings and offer great promise as a way of increasing quality of patient care, improving health of populations, and reducing health care costs. Methods: A systematic search of PubMedl MEDLINE databases was performed for publications between January 1970 and May 2013 to identify articles describing collaborative care and related interventions. Identified articles were then evaluated independently by multiple reviewers for quality and importance; additional articles were identified by searching reference lists and through recommendations of senior content-matter experts. The articles considered to be both of high quality and most important were then placed into categories and annotated reviews performed. Results: Over 600 articles were identified of which 67 were selectedfor annotated review. The results reported in these articles indicate that <b>collaborative</b> care <b>interventions</b> for {{psychiatric disorders}} have been consistently successful in improving key outcomes in both research and clinical intervention studies; cost analyses also suggest that this model is cost effective. Conclusions: Collaborative care models for psychiatric disorders are likely to serve an increasingly large role in health care given their effect on patient and population outcomes and their focus on integration of care...|$|R
40|$|An {{earlier study}} of a <b>collaborative</b> chat <b>intervention</b> in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) {{identified}} negative effects on attrition stemming from a requirement for students to be matched with exactly one partner prior to beginning the activity. That study raised questions about how to orchestrate a <b>collaborative</b> chat <b>intervention</b> in a MOOC context {{in order to provide}} the benefit of synchronous social engagement without the coordination difficulties. In this paper we present a careful analysis of an intervention designed to overcome coordination difficulties by welcoming students into the chat on a rolling basis as they arrive rather than requiring them to be matched with a partner before beginning. The results suggest the most positive impact when experiencing a chat with exactly one partner rather than more or less. A qualitative analysis of the chat data reveals differential experiences between these configurations that suggests a potential explanation for the effect and raises questions for future research.
