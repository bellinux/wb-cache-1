The canyon contains endangered and threatened species such as the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtle</b> and the American crocodile, which {{can be seen on}} the riverbanks. The walls of the canyon contain numerous small caves, rock formations and other notable features. The best known of the area’s caves is the Cueva de Colores ("Cave of Colors"). This cave gets its name from the filtration of magnesium, potassium and other minerals which form colors on the walls, especially shades of pink. It contains an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe inside usually surrounded by fresh flowers and burning candles left by visitors. The Cueva de Silencio ("Cave of Silence") is so named {{because of a lack of}} echo or any other kind of resonance in its interior. In another small cave, there is a stalactite called the Caballito de Mar or [...] "Seahorse" [...] after its shape. Of the various seasonal waterfalls, the best known is the Árbol de Navidad ("Christmas Tree"). The “branches” of the Árbol are made by deposits from the waterfall which have been covered in moss. During the rainy season, when the waterfall is active, the water and the light change the colors of the “branches” and make the formation stand out.

40|$|AbstractThe {{continental}} turtle fauna of Mexico {{is composed}} of 7 families, 13 genera, and 45 species; when subspecies are included, a total of 61 distinct taxa are recognized. We searched for the imperiled level or protection status of each taxon according to the IUCN Red List, CITES appendices, the 25 most endangered freshwater turtles and tortoises, and the protection lists issued by the Mexican Government. We explored the overlap of conservation status between Mexican and international agencies by comparing listing status. Among the 61 taxa, 37 were in the IUCN Red List, 16 taxa were listed on CITES appendices, 39 taxa were in NOM- 059 (Mexican Government list), 4 taxa were in Conabio's list (Mexican Government list), and only 1 species {{was included in the}} world's 25 most endangered freshwater turtles and tortoises.

40|$|The Yellow-spotted <b>River</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Podocnemis unifilis Troschel, 1848) and the South <b>American</b> <b>River</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Podocnemis expansa (Schweigger, 1812)) are two turtles {{species that}} are widely {{distributed}} and have ecological, economic, and cultural importance in the Amazon basin. Although sympatric regarding most of their distribution, few studies have addressed the coexistence of these two species. To examine this, we analyzed the trophic level and the primary carbon source from the diets of both species in Baixo Araguaia, Tocantins, Brazil, using stable isotope analyses of carbon (delta C- 13) and nitrogen (delta N- 15). We also verified possible intraspecific variations (related to sex and body mass) in the trophic levels and primary carbon sources of their diets. Podocnemis unifilis had higher values of delta N- 15 than P. expansa, averaging 7. 59 parts per thousand and 5. 06 parts per thousand, respectively, a difference which may indicate a possible trophic change owing to exploiting different food resources. No {{differences were found between}} the two species in relation to delta C- 13 (mean values of - 26. 2 parts per thousand and - 26. 1 parts per thousand, respectively). The similarity between delta C- 13 values suggests that the sources of their basal feeding are the same, consisting mainly of C- 3 plants.

40|$|The {{critically}} endangered <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>River</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Dermatemys mawii) is {{the only}} remaining member of the Dermatemydidae family, yet {{little is known about}} its population structuring. In a previous study of mitochondrial (mt) DNA in the species, three main lineages were described. One lineage (Central) was dominant across most of the range, while two other lineages were restricted to Papaloapan (PAP; isolated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Sierra de Santa Marta) or the south-eastern part of the range (1 D). Here we provide data from seven polymorphic microsatellite loci and the R 35 intron to re-evaluate these findings using DNA from the nuclear genome. Based on a slightly expanded data set of a total of 253 samples from the same localities, we find that mtDNA and nuclear DNA markers yield a highly congruent picture of the evolutionary history and population structuring of D. mawii. While resolution provided by the R 35 intron (sequenced for a subset of the samples) was very limited, the microsatellite data revealed pronounced population structuring. Within the Grijalva-Usumacinta drainage basin, however, many populations separated by more than 300 kilometers showed signals of high gene flow.

40|$|The clade Kinosternoidea {{consists}} of the extant mud and musk turtles (Kinosternidae) and the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtle</b> Dermatemys mawii. Baptemys, an Eocene turtle taxon from North America, has historically been allied to D. mawii within Dermatemydidae, but this relationship has never been rigorously tested in a global analysis. Molecular data and multiple morphological characters support monophyly of Kinosternoidea, but kinosternids and D. mawii are vastly different in their morphology, and the relationships of Dermatemys are controversial. Dermatemys mawii is highly adapted to consuming aquatic vegetation and is thus much more similar in gestalt to some emydids than to kinosternids. Dermatemys mawii was historically placed among tortoises (Testudinoidea) {{by a number of}} traits pertaining to their fully ossified shell {{and the development of a}} secondary palate. Different placements of D. mawii indicate radically different historical biogeographic scenarios and sequences of character evolution. Few relevant morphological characters have been used in global analyses of turtle relationships, and several fossil taxa are known that could prove critical to resolving this debate. Baptemys wyomingensis is the best-sampled fossil dermatemydid. A detailed description of B. wyomingensis, along with a consideration of its phylogenetic relationships, indicates additional morphological support for a close relationship with Dermatemys and a placement for D. mawii and Baptemys within Kinosternoidea, as well as an unexpected close relationship with Hoplochelys and Agomphus to the exclusion of the Kinosternids. A review of the alpha taxonomy of Baptemys reveals that the relationships between the species, other than B. wyomingensis and B. garmanii remain unclear due to a lack of published descriptions and it appears likely that Baptemys may be paraphyletic in regard to D. mawii...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a phylogeographic {{analysis of the}} strictly aquatic and critically endangered <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>river</b> <b>turtle,</b> Dermatemys mawii, {{as part of a}} conservation management program for the species. We sampled 238 individuals from 15 different localities throughout the species range. Using sequence fragments from the mtDNA Cyt b and ND 4 genes, we identified 16 different haplotypes. Overall, our results reveal a signal of phylogeographic structure throughout the range, which appears to have been secondarily blurred by extensive gene flow. Notably, this also applies to genetic structuring across three major hydrological basins that pose biogeographic breaks in other aquatic taxa. Divergence times of mtDNA haplotypes in D. mawii suggest that the main lineages split in the Pliocene–Pleistocene (3. 73 – 0. 227 MA) and demographic tests indicate that the species has undergone drastic demographic size fluctuations since this time period. One ancient haplotype (1 D) was found to exhibit sequence divergence of up to 2 % from other haplogroups. Divergence of this magnitude is indicative of species level differentiation in other turtle genera. Haplotype 1 D was found in only two localities, Sarstun and Salinas, but specimens with other haplotypes were also found in those localities. It is not known whether the individuals with the 1 D haplotype interbreed with non- 1 D individuals. Our results suggest that human activity, such as harvesting and long distance transport of animals, may have influenced the current patterns of genetic diversity. For more than 2000 years, D. mawii has been consumed by people from Middle American cultures, and the archeological record contains strong evidence that the Mayans transported animals between villages and far away from their natural distribution range. Therefore, the large-scale pattern of haplotype sharing even across hydrological barriers, the observed low haplotype diversity in some populations and the contemporary absence of a pronounced phylogeographic pattern is likely due to a combination of population expansions, gene flow, extensive human-mediated-movements and recent bottlenecks resulting from over-harvesting...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent {{molecular}} hypotheses {{suggest that}} some traditional suprageneric taxa of Characiformes require revision, as they may not constitute monophyletic groups. This {{is the case for}} the Bryconidae. Various studies have proposed that this family (considered a subfamily by some authors) may be composed of different genera. However, until now, no phylogenetic study of all putative genera has been conducted. Results: In the present study, we analyzed 27 species (46 specimens) of all currently recognized genera of the Bryconidae (ingroup) and 208 species representing all other families and most genera of the Characiformes (outgroup). Five genes were sequenced: 16 SrRNA, Cytochrome b, recombination activating gene 1 and 2 and myosin heavy chain 6 cardiac muscle. The final matrix contained 4699 bp and was analyzed by maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. The results show that the Bryconidae, composed of Brycon, Chilobrycon, Henochilus and Salminus, is monophyletic and is the sister group of Gasteropelecidae + Triportheidae. However, the genus Brycon is polyphyletic. Fossil studies suggest that the family originated approximately 47 million years ago (Ma) and that one of the two main lineages persisted only in trans-Andean <b>rivers,</b> including <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>rivers,</b> suggesting a much older origin of Mesoamerican ichthyofauna than previously accepted. Conclusion: Bryconidae is composed by five main clades, including the genera Brycon, Chilobrycon, Henochilus and Salminus, but a taxonomic review of these groups is needed. Our results point to a possible ancient invasion of Central America, dating about 20. 3 +/- 5. 0 Ma (late Oligocene - early Miocene), to explain the occurrence of Brycon in Central America...|$|R

Presence and spatio-temporal habitat characterization of Dermatemys mawii (Testudines: Dermatemydidae) in the Grijalva-Usumacinta watershed, Tabasco, Mexico. The <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>River</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Dermatemys mawii) is {{an endangered species}} that has been poorly studied. There are no reports on their population status, habitat condition, and the species distribution area is still unknown. This study analyzes the seasonal and spatial variations of their habitat and the presence/absence of D. mawii in three rivers within the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (Tabasco, Mexico). For habitat characterization, natural segmentation of rivers was used and three sites per segment were identified, 9 in each rivers (Grijalva and Usumacinta) and 6 in Tabasquillo. Additionally, the evaluation of 11 environmental variables such as water hydrological, physicochemical characteristics and riparian and hydrophytic vegetation were carried out during two different seasons (dry and rainy). The presence/absence of species was assessed with eight fike nets that were set per segment, with a capture effort of 384 hours per trap. The capture per unit effort (CPUE) {{was used as an}} indicator of relative abundance. The results indicated spatio-temporal variations in habitat characteristics and the presence of environmental gradients. The principal components analysis (PCA) applied allowed us to determine that the first three components explained 67. 8 % of the environmental variability. The species presence was confirmed in all rivers, however significant differences exists in their relative abundance: the highest was registered in the Tabasquillo River where the species was present in both seasons and in all segments. Of the 11 environmental variables analyzed, the gradient, shelter and depth were the most indicative of species presence. The obtained results evidenced the importance of riparian vegetation as habitat for Dermatemys.

40|$|Aim Documentation of {{the ongoing}} effect of rain forest refuges at the last glacial maximum (LGM) on {{patterns}} of tropical freshwater fish diversity. Location Tropical South and Central America, and West Africa. Methods LGM rain forest regions and species richness by drainage were compiled from published data. GIS mapping was applied to compile drainage area and contemporary primary productivity. We used multiple regression analyses, applied separately for Tropical South America, Central America and West Africa, to assess differences in species richness between drainages that were connected and disconnected to rain forest refuge zones during the LGM. Spatial autocorrelation of the residuals was tested using Moran's I statistic. We added an intercontinental comparison to our analyses {{to see if a}} historical signal would persist even when a regional historical effect (climate at the LGM) had already been accounted for. Results Both area and history (contact with LGM rain forest refuge) explained the greatest proportions of variance in the geographical pattern of riverine species richness. In the three examined regions, we found highest richness in drainages that were connected to the rain forest refuges. No significant residual spatial autocorrelation was detected after considering area, primary productivity and LGM rain forest refuges. These results show that past climatic events still affect West African and Latin American regional and continental freshwater fish richness. At the continental scale, we found South <b>American</b> <b>rivers</b> more species-rich than expected {{on the basis of their}} area, productivity and connectedness to rain forest refuge. Conversely, <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>rivers</b> were less species-diverse than expected by the grouped model. African rivers were intermediate. Therefore, a historical signal persists even when a regional historical effect (climate at the LGM) had already been accounted for. Main conclusions It has been hypothesized that past climatic events have limited impact on species richness because species have tracked environmental changes through range shifts. However, when considering organisms with physically constrained dispersal (such as freshwater fish), past events leave a perceptible imprint on present species diversity. Furthermore, we considered regions that have comparable contemporary climatic and environmental characteristics, explaining the absence of a productivity effect. From the LGM to the present day (a time scale of 18, 000 years), extinction processes should have played a predominant role in shaping the current diversity pattern. By contrast, the continental effects could reflect historical contingencies explained by differences in speciation and extinction rates between continents at higher time scales (millions of years) ...|$|R
