40|$|We {{consider}} {{the expulsion of}} proton fluxoids along neutron vortices from the superfluid/superconductive core of neutron star with weak (B< 10 ^ 10 G) magnetic field. The velocity of fluxoids is calculated from the balance of buoyancy, drag and crustal forces. We show, that the proton fluxoids can leave the superfluid <b>core</b> <b>sliding</b> along the neutron vortices on a timescale of about 10 ^ 7 years. An alternative possibility is that fluxoids are aligned with the vortices on the same timescale.

500|$|Other die {{components}} include <b>cores</b> and <b>slides.</b> <b>Cores</b> are {{components that}} usually produce holes or opening, {{but they can}} be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable <b>cores</b> and <b>slides</b> greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called pick-outs, are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes. These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part {{at the end of the}} cycle. The core then must be removed by hand. Loose cores are the most expensive type of core, because of the extra labor and increased cycle time. Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines. These vents are usually wide and thin (approximately [...] ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap. No risers are used because the high pressure ensures a continuous feed of metal from the gate.|$|R

The initial die configuration used a <b>sliding</b> <b>core</b> assembly with stationary pins to core a through hole in a thick section of the front cam caps.

Replacement of the <b>sliding</b> <b>core</b> assembly with a squeeze pin unit substantially reduced shrinkage porosity in the critical region, with consequent reductions in the scrap rate. The squeeze pins are actuated 1. 5 s after the piston reaches the high shot changeover position, but can be successfully engaged between I and 3. 5 seconds after high shot changeover. Density measurements and visual inspection confirmed the substantial improvement in porosity levels in the critical region of the castings. <br /...|$|R

From analysis of molecular dynamics simulations, 19 core hydrophobic residues appear to facilitate the conformational changes that occur in HIV- 1 protease. The hydrophobic <b>core</b> residues <b>slide</b> by each other, exchanging one hydrophobic van der Waal contact for another, with little energy penalty, while maintaining many structurally important hydrogen bonds. Such hydrophobic sliding may represent a general mechanism by which proteins undergo conformational changes.

40|$|Part 1 of {{this thesis}} reviews the known {{dynamical}} processes of DNA, histories and nucleosomes. Part 2 presents research on salt-induced nucleosome dissociation. In elevated [NaCl], dissociation occurs within minutes to hours, to generate free DNA. Dissociation is reversible (or nearly so), and {{is enhanced by}} nucleosome dilution; thus {{it appears to be}} an equilibrium phenomenon. Upon exposure of nucleosome core particles to 0. 35 - 0. 75 M NaC 1, a second reversible transition is observed, on a much faster time-scale (thesis, part 3). This fast transition results in a 15 % decrease in s g 0. It also involves an increase in circular dichroism around 280 nm, amounting to 35 - 40 % of the difference in CD between free DNA and native core particles. The fast transition is interpreted in terms of a two-state model: the core particle is envisioned to move from the native state into a new state, where some portion of its DNA is now more like the solution "B " form. The CD increase (assayed in 0. 65 M Nadi) is temperature independent over 5 - 35 C. This is interpreted (via the two-state model) to mean that the fast transition is entropy-driven. From a consideration of both these data and published studies, we suggest that the fast transition involves the release of two 25 - 30 by DNA "termini " from the histone core. Under this model, we calculate that 5 - 7 DNA/histone bonds are broken in the release of each terminus. From oligopeptide/DNA binding data, we calculate these bonds to be at least as strong as oligoarginine/DNA bonds; thus they probably have substantial non-electrostatic character.

The mean square superstructure acceleration and bearing displacement of the system are plotted under different system parameters and compared with the corresponding response of rigid sup erstructure condition to study the influence of superstructure flexibility. The comparison of response is made under various isolation system parameters (i. e. isolation period, damping, yield strength of elastomeric bearings and friction coefficient of sliding systems). It is observed that the bearing displacement can accurately obtained by modelling the superstructure as a rigid body in a base-isolated structure.

Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock.

30|$|A {{variety of}} {{isolation}} devices including elastomeric bearings (with and without lead <b>core),</b> frictional, <b>sliding</b> and roller bearings have been developed, tested and implemented for aseismic design of structures {{during the last}} 30 ¬†years (Kelly 1986; Skinner et al. 1993; Naeim and Kelly 1999). In 1968, un-reinforced rubber blocks were first implemented into a reinforced concrete building in Macedonia but they bulged sideways under the weight the structure and led to building bounce and rocking (Staudacher 1982; Jurukovski and Rakicevic 1995). The subsequent development of laminated rubber bearings improved the vertical bearing capacity but without adding a source of damping. To combine flexibility and damping in a single unit, the lead rubber bearing (LRB) was invented in the 1970 ‚Äôs (Robinson and Tucker 1977, 1983; Tyler and Robinson 1984). In the early 1980 ‚Äôs, high damping rubber (HDR) bearings came into existence (Derham et al. 1985). However, both LRB and HDR isolation systems still lack a self-braking mechanism, under severe earthquakes, besides the aptitude for low-mass structures. In addition, they undergo bearing area reduction as displaced laterally, which imposes restrictions on the height/width and deformation/height ratios. In 1986, Al-Hussaini et al. (1994) introduced an isolation system, namely the friction pendulum system (FPS), which uses friction to dissipate the transmitted energy to the structure and concave sliding surfaces to provide a gravity-based recentering mechanism. Due to the concavity of sliding surfaces, a building supported on FPS isolators exhibits vertical fluctuation and vibrates as a simple pendulum having a constant vibration independent of the structural mass, which represents a severe practical difficulty {{that may lead to}} resonance failure as the FPS‚Äôs period approaches the dominant period of the hitting earthquake (Murnal and Sinha 2004). Another drawback is the increase of sliding friction coefficient as sliding velocity increases as a characteristic of the interface liner of Teflon. Such increase of friction coefficient reduces the degree of structure‚Äìground decoupling and results in more force transfer.|$|R

Besides mud extrusion, numerous cold seeps are created by landslides induced by seamount subduction or fluid migration along major faults. Most of the dissolved methane migrating through the sediments of cold seeps is oxidized within the benthic microbial methane filter by anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Measurements of AOM and sulfate reduction as well as numerical modeling of porewater profiles revealed a highly active and efficient benthic methane filter at the Quepos Slide site, a landslide on the continental slope between the Nicoya and Osa Peninsula.

40|$|ASTM (1995) in {{standard}} D 4823 describes many {{other types of}} core samplers. The most common sampler is the open tube sampler with a core catcher. This sampler is commonly used in shallow waters where it is manually pushed into the sediment. When the desired penetration depth is reached, the sampler is carefully withdrawn. A leaf core catcher is commonly used to help retain the sample in the corer (Figure 5. 73). The leaves separate and fold against the inside walls of the sampler when the corer penetrates the sediment. The leaves fold closed when the sampler is withdrawn, holding the sample in the corer. Plastic liners are also commonly used inside the sampler, simplifying core removal from the corer. The liners usually have plastic end caps that can {{be placed on the}} liner ends, holding the cores inside until analyses. These conventional core samplers are most effective with clayey sediments.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tissue MicroArrays (TMAs) {{represent}} a potential high-throughput {{platform for the}} analysis and discovery of tissue biomarkers. As TMA slides are produced manually and subject to processing and sectioning artefacts, the layout of TMA cores on the final slide and subsequent digital scan (TMA digital slide) is often disturbed {{making it difficult to}} associate cores with their original position in the planned TMA map. Additionally, the individual cores can be greatly altered and contain numerous irregularities such as missing cores, grid rotation and stretching. These factors demand the development of a robust method for de-arraying TMAs which identifies each TMA core, and assigns them to their appropriate coordinates on the constructed TMA slide. METHODOLOGY: This study presents a robust TMA de-arraying method consisting of three functional phases: TMA core segmentation, gridding and mapping. The segmentation of TMA cores uses a set of morphological operations to identify each TMA core. Gridding then utilises a Delaunay Triangulation based method to find the row and column indices of each TMA core. Finally, mapping correlates each TMA core from a high resolution TMA whole slide image with its name within a TMAMap. CONCLUSION: This study describes a genuine robust TMA de-arraying algorithm for the rapid identification of TMA <b>cores</b> from digital <b>slides.</b> The result of this de-arraying algorithm allows the easy partition of each TMA core for further processing.

The And√∏ya Slide covers {{an area of}} about 9700 km 2 of which the slide scar area comprise ca. 3600 km 2. The slide has a total run-out distance of about 190 km. Slope failure is inferred to have occurred during the Holocene because the slide scar has prominent relief on the present sea floor. The area of sediment removal is characterised by an irregular relief were relatively consolidated sediments are exposed at the sea floor. Little or no unconsolidated sediments overlies the slide deposits. Earthquake activity is inferred to have triggered the slide. A Holocene age of the And√∏ya Slide implies that three giant slides (the Storegga, Tr√¶nadjupet and And√∏ya Slides) have occurred along the continental slope of Norway during the last 10, 000 years. A large canyon, the And√∏ya Canyon, is located immediately south of the And√∏ya Slide. On the upper slope, the canyon has been incised about 1000 m in the bedrock, and the maximum width {{at the bottom and}} between the canyon shoulders is 2 and 12 km, respectively. The And√∏ya Canyon represents {{the upper part of the}} Lofoten Basin Channel. Based on analogy with other deep-sea canyon/channel systems, the And√∏ya Canyon/Lofoten Basin Channel is possibly of pre-Quaternary age. Holocene sediments recovered from within the canyon, and draping the flanking channel deposits, indicate that the And√∏ya Canyon is not presently active and has probably not been active during the Holocene. During the Holocene, the canyon acted as a trap for sediments settling from the winnowing Norwegian Current...|$|R

Multibeam bathymetry mapping of the Middle America Trench reveals numerous continental slope failures of different dimensions and origin. For example, large rotational slumps have been interpreted {{to be caused}} by slope collapse in the wake of subducting seamounts. In contrast, the mechanisms generating translational slides have not yet been described. Lithology, shear strength measurements, density, and pore water alkalinity from a sediment <b>core</b> across a <b>slide</b> plane indicate that a few centimeters thick intercalated volcanic tephra layer marks the detachment surface. The ash layer can be correlated to the San Antonio tephra, emplaced by the 6000 year old caldera-forming eruption from Masaya-Caldera, Nicaragua. The distal deposits of this eruption are widespread along the continental slope and ocean plate offshore Nicaragua. Grain size measurements permit us to estimate the reconstruction of the original ash layer thickness at the investigated slide. Direct shear test experiments on Middle American ashes show a high volume reduction during shearing. This indicates that marine tephra layers have the highest hydraulic conductivity of the different types of slope sediment, enabling significant volume reduction to take place under undrained conditions. This makes ash layers mechanically distinct within slope sediment sequences. Here we propose a mechanism by which ash layers may become weak planes that promote translational sliding. The mechanism implies that ground shaking by large earthquakes induces rearrangement of ash shards causing their compaction (volume reduction) and produces a rapid accumulation of water in {{the upper part of the}} layer that is capped by impermeable clay. The water-rich veneer abruptly reduces shear strength, creating a detachment plane for translational sliding. Tephra layers might act as slide detachment planes at convergent margins of subducting zones, at submarine slopes of volcanic islands, and at submerged volcano slopes in lakes...|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} die casting {{is one of the}} most cost-effective methods for mass producing aluminium components. Thus, for example, die casting is used to currently manufacture a large volume of all aluminium engines. However, besides the undisputed advantages, the restricted freedom in mould design largely limits the applications of high {{pressure die}} casting. Although in the past it was possible to significantly improve this situation by means of <b>sliding</b> <b>core</b> technologies, it is however still not possible to represent complex internal geometries. This can only be achieved by using lost cores. Conventional core systems made of sand, i. e. for low {{pressure die casting}}, only partially endure the high mechanical loading. However, continuously increasing component and material requirements necessitate constructions having internal contours. An example are crankcases which can currently be high pressure die cast using mass production technology only in an open-deck construction. By using an operational coring system, the motors could also be cast as a single piece in a closed-deck. In relation to this, there are commercial endeavours to implement suitable sand and salt coring systems. Another application which is considered in this work is a combination of lost cores for die casting partially liquid metal suspensions. Rheocast processes are a particularly cost-effective alternative to conventional high pressure die casting and provide, moreover, advantages intrinsic to the process such as, for example, lower shrinkage, pressure tightness, near-net shapes as well as the possibility of carrying out heat treatments or welding thick-walled components. A decisive advantage for implementing lost cores is a significantly slower and, in the ideal case, a non-turbulent flow. By using the cooling channel process, which was developed at the Foundry Institute of RWTH Aachen, different coring systems based on sand, salt, zinc and plastic are well proven in tests with respect to their suitability for rheocasting. Furthermore, the parameters influencing the material and the process are determined and thoroughly investigated for the cooling channel process. Here, the aim is both to provide a reproducible input material, which is as homogeneous as possible, for subsequently high pressure die casting using lost cores as well as to assess the suitability of the cores and the cooling channel process for possible industrial applications. Moreover, the knowledge gained about both rheocasting as well as highly reactive alloys, which can be employed due to the lower processing temperatures, is firstly verified by means of the alloy AlLi 2. 1 Mg 5. 5. Secondly, the influences of processing the partial-liquid in the Rheo-Container-Process on the morphology and phase formation are analysed in detail...|$|R
40|$|In the {{semi-arid}} {{environment of}} the Eastern Mediterranean, water can be a limiting resource and its availability is influenced by different climate factors. Knowledge of late Holocene water balance is limited for this region. Lake systems and organisms respond to environmental variability {{and can be used}} as a proxy for palaeoclimate. The aims of this research project were to reconstruct late Holocene palaeoclimate using diatom frustules preserved within crater lake sediments in central Turkey. Two lakes (Nar G√∂l√º and Kraterg√∂l), located in the same climate region, were selected for this purpose. Modem lake samples and sediment cores collected between 1999 - 2006 were subsampled at high resolution for diatom analysis, Nar G 610 provided an uninterrupted annually-laminated late Holocene sequence covering the last 1720 years. The varied lake sedimentation rate of Kraterg√∂l was evident in sediment core coarse sandy sections and the sequence was thought to represent the mid-late 20 `h century. A diatom-salinity transfer function was employed using existing training sets from the European Diatom Database to infer past water balance. The reconstruction was calibrated with instrumental meteorological data. Reconstructed salinity was limited by poor analogue matching between the palaeo-diatom assemblage and the modem training set. This was partly associated with the presence of a previously undescribed diatom genus (newly named Clipeoparvus anatolicus), which was highly abundant in the Nar modern environment and sediment record. Additional methods to extract palaeoenvironmental information from the diatom record were explored. This included calibrating diatom DCA axes with instrumental temperature in order to reconstruct palaeo-temperature, identifying mono-specific diatom bloom events in situ on <b>core</b> thin section <b>slides,</b> calculating diatom biovolume, concentration, diversity and grouping species according to their habitat preferences. Comparison of the Nar and Kraterg√∂l records highlighted the advantages of annually laminated lake sediments for palaeoenvironmental research and the limitations of sediment sequences from lakes with a varied sedimentation rate and poor chronological control. The primary meteorological control on the Nar diatom population was identified as summer temperature, via the link with lake water salinity. The Nar diatom sequence was compared with an oxygen isotope (palaeo-evaporation) and pollen record (human land use) from the same sediment cores and palaeoclimate reconstructions from other sites and regions. Nar diatoms and oxygen isotopes revealed that Cappadocia experienced high aridity prior to AD 540 and mono-specific diatom bloom events have become increasingly common during the most recent - 400 years. A diatom assemblage shift at AD 2001 also indicated a recent change in the system. Human land use evident in the pollen sequence may have influenced the diatom relationship with climatic variability in the later part of the record. The Kraterg√∂l diatom record indicated environmental variability throughout the mid-late 20 `h century; however, interpretations were limited due to chronological discrepancies. The annually laminated Nar diatom record has provided a detailed account of palaeoenvironmental variability in central Anatolia throughout the late Holocene and contributes towards our understanding of Eastern Mediterranean palaeoclimate.

40|$|How {{proteins}} undergo conformational {{changes to}} bind a ligand {{is one of}} the most fundamental questions of protein biology. MD simulations provide a useful computational tool for studying the theoretical movements of protein in solution on nanosecond timescales. The results of these simulations can be used to guide experimental design. By correlating the theoretical models with the results of experimental studies, we can obtain a significant amount of information about protein dynamics. This study represents the application of both computational and traditional experimental techniques to study protein dynamics in HIV- 1 protease. The results provide a novel mechanism for the conformational changes in proteins and address the role of residues outside the active site in protein dynamics. Additionally, these results are applied to the complex role of non-active site mutations in the development of drug resistance. Chapter II examines an invariant Thr 80 at the apex of the P 1 loop of HIV- 1, HIV- 2, and simian immunodeficiency virus protease. Sequence variability associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is useful for inferring structural and/or functional constraints at specific residues within the viral protease. Positions that are invariant even in the presence of drug selection define critically important residues for protease function. Three protease variants (T 80 V, T 80 N, and T 80 S) were examined for changes in structure, dynamics, enzymatic activity, affinity for protease inhibitors, and viral infectivity. While all three variants were structurally similar to the wild type, only T 80 S was functionally similar. T 80 V significantly decreased the ability of the enzyme to cleave a peptide substrate but maintained infectivity, while T 80 N abolished both activity and viral infectivity. Additionally, T 80 N decreased the conformational flexibility of the flap region, as observed by simulations of molecular dynamics. Taken together, these data indicate that HIV- 1 protease functions best when residue 80 is a small polar residue and that mutations to other amino acids significantly impair enzyme function, possibly by affecting the flexibility of the flap domain. Chapter III focuses on residues within the hydrophobic core of each monomer in HIV- 1 protease. Many hydrophobic residues located in the core of this dimeric enzyme frequently mutate in patients undergoing protease inhibitor therapy. The mechanism by which these mutations aid the development of drug resistance is not well understood. Using MD simulations, this study suggests that the hydrophobic residues outside the active site facilitate the conformational change that occurs in HIV- 1 protease upon binding substrates and inhibitors. In these simulations, the core of each monomer significantly rearranges to assist in the expansion of the active site as hydrophobic <b>core</b> residues <b>slide</b> by each other, exchanging one hydrophobic contact for another. Such hydrophobic sliding may represent a general mechanism by which proteins undergo conformational changes. Mutation of these hydrophobic core residues would alter the packing of the hydrophobic core. Thus, these residues could facilitate drug resistance in HIV- 1 protease by altering dynamic properties of HIV- 1 protease preferentially affecting the relative affinity for inhibitors versus substrates. Chapter IV concentrates on a residue in the flap region, Ile 54, which is significantly correlated with the development of drug resistance. A series of patient sequences containing the mutation I 54 A were evaluated for the most frequently occurring co-mutations. I 54 A was found to occur with mutations that were previously correlated with I 54 V mutations, including L 10 I, G 48 V, and V 82 A. Based on the results of this evaluation, the binding properties of five variant proteases were investigated: MDI 54 V, MDRI 54 A, I 54 V, I 54 A, and G 48 V. MDRI 54 V and MDRI 54 A each contained the mutations L 10 I, G 48 V, and V 82 A, and either I 54 V or I 54 A, respectively. The other variants contained only the mutation indicated. Mutations at Ile 54 were able to significantly impact the thermodynamics of binding to saquinavir, amprenavir, and the recently approved darunavir. The magnitude of this impact depended on the presence or absence of other drug resistance mutations, including another mutation in the flap region, G 48 V. Therefore, while residues 48 and 54 are not in contact with each other, mutations at both sites had a cooperative effect that varies between inhibitors. The results demonstrate that residues outside the active site of HIV- 1 protease are clearly important to enzyme function, possibly through their role in the dynamic properties of protease. Mutations outside the active site of protease that are known to cause drug resistance could alter the conformational flexibility of protease. While the role of protein dynamics in molecular recognition is still not fully understood, the results of this study indicate that altering the dynamic properties of a protein affects its ability to recognize ligands. Therefore, to design better inhibitors we will have to develop a more thorough understanding of protein dynamics...|$|R
