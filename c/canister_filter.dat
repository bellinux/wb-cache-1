25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes <b>canister</b> <b>filter</b> pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} the set-up, operation and observations {{from the first}} 1385 days (3. 8 years) of the large scale gas injection test (Lasgit) experiment conducted at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory. During this time the bentonite buffer has been artificially hydrated and has given new insight into {{the evolution of the}} buffer. After 2 years (849 days) of artificial hydration a <b>canister</b> <b>filter</b> was identified to perform a series of hydraulic and gas tests, a period that lasted 268 days. The results from the gas test showed that the full-scale bentonite buffer behaved in a similar way to previous laboratory experiments. This confirms the up-scaling of laboratory observations with the addition of considerable information on the stress responses throughout the deposition hole. During the gas testing stage, the buffer was continued to artificially hydrate. Hydraulic results, from controlled and uncontrolled events, show that the buffer continues to mature and has yet to reach full maturation. Lasgit has yielded high quality data relating to the hydration of the bentonite and the evolution in hydrogeological properties adjacent to the deposition hole. The initial hydraulic and gas injection tests confirm the correct working of all control and data acquisition systems. Lasgit has been in successful operation for in excess of 1385 days...|$|E
40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{dust collector}} {{tests showed that}} 99. 6 % of the test dust fed into the collector was captured by the dustbags. Figure 1 shows {{the condition of the}} main chamber before and after testing. Total weight gain on the <b>canister</b> <b>filter</b> was over five times greater without use of the bag. The RAM-I unit showed respirable dust levels in the collector exhaust to be over two times higher when tests were conducted without the bags in place. The APS showed that the" number of total dust particles emitted from the exhaust was two times greater when the tests were conducted without the bags. Since nearly all the dust is contained in the bag, operator exposure is improved when emptying the collector box's main chamber. Filter loading is greatly decreased when using the bags, enabling longer periods of drilling without filter removal/cleaning. Pressure drop across the filter for all tests ranged from 3. 0 to 3. 3 in w. g. when the bag was used and from 4. 0 to 8. 4 in w. g. without the bag. Filtered air emitted from the collector has less respirable dust and fewer total dust particles when the bags are used. These results show that benefits from use of the bags are realized in all areas of operator exposure. In order to use these bags in underground coal mines, the dustbags must be accepted by MSHA as an optional item for the specific dust collection system and machine model (30 CFR 33). In addition, the collector must be equipped with a predump option and must have a retrofit kit installed inside the collector to connect to the bag..

50|$|Benefits of {{this type}} of filter are that they can provide a high volume of filter {{material}} without reducing the internal space in the aquarium, and that they can be disconnected from the tank for cleaning/maintenance and replaced without disturbing the aquarium interior or occupants.

25|$|The modern {{gas mask}} was {{developed}} in 1944 by the US Army Chemical Warfare Service. It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I gas masks and fitted the user's face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate <b>filter</b> <b>canister</b> connected with a hose by a <b>filter</b> <b>canister</b> screwed {{on the side of}} the gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the unit during its production, {{including}} an uprated oil pump around mid-1997, with the addition of larger oilways in the head machining (T-Vents), and modified valve lifters to reduce top-end valve noise, at which point the cam belt arrangement also changed with the lower idler moving.

50|$|The {{design of}} the mask with its {{internal}} cheek filters means {{that it must be}} removed by the wearer to change the filters once they are expired or clogged, thus compromising its protective capabilities in a contaminated environment.

40|$|The current {{environmental}} control device in the shuttle uses lithium hydroxide (LiOH) <b>filter</b> <b>canisters</b> to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{from the cabin}} air, requiring several bulky <b>filter</b> <b>canisters</b> {{that can only be}} used once and must be changed frequently. To alleviate a stowage problem and decrease launch weight, the Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD) at the NASA Johnson Space Center has been researching a system to be used on future shuttle missions. This system uses two beds of solid amine material to absorb CO 2 and water, later desorbing them to space vacuum. In this way the air scrubbing medium is regenerable and reusable. To identify the efficacy of this regenerable CO 2 removal system (RCRS), CTSD began investigations in the shuttle mockup. The purpose of this investigation was to support the CTSD program by determining mean levels of carbon dioxide and water vapor production in normal, healthy males and females age-matched with the astronaut corps. Subjects' responses were measured at rest and during exercise at intensity levels equivalent to normal shuttle operation activities. The results were used to assess the adjustments made to RCRS and are reported as a reference for future investigations in shuttle {{environmental control}}...|$|R

While other manufactures had utilised {{the advantages of}} rotary disc valve induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. Rotary disc valve induction ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range.

The S6 features an innovative air seal around {{the inside of}} the face piece to improve the fit and comfort of the mask; a tap inside the nose cup was to allow the equalisation of pressure inside the air seal, in different climatic conditions. The wearers natural body heat would then warm the trapped air to inflate the air seal, thus getting a better seal around the face. The mask could also be made to benefit left-handed people, where the <b>filter</b> <b>canister</b> is positioned on the right of the face mask instead of the left. The location of the filter on the left or right side of the mask was to allow the rifle to be shouldered, aimed and fired correctly.|$|R

This system draws a sample of exhaust gas from the source, dilutes it with filtered air and quantifies total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), oxygen (O 2), particle size distribution, particle number and mass concentrations, and black carbon (BC) concentration at 1 – 6 sec interval. Integrated samples by <b>canisters</b> and <b>filter</b> packs are acquired for laboratory analyses of VOC speciation, particle mass concentration, light absorption, elements, isotopes, ions, ammonia (NH 3), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon, and organic compounds.

Instrument response time was tested by emissions from lighting and burning matches. The DustTrak DRX and optical particle counter (OPC) had the fastest response time, while other instruments had 3. 5 – 21. 5 sec delay from the DustTrak DRX and OPC. This system was applied to measure emissions from burning pine logs in a wood stove. The real-time data showed flaming, transition, and smoldering phases, and allowed real-time emission ratios to be calculated.

25|$|Gas mask {{development}} {{since has}} mirrored {{the development of}} chemical agents in warfare, filling {{the need to protect}} against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, where agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin occurs, such as blister agent or nerve agent, a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition, to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defense and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks believing that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC) agents; which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Whilst most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protection against all NBC agents, they can have <b>filter</b> <b>canisters</b> proof against those agents (heavier) or only against riot control agents and smoke (lighter, and often used for training purposes); likewise there are lightweight masks solely for use in riot control agents and not for NBC situations.|$|R
