25|$|If {{none of the}} two numbers has a hundreds-digit then {{if there}} is no <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> then the {{addition}} algorithm has finished. If there is a <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> (carried over from the tens-column) then write it in the hundreds-column under the line, and the algorithm is finished. When the algorithm finishes, the number under the line is the sum of the two numbers.|$|E
25|$|If the {{multiplicand}} has a hundreds-digit, {{find the}} product of the multiplier and the hundreds-digit of the multiplicand, and to this product add the <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> if there is one. Then write the resulting sum of the hundreds-column under the line, also in the hundreds column. If the sum has two digits then write down the last digit of the sum in the hundreds-column and write the <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> to its left: on the thousands-column.|$|E
25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column might contain two digits: the tens-digit {{of the first}} number and the tens-digit of the second number. If one of the numbers has a missing tens-digit then the tens-digit for this number can be {{considered}} to be a 0. Add the tens-digits of the two numbers. Then, if there is a <b>carry</b> <b>digit,</b> add it to this sum. If the sum was 18 then adding the <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> to it will yield 19. If the sum of the tens-digits (plus <b>carry</b> <b>digit,</b> if there is one) is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit (which should be a 1) over to the next column: in this case the hundreds-column.|$|E

25|$|If {{at least}} one of the numbers has a {{hundreds}}-digit then if one of the numbers has a missing hundreds-digit then write a 0 digit in its place. Add the two hundreds-digits, and to their sum add the <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> if there is one. Then write the sum of the hundreds-column under the line, also in the hundreds column. If the sum has two digits then write down the last digit of the sum in the hundreds-column and write the <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> to its left: on the thousands-column.|$|E
25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column so far {{contains}} only one digit: the tens-digit of the multiplicand (though it might contain a <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> under the line). Find {{the product of}} the multiplier and the tens-digits of the multiplicand. Then, if there is a <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> (superscripted, under the line and in the tens-column), add it to this product. If the resulting sum is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit over to the next column: in this case the hundreds column.|$|E
2500|$|Next, the hundreds-column. The hundreds-digit of {{the first}} number is 6, while the hundreds-digit of the second number is 2.

2500|$|Next, the tens-column. The tens-digit of {{the first}} number is 5, and the tens-digit of the second number is 7, and five plus seven is twelve: 12, which has two digits, so write its last digit, 2, in the tens-column under the line, and write the <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> on the hundreds-column above the first number: ...|$|E
2500|$|Start {{with the}} ones-column: the ones-column should contain {{a pair of}} digits: the ones-digit of the {{multiplicand}} and, under it, the ones-digit of the multiplier.

Write the [...] "carry digit" [...] as a superscript of the yet-unwritten digit in the next column and under the line: {{in this case the}} next column is the tens-column, so write the <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> as the superscript of the yet-unwritten tens-digit of the product (under the line).|$|E
50|$|To put {{it another}} way, we are taking a <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> from the {{position}} on our right, and passing a <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> to the left, just as in conventional addition; but the <b>carry</b> <b>digit</b> we pass to the left {{is the result of}} the previous calculation and not the current one. In each clock cycle, carries only have to move one step along, and not n steps as in conventional addition.|$|E
5000|$|Consistency. Codes in {{the data}} items which are related in some way can thus be checked for the {{consistency}} of their relationship.

50|$|Specification of a CRC code {{requires}} {{definition of}} a so-called generator polynomial. This polynomial becomes the divisor in a polynomial long division, which takes the message as the dividend and in which the quotient is discarded and the remainder becomes the result. The important caveat is that the polynomial coefficients are calculated according to the arithmetic of a finite field, so the addition operation can always be performed bitwise-parallel (there is no <b>carry</b> between <b>digits).</b> The length of the remainder is always less than {{the length of the}} generator polynomial, which therefore determines how long the result can be.|$|R
