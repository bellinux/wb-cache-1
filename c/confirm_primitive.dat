40|$|Primary focal {{segmental}} glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is {{a disease}} with poor prognosis and high unmet therapeutic need. Here, we evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of single-dose infusions of fresolimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inactivates all forms of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), in a phase I open-label, dose-ranging study. Patients with biopsy-confirmed, treatment-resistant, primary FSGS with a minimum estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 [*]ml/min per 1. 73 [*]m 2, and a urine protein to creatinine ratio over 1. 8 [*]mg/mg were eligible. All 16 patients completed the study in which each received one of four single-dose levels of fresolimumab (up to 4 [*]mg/kg) and was followed for 112 days. Fresolimumab was well tolerated with pustular rash the only adverse event in two patients. One patient {{was diagnosed with a}} histologically <b>confirmed</b> <b>primitive</b> neuroectodermal tumor 2 years after fresolimumab treatment. Consistent with treatment-resistant FSGS, there was a slight decline in eGFR (median decline baseline to final of 5. 85 [*]ml/min per 1. 73 [*]m 2). Proteinuria fluctuated during the study with the median decline from baseline to final in urine protein to creatinine ratio of 1. 2 [*]mg/mg with all three Black patients having a mean decline of 3. 6 [*]mg/mg. The half-life of fresolimumab was ∼ 14 days, and the mean dose-normalized Cmax and area under the curve were independent of dose. Thus, single-dose fresolimumab was well tolerated in patients with primary resistant FSGS. Additional evaluation in a larger dose-ranging study is necessary...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGrasping {{requires}} coding of the object's intrinsic properties (size and shape), and {{the transformation}} of these properties into a pattern of distal (finger and wrist) movements. Computational models address this behavior through the interaction of perceptual and motor schemas. In monkeys, {{the transformation of}} an object's intrinsic properties into specific grips {{takes place in a}} circuit that is formed by the inferior parietal lobule and the inferior premotor area (area F 5). Neurons in both these areas code size, shape and orientation of objects, and specific types of grip that are necessary to grasp them. Grasping movements are coded more globally in the inferior parietal lobule, whereas they are more segmented in area F 5. In humans, neuropsychological studies of patients with lesions to the parietal lobule <b>confirm</b> that <b>primitive</b> shape characteristics of an object for grasping are analyzed in the parietal lobe, and also demonstrate that this 'pragmatic' analysis of objects is separated from the 'semantic' analysis performed in the temporal lobe...|$|R
40|$|Context. Primitive asteroids contain complex organic {{material}} and ices {{relevant to the}} origin of life on Earth. These types of asteroids are the target of several-sample return missions to be launched in the next years. 1999 JU 3 is the target of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's Hayabusa 2 mission. Aims. 1999 JU 3 has been previously identified as a C-class asteroid. Spectroscopic observations at longer wavelengths will help to constrain its composition. Methods. We obtained spectroscopy of 1999 JU 3 from 0. 85 to 2. 2 microns, with the 3. 6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo using the low resolution mode of the Near Infrared Camera Spectrograph. Results. We present a near-infrared spectrum of 1999 JU 3 from 0. 85 to 2. 2 microns that is consistent with previously published spectra and with its C-type classification. Conclusions.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionPrimary meningiomas of the sinonasal tract {{are rare}} tumors. Their {{positive}} diagnosis {{is difficult to}} establish. From one case observation, we report the clinical features, the diagnosis difficulties and the therapeutic modalities of primary meningioma of the sinonasal tract. Case reportA seventeen-year-old girl consulted for a left unilateral nasal obstruction with progressive evolution without episodes of epistaxis, smell disorder or headaches over a year. Physical examination revealed a grayish polypoid tumor in the left nasal fossa. CT scan evidenced an isodense lesion of the left nasal fossa slightly enhanced pushing back the lateral nasal wall without invasion or intracranial connection. Biopsy was in favour of an inverted papilloma. The tumor was resected via endoscopic approach. Pathological examination established the diagnosis of meningothelial menigioma. The prognosis was favourable without recurrence after a six-month follow-up. ConclusionThe positive diagnosis of primary sinonasal meningioma is difficult to establish because of their infrequent occurrence in this ectopic site and of their non-specific clinical appearance. The final diagnosis rests on the histological examination. Immunohistochemical studies are helpful to establish the accurate diagnosis. Imaging <b>confirms</b> the <b>primitive</b> nature of these tumors. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical extirpation without the necessity of adjuvant therapy...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an {{uncommon}} benign neoplasm with locally aggressive behavior but malignant change is rare. We report an unusual case of pelvic-abdominal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor with malignant transformation in a 14 -year-old boy presenting with abdominal pain and 9 kg body weight loss in one month. Computed tomography revealed a huge pelvi-abdominal mass (30 cm), possibly originating from the pelvic extraperitoneal space, protruding into the abdomen leading to upward {{displacement of the}} bowel loops, downward displacement of the urinary bladder, massive central necrosis, a well-enhanced peripheral solid component with prominent peritumoral vascularity. Subsequent examination confirmed the computed tomographic findings. Histopathologic examination revealed proliferative epitheloid and spindle cells, inflammatory cell infiltration and high mitotic counts. Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase and revealed a high proliferative index (ki- 67 = 40 %). DNA sequencing and electronic microscopy further <b>confirmed</b> the <b>primitive</b> fibroblastic cell phenotype of the tumor and a final diagnosis of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor with malignant transformation was established. Rapid tumor recurrence was noted 20 d after radical tumor resection.

40|$|Corneal {{epithelium}} {{is maintained}} throughout life by well-orchestrated proliferation of limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs), followed by migration and maturation centripetally towards the ocular surface. Disturbance of LESCs can potentially {{lead to a}} blinding condition, which can be reversed by reconstitution of a functional LESC pool. The current clinical procedures are effective to some degree, however, deeper knowledge of the molecular interplay within the limbal niche is necessary to achieve a fully satisfactory patient outcome.

40|$|International audienceContext. Near-Earth {{objects are}} among the most {{accessible}} bodies in the solar system in terms of the spacecraft propulsion requirements to reach them. The choice of targets and the planning of space missions are based on high quality ground-based science. Aims. The knowledge of the ensemble of physical parameters for these objects, including their composition, is a critical point in defining any mission scientific objectives. Determining the physical properties of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is also possible from the ground by analyzing spectroscopy at both visible and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We present spectra of eight NEAs (1917, 8567, 16960, 164400, 188452, 2001 SG 286, and 2010 TD 54) obtained using the NASA telescope IRTF equipped with the spectro-imager SpeX. The observations were performed in the 0. 8 - 2. 5 mu m spectral region using the low resolution mode of the spectrograph. We completed the taxonomic classification using the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy. We analyzed the spectra by comparing them to meteorite spectra from the Relab database using chi(2) approach. For the S-type asteroids of our sample, the band centers and BAR were calculated. We also attempted to interpret our data using a space-weathering model. Results. The taxonomic classification of five objects was reviewed and we assigned a corresponding type to the other three asteroids that were not classified before. We found that (1917) Cuyo, (8567) 1996 HW 1, (16960) 1998 QS 52, (188452) 2004 HE 62, and 2010 TD 54 are in the S-complex. We achieved a good matching of our S-type asteroids with the spectra of ordinary chondrites meteorites. The asteroid (5620) Jasonwheeler was found to have a NIR spectrum similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Thus, our results <b>confirm</b> its <b>primitive</b> properties obtained in several other spectral intervals...|$|R
40|$|Themajor {{elements}}, {{trace elements}} and Sr and Nd isotopes of selected Etnean primitive rocks (b 15 ky BP) were studied {{in order to}} characterize their mantle source. The noble-gas geochemistry of fluid inclusions in minerals fromthe same lavaswas also investigated. Themajor element compositions ofwhole rocks and minerals showed that these products {{are among the most}} primitive atMt. Etna, comprising 6. 3 – 17. 5 wt. % MgO. The variable LREE (Light Rare Earth Elements) enrichment relative to MORB (Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt) (Lan/Ybn = 11 – 26), togetherwith the patterns of certain trace-element ratios (i. e., Ce/Yb versus Zr/Nb and Th/Y versus La/Yb), can be attributed to varying degrees of melting of a common mantle source. Numerical simulations performed with the MELTS program allowed the melting percentages associated with each product to be estimated. This led us to recalculate the hypothetical parental trace-element content of the Etneanmantle source, whichwas common to all of the investigated rocks. The characteristics of the Sr, Nd and He isotopes <b>confirmed</b> the <b>primitive</b> nature of the rocks,with themost-depleted and primitive lava being that ofMt. Spagnolo (SPA; 143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 512908 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 703317 – 0. 703325 and 3 He/ 4 He = 7. 6 Ra), and highlighted the similarity of the mantle sources feeding the volcanic activity of Mt. Etna and the Hyblean Plateau (a region to the south of Mt. Etna and characterized by oldermagmatismthan Mt. Etna). The coupling of noble gases and trace elements suggests an origin for the investigated Etnean lavas from melting of a Hyblean-like mantle, consisting of a two-component source where a peridotitic matrix is veined by 10 % pyroxenite. A variable degree of mantle contamination by crustal-like fluids, probably related to subduction, is proposed to explain the higher Sr-isotope and lowerNd-isotope values in some rocks (143 Nd/ 144 Nd up to 0. 512865 and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr up to 0. 703707). This process probably occurred in the source prior tomagma generation, refertilizing some portions of themantle. Accordingly, the estimated degree of melting responsible for each magma appears to be related to its 87 Sr/ 86 Sr enrichment. In contrast, the decoupling between 3 He/ 4 He and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios requires the occurrence in the crustal reservoirs of further processes capable of shifting the He isotope ratio towards slightly more radiogenic values, such as magma aging or a contribution of shallow fluid. Therefore, different residence times in the Etnean reservoir and/or various rates of magma ascent could be key parameters for preserving the original He isotope marker of the Etnean mantle source...|$|R
40|$|We have {{experienced}} 7 cases of multicystic kidney. The latest two cases, etiologically of interest, are reported herein with special reference to its embryogenesis. Case 6 : A 4 -year-old girl {{was referred to}} our clinic for further evaluation of mild azotemia and nonvisualization of left kidney. Left kidney was strongly thought to be multicystic kidney from abdominal CT, whereas her contralateral kidney exhibited hydrocalycosis resembling infundibular stenosis with diminished calyceal numbers. Nephrectomy of her left kidney was performed and histological studies <b>confirmed</b> renal dysplasia (<b>primitive</b> duct, metaplastic cartilage, etc.). Case 7 : A 7 -year-old girl was referred to Hakodate Kyokai Hospital {{for the evaluation of}} azotemia and low stature. Her right kidney was not visualized on IVP and her left kidney exhibited hydronephrosis with diminished calyceal numbers. Her right kidney was diagnosed as multicystic kidney on CT-scan. Pyeloplasty of her left kidney was performed. Multicystic kidney is a rather rare congenital disease. Association of various anomalies in contralateral kidney has been emphasized as well as the notion that infundibulopelvic stenosis is a linked in the clinical spectrum extending from cystic dysplasia of the kidney to hydronephrosis. Our last two cases seem to be included in this category of obstruction theory. As shown by microdissection technique (Potter), however, severe ampullary inhibition early in fetal life is also an attractive hypothesis. Diminished calyceal number of contralateral kidneys seen in our recent two cases is compatible with possibility of ampullary damage. Recent experimental study also showed that renal dysplasia is not solely caused by simply mechanical obstruction to urinary drainage, even when the obstruction is imposed at an early stage of renal development...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to optimize conditions for retroviral transduction of human cord blood (CB) CD 34 + cells and to reveal mechanisms which interfere with efficient gene transfer. METHODS: An MSCV based retroviral vector with the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (MGIN) produced by GP+envAM 12 (amphotropic envelope), PG 13 (gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope) or 293 GPG (vesicular stomatitis virus envelope) cell lines was used to transduce cord blood CD 34 + cells on Retronectin (fibronectin fragment CH- 296) in three different ways: either in vector containing medium (VCM), in fresh medium on Retronectin pre-loaded with vector or in VCM on Retronectin pre-loaded with vector. RESULTS: Paradoxically, the transduction efficiency obtained with pre-load of vector onto Retronectin alone was higher than pre-load plus VCM for PG 13 -MGIN (67. 9 +/- 6. 0 % vs 24. 9 +/- 8. 0 %) and AM 12 -MGIN (47. 5 +/- 5. 8 % vs 38. 7 +/- 2. 2 %). Further experiments showed that transduction on Retronectin pre-loaded with PG 13 -MGIN or AM 12 -MGIN was inhibited by the presence of the same VCM at high concentrations, but not by the presence of a VCM with a different receptor specificity. If no pre-load of vector was performed, the highest transduction efficiencies were seen when VCMs were diluted 1 : 10 (MOIs of 3). The inhibitory effect of high titer PG 13 -MGIN VCM was <b>confirmed</b> in more <b>primitive</b> CD 34 +CD 38 low cells and in NOD/SCID repopulating cells, and was also seen in experiments with bone marrow CD 34 + cells. CONCLUSIONS: Retroviral transduction of CB CD 34 + cells on Retronectin is inhibited by high titer PG 13 and GP+envAM 12 vector containing medium. Efficient gene transfer to human hematopoietic cells can be obtained by preload alone of the vector onto Retronectin. These findings are of importance for the design of transduction protocols for repopulating hematopoietic cells...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} image generalization paradigm for computing visibility. The paradigm {{is based on}} the observation that an image is a powerful tool for computing visibility. An image can be rendered efficiently with the support of graphics hardware and each of the millions of pixels in the image reports a visible geometric primitive. However, the visibility solution computed by a conventional image is far from complete. A conventional image has a uniform sampling rate which can miss visible geometric primitives with a small screen footprint. A conventional image can only find geometric primitives to which there is direct line of sight from the center of projection (i. e. the eye) of the image; therefore, a conventional image cannot compute the set of geometric primitives that become visible as the viewpoint translates, or as time changes in a dynamic dataset. Finally, like any sample-based representation, a conventional image can only confirm that a geometric primitive is visible, but it cannot confirm that a geometric primitive is hidden, as that would require an infinite number of samples to <b>confirm</b> that the <b>primitive</b> is hidden at all of its points. ^ The image generalization paradigm overcomes the visibility computation limitations of conventional images. The paradigm has three elements. (1) Sampling pattern generalization entails adding sampling locations to the image plane where needed to find visible geometric primitives with a small footprint. (2) Visibility sample generalization entails replacing the conventional scalar visibility sample with a higher dimensional sample that records all geometric primitives visible at a sampling location as the viewpoint translates or as time changes in a dynamic dataset; the higher-dimensional visibility sample is computed exactly, by solving visibility event equations, and not through sampling. Another form of visibility sample generalization is to enhance a sample with its trajectory as the geometric primitive it samples moves in a dynamic dataset. (3) Ray geometry generalization redefines a camera ray as the set of 3 D points that project at a given image location; this generalization supports rays that are not straight lines, and enables designing cameras with non-linear rays that circumvent occluders to gather samples not visible from a reference viewpoint. ^ The image generalization paradigm has been used to develop visibility algorithms for a variety of datasets, of visibility parameter domains, and of performance-accuracy tradeoff requirements. These include an aggressive from-point visibility algorithm that guarantees finding all geometric primitives with a visible fragment, no matter how small primitive 2 ̆ 7 s image footprint, an efficient and robust exact from-point visibility algorithm that iterates between a sample-based and a continuous visibility analysis of the image plane to quickly converge to the exact solution, a from-rectangle visibility algorithm that uses 2 D visibility samples to compute a visible set that is exact under viewpoint translation, a flexible pinhole camera that enables local modulations of the sampling rate over the image plane according to an input importance map, an animated depth image that not only stores color and depth per pixel but also a compact representation of pixel sample trajectories, and a curved ray camera that integrates seamlessly multiple viewpoints into a multiperspective image without the viewpoint transition distortion artifacts of prior art methods. ...|$|R
