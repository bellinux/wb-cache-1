40|$|This study {{assesses the}} link between land leasing {{behavior}} and productivity differentials between male and female-headed households. A double-moral hazard model allows us {{to show that the}} landlord‟s tenure insecurity leads to a sub-optimal level of effort on the tenant‟s part, via its impact on the likelihood of <b>contract</b> <b>renewal.</b> The model also predicts that a high search cost of a landlord leads to a higher probability of <b>contract</b> <b>renewal.</b> A lower probability of <b>contract</b> <b>renewal</b> leads to lower levels of tenant‟s effort, and vice versa. The empirical findings support the hypotheses that female household heads have lower enforcement ability and that tenure insecurity is a significant negative determinant of productivity. However, the results show no support for a lower likelihood of <b>contract</b> <b>renewal</b> by female-headed households or for a significant impact of <b>contract</b> <b>renewal</b> on productivity...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{technological}} progress, recent {{performance is}} often more informative about future performance prospects than is older performance. We incorporate information decay in a career concern model in which performance depends on type and effort and <b>contract</b> <b>renewal</b> {{is based on the}} performance record. In contrast with the career concern literature (e. g. Lewis, 1986; RJE), contractors work harder when the project approaches renewal date and when their reputation is better. Productive investment are crowded out by window-dressing effort in late contract periods, but it is boosted in early periods. More frequent <b>contract</b> <b>renewals</b> strengthen reputational effects and result in improved performance if the relative cost of investment is low, but otherwise long-term contracts induce more effort. Our results are corroborated by some empirical studies showing that performance improves as the <b>contract</b> approaches <b>renewal</b> date.

40|$|This study investigates whether {{temporary}} contract volition and workers' {{expectations for}} <b>contract</b> <b>renewal</b> are boundary conditions to explain differences in temporary workers' job insecurity feelings and well-being. It is hypothesized that (1) low volition through higher job insecurity indirectly associates with lower well-being and that (2) temporary workers' expectations of <b>contract</b> <b>renewal</b> weakens {{the links between}} both low volition and high job insecurity and high job insecurity and impaired well-being. Results based on an international data set of 1755 temporary workers employed in the education, manufacturing, and service sectors supported the first hypothesis and partly also the second. More specifically, low preferences for temporary contracts associated via higher job insecurity with lower job satisfaction, impaired health, and higher irritation. Contract expectations placed a boundary condition upon this indirect relation; however, the negative association between high job insecurity and impaired well-being was not weakened but strengthened. In conclusion, particularly temporary workers with low contract volition and high job insecurity feelings, who have high expectations for <b>contract</b> <b>renewal</b> {{are at risk for}} impaired well-being. Hence, this study sheds light onto the question how volition for temporary work and expected <b>contract</b> <b>renewal</b> relate to job insecurity and associate with individual well-being.
