However, they could not be commercially exploited until a railway had been built. A railway bridge across the Zambezi was constructed in 1903 and the line was continued northward, reaching Broken Hill in 1906, where the lead and zinc vanadium mine was opened, and reaching the Belgian Congo border in 1909. At that time, mining had started in Katanga, where rich copper oxide ores occurred near the surface.

Linear mapping indicated that moganite mainly concentrates in grey zones of the monocentric agate nodules. The other types, polycentric and pseudostalactitic agates, are usually brown and red and contain minerals such as hematite and goethite.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of <b>copper</b> <b>sulphide</b> within oil filled high voltage equipment is the {{symptom of the}} use of sulphurous oil. In some cases, severe <b>copper</b> <b>sulphide</b> contamination has resulted in expensive equipment failure. It has been shown that sealed equipment, containing sulphurous oils and operating at elevated temperatures, are the more susceptible to the <b>copper</b> <b>sulphide</b> deposits. Recent work has suggested a mechanism for the deposits in the paper covering the copper conductors. Other work has suggested that the deposition {{may be the result of}} thermally driven gassing.
