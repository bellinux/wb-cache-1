40|$|Abstract In this study, {{interrupted}} <b>creep</b> <b>crack</b> growth {{tests were}} conducted using C(T) specimens with side-grooves of P 92 steel. After the interrupted tests, to investigate the <b>creep</b> <b>crack</b> growth behavior of P 92 steel under the multi-axial stress field, the <b>creep</b> <b>crack</b> growth path {{of the center of}} the thickness direction and near the side-groove were observed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{collapse}} of several historical masonry towers has {{been attributed to}} gradually increasing mechanical damage, such as <b>creep</b> <b>cracking</b> which occurs under constant stress levels. This paper reviews theoretical, experimental and numerical methods for analysing compressive creep in historical masonry. The investigations focus on creep behaviour in ferruginous sandstone, as results are applied to understand the {{collapse of}} two historical towers in Belgium that were both constructed in local sandstone. At the level of the material, <b>cracking,</b> <b>creep</b> strains and acoustic emissions are studied in small-to-medium scale sandstone samples under dry and saturated conditions. Results indicate an acceleration of the degradation process when water absorption takes place during the secondary creep phase. At the structural level, numerical macro modelling is performed to investigate the effect of stress redistributions on creep behaviour of three-leaf masonry.

40|$|Cu 6 Sn 5 is an {{important}} intermetallic compound (IMC) commonly formed during lead-free soldering. It is known that Cu 6 Sn 5 exhibits significantly different thermo-mechanical deformation behaviour compared to both bulk solder alloys and their substrates. In high-density 3 -D electrical packages individual solder joints may contain only a few grains of Cu 6 Sn 5. The knowledge of the mechanical properties, <b>creep</b> and <b>crack</b> behaviour of Cu 6 Sn 5 on different crystal planes is therefore essential to understanding the deformation of lead-free solder joints in service. In this research, the mechanical properties, <b>creep</b> and <b>crack</b> patterns on diverse crystal planes of hexagonal Cu 6 Sn 5 and (Cu,Ni) (6) Sn- 5 were investigated using electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nanoindentation.

The 241 -BY Tank Farm has 12 reinforced concrete,underground waste tanks, numbered 241 -BY- 101 to 112. Each tank has an inside, 3 / 8 inch thick carbon steel liner, for containment of liquid wastes. The capacity of each tank is 758, 000 gallons. The reinforced concrete design drawings for the 241 -BY Tank (H- 2 - 1312, H- 2 - 1314, and H- 2 - 1315) are reproduced in this report. The 241 -BY Tank Farm was originally used to store liquid radioactive wastes with temperatures about 2000 F. For approximately the last five years, the Waste Management Program has had the In-Tank Solidification Unit No. 2 (ITS- 2) i{approx}stalled in the 241 -BY- 112 Tank. With ITS- 2, this tank has operated with a liquid temperature of 250 F most of the time. Currently, Operations Support Engineering of Atlantic Richfield Hanford Company believes that ITS- 2 could operate more effectively if the liquid in the 241 -BY- 112 Tank were heated to 280 F. Thus, the subject structural analyses were undertaken to predict how the tank structure responds to the 250 F and the proposed 280 F liquid temperatures. More specifically, the goals of these analyses were: (1) Make a quantitative determination and evaluation of the time dependent <b>creep,</b> <b>cracking,</b> and stresses experienced to date by the 241 -BY- 112 reinforced concrete structure due to its surrounding soil load and the 2500 F temperature history; and (2) Predict and evaluate future time-dependent <b>creep,</b> <b>cracking,</b> and stresses in the 241 -BY- 112 concrete structure that would occur if ITS- 2 operated with 2800 F liquid in the tank. Based on the analyses results presented herein, the 241 -BY- 112 reinforced concrete tank structure, with 7 feet of soil cover and operating with 250 F to 280 F liquid contents will experience thermal expansion, and time-dependent <b>creep</b> and <b>cracking.</b> However, the time-dependent cracking is shown to essentially stop progressing when the tank reaches a steady state temperature.

Crack growth by coalescence with grain boundary cavities is modeted and the lifetimes of cracked specimens are calculated by integrating the resulting laws for crack growth. Limitations to C-integral arise from the initial elastic-plastic material response, from primary creep, from cracktip blunting and from widespread cavitation damage.

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{formulation}} is presented {{for the analysis}} of moisture migra-tion, <b>creep,</b> shrinkage and <b>cracking</b> in cementitious materials. A one-way coupled approach is followed, where the pore humidity, the driving force for shrinkage, is solved for from a diffusion equation. The evolution of the shrinkage strain field is then computed and employed in a subsequent mechanical analysis neglecting stress or cracking influence on the pore humidity. Either a continuous approach is followed, or a discrete approach is followed where the heterogeneity rules out the former, for example in masonry containing large blocks. Cracking is simulated in a smeared way by softening, anisotropic Rankine plasticity. In the second approach cracking is restricted to predefined areas, such as the mortar joints, where interfaces account for debonding and shear-slipping via a combined tension cut-off and Coulomb-friction material law, based on multi-surface plasticity. Bulk creep is modelled with visco-elasticity. Rate dependence of the bond ruptures leading to fracture is accounted for by considering the viscosity of the cracking process. The lat-ter contribution has a regularising effect on the localisation process which accompanies smeared cracking models.

The data were recorded by a telemetering system for events from 1985 to 1991 (367 events), with magnitudes less than 4. 0 and depths shallower than 30 km. We found a temporal variation in coda Q- 1, the number of earthquakes and b value, all of which increased with time in the volcanic area. However, we could not find significant temporal variation in such values in the tectonic area. Positive correlation between the coda Q- 1 and the b value {{was found in the}} volcanic area, but good correlation was not observed in the tectonic area. We also measured the temporal variation of power of frequency n for coda Q- 1 defined by the formula Qc- 1 = Q 0 - 1 f-', where Q 0 - 1 represents Qc- 1 at 1 Hz andf is frequency. The value of a shows no significant temporal change in the Hida region. We consider the cause of the temporal change in coda Q- 1 in the volcanic area involves aseismic fractures, increasing scatter of <b>creeping</b> <b>cracks,</b> due to magma accumulation. 1...|$|R
