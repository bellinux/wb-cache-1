Thus, it is very usual to check the accuracy of the coded algorithms with commercial ones. In this work, previously coded and tested algorithm based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) to solve the optimization problems in structural engineering is used to compare the solution obtained by MATLAB Genetic Tool.

This thesis develops an abstract language which is expressive enough to describe any sequential object <b>code</b> <b>program.</b> The abstract language supports the definition of program logics in which to specify and verify object <b>code</b> <b>programs.</b> This allows the object <b>code</b> <b>programs</b> of any processor language to be verified in a single system of logic. The abstract language is expressive enough that a single command is enough to describe the behaviour of any processor instruction. An object <b>code</b> <b>program</b> can therefore be translated to the abstract language by replacing each instruction with the equivalent command of the abstract language. This ensures that the use of the abstract language does not increase the difficulty of verifying an object <b>code</b> <b>program.</b> The verification of an object <b>code</b> <b>program</b> can be simplified by constructing an abstraction of the program and showing that the abstraction correctly implements the program specification. Methods for abstracting programs of the abstract language are developed which consider only the text of a program. These methods are based on describing a finite sequence of commands as a single, equivalent, command of the abstract language. This is used to define transformations which abstract a program by replacing groups of program commands with a single command. The abstraction of a program formed in this way can be verified in the same system of logic as the original program. Because the transformations consider only the program text, they are suitable for efficient mechanisation in an automated proof tool. By reducing the number of commands which must be considered, these methods can reduce the manual work needed to verify a program. The use of an abstract language allows object <b>code</b> <b>programs</b> to be specified and verified in a system of logic while the use of abstraction to simplify programs makes verification practical. As examples, object <b>code</b> <b>programs</b> for two different processors are modelled, abstracted and verified in terms of the abstract language.

The applied construction method {{is based on the}} differentiation of algorithms in the backward mode. Starting from the <b>coded</b> <b>program</b> of the model, the adjoint model is stepwise constructed by means of simple rules. In twin-experiments on the basis of simulated ocean surface measurements the amplitudes of the wind thrust pattern have been reconstructed. By introducing a smoothness condition the 2 #DELTA#t amplitude signals have been suppressed. Analysis of the fault covariance matrix of the results proved that the inverse problem is by far better determined after supressing the 2 #DELTA#t signal. In additional experiments, surface data sets derived from experimental measurements have been assimilated by variation of the wind thrust. It is demonstrated that dynamic interpolation between different kinds of data is made possible by means of the circulation model.

40|$|Abstract: Maintaining desired flight {{conditions}} in flight envelope {{for a long}} period is one of the primary control problems in aircraft flight control. Aircraft dynamics are in general nonlinear, time varying and uncertain. A control system (classical control systems) designed for a flight condition, may not provide the desired stability and performance characteristics in case of deviation from the equilibrium point. There are numerous studies regarding flight control in the literature. Most of the applications about the design of fuzzy flight control are in simulation level. Fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) from their inception have demonstrated a vast range of applicability to processes where the plant transfer function is not defined but the control action can be described in terms of linguistic variables. Fuzzy controllers are also being used to improve the performance of a system where the plant transfer function is known. Most of the applications about the design of fuzzy flight control are in simulation level. In this study, the results of fuzzy PD and classical PD controller for the yaw damper system is compared and evaluated for a very large four engined passenger jet aircraft in a MATLAB <b>coded</b> <b>program.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Power flow {{analysis}} {{is crucial for}} power system analysis and design. For these reasons, it is commonly necessary to have different inputs for the program to have different generated results for further analyses. As a basic program, power flow program may be employed by the other programs for evaluating the power system for the given input parameters. The program is therefore required to be interactive or has open connectivity with the other program or may be modified and included as a sub routine in the upper level program. It is unfortunate since the available package programs normally do not provide the aforementioned features. Due to this circumstance, power flow program is normally again constructed using the same programming language, which the main program may utilize. Beside additional effort that may be time consuming, the coded power flow program may {{still need to be}} verified to generate accurate results. This paper presents the program for power {{flow analysis}} using Newton Raphson method. The program is constructed using Matlab and the generated results are then confirmed with those generated by two standard package program (ETAP and HARMFLOW). The verification is necessary to assure that the generated results are accurate. Since the results of the coded programs may be used for further calculations, the precision of the results will significantly contribute the accuracy of the results of analysis and design.

40|$|Developmental biology {{seeks to}} {{understand}} how organisms are constructed. Development {{is a set of}} very complex processes involving a <b>coded</b> <b>program</b> as the organisms’ genome. This genome describes how to build the organism, but not how the organism will look like. The zygote (the initial single cell), will eventually develop into a trillion cell organism. This extraordinary phenomenon has been an inspiration to the world of Computer Science and Artificial Life and has {{led to the creation of}} Artificial Embryogeny (AE). Artificial Embryogeny is a sub-discipline of evolutionary computation (EC) in which a phenotype undergoes a developmental phase. The number of AE systems currently being developed investigate mainly how principal biological processes and mechanisms can be exploited in the artificial world. One approach that utilize the phase of biological development in artificial systems is called Artificial Development (AD) where the genotype (genetic representation) contain a similar set of instructions - as in the biological organisms case - called generative program or developmental encoding. Therefore, the process of development comprise to actually execute those instructions and deal with the highly parallel interactions between them and the structure they create. On the other hand, nature uses the same fundamental machinery and almost the same genetic information to create vastly different creatures. A study reveals that about 99 % of mouse genomes have direct counterparts in humans with cats having 90 % of their homologous genes identical to humans. How is it possible for nature to use a vast majority of the same genetic representation in the DNA but still be able to develop such distant species? It was found that a common regulator gene can control the formation of many of the internal organs in both nematodes and vertebrates. Therefore, the very same gene can initiate the process of formation and define its outcome, for example, an intestine or a muscle cell. This thesis investigates how to design an Artificial Embryogeny by using the same genetic information to develop a class of computational architectures or different computational architectures. The result of this investigation has given rise to the Common Developmental Genomes (CDG). The computational architectures targeted, have a common characteristic of being sparsely-connected networks, with each node acting as a simple computational unit. Such computational architectures are cellular automata and boolean networks, artificial neural networks and cellular neural networks. The approach followed includes the following steps: a. investigate which architectures are suitable for development with such a model, b. describe a common developmental approach that can handle the targeted architectures, c. define how genetic information can be exploited by the developmental process, so as to develop these architectures and d. identify a suitable genome representation to ensure that different structures can be developed and achieved. The target architectures chosen throughout this thesis were cellular automata and random boolean networks. The reason for choosing those particular architectures is that they have similar structural and functional properties; in addition, random boolean networks are considered a generalization of cellular automata. Core work and design principles are given in Paper I. Though this paper it was able to show how genetic information can be represented and how targeted architectures can be integrated in the genotype. It is also shown how target architectures can be evolved and different structures achieved. Paper II studies the ability of CDG to evolve a simple financial market model in problems of varying complexity. CDG was shown to evolve better for some architecture sizes. In addition, CDGs evolvability were studied in case of limited resources (Paper III) with very promising results in certain cases. Paper IV focuses on how genetic operators affect evolution of CDG and studies their developmental dynamics under more complex and random environments. Paper V studies the ability of CDG to adapt when the target goal changes over evolutionary time. CDG were able to find very good solutions with rather simplified structure than anticipated. Paper VI focuses on how CDG exploit the underlying architectures during development and build final structure (network morphology). It was shown that during evolution, CDG exploit a larger number of nodes/cells and manage to maintain only a few neutral and static cells/nodes of the final structure...|$|E
