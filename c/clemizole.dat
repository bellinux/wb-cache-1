50|$|Benzimidazoles {{substituted}} with an alkylamine {{at position}} 2 have a venerable history as H1 antihistaminic agents. The standard starting material for many benzimidazoles consists of phenylenediamine, or its derivatives.Reaction of that compound with chloroacetic acid can be rationalized by invoking initial {{formation of the}} chloromethyl amide. Imide formation with the remaining free amino group closes the ring to afford 2-chloromethyl benzimidazole (3). Displacement of halogen with pyrrolidine affords the alkylation product. The proton on the fused imidazole nitrogen is then removed by reaction with sodium hydride. Treatment of the resulting anion with α,4-dichlorotoluene gives the H1 antihistaminic agent <b>clemizole</b> (5).|$|E
40|$|Background. We {{recently}} {{identified a}} compound, <b>clemizole</b> hydrochloride, that inhibits NS 4 B’s RNA binding and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Although significant, clemizole’s antiviral effect is moderate (50 % effective concentration of 8 mM against an HCV genotype 2 a clone). We {{hypothesized that the}} combination of <b>clemizole</b> with other anti-HCV agents can increase the antiviral effect over that achieved with each drug alone and could also decrease the emergence of viral resistance. Methods. Luciferase reporter-linked HCV replication assays were used to study the antiviral effects of drug combinations that included <b>clemizole.</b> Data were analyzed using Loewe additivity and Bliss independence models for synergy, and resistance studies were performed using HCV colony formation assays. Results. Clemizole’s antiviral effect was highly synergistic with the HCV protease inhibitors SCH 503034 and VX 950, without toxicity. In contrast, combinations of <b>clemizole</b> with either interferon, ribavirin, or the nucleoside (NM 283) and nonnucleoside (HCV 796) HCV polymerase inhibitors were additive. Furthermore, combination of <b>clemizole</b> with SCH 503034 decreased the frequency of drug-resistant mutants, compared with treatment with either drug alone. Finally, no cross-resistance to <b>clemizole</b> of SCH 503034 -resistant mutants (or vice versa) was observed. Conclusions. <b>Clemizole</b> can yield high-level synergy with the protease inhibitor class. Inclusion of <b>clemizole</b> in future anti-HCV cocktails can represent an attractive paradigm for increasing current virologic response rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{histamine}} and specific histamine agonists has been examined on isolated longitudinal colon strips of guinea-pig and rat. Histamine and 2 -pyridyl-ethylamine but not 4 methylhistamine produced a concentration-related contractile {{response in the}} guinea-pig colon. The H 1 -antagonist <b>clemizole</b> antagonized competitively the effect of histamine but the H 2 -antagonist ranitidine did not modify the dose-response curve to histamine in the guinea-pig colon. Atropine, hexamethonium, prazosin and propranolol failed to modify the contractile response to histamine. Tone induced with KCl in guinea-pig isolated colon was not modified by histamine agonists even in tissues pretreated with <b>clemizole</b> or ranitidine. Histamine and histamine analogues were without effect on the isolated longitudinal strip of the rat colon. It is concluded that histamine produced dose-dependent contractions of the guinea-pig colon due to direct activation of H 1 -histamine receptors. There is no evidence in favour {{of the existence of}} H 2 -histamine receptors in this preparation. The lack of effect of histamine agonists in rat colon strip argues against the existence of histamine receptors in this preparation...|$|E
40|$|Dravet {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{a catastrophic}} pediatric epilepsy with severe intellectual disability, impaired social development and persistent drug-resistant seizures. One of its primary monogenic causes are mutations in Nav 1. 1 (SCN 1 A), a voltage-gated sodium channel. Here we characterise zebrafish Nav 1. 1 (scn 1 Lab) mutants originally identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen. Mutants exhibit spontaneous abnormal electrographic activity, hyperactivity and convulsive behaviors. Although scn 1 Lab expression is reduced, microarray analysis is remarkable {{for the small}} fraction of differentially expressed genes (~ 3 %) and lack of compensatory expression changes in other scn subunits. Ketogenic diet, diazepam, valproate, potassium bromide and stiripentol attenuate mutant seizure activity; seven other antiepileptic drugs have no effect. A phenotype-based screen of 320 compounds identifies a US Food and Drug Administration-approved compound (<b>clemizole)</b> that inhibits convulsive behaviors and electrographic seizures. This approach represents a new direction in modeling pediatric epilepsy and {{could be used to}} identify novel therapeutics for any monogenic epilepsy disorder. Epilepsy can be acquired {{as a result of an}} insult to the brain or genetic mutation. Among th...|$|E
