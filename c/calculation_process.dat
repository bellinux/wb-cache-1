40|$|Current {{theories}} of mathematical cognition offer competing {{accounts of the}} interplay between encoding and calculation in mental arithmetic. Additive models propose that manipulations of problem format do not interact with the cognitive <b>processes</b> used in <b>calculation.</b> Alternatively, interactive models suppose that format manipulations have a direct effect on <b>calculation</b> <b>processes.</b> In the present study, we tested these competing models by fitting participants' RT distributions in an arithmetic verification task with a single-boundary accumulator model (the shifted Wald distribution). We found {{that in addition to}} providing a more complete description of RT distributions, the accumulator model afforded a potentially more sensitive test of format effects. Specifically, we found that format affected drift rate, which implies that problem format has a direct impact on <b>calculation</b> <b>processes.</b> These data give further support for an interactive model of mental arithmetic...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{deals with}} dynamic voltage and {{frequency}} scaling (DVFS) in mobile multimedia services. The multimedia services that consume {{a large amount of}} energy cannot be continuously used in mobile devices because of battery limitation. The DVFS has been applied to multimedia services in previous studies. However, they have only addressed the issue of power saving and overlooked the fact that mobile multimedia services are sensitive to delays. The proposed method is intended to apply DVFS to multimedia services considering potential delays. Another problem with previous studies is that either separate devices have been employed or appropriate frequency scaling values have been determined through complicated <b>calculation</b> <b>processes</b> to apply DVFS to multimedia services. On the contrary, the proposed method determines appropriate frequency scaling values using the characteristics of multimedia contents without employing any separate devices or undergoing complicated <b>calculation</b> <b>processes.</b> This has the advantage of allowing DVFS to be applied to real-time multimedia content. The present paper proposes a DVFS application method that divides multimedia services into video conferences, which are real-time services, and video streaming, which is a non-real-time service, and that reduces energy consumption in a simple manner while considering the constraints of service delays.|$|R
