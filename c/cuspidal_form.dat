40|$|We {{compute the}} p-adic Abel-Jacobi {{map of the}} product of a Hilbert modular surface and a modular curve at a null-homologous (modified) {{embedding}} of the modular curve in this product, evaluated on differentials associated to a Hilbert <b>cuspidal</b> <b>form</b> f of weight (2, 2) and a <b>cuspidal</b> <b>form</b> of weight 2. We generalize this computation to suitable null-homological cycles in the fibre products of the universal families on the surface and the curve, evaluated at differentials associated to f and g of higher weights. We express the values of the p-adic Abel-Jacobi map at these weights in terms of a p-adic L- function associated to a Hida family of Hilbert modular forms and a Hida family of cuspidal forms. Our function is a Hilbert modular analogue of the p- adic L-function defined by Darmon and Rotger. Comment: We restate an incomplete proof by putting a nonordinarity conditio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is a {{well-known}} theorem, due to J. Shalika and I. Piatetski-Shapiro, independently, that any non-zero <b>cuspidal</b> automorphic <b>form</b> on GLn(A) is generic, i. e. has a non-zero Whittaker-Fourier coefficient.
