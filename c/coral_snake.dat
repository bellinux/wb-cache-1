5|$|Some mimicry is imperfect. Natural {{selection}} drives mimicry only {{far enough}} to deceive predators. For example, when predators avoid a mimic that imperfectly resembles a <b>coral</b> <b>snake,</b> the mimic is sufficiently protected.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to a plethora of native reptile species {{including}} the Western diamondback rattlesnake, Sonoran sidewinder, several other types of rattlesnakes, Sonoran <b>coral</b> <b>snake,</b> dozens of species of non-venomous snakes (including the Sonoran gopher snake and the California kingsnake), the gila monster, desert spiny lizard, several types of whiptail lizards, the chuckwalla, desert horned lizard, Western banded gecko, Sonora mud turtle, and the desert tortoise. Native amphibian species include the Couch's spadefoot toad, Chiricahua leopard frog, and the Sonoran desert toad.|$|E
5|$|Warning signals do not {{necessarily}} require that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators. Mimics such as the nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> species, have essentially piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The evolution of a warning signal by a mimicking species that resembles a species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Emsleyan or Mertensian mimicry {{describes}} unusual {{cases where}} deadly prey mimic a less dangerous species. It was first proposed by Emsley {{as a possible}} answer for the theoretical difficulties a predator species faces when associating an aposematic phenotype of potentially dangerous animals, such as the <b>coral</b> <b>snake,</b> with unprofitability when the predator has {{an increased risk of}} death, negating any learned behaviour. The theory was developed by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler in a chapter of Mimicry in Plants and Animals, who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens. Sheppard points out that Hecht and Marien put forward a similar hypothesis ten years earlier. This scenario is a little more difficult to understand, since in other types of mimicry it is usually the most harmful species that is the model. But if a predator dies, it cannot learn to recognize a warning signal, e.g., bright colours in a certain pattern. In other words, there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning; such an animal is better off being camouflaged, to avoid attacks altogether. If, however, there were some other species that were harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic, the predator could learn to recognize its particular warning colours and avoid such animals. A deadly species could then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism if this reduces the number of attacks. The exception here, ignoring any chance of animals learning by watching a conspecific die (see Jouventin et al. for a discussion of observational learning and mimicry), is the possibility of not having to learn that it is harmful in the first place: instinctive genetic programming to be wary of certain signals. In this case, other organisms could benefit from this programming, and Batesian or Müllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} some species do have an innate recognition of certain aposematic warnings. Hand-reared turquoise-browed motmots (Eumomota superciliosa), avian predators, instinctively avoid snakes with red and yellow rings. Other colours with the same pattern, and even red and yellow stripes with the same width as rings, were tolerated. However, models with red and yellow rings were feared, with the birds flying away and giving alarm calls in some cases. This provides an alternative explanation to Mertensian mimicry. See Greene and McDiarmid for a review of the subject.|$|E

25|$|New World coral snakes possess one of {{the most}} potent venoms of any North American snake. However, {{relatively}} few bites are recorded due to their reclusive nature and the fact they generally inhabit sparsely populated areas. According to the American National Institutes of Health, there are an average of 15–25 <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> bites in the United States each year.|$|E
5|$|Some {{harmless}} {{milk snake}} (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic false <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> (genus Erythrolamprus), and the deadly <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> (genus Micrurus) {{all have a}} red background color with black and white / yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are mimics, whereas the false <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|R

25|$|<b>Coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are not {{aggressive}} or {{prone to}} biting and account {{for less than}} one percent of the number of snake bites each year in the United States. The life span of <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> in captivity is about 7 years.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the normal drab coloration of most reptiles, the lizards of the genus Heloderma (the Gila monster and the beaded lizard) {{and many of the}} coral snakes have high-contrast warning coloration, warning potential predators they are venomous. A number of non-venomous North American snake species have colorful markings {{similar to those of the}} <b>coral</b> <b>snake,</b> an oft cited example of Batesian mimicry.|$|E
25|$|Coral snakes are a {{large group}} of elapid snakes that can be {{subdivided}} into two distinct groups, Old World coral snakes and New World coral snakes. There are 16 species of Old World <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> in three genera (Calliophis, Hemibungarus and Sinomicrurus), and over 65 recognized species of New World coral snakes in three genera (Leptomicrurus, Micruroides, and Micrurus). Genetic studies have found that the most basal lineages are Asian, indicating that the group originated in the Old World.|$|E
25|$|The velvet worm's {{important}} predators {{are primarily}} various spiders and centipedes, along with rodents and birds, such as, in Central America, the clay-coloured thrush (Turdus grayi). In South America, Hemprichi's <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> (Micrurus hemprichii) feeds {{almost exclusively on}} velvet worms. For defence, some species roll themselves reflexively into a spiral, while they can also fight off smaller opponents by ejecting slime. Various mites (Acari) {{are known to be}} ectoparasites infesting the skin of the velvet worm. Skin injuries are usually accompanied by bacterial infections, which are almost always fatal.|$|E
50|$|Sinomicrurus is a genus of venomous elapid snakes, one {{of several}} genera {{commonly}} known as Asian <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> or oriental <b>coral</b> <b>snakes.</b> The genus includes five subtropical species found in Asia. Molecular and morphological analysis suggest this new genus {{is part of the}} family Elapidae.|$|R
25|$|Thus, the Australian {{terrestrial}} elapids are technically 'hydrophiines', {{although they}} are not sea snakes. It is believed that the Laticauda and the 'true sea snakes' evolved separately from Australasian land <b>snakes.</b> Asian cobras, <b>coral</b> <b>snakes,</b> and American <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> also appear to be monophyletic, while African cobras do not.|$|R
25|$|When {{confronted by}} humans, <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> will almost always attempt to flee, and bite {{only as a}} last resort. In addition, <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> have short fangs (proteroglyph dentition) that cannot {{penetrate}} thick leather clothing. Any skin penetration, however, is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. <b>Coral</b> <b>snakes</b> have a powerful neurotoxin that paralyzes the breathing muscles; mechanical or artificial respiration, along with large doses of antivenom, are often required to save a victim's life. There is usually only mild pain associated with a bite, but respiratory failure can occur within hours.|$|R
25|$|There {{is a large}} {{contingent}} of snakes native to the region. Among them include: the rosy boa (Lichanura trivirgata); several sub-species of the glossy snake (Arizona elegans); the Trans-Pecos ratsnake (Bogertophis subocularis); several sub-species of shovel-nosed snakes; several sub-species of kingsnake, including the desert kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula splendida) and the Arizona mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis pyromelana); the Arizona <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> (Micruroides euryxanthus); the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox); the Trans-Pecos copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix pictigaster); the Sonoran sidewinder (Crotalus cerastes cercobombus); the Arizona black rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus cerberus); the western rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis); the Grand Canyon rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus abyssus), found only in Arizona; several sub-species of the ridge-nosed rattlesnake (Crotalus willardi), the most recent rattlesnake species to be discovered in the United States, including the New Mexico ridge-nosed rattlesnake (Crotalus willardi obscurus), and the Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake, the state reptile of Arizona; and the desert massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii).|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself. The most common and effective method is through antivenom (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake. Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent). In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, {{with the exception of}} the <b>coral</b> <b>snake.</b> To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse. The serum is separated and further purified and freeze-dried. It is reconstituted with sterile water and becomes antivenom. For this reason, people who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to antivenom. Antivenom for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.|$|E
