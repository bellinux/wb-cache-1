5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syrup.|$|E

5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} compressed air and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, Monsanto rented {{three floors}} of a {{warehouse}} at 601 East Third Street from General Electric. Initially {{it was used}} to receive and store equipment used by the Project. Later the fourth floor was used as office space, and a laboratory was established on the fifth floor where studies were carried out on the effects of polonium on laboratory animals. Analysis of bioassay samples was carried out there to minimize the danger of polonium <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> samples.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} he was {{assigned}} to the Manhattan Project, and moved with his family to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory's Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, Captain William S. Parsons. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a gun-type nuclear weapon known as Thin Man. This proved to be impractical due to <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor-bred plutonium with plutonium-240, and in February 1944, the Division switched its attention {{to the development of the}} Little Boy, a smaller device using uranium-235. Birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full-scale mock-ups of the device.|$|E
40|$|Ti- 6 Al- 4 V {{is due to}} {{its high}} strength-density ratio a {{commonly}} used alloy in aerospace industry applications.

5|$|Neptunium-237 is {{the most}} mobile {{actinide}} in the deep geological repository environment.

5|$|Chadwick {{was himself}} {{a critic of}} Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E

The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. She responds to a group asking for help on the radio. It turns out that they are bandits who first attempt to rape her and then have her killed by infected dogs, only for her to unleash them unto her captors. On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in Alaska.|$|E

5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Project A119 remained largely secret until the mid-1990s, when writer Keay Davidson discovered the story while researching {{the life of}} Carl Sagan for a biography. Sagan's involvement with the project was apparent from his application for an academic scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley's Miller Institute in 1959. In the application, Sagan gave details of the project research, which Davidson felt constituted a violation of national security. The leak consisted of Sagan revealing the titles of two classified papers from the A119 project—the 1958 paper Possible Contribution of Lunar Nuclear Weapons Detonations to the Solution of Some Problems in Planetary Astronomy, and the 1959 paper Radiological <b>Contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon by Nuclear Weapons Detonations. A 1958 paper titled Cosmic Radiation and Lunar Radioactivity, credited to I. Filosofo, was also named by Sagan in a 1961 paper written for the United States National Research Council. These were among the eight reports created by the project, {{all of which were}} destroyed in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E
