50|$|Authorities say Figueroa-Agosto, {{worked as}} a drug-boat driver until 1993, when he carried out a hit on a truck driver who {{allegedly}} stole a shipment of Colombian cocaine. Puerto Rican courts convicted him of the murder and sentenced him to 209 years in prison. But in 1999, {{he walked out of}} the prison's front gates after presenting the guards with a falsified release order. He was on the run for the next 11 years, leading his criminal organization while living what U.S. Marshals described as a luxury lifestyle in both the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. He allegedly bought homes and cars under false identities. At one point, Figueroa-Agosto — or a man claiming to be him — called a popular Dominican morning radio show and offered an $800,000 reward for the murder of either of the <b>country's</b> two top <b>police</b> <b>officials.</b>|$|R

40|$|D. Ed. The {{research}} {{nature of}} this study was primarily explorative, and also descriptive. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore and describe community experiences of aggressive behaviour exhibited by <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> towards them. This research was of a qualitative nature. Four steps of psycho-educational programme development were followed. In the first step a situational analysis was carried out. The sampling component was purposively selected <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> working under the jurisdiction of specific police stations in Gauteng Province and community members as victims of aggression at the hands of <b>police</b> <b>officials.</b> Data gathering methods used in this research were phenomenological individual and focus group interviews and observations. The researcher conducted the observation for this study during interviews and field notes were written during interview process. The researcher conducted interviews with victims of aggressive behaviour by <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> and other participants were <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> and stakeholders who are dealing with inappropriate behaviour of <b>police</b> <b>officials.</b> The participants had to comment on their experiences of aggression exhibited by <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> and other participants who are <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> in the South African Police Service talk about their experiences when they were involved in aggressive action towards the community. These interviews formed the basis of this study to facilitate the attainment of the primary objective, which was to explore and describe the experience of aggression behaviour exhibited by <b>Police</b> <b>officials</b> towards the community. The data from these interviews were analysed using an open coding method. An independent coder did an analysis independent from the researcher. A consensus validation discussion was held with the independent coder on the codification of the data. The detailed discussion of results obtained from the interviews and observations were presented in verbatim quotes, descriptive and reflective notes and the illustration of emergent themes and categories. Rigour and adequacy were ensured by data collected and the results obtained from data analysis indicated convergence and saturation. The integration of trustworthiness, that is, credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability were applied throughout the study. Ethical considerations and consent letters were presented to the participants, including preserving of anonymity, confidentiality, voluntary participation, understood consent and the ethical role of the researcher has adhered to. The research is very important as the experiences of aggression by community members were explored and described. The research results indicated that there is tension among the community and <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> in the South African Police Service. The <b>Police</b> <b>officials</b> under study are demoralised and tend to become negative towards the public because they are of the opinion that enough is not done to support them in performing their difficult duties. It is evident from the results that there is lack of effective communication stakeholders who are dealing with inappropriate behaviour in the South African Police Service with other structures like the Independent Complaints Directorate. In step two the psycho-educational programme was developed. Firstly a conceptual framework was derived from the result of step one. The conceptual framework served as framework of reference for the description of a psycho-educational programme. In step three the programme was implemented and in step four the programme was evaluated. In conclusion, it is evident that aggression really exists in the workplace and officials are affected by such aggression. The recommendations of dealing with aggressive behaviour exhibited by <b>police</b> <b>officials</b> towards the community was done in line with the situational analysis after the conclusion drawn from the findings and were described in a psycho-educational perspective...|$|R
