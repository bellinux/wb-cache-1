50|$|Approximately 75 {{per cent}} of Setiu {{district}} is wetland areas, which mainly consists Chalok River basin, Bari River basin, and Merang River basin that converge {{and form a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>lagoon.</b> These areas start from the coastal lowland plains of the South China Sea in the east to the hilly areas in western Setiu, that includes Mount Tebu. Setiu Wetlands itself is 26 kilometres long and 1.5 kilometres at its widest section.|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{simulation}} {{was carried out}} using BioWin 3. 1 to test the capability of the software to predict the biogas potential for two different anaerobic systems. The two scenarios included: (1) a laboratory-scale batch reactor; and (2) an industrial-scale anaerobic <b>continuous</b> <b>lagoon</b> digester. The measured data related to the operating conditions, the reactor design parameters and the chemical properties of influent wastewater were entered into BioWin. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify {{the sensitivity of the}} most important default parameters in the software’s models. BioWin was then calibrated by matching the predicted data with measured data and used to simulate other parameters that were unmeasured or deemed uncertain. In addition, statistical analyses were carried out using evaluation indices, such as the coefficient of determination (R-squared), the correlation coefficient (r) and its significance (p-value), the general standard deviation (SD) and the Willmott index of agreement, to evaluate the agreement between the software prediction and the measured data. The results have shown that after calibration, BioWin can be used reliably to simulate both small-scale batch reactors and industrial-scale digesters with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10 % and very good values of the indexes. Furthermore, by changing the default parameters in BioWin, which is a way of calibrating the models in the software, as well, this may provide information about the performance of the digester. Furthermore, {{the results of this study}} showed there may be an over estimation for biogas generated from industrial-scale digesters. More sophisticated analytical devices may be required for reliable measurements of biogas quality and quantity...|$|E
40|$|Spatially {{explicit}} {{ecological modelling}} {{was used to}} predict the distribution of 4 benthic components (live coral, carbonate sand, macroalgae and dead coral) inside the Aldabra lagoon, southern Seychelles, western Indian Ocean. Both classic ordinary least-squares and spatial autoregression techniques were carried out on a field data set of 774 spatially referenced records and 3 satellite remote sensing images to define an empirical relationship between local environmental conditions (water depth and water level variation) and benthic cover. This relationship was then used to generate a synoptic model of the spatial cover and distribution of each benthic component at the landscape (i. e. whole lagoon) scale. Environmental conditions were estimated from satellite remote sensing data (water depth) and using GIS techniques (water level variation). By drawing on species−environment relationships applicable to many <b>lagoons,</b> <b>continuous</b> records of percentage benthic cover were derived for the extensive lagoon (174 km 2) at a high measurement level (ratio) for use in conservation and resource management applications. The transition from the ordinary least-squares model to the spatially lagged model {{was accompanied by a}} marked growth in predictive power (R 2 = 0. 25 to 0. 79), indicating that neighbourhood context interactions {{play an important role in}} determining benthic cover of the Aldabra lagoon...|$|R
40|$|Climate change impacts the {{hydrological}} cycle. The {{intensity of}} extreme precipitation events and droughts {{is expected to}} increase, creating stress {{on the water and}} wastewater infrastructure. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the potential impacts of climate change on the existing water and wastewater treatment infrastructure in rural Eastern Ontario. In total, 13 municipal WTPs and 28 municipal wastewater treatment systems in the Eastern Ontario region were investigated. These facilities were characterized using existing data, questionnaires, and sites visits. On the basis of this information, potential impacts of climate change were identified. One conclusion of this analysis was the potential need to convert lagoon systems to mechanized WWTPs. Such a conversion would represent a significant financial burden for a small community. Therefore, a cost-estimation methodology was developed, based on the existing CAPDET software. Dry periods, heavy rain events, heavy spring runoff and increased temperatures are the critical climate change phenomena that are expected to have the greatest impact on the water infrastructure of the study area. It was found that WTPs on the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River are not likely to exhibit water shortages, but those using smaller surface water sources are more vulnerable to water scarcity. Furthermore, this vulnerability to water scarcity will be exacerbated by and increase in water demand resulting from higher temperatures and more severe droughts. Turbidity events typically occur during periods of heavy runoff, and it is expected that climate change will increase the intensity of heavy runoff events. Taste and odor problems due to algal growth during spring and summer are an existing concern for at least five facilities in the study area. It is expected that this phenomenon will increase as a consequence of increased temperatures, increased evaporation rates and longer dry periods during the spring, summer and fall. Inflow and infiltration into the sewer system during spring runoff and rain events are typical problems in the study area, resulting in high peak flows at wastewater treatment facilities. Currently, certain WWTPs in the study area use bypass as a method to cope with extreme peak flows. It is expected that climate change will increase the intensity of spring runoff, and the intensity and frequency of rain events. Consequently, it is likely that there will be an increase in the frequency of bypass events, and an increase in the volume of bypassed wastewater. In lagoon systems, intensified rain events will further swell the normal wastewater flow to several times the dry weather flow, likely causing incomplete treatment of the wastewater particularly at <b>continuous</b> discharge <b>lagoons.</b> During dry periods and warm weather, algal growth in lagoon systems will likely increase. The discharge of effluent containing high quantities of algae will degrade the receiving waters quality. An increased frequency and intensity of periods of low streamflows will reduce the dilution capacity of receiving waters, particularly in small streams. This increased vulnerability may eventually be reflected in more stringent discharge criteria. A reduction in streamflows could also lead to more extensive algal growth, resulting in more turbidity, more taste and odor problems and possibly algal toxins contaminations...|$|R
