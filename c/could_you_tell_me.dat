5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped {{almost as if he}} was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never thought}} of {{anything}} but what you {{could do to help}} me; and I was so troublesome. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not true!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "It is not true. Oh, Dr. von Horn how <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> such a {{cruel and}} terrible untruth." ...|$|E
6000|$|A young bee {{crawled up}} the greasy trampled alighting-board. [...] "Excuse me," [...] she began, [...] "but it's my first honey-flight. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> kindly <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{if this is}} my--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{a patron}} here {{who has never}} deceived, and who will never desert me; I want no other; and that's myself. Now here comes a party: <b>could</b> <b>you</b> just <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{the name of that}} tall lady now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I am glad; why <b>could</b> <b>you</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> before? Cousin George {{disposed}} of and Mr. Fraser coming back. Why, {{things are looking}} quite bright again; at least they would be if only Arthur were here," [...] and her rejoicing ended in a sigh.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing, {{nothing to}} say, except only good-bye. What <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I have not told myself {{over and over}} again? Reason's gone. Thinking's gone. Now I am only sure.' She smiled shadowily. 'What peace did HE find who couldn't, perhaps, like you, face the last good-bye?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. Probably with a chisel. Probably the man {{knocked the}} pane {{out with one}} blow, then removed all the glass {{so as to make}} it look like the work of an old hand. Very good idea, but amateurish. I am told that three cups have been taken. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how long they had been in the Pavilion?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to trouble you," [...] said he, in his blandest manner, to the young woman behind the grating; [...] "there is some small mistake about a {{telegram}} I sent yesterday. I have had no answer, and I very much fear that I must have omitted to put my name at the end. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> if this was so?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabinovich calls Pamyat headquarters, {{speaking}} with a characteristic accent: [...] "Tell me, {{is it true}} that Jews sold out Russia?" [...] / [...] "Yes, of course it's true, Kike-schnabel!" [...] / [...] "Oh good! <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where I should go to get my share?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} been talking of my faults," [...] said Florida, {{breathing}} quickly. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of them to my face." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here Alice {{ventured to}} {{interrupt}} him. 'If it's VERY long,' she said, as politely as she <b>could,</b> 'would <b>you</b> please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> first which road--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Hetty, roused by this {{question}} to exert more self-command, and feeling {{the better for}} the food she had taken. [...] "I've come a good long way, and it's very tiring. But I'm better now. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{which way to go}} to this place?" [...] Here Hetty took from her pocket a bit of paper: {{it was the end of}} Arthur's letter on which he had written his address.|$|E
6000|$|... is very noticeable: {{no person}} could have hit upon that union of images without being possessed of true poetic feeling. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{anything}} of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu {{more than is}} {{to be learned from}} Pope's letters and her own? She seems to have been destined for something much higher and better than she became. A parallel between her genius and character and that of Lady Winchelsea her contemporary (though somewhat prior to her) would be well worth drawing.|$|E
6000|$|Colonel Carrington {{regarded}} {{us as if}} we were strangers, as with {{a pitiful}} courtesy some raised their hats to him. He attempted with one hand to strike a match and dropped it, and after Lyle ignited another and held it to his cigar he nodded cordially. [...] "I thank you, sir," [...] he said with an entire absence of recognition. [...] "I am not quite as strong as I used to be. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how far it is to Lone Hollow? I seem to have forgotten the way, and the snow is soft and heavy." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Antonio, who, {{with all}} his faults, was no coward, and was {{moreover}} a very civil-spoken lad, took off his hat, and said: 'Good-day, sir; I hope you are pretty well. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> kindly <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how far it is from here {{to the place where}} I wish to go?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton {{seemed a}} trifle bewildered. [...] "When you can I'll listen, but there's nothing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{would make any}} {{difference}} between you and me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You said, {{speaking}} for your friend, that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{how to do}} something useful and good. Something {{that you would like}} done, is it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Frank," [...] now {{cried the}} {{restored}} friend, cordially {{stepping out of}} the ring, with regained self-possession regaining lost identity, [...] "My dear Frank, what a funny man you are; full of fun as an egg of meat. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that absurd story of your being in need? But I relish a good joke too well to spoil it by letting on. Of course, I humored the thing; and, on my side, put on all the cruel airs you would have me. Come, this little episode of fictitious estrangement will but enhance the delightful reality. Let us sit down again, and finish our bottle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it can be}} proved," [...] said he at last, [...] "that I have a {{just and}} honest right to this, as God well knows I always deemed I had; if this salary or stipend be really my due, I am not less anxious than another to retain it. I have the {{well-being}} of my child to look to. I am too old to miss without some pain the comforts to which I have been used; and I am, as others are, anxious {{to prove to the}} world that I have been right, and to uphold the place I have held; but I cannot do it at such a cost as this. I cannot bear this. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to do so?" [...] And he appealed, almost in tears, to the bishop, who had left his chair, and was now leaning on the warden's arm as he stood on the further side of the table facing the archdeacon. [...] "Could you tell me to sit there at ease, indifferent, and satisfied, while such things as these are said loudly of me in the world?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the {{right-hand}} pavement--she must be {{almost out of}} sight now." [...] Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her brother's arm, walking slowly down the street. She saw them both looking back at her. [...] "Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe," [...] she impatiently cried; [...] "it is Miss Tilney; it is indeed. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> they were gone? Stop, stop, I will get out this moment and go to them." [...] But to what purpose did she speak? Thorpe only lashed his horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who had soon ceased to look after her, were in a moment out of sight round the corner of Laura Place, and in another moment she was herself whisked into the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of another street, she entreated him to stop. [...] "Pray, pray stop, Mr. Thorpe. I cannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss Tilney." [...] But Mr. Thorpe only laughed, smacked his whip, encouraged his horse, made odd noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as she was, having no power of getting away, was obliged {{to give up the}} point and submit. Her reproaches, however, were not spared. [...] "How could you deceive me so, Mr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road? I would not have had it happen so for the world. They must think it so strange, so rude of me! To go by them, too, without saying a word! You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor in anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now, and walk back to them. How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton?" [...] Thorpe defended himself very stoutly, declared he had never seen two men so much alike in his life, and would hardly give up the point of its having been Tilney himself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Has that Copperfield no tongue?' muttered Uriah, 'I {{would do}} {{a good deal for}} <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> without lying, that {{somebody}} had cut it out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a {{plant in}} this country whose leaves the Indians believe are efficacious in {{stopping}} blood," [...] he said. [...] "I wonder if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where to find it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> Mrs Bhaer's age and birthplace, date of marriage, {{and number}} of children, I should be much obliged,' {{continued}} the unabashed visitor as he tripped over the door-mat.|$|R
5000|$|Post-Soviet Russia. Rabinovich {{calls the}} Pamyat headquarters: [...] "Is {{it true that}} we Jews sold out Mother Russia?" [...] "Damn right, you filthy kike!" [...] "Oh good. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where I might get my share?" ...|$|E

5000|$|In early 2014, {{during the}} U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama's state visit to China, Kong alleged on his Sina Weibo account that Michelle Obama was {{successfully}} confronted and rebuked by a Peking University student while {{giving a speech}} supporting free speech. The student supposedly asked Michelle Obama, [...] "is America’s strength {{a result of the}} U.S. secret services listening to the voices of its citizens? <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> in America what the difference is between ‘listening to’ and ‘listening in’?” in a reference to the NSA spying scandal. Kong further described Michelle Obama's response as “dumbfounded by the question, Michelle Obama eventually replied that she was not there to talk about politics." [...] After Kong had made his allegations, reporters and students present at Michelle Obama's speech denied that the confrontation took place. Kong was subsequently widely panned for having fabricated the entire story, which critics have noted can subject him to arrest under the same criteria with which the police had arrested hundreds of people accused of spreading rumors online in mid-2013. In response, Kong simply called the critics [...] "dogs of America" [...] and [...] "traitors to China." ...|$|E
