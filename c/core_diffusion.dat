In order to correct the BP absorption cross sections in whole <b>core</b> <b>diffusion</b> calculations, energy spectrum reconstruction (ESR) methods {{have been developed to}} reconstruct the fine group spectrum (and in-core continuous energy spectrum).

40|$|One of {{the design}} basis {{accidents}} for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), a high temperature gas-cooled reactor, is air ingress subsequent to a pipe break. Following a postulated double-ended guillotine break in the hot duct, and the subsequent depressurization to nearly reactor cavity pressure levels, air present in the reactor cavity will enter the reactor vessel via density-gradient-driven-stratified flow. Because of the significantly higher molecular weight and lower initial temperature of the reactor cavity air-helium mixture, {{in contrast to the}} helium in the reactor vessel, the air-helium mixture in the cavity always has a larger density than the helium discharging from the reactor vessel through the break into the reactor cavity. In the later stages of the helium blowdown, the momentum of the helium flow decreases sufficiently for the heavier cavity air-helium mixture to intrude into the reactor vessel lower plenum through the lower portion of the break. Once it has entered, the heavier gas will pool {{at the bottom of the}} lower plenum. From there it will move upwards into the <b>core</b> via <b>diffusion</b> and density-gradient effects that stem from heating the air-helium mixture and from the pressure differences between the reactor cavity and the reactor vessel. This scenario (considering density-gradient-driven stratified flow) is considerably different from the heretofore commonly used scenario that attributes movement of air into the reactor vessel and from thence to the <b>core</b> region via <b>diffusion.</b> When density-gradient-driven stratified flow is considered as a contributing phenomena for air ingress into the reactor vessel, the following factors contribute to a much earlier natural circulation-phase in the reactor vessel: (a) density-gradient-driven stratified flow is a much more rapid mechanism (at least one order of magnitude) for moving air into the reactor vessel lower plenum than diffusion, and consequently, (b) the diffusion dominated phase begins with a much larger flow area and a much shorter distance for air to move into the core than earlier scenarios that attribute all air ingress from the reactor cavity into the <b>core</b> to <b>diffusion</b> only. Hence, consideration of the density-gradient-driven stratified flow phenomena will likely lead to more rapid air ingress into the core and also the presence of more air for core graphite oxidation than the widely-used air ingress attributed solely to diffusion. This paper discusses the density-gradient-driven stratified flow phenomena and the implications of considering this behavior on the progression of the air ingress event. Preliminary calculations are used to underline the importance of considering the density-gradient driven stratified flow phenomena in subsequent validation experiments and software development for analyzing VHTR scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Modified Sine-Gordon {{equation}} is established {{to investigate the}} kink soliton motion affected by core impurities. The dragging force that the core impurities exert on the moving kink soliton is determined by computer simulation of diffusing of solute atoms in dislocation core. The soliton motion can be dissolves into two kinds of movement: the changing of soliton position and soliton shape. These two kinds of movements correspond to the longitude core diffusion(LCD) and transverse core diffusion(TCD) of solute atoms respectively. We solve the equation of these motions numerically, temperature internal friction peak and stress amplitude internal friction peak are discussed. The results are compared with the anomalous interrial friction peaks in AI-Mg,AI-CU alloy.

The loss maxi-mum at about 450 K (f ~ 1 Hz), especially its "low " activation enthalpy of H = 1. 14 eV, can be explained by our dislocation model described in the companion paper (Part I), which considers the enhanced transverse diffusivity of solute atoms {{in the vicinity of the}} dislocation core. The model is also shown to be in agreement with published ata on AI-Si, AI-Mg, Cu-Si and Cu-A 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{ultrahigh}} specific {{lithium ion}} storage capacity of Si nanowires (SiNWs) {{has been demonstrated}} recently and has opened up exciting opportunities for energy storage. However, a systematic theoretical study on lithium insertion in SiNWs remains a challenge, and as a result, understanding of the fundamental interaction and microscopic dynamics during lithium insertion is still lacking. This paper focuses {{on the study of}} single Li atom insertion into SiNWs with different sizes and axis orientations by using full ab initio calculations. We show that the binding energy of interstitial Li increases as the SiNW diameter grows. The binding energies at different insertion sites, which can be classified as surface, intermediate, and core sites, are quite different. We find that surface sites are energetically the most favorable insertion positions and that intermediate sites are the most unfavorable insertion positions. Compared with the other growth directions, the [110] SiNWs with different diameters always present the highest binding energies on various insertion locations, which indicates that [110] SiNWs are more favorable by Li doping. Furthermore, we study Li diffusion inside SiNWs. The results show that the Li surface diffusion has a much higher chance to occur than the surface to <b>core</b> <b>diffusion,</b> which is consistent with the experimental observation that the Li insertion in SiNWs is layer by layer from surface to inner region.
