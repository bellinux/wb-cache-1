50|$|However, as {{he covered}} his tracks very easily, {{he was able}} to conceal what was happening, leading each of the {{characters}} to believe they were imagining the situation. When Ellie confided in Sia that Lewis had attempted to attack her in the Hollins' kitchen with a carving knife, she informed Karen's colleague, Dr. Simon Bond (David Sturzaker), and later went round to the Hollins' house to inform Lewis that she would be telling the police about his actions. However, Lewis denied his attack, and as there was no evidence and Ellie would not talk to the police, nothing could be done. However, she did not act on this. Meanwhile, Rob Hollins informed his son that the police would be keeping an eye on Lewis, as his name had been mentioned too many times for them to be comfortable. The storyline culminated when Imogen then realised that her art project, containing photos of each of the victims of gun crime in the last year was tampered with, with the addition of photos of Jack, Sia and Ellie.

Jack is {{reluctant}} to let Charlie spend time with Matthew as Matthew does not know him. However, Max convinces him otherwise. Unbeknownst to Jack, Max and Charlie are secretly plotting against him. When Dot lets Jack know of Charlie's plan to return to Ireland with Matthew, Jack is infuriated. He declares that Charlie will never get custody of Matthew as this would mean breaking his promise to Ronnie. When Charlie says that Ronnie got what she deserved, Jack punches Charlie, only to be stopped by Max who tells Jack he may have lost his chances of keeping Matthew. Max is later disappointed when he learns from Jack's solicitor that Jack still has a strong chance of keeping Matthew, despite his fight with Charlie. Max visits Charlie and later, Jack is arrested for assaulting Charlie, though unbeknownst to Jack, Max has attacked Charlie to make his injuries worse and allowed Jack to take the blame. However, the charges against Jack are dropped. Charlie's wife, Liz Cotton, speaks to Jack and Jack realises what is best for Matthew and gives Charlie residence of Matthew.

Ralph Linderman, middle-aged, long divorced, and a loner, self-righteous and judgmental, lives nearby and works odd hours as a {{security}} guard. Their worlds intersect briefly when Ralph finds John's wallet {{in the street and}} returns it in person. A second intersection develops more slowly, at first without direct <b>contact.</b> <b>Jack</b> chats with a coffee shop waitress, Elsie Tyler, a pretty 20-year-old blond from a small town in upstate New York. Ralph has already noticed Elsie in the neighborhood and made a nuisance of himself warning her about the dangers of life in the city, the wrong friends who will introduce her to drugs, casual sex, and prostitution. Jack simply notices how Elsie waves off Ralph's counsel, but Ralph views Jack's friendship with Elsie as immoral behavior that is destroying her innocence. He sees, repeatedly yet almost accidentally as he walks his dog, Jack and Elsie (and sometimes Natalia or another female friend) coming or going from the Sutherlands' apartment at odd hours, interprets their interactions in the most negative light, and writes Jack letters warning him against corrupting Elsie. The Sutherlands both become friendly with Elsie and draw her into their circle of friends, get her invited to adult parties, and help launch her career as a fashion photography model. Ralph, by contrast, tries to monitor Elsie's social life by tracking her movements when she changes apartments.|$|E

5000|$|In January 2017, Ronnie and Roxy die on {{the night}} of Ronnie's wedding to Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). Ronnie and Roxy's mother Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) convinces Dot not to inform Charlie of Ronnie's death, but Dot still expects him to attend their {{funerals}} and to take custody of Matthew. However Charlie does not attend. Four months later, Max decides to call Charlie, claiming that he believes Jack is struggling to cope with three children, including one that is not his own. When Matthew goes missing, Max tells him he is at Dot's home, and when Jack goes there, Charlie answers the door, saying he wants to talk about his son. A few days later, Charlie reveals to Dot that he has remarried a woman called Liz (Michelle Connolly) and has been living in Ireland. Max convinces Jack to allow Charlie to spend time with Matthew who reluctantly agrees. He later agrees that Charlie has helped but he still doesn't trust him. Later, Max tells Charlie he has a proposition for him. Charlie tells Dot that he has spoken to a solicitor about getting legal custody of Matthew, but Dot thinks he is being selfish as Matthew knows Jack. After Jack invites Dot on a family holiday, she tells him that Charlie wants custody of Matthew, so Jack confronts Charlie saying he promised never to leave his children, including Matthew, while Max watches. Jack and Charlie have a confrontation in which Jack punches Charlie when he says Ronnie deserved to die. Jack's solicitor tells Jack that the fight should not affect the case as Charlie goaded him, so Max visits Charlie and assaults him to make it seem that Jack's attack was worse than it was. Jack is arrested and charged with assault. Dot attempts to get Jack and Charlie to make amends for Matthews, but Charlie insists that he will take Matthew back to Ireland, despite Dot asking him to stay in Walford. Later, Charlie watches Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton) in the park with Jack's children and talks to Matthew. Honey tells him that Jack is a good father who gives the children security, love and comfort, and never puts himself first, and that Charlie's return is damaging the children, so Charlie tells Jack that he is no longer applying for residence of Matthew. However, Jack still thinks he will lose Matthew and hires someone to make Charlie [...] "disappear", but Max tells him to cancel it as he could lose everything. Liz later comes to Walford and meets Jack, explaining that Matthew would have a good life living with her and Charlie. After talking to Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), Jack decides to let Charlie have custody of Matthew. Charlie promises {{to keep in touch with}} Jack but Max later meets up with him and gives him money to stay away from Walford and never <b>contact</b> <b>Jack</b> again, threatening him with more violence if he backs out.

5000|$|After {{realising}} {{the love}} that Ronnie and Roxy have for each other, Jack invites Max to his wedding. Max attends and Roxy slips her bedroom key into his pocket. After the ceremony, Max comes to Roxy's bedroom to sleep with her but he waits because Roxy goes {{to spend time with}} Ronnie. Max finds cocaine in Roxy's handbag, he waits for Roxy in her room, unaware that Ronnie and Roxy have both drowned in the hotel swimming pool. The next day, Max is shocked to hear they are dead and, with the police, informs Jack. Max disposes of Roxy's cocaine so the police will not find it. Max supports Jack and his mother-in-law Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) as they struggle to cope with their loss and to look after his children, Amy Mitchell (Abbie Knowles), Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles), and Ronnie's son, Matthew Mitchell-Cotton, whose father is Charlie Cotton. At Ronnie and Roxy's funeral, Max tells Stacey that he found drugs in Roxy's handbag and begs her to not tell anyone. When a bus crashes into the market, Max organises the rescue of Stacey's husband, Martin Fowler (James Bye), from under the bus and is hailed a hero. Later, Max meets the chairman (Simon Williams) of a company called Weyland & Co, and they share a cryptic conversation in which the man talks about the development of Walford, to which Max says that the pub is next on his list. Two weeks later, Glenda confronts Max, suspecting that he is planning something, and warns him that Jack will soon find out. Later, it is revealed that Max works for Weyland & Co, and they are planning to redevelop the Albert Square area. Lauren meets Max's boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), and they are attracted to each other, so she decides to apply for a job at Weyland & Co, despite Max telling her not to. Max tells Josh not to employ her but Josh does so anyway, warning Max that he is in charge and to stop challenging him. Max then convinces Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) to sell the freehold to a company called Grafton Hill. Worried about Jack attempting to raise three children, one of them not his own, Max calls Charlie, who returns to Walford and tells Jack they need to talk about Matthew. Hostilities begin to emerge between Jack and Charlie, who eventually insists he is going to seek custody of Matthew. When discussing the matter in public, Charlie starts a fight with Jack, who punches Charlie aside. Max later visits Charlie when discovering the incident likely will not influence the legal case over Matthew, revealing their secret scheming, and says they have to take further actions; soon after, the police find Jack and arrest him for assault as Max watches. Max takes care of the children whilst Jack remains at the police station, where he is then accused of badly hurting Charlie, who allowed Max to purposely attack and injure him to frame Jack for serious assault. The charges against Jack are dropped, and Charlie attempts to settle for residence of Matthew and plans to move to Ireland with him, so Max threatens violence against him. After Jack voluntarily gives Charlie residence of Matthew, Max warns Charlie that he is not doing enough. Max gives him cash as a reward for his assistance and takes his mobile phone, telling him not to <b>contact</b> <b>Jack</b> again, threatening him with violence if he refuses. Charlie agrees and Max smashes Charlie's phone. Max later seemingly shows an interest in Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford). On their first date, however, he looks at her files from the council and reveals his self-harm habit to her. When Ian and Jane plan to sell the chippy, they are shocked to discover the buyer is Weyland & Co. Ian pulls out of the deal, fearing Max's motives. However, Max convinces Ian that he does not have any ulterior motives and he just wants to move on. Max and Carmel agree to resume their relationship without making it public. Max is surprised to hear that Lauren and her boyfriend Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) are engaged, despite Steven lying to Lauren that he has a brain tumour. Lauren leaves a message on Max's voicemail, requesting him to refuse Steven when he asks him for permission to marry her. However, Max deliberately gives his permission straightaway. On Max and Carmel's second date, they go to a hotel room and sleep together. However, Max leaves Carmel before she wakes up and is seen going home to a wealthy house, despite telling people that he lives in a bedsit. There, it is also revealed that he is in a relationship with Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner) who works for Grafton Hill which is the company Max convinced the Carters to sell the Vic freehold to.|$|E
