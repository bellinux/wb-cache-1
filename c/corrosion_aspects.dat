Nevertheless {{it is important}} to take them into account adequately. In this chapter we consider the following items: structural metallic material corrosion in high temperature conditions; graphite corrosion (mainly oxidation) behaviour in high temperature environments; the corrosion of the PBMR spent fuel tank in severely corrosive environments; the interaction between UO 2 and C layer into the CP.

Accordingly long term immersion and electrochemical corrosion tests were conducted on stainless steel 304 L, 316 L, 2205 and 6 % Mo and mild steel in peroxide solutions of pH 10. The materials were tested for uniform corrosion, pitting and crevice corrosion and attack around the weld area. Corrosion attack estimated from long term immersion tests is found in agreement, by and large, with that analyzed from electrochemical test.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of employing a flowing, high-temperature, pure fluorine/UF 6 regeneration system to efficiently convert a large {{fraction of the}} effluent plasma exhaust back to pure UF 6 was demonstrated. The custom built T. O. F. mass spectrometer sampling system permitted on-line measurements of the UF 6 concentration at different locations in the exhaust system. Negligible amounts (100 ppm) of UF 6 were detected in the axial bypass exhaust duct and the exhaust ducts downstream of the cryogenic trap system used to collect the UF 6, thus verifying the overall system efficiency over a range of operating conditions. Use of a porous Monel duct {{as part of the}} exhaust duct system, including provision for injection of pure fluorine, provided a viable technique to eliminate uranium compound residue on the inside surface of the exhaust ducts. Typical uranium compound mass deposition per unit area of duct was 2 micron g/sq cm. This porous duct technique is directly applicable to future uranium compound transfer exhaust systems. Throughout these experiments, additional basic data on the <b>corrosion</b> <b>aspects</b> of hot, pressurized UF 6 /fluorine were also accumulated...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{significant}} improvements {{in the understanding of}} pitting <b>corrosion,</b> many <b>aspects</b> of this phenomenon remain unclear and corrosion rate prediction based on experimental data remains difficult. Experimental measurements of corrosion rates under different electrochemical conditions can be complex and time consuming, and the conclusions are limited to the timescale and the conditions in which experiments have been carried out. In order to overcome these limitations, numerical approaches can be a valuable complement. Hence, in this study a new numerical model based on peridynamics to predict pitting corrosion damage is developed. The developed model is implemented in a commercial finite element software and it allows for the reproduction of realistic pitting morphologies, modelling of microstructural effects such as the presence of intermetallic particles and the reduction of the computational cost of the simulations. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} shows that the peridynamic models can be helpful in failure analysis and design of new corrosion-resistant material...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{corrosion}} {{distress and}} failures in post-tensioned tendons {{has been found}} in two major bridges in the State of Florida. Corrosion distress and complete tendon failure has been identified in horizontally oriented tendons that support pre-cast bridge superstructure box segments. In virtually all instances, the observed corrosion has been associated with the presence of grout voids and visual evidence of grout bleed water having been present for indeterminate periods of time. With few exceptions, corrosion induced strand failures have occurred in the immediate vicinity of the anchorage. The anchorage systems in both bridges utilize a proprietary multi-plane anchorage (housing) comprised of ductile cast iron and forged steel wedge plate. The presence of these metals coupled with high strength strands gives rise to concerns relative to galvanic corrosion thus prompting this preliminary investigation focusing on dissimilar metals corrosion. The investigation involves laboratory tests that examine the <b>corrosion</b> <b>aspects</b> of grout bleed water and re-charge water in contact with dissimilar metals comprising the tendon and anchorage system. The preliminary results indicate that the high strength post-tensioned strands are mostly anodic to the anchorage system when exposed to either grout bleed water or recharge water such as that which may be experienced through leakage. The preliminary findings of the investigation are presented along with the implications on existing structures and on future design and materials selection for post-tensioning systems...|$|E
40|$|It is {{an undeniable}} fact that {{concrete}} {{is the most}} widely used man-made construction material in the world today, and will remain so for decades to come. The popularity of concrete is largely due to the abundance of raw material, low manufacturing and maintenance cost, excellence in compression, and <b>corrosion</b> <b>aspects,</b> durability to weathering and fire hazards, versatility in forming various shapes and its unlimited structural applications in combination with steel reinforcement. However, the cement industry is also highly energy intensive, and the emission of carbon dioxide during cement manufacturing has created enormous environmental concerns. There has also been {{an increase in the number}} of incidents where concrete structures experienced severe deterioration in extreme environments. All these factors have contributed pressures from various quarters to reduce cement consumption, and to intensify research in exploring the possibilities of enhancing strength, durability and corrosion reduction through the use of pozzolans as supplementary cementing materials. The utilization of calcined clay in the form of metakaolin as a pozzolan for concrete has received considerable interest in recent years. The use of metakaolin as a mineral admixture for concrete is a well documented practice. Metakaolin is a quality enhancing pozzolan for concrete.

40|$|AbstractSteam {{generator}} (SG) tubes made of Ni-Cr-Fe based alloys such as Alloy- 800 {{are used}} in nuclear power plants like Indian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) {{in the form of}} thin-walled tubular structural members as heat exchangers. These tubes are exposed to aggressive environments such as high temperature, internal pressure and flow-induced vibration etc. <b>Corrosion</b> <b>aspects</b> like intergranular-stress-corrosion-cracking (IGSCC) of such alloys received much attention in literature, whereas work on fracture behavior of these materials is limited, particularly for thin-walled tubes. For structural integrity assessment of SG tubes, a valid fracture mechanics parameter must be obtained. As their thickness is only about 1 mm, it is not feasible to machine standard fracture mechanics specimens from them. Moreover, the plane-strain condition of state of stress cannot be achieved at the crack-tip of these tubes which is a requisite of ASTM standard tests for fracture toughness. Thus, non-standard tests have been carried out on axially-cracked tubular specimens, directly machined from SG tubes in a test-setup known as Pin-Loading-Tension (PLT) setup for derivation of shape function from compliance for determining stress intensity factor and fracture toughness. Finite element analysis (FEM) has also been done to determine the shape function and the other required geometric functions for obtaining J from experimental data. A load-normalization technique was used for estimation of crack growth. The results obtained will be highly useful for residual life assessment of SG tubes of Indian PHWRs...|$|E

40|$|Chlorine is {{the most}} {{economical}} biocide widely used in SWCC sea water MSF desalination plants to prevent biofouling in the intake and flow through systems. However, chlorine has a negative contribution towards the <b>corrosion</b> <b>aspect</b> of the plant. Excess of chlorine when present in sea water oxidizes its higher homologues in the periodic table such as bromide present in sea water to bromine which finds its way in the venting system causing corrosion damage to the materials in the venting system of the MSF plants. Evolution of bromine is influenced by several parameters such as residual chlorine, pH and temperature of the sea water streams. It is deemed necessary to study the magnitude of their influence {{on the evolution of}} bromine in order to reduce its production to the minimum levels thereby keeping the corrosion probability to the lowest possible extent. This paper summarises the results of detailed studies carried out in the Research and Development Center on the evolution of bromine in sea water containing bromide as a function of several parameters such as residual chlorine, pH, temperature, contact time etc. These shtdies were carried out using a laboratory scale set up. Several water samples from an operating MSF plant in Al-Jubail Phase-II area were also analysed for bromide contents in order to assess the extent of bromine conversion in various process streams. A new analytical method was developed during the course of these studies to determine bromide in sea water samples containing complex matrix. Finally, vent gases from various stages of a MSF plant also were collected for evaluating the bromine contents. The results indicate that significant amounts of bromine evolution occur even at high pH (8. 3 - 9. 0) and low levels of residual chlorine normally present in an additive based MSF plant. Further, sea water used in barometric condensers was found to be inefficient in stripping bromine completely from the vent gases thereby creating a potential corrosion problem to the materials down stream of the condensers. Some suggestions have been put forward to avoid corrosion problems in vent systems in future MSF plants. I...|$|R

40|$|This textbook, {{suitable}} for students, researchers and engineers, gathers {{the experience of}} more than 20 years of teaching fracture mechanics, fatigue and corrosion to professional engineers and running experimental tests and verifications to solve practical problems in engineering applications. As such, it is a comprehensive blend of fundamental knowledge and technical tools to address the issues of fatigue and corrosion. The book initiates with a systematic description of fatigue from a phenomenological point of view, since the early signs of submicroscopic damage in few surface grains and continues describing, step by step, how these precursors develop to become mechanically small cracks and, eventually, macrocracks whose growth is governed by fracture mechanics. But fracture mechanics is also introduced to analyze stress corrosion and corrosion assisted fatigue in a rather advanced fashion. The author dedicates a particular attention to corrosion starting with an electrochemical treatment that mechanical engineers with a rather limited knowledge of electrochemistry will well digest without any pain. The electrochemical introduction is considered an essential requirement to the full understanding of corrosion that is essentially an electrochemical process. All stress <b>corrosion</b> <b>aspects</b> are treated, from the generalized film rupture-anodic dissolution process that is the base of any corrosion mechanism to the aggression occurring in either mechanically or thermally sensitized alloys up to the universe of hydrogen embrittlement, which is described in all its possible modes of appearance. Multiaxial fatigue and out-of-phase loading conditions are treated in a rather comprehensive manner together with damage progression and accumulation that are not linear processes. Load spectra are analyzed also in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform in a rather elegant fashion full of applications that are generally not considered at all in fatigue textbooks, yet they deserve a special place and attention. The issue of fatigue cannot be treated without a probabilistic approach unless the designer accepts the shame of one-out-of-two pieces failure. The reader is fully introduced to the most promising and advanced analytical tools {{that do not require}} a normal or lognormal distribution of the experimental data, which is the most common case in fatigue. But the probabilistic approach is also used to introduce the fundamental issue of process volume that is the base of any engineering application of fatigue, from the probability of failure to the notch effect, from the metallurgical variability and size effect to the load type effect. Fractography plays a fundamental role in the post mortem analysis of fatigue and corrosion failures since it can unveil the mystery encrypted in any failure...|$|E

Throughout the analysis, the main parameter of choosing reservoir design can be recognize, in this study there are two main parameters for choosing the best tank design that is, pressure drop and costing. The need of reservoir generally in term of costing for the whole project is because a costly pipe material would be required to withstanding a very high pressure in a very long pipe system. Therefore using reservoir is more economical compare to costly pipeline material, but in term of reservoir costing only, the variable that we can change is the volume of material use and also price of material. The volume of material used is depends on the dimension of the design and the dimension is depends on the criteria that this project need for reservoir section, to reduce volume material used, a single, double, and triple design is rational to be proposed. Choosing a right material need several analysis to be done, firstly throughout the CFD analysis, the data for maximum total pressure across wall can be obtain and with this data, a stress and strain analysis will be perform using a different grade of concrete, in this project the material used is concrete because it cannot be corroded since the fluid medium will be water so <b>corrosion</b> <b>aspect</b> is important. With stress and strain analysis, the maximum deflection data for each design can be obtain, the maximum deflection is like the safety level for the material use, the less deflection the more level of safety of the material, hence an optimum material with less price but strong can be choose, in this study the most suitable material to be use is grade 10 ready mix concrete.

Bacteria are often associated with marine immersion corrosion but there appears to have been little attempt previously to associate bacterial activity with atmospheric corrosion in the coastal zone. The present paper describes observations of rust conditions on steel strips and coupons exposed in field tests conducted at several locations on the Eastern Australian seaboard. Careful examination revealed rust patterns and corrosion surface characteristics that could not have been caused by conventional oxidation with oxygen as the ultimate electron receptor. The patterns are consistent, however, with the activity of the sulphate-reducing bacteria in which sulphur acts as the electron receptor. Importantly, the most severe corrosion losses occurred away from coupon edges and revealed shiny, heavily pitted metal surfaces. There is evidence also that ferrous oxidizing bacteria are involved.

Push-out tests were performed in specimens prepared with different adhesive systems and resin cements. It was possible to conclude that periodontal disease did not affected the bond strength mean values of fiberglass posts cementation. In the third paper, Silva Neto et al. present a numerical and experimental investigation on the adhesion between the steel tube and cement paste in petroleum wells. Push-out tests were performed with three different interface conditions in order to validate the numerical model. They observed the influence of the different conditions used in the experiments and the sensibility of the model variables to these changes. Antunes et al. worked on the characterization of FeCr and FeCoCr alloy coatings of carbon steels for marine environment applications. The adhesive strength of alloy coatings using thermal spray process was studied and related to chemical composition. Five combinations of wires and intermediate bonds were used.

Some alloy additions are known to promote glass formation and to lower the critical cooling rate [F. Guo, S. J. Poon, Applied Physics Letters, 83 (13) 2575 - 2577, 2003]. Other elements are known to enhance the corrosion resistance of conventional stainless steels and nickel-based alloys [A. I.

Many of these materials can be cast as relatively thick ingots, or applied as coatings with advanced thermal spray technology. A wide variety of thermal spray processes have been developed by industry, and can be used to apply these new materials as coatings. Any of these can be used for the deposition of the formulations discussed here, with varying degrees of residual porosity and crystalline structure. Thick protective coatings have now been made that are fully dense and completely amorphous in the as-sprayed condition. An overview of the High-Performance Corrosion Resistant Materials (HPCRM) Project will be given, with particular emphasis on the corrosion resistance of several different types of iron-based amorphous metals in various environments of interest. The salt fog test has been used to compare the performance of various wrought alloys, melt-spun ribbons, arc-melted drop-cast ingots, and thermal-spray coatings for their susceptibility to corrosion in marine environments. Electrochemical tests have also been performed in seawater. Spontaneous breakdown of the passive film and localized corrosion require that the open-circuit corrosion potential exceed the critical potential. The resistance to localized corrosion is seawater has been quantified through measurement of the open-circuit corrosion potential (E{sub corr}), the breakdown potential (E{sub crit}) and the repassivation potential (E{sub rp}). The greater the difference between the open-circuit corrosion potential and the repassivation potential ({Delta}E), the more resistant a material is to modes of localized corrosion such as pitting and crevice corrosion. Cyclic polarization (CP) was used as a means of measuring the critical potential (E{sub crit}) relative to the open-circuit corrosion potential (E{sub corr}). Linear polarization (LP) has been used to determine the corrosion current (i{sub corr}) and the corresponding <b>corrosion</b> rate. Other <b>aspects</b> of the materials will also be discussed, as well as potential applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} of SiCp / 6061 A 1 in 3 % NaCl solution, at pH {{values of}} 3. 8, 7. 2 and 10. 2, {{has been studied}} using SEM and combined scanning Auger electron/ X-ray microscopy. The MMC, fabricated by powder metallurgy, contains approximately 15 percent (volume) SiC as < 10 mum particles. Scatter diagrams are applied to analyze elemental maps created by scanning Auger microscopy. The experiments reveal that some impurity elements such as Fe, Ti etc., introduced during fabrication, form intermetallic compounds and {{that these are the}} dominant factors causing micro-galvanic corrosion. The Auger maps show, by inspection, that oxygen is enriched after exposure around these intermetallics. This has been confirmed by using scatter diagrams to analyze the data contained within the map. The phenomenon is probably caused by the dissolution of aluminium, resulting in the deposition of porous corrosion products such as Al(OH) 3 and AlOOH. Because of a low overpotential for oxygen reduction, the intermetallic compounds are expected to act as cathodes. This is confirmed by the finding of magnesium hydroxide {{on the surface of the}} intermetallics after exposure of the specimen in MgCl 2 solution. It is shown that the onset of this deposition can be used to estimate the cathodic current density at the cathode. Current density at the SiC particles, estimated by this method is negligible, suggesting that the principal cause of corrosion is found in the interaction between the aluminium alloy and the intermetallics. The same method is used for SiC, / 6061 A 1 MMC. Intermetallic particles are found much more likely to be located at a fibre / matrix interface, and they are still a sensitive factor for localized corrosion. There is some Cr in the Fe-containing intermetallics in this matrix, this type of intermetallic is not very susceptible to micro-galvanic <b>corrosion.</b> Another different <b>aspect</b> is that the reinforcing material in SiCf / 6061 A 1 MMC is directly associated with the micro-corrosion cell. The reinforcing SiC fibre belongs to the SCS series which consists of three different layers. The SiC is grown on a carbon core by chemical vapour deposition and a protective coating is applied on the outside of the fibre. This coating is mainly composed of carbon which is slightly enriched in silicon at the surface. In this investigation we found that carbon core and carbon coating act as cathodes and form a galvanic cell with surrounding aluminium alloy. This is confirmed by the magnesium decoration method. Electrochemical techniques are also used. Several kinds of SiC fibres and graphite fibres are cathodically polarized in 3 % NaCl solution. By comparison with the anodic polarization curve of A 1 alloy, the galvanic cells between A 1 alloy and carbon core or protective coating are confirmed. There is no galvanic effect between A 1 and pure SiC. Al 3 Fe is extracted from intermetallic enriched A 1 alloy, and the electrochemical performance of this intermetallic is investigated...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} experimental and theoretical studies of high temperature corrosion phenomena in plant exposed nickel-based alloys. Different complementary experimental techniques {{have been used to}} unravel the microstructural changes and phase formations accompanying the corrosion process, including light microscopy, hardness measurements, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEG SEM), microprobe / WDS analyses, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (S-XRD). These results together with thermodynamic and kinetic modelling of the rate phenomena involved have provided new insight into the mechanisms of metal dusting corrosion in Ni-based alloys under real plant exposure conditions that have not previously been disclosed using accelerated laboratory tests. The thesis is divided into five parts. Part Î™ gives a general introduction to metal dusting <b>corrosion.</b> In particular, <b>aspects</b> of metal dusting corrosion in low alloyed steels, complex engineering alloys and nickel-based alloys have been reviewed and put into proper perspective. In Part Î™Î™ of the thesis a research strategy aiming at a more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of metal dusting corrosion is presented. Then a full description of the materials, exposure conditions and the experimental techniques being applied throughout the investigations is given as a lead-in to the subsequent microstructure and phase characterisation. In Part Î™Î™Î™ of the thesis, metallurgical characterisation of the nickel based alloy 602 has been carried out following plant exposure at approximately 540 Â°C for 2 years. In general, alloy 602 is found to exhibit a high intrinsic resistance to metal dusting corrosion under the prevailing circumstances. Only a thin zone is affected by carbon intrusion, extending about 20 Î¼m from the surface and into the bulk of the material. The subsequent FEG SEM and S-XRD analyses of the exposed 602 alloy revealed the presence of various phases at the corroded surface, including nepheline (NaAlSiO 4) and presumably also corundum (Al 2 -x Cr x O 3). None of these oxide phases are commonly observed in connection with metal dusting corrosion. In Part Î™V of the thesis, the surface disintegration and microstructural stability of the two nickel-based alloys 602 and 693, containing varying levels of chromium and aluminium, have been examined both during oxidising conditions in the laboratory and following 2 and 4 years of exposure to syngas in an industrial plant for methanol production at 540 Â°C and 35 bar total pressure. The near surface phases were investigated using optical microscopy and hardness measurements, and further characterised by employing synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) in combination with scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM). The disintegration process starts by rejection of Î±-Cr from the supersaturated austenite matrix. The process proceeds by reactions between the surface oxide layer and the syngas containing the trace elements Si, Na, Ni at the ppb level. The former elements {{contribute to the development of}} nepheline (NaAlSiO 4) at the outmost surface facing the gas, whereas the deposited Ni particles from the syngas promote coke formation by catalysing the Boudouard reaction (2 CO = C + CO 2). On the inside a mixed Cr 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 oxide layer is observed, both in the steam oxidised and plant exposed alloys. In particular, the inner aluminium oxide is very dense and provides an effective getter against carbon intrusion into the bulk of the alloys by virtue of its ability to restore cracks and flaws through diffusion. Eventually, restrictions in the supply of reactants (e. g. Al) to the oxide/ metal interface complete the incubation period and lead to the formation of corrosion pits at the bottom of the open surface cracks being in direct contact with the syngas atmosphere. Finally, Part V is concerned with fundamental studies of the mechanisms of metal dusting corrosion in the Ni-based alloys 602 and 693 during long time exposure to syngas at 540 o C and 35 bar total pressure. Four years plant exposed alloys were examined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction in combination with scanning- and transmission electron microscopy. It is concluded that the metal dusting corrosion attacks start by carbon diffusing into the bulk of the alloys following the break-down of the protective Cr 2 O 3 - Al 2 O 3 surface oxide layer. During the incubation period this oxide layer provides an effective barrier against carbon intrusion by virtue of its ability to restore cracks and flaws through diffusion. The corrosion pits then grow by a process of internal carburisation and oxidation, where carbides, oxides and graphite form separately within an approximately 30 Î¼m thick belt in front of the pits (referred as the white zone). In particular, the oxidation of the internal Cr 3 C 2 carbides occurring close to the white zone/pit interface is associated with large volume changes. This volume expansion results in build-up of high mechanical stresses within the white zone and eventually to the complete disintegration of the original alloy matrices into a layered pit microstructure consisting of Ni + Fe and Cr 2 O 3 + Al 2 O 3 + graphite, respectively. The observed microstructural changes have been rationalised through detailed modelling of the physical reactions involved, leading to the development of new and comprehensive models for metal dusting corrosion in Ni-based alloys. </p...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement {{corrosion}} {{is frequently}} considered as the predominant degradation mechanism affecting reinforced concrete structures. Reinforced concrete structures are commonly subject to harsh environmental and loading {{conditions in which}} aggressive species can penetrate. Chlorides, present in seawater or de-icing salts, are the main responsible for the initiation of reinforcement corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. Chlorides penetrate through the concrete cover by different transport mechanisms, i. e. capillary and/or diffusive processes. During time, the chloride concentration at the surface of steel reinforcement reaches a level known as the critical chloride content Ccr i t. The time necessary for chlorides to reach Ccr i t {{is known as the}} initiation period. Service life models that consider reinforcement corrosion as the governing degradation mechanism are composed of two periods: initiation and propagation. Numerous investigations have been dedicated to the study of chloride ingress and corrosion initiation and propagation. Most of them, however, have been conducted in crack-free concrete. In practice, different types of cracks can be present in concrete structures originated from construction (i. e. drying shrinkage cracks) to service (e. g. mechanical load) actions. The presence of cracks in concrete structures is commonly considered as irrelevant for their mechanical capacity. However, the influence of cracks upon the structures durability remains uncertain. Commonly, surface crack widths are limited and controlled by design codes based on exposure conditions. Often, these guidelines provide recommendations of â€™acceptableâ€™ surface crack width values which. Recent findings have shown that the presence of secondary cracks at the concrete-steel interface could be more detrimental to the durability of reinforced concrete structures. This thesis is devoted {{to the study of the}} influence of cracks on the initiation of reinforcement <b>corrosion</b> including <b>aspects</b> on the determination of chloride concentration in cement paste and concrete and the incorporation of cracks on service life predictions. One of the most important, and difficult to determine, parameters related to the chloride induced reinforcement corrosion is the corrosion inducing chloride concentration Ccr i t. In this thesis, the experimental determination of Ccr i t was carried out following a proposed test method by the RILEM Technical Committee 235 -CTC "corrosion initiating chloride threshold concentrations" in which a test method for determining Ccr i t. Portland (PC - CEM I) and blast furnace slag (BFS - CEM III/B) cements were employed in the fabrication of reinforced concrete specimens with two different cover depths of 15 mm and 10 mm, respectively. After fabrication, the specimens were exposed to a chloride rich solution (3. 3 % NaCl) while monitoring of the electrochemical potential vs a reference electrode (SCE). Corrosion initiation was determined by detecting a shift of the electrochemical potential towards less noble values for a period of at least 7 days. Subsequently, chloride profiles were obtained by acid digestion followed by wet chemical analysis. Also, a Round Robin test (RRT) among the participating laboratories in the RILEM Committee was studied. In PC specimens, an average Ccr i t of 0. 56 % by weight of cement was found whilst in BFS specimens chloride contents were below 0. 1 % by mass of binder after 6 months of exposure. In the case of the RRT, concentrations of up to 1. 3 % by weight of cement were measured without signs of corrosion (potential shift) after 1 year of exposure. Results of electrochemical measurements and chloride concentrations for each series are discussed. Based on the obtained results, the test method is critically analysed and potential improvements to it are presented. Compared to bulk techniques (viz. acid digestion and titration), X-ray microanalysis can provide quantitative determination of element concentrations at high spatial resolutions. In order to perform fully quantitative microanalysis, X-ray spectra from rock forming minerals must be used as reference. Six minerals were studied as reference minerals for quantification of chlorine in cement paste: chlorapatite, halite, marialite, scapolite, tugtupite and zunyite. Cement paste samples with added chloride concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 5 and 5. 0 % by mass of cement were fabricated. Subsequently, X-ray spectra collected from C-S-H rich phases was analysed with each mineral. Results show that scapolite provided to be the most accurate concentrations of chlorine amongst the employed minerals. Deviations from acid digestion and wet chemical analysis are attributed to matrix effects (Â¯Z AF) between rock-forming minerals and cement paste such as the presence of chemically bound water in C-S-H, porosity and poorly crystalline structure. Due to the lack of appropriate minerals with similarities to C-S-H, the synthesis of a cement-like mineral is presented. For this, high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) experiments were performed at VU Amsterdam department of Planetary Evolution. Cement paste with a chloride concentration of 5 % by weight of cement was subject to HPHT conditions of 1 GPa and temperature range between 1000 and 1600 Â±C for 30 minutes. After quenching, the resulting material was analysed with a Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Microprobe and EDS. Results showed that an homogeneously glass porous matrix could be obtained. Subsequently, it was found that the synthetic glass provided better quantitative results compared to the previously tested minerals due to reduced matrix effects. Cracking of concrete was assessed by electrical resistance and image analysis in reinforced concrete specimens subject to a Modified Wedge Splitting Test. Concrete specimens with Portland cement (PC) and blast furnace slag (BFS) were fabricated with dimensions of 150 x 150 x 150 mm 3. Cracking of concretewas performed under controlled displacement conditions while the electrical resistance across the crack was monitored. Results showed that the electrical resistance across the crack increased with increasing COD (crack opening displacement) at the concrete surface. Afterwards, cracks were impregnated with a fluorescent epoxy resin. Concrete slices of 20 mmthickwere sawn from the specimens and the geometry of the cracks was assessed. Secondary cracks (roughly parallel to the rebars) were observed with COD values of 200 micrometer or higher. Image analysis of binary images obtained from the impregnated slices showed that the crack volume increased with increasing COD. The corrosion behaviour of cracked concrete specimens was monitored in reinforced cracked concrete specimens. The specimens were exposed to cyclic wet-dry cycles with a chlorine rich solution. Monitoring of the electrochemical potential, corrosion rate and electrical concrete resistivity were carried out. After 36 weeks, results showed that the corrosion rate of all PC specimens was higher than 1 Â¹m/year whilst in BFS they were below this value. At the end of the cyclic exposure, reinforcement bars were mechanically extracted for inspections of the pit locations and dimensions. Stereomicrographs showed the presence of secondary cracks in specimens with COD values higher than 200 micrometer. Samples of the concrete-steel interface in the vicinity of corrosion pits were analysed with EDS. The concentration of chlorine was found to be higher in specimens with higher corrosion rate values. Estimations of accumulated pit volume were higher with increasing COD in all cases. Finally, the incorporation of cracks on chloride transport and service life predictions of concrete elements is presented. The model incorporates a correction to the diffusion coefficient of uncracked concrete determined by performance tests (natural diffusion or RCM). Prediction of the service life of concrete elements under marine exposure was performed with the DuraCrete model, including the correction to the resistance to chloride ingress. Estimations of ti as a function of crack width are studied. Results of the predicted ti from the model are then compared to observations of the ti of specimens studied in Chapter 7. For PC specimens, difference between estimations of ti were up to 4 times higher than the observed corrosion behaviour. In the case of BFS, the difference is larger. It seems that predictions of ti in BFS concrete are more sensitive to the increased resistance to chloride ingress as shown in the value of D 0 which is one order of magnitude lower than in PC concrete.
