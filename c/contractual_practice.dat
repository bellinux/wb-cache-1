During these decades, a major event took place: the Paramount antitrust case was resolved by the US Supreme Court in 1948. As a result, the five largest studios (MGM, Paramount, 20 th Century Fox, Warner Brothers and RKO) were forced to vertically disintegrate and separate production and distribution from exhibition. The Supreme Court also banned these and three other studios (Columbia, Universal and United Artists) from using block booking as <b>contractual</b> <b>practice.</b> In this article, I examine how this antitrust ruling affected the movie industry. ...|$|E

The contracts enable the innovative entrepreneur and his investor to extract some of the surplus they generate through positive spillovers for new entrants. This provides a new rationale for contractual incompleteness, and may help to explain observed <b>contractual</b> <b>practice</b> in Silicon Valley. innovation, spillovers, venture capital, incomplete contracts...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we use the}} {{incomplete}} contract {{theory and}} transaction cost theory frameworks as complementary tools. We analyze <b>contractual</b> <b>practices</b> in various types of services for which several dimensions are non-contractible and specific investments appear to be present only at low levels. Starting with an incomplete contract model, we put forth propositions regarding the make or buy decision. We perform econometrical tests on ground services for aeronautical companies in several countries. As far as we know, {{it is one of}} the first econometrical tests of the incomplete contract theory’s propositions. Results show that even without a high level of specific investment, vertical integration may be chosen to avoid opportunistic behavior when crucial dimensions of the service are non-contractible. The paper concludes that non-contractibility may be a crucial determinant of cooperation, as important as uncertainty or specific investments. However, we believe that to understand <b>contractual</b> <b>practices</b> when the integration solution is not retained, a transaction cost analysis appears more efficient.

40|$|A {{customary}} {{contract is}} a set of terms that is standard in a given locale for a given economic purpose. Once established, such a standard tends to perpetuate itself because it creates expectations about what is fair and appropriate in a given type of economic bargain. We propose a dynamic model of how contractual customs form endogenously. Agents are situated in a geographical or social space, and they recontract periodically based on expected returns, local properties of the contract, and its conformity with local practice. The model predicts that the most likely geographic pattern consists of "patches" where contractual terms are nearly uniform, separated by bounderies where contractual norms jump from one set of terms to another. Differences in regional customs are roughly related to average differences in economic fundamentals, but they mask the considerable amount of heterogeneity that exists within regions. We compare these predictions with <b>contractual</b> <b>practice</b> in contemporary Illionois agriculture, and find considerable support for the model's prediction...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} insight of {{the economic}} analysis of law {{is the notion that}} legal sanctions are "prices " set for given categories of legally relevant behaviour. This idea develops around the positive conception of law as a command backed by an enforceable sanction. Law and economics uses the well-developed tools of price theory to predict the effect of changes in sanctions on individual behaviour. One essential question, however, remains unanswered: How can the legal system set efficient prices if there is no market process that generates them? In other words, how can legal rules reflect the level of social undesirability of the conduct being sanctioned? Although the legal system sometimes borrows a price from the actual market (e. g., when the sanction is linked to the compensatory function of the rule of law), there is a wide range of situations in which legislative and judicial bodies set prices {{in the absence of a}} proper market mechanism. In a law and economics perspective, customary law can be viewed as a process for generating legal rules that is analogous to a price mechanism in a partial equilibrium framework. Both the emergence of custom from repeated <b>contractual</b> <b>practice</b> and the role of custom as a non-contractual solution to game inefficiencies have been the object of study in both the economic and philosophical literature.

40|$|Abstract. ‘International subcontracting’ (sous-traitance de marché or de {{services}} or sous-traité, sous-entreprise, Zulieferwesen or Zuliefervertrag, subappalto or subfornitura) {{refers to a}} widespread <b>contractual</b> <b>practice</b> of the modern construction industry, at {{the very core of}} the ‘self-made law of building industry’, which has so extensively contributed {{to the development of the}} lex mercatoria. As often described in literature, international subcontracting denotes an agreement, entered into by a contractor and a third party that undertakes to perform all or a part of the contractor’s obligations required by an employer under an actual or proposed cross-border construction contract. Reference hereby shall be made to private procurements only, since subcontracts related to public procurements almost exclusively involve administrative concerns, which deserve a separate appreciation. International subcontracts, because of the contractual connection to the construction contract, raise significant issues of private international law that require, subject to certain conditions, a deviation from the classic standard of neutrality and blindness of conflict rules in contracts. Indeed, only conflict rules likely to support the substantial private interests within the contractual connection can properly keep the focus on the functional unity that closely connects international subcontracts and construction contracts, which escape mechanical allocation by means of hard and fast conflict rules. To this purpose, a recent wave of scholarship should be taken into account, which suggests a functional approach to conflict rules, which focuses on the nature of the relationships between the parties, rather than on the territorial scope of the applicable rules, to achieve the application of the law ‘which is presumed to be most concerned with the party in need of protection’. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{subcontracting}} {{culture in}} New Zealand {{is such that}} the same retention regime imposed on contractors is imposed on subcontractors by and large. This paradoxically fair <b>contractual</b> <b>practice</b> of back-to-back terms results in high retention rates (10 %) and long defects liability periods set from contractor’s practical completion which has caused concerns for subcontractors with no rational basis for resolving such concerns. This study investigates this phenomenon from a risk based perspective to understand the link between risk and retentions particularly in relation to current practice. Accordingly, {{it is found that}} current retention rates do not show an association with overall risk computed as a product of likelihood and consequence based on contractors’ perceptions. However, when risk is viewed through these two components, it is seen that trades with high default risks for either likelihood or consequence results in high retention rates. Additionally, it is also seen that high risk is associated with subcontractor-harsh retention regimes with some exceptions lowering the strength of this association suggesting the need to investigate such trades to understand whether there are other overwhelming reasons for such exceptions. Thus, it is concluded that risk and retention regimes are linked to this extent although for a given level of risk, subcontractor friendly or unfriendly regimes could be achieved by a mix of different retention rates and release mechanisms. In this regard, it is seen that contractors seem to prefer high retention rates than longer defects liability periods for trades which have high risk levels. A further understanding about this relationship could be developed by undertaking a study on perceived overall risk levels and perceived retention regimes. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} author’s {{reversion}} rights {{begins with the}} Statute of Anne and the debates {{that led up to}} the adoption of section 11, which vested in the author a second fourteen-year term, provided he or she was still alive {{at the end of the}} initial fourteen-year term. The study then will address the impact of the author’s reversion right on publishing practice and authors’ welfare in the United Kingdom through the eighteenth century to the demise of the reversion right in 1814. We will suggest that the apparent lack of use of the reversion right by authors in the eighteenth century was a result of a host of factors, including but not limited to the common (but by no means universal) <b>contractual</b> <b>practice</b> which purported to confer on a publisher the entirety of an author’s rights. In addition, we call attention to the multiple and shifting interpretations of what was required by section 11, as well as the social and economic limitations on an author’s capacity to take advantage of the reversion. The second half of this study turns to the law and publishing practices in the United States, where reversion rights have proved more enduring if not always more beneficial to authors. The study concludes that history and practice suggest at best inconsistent achievement of reversonary rights’ aim to offset the author’s weaker bargaining position by assuring her a future opportunity to make a better deal. Legislators might improve the reversion rights regime, but it is not clear that authors’ lots will accordingly ameliorate. Substantive regulation of contracts of transfer, rather than rights to terminate those transfers, may offer the preferable path to ensuring meaningful and effective protection of authors’ interests in reaping the fruits of their intellectual labors...|$|E
