In 1794, {{chocolate}} manufacturer Benjamin Sweetser, who {{became one of the}} most successful chocolate makers in the United States, purchased the property. Around 1796, Sweetser <b>constructed</b> <b>a</b> new chocolate factory about seventy feet northwest of the grist mill. Around 1800, he <b>constructed</b> <b>a</b> new residence north of the factory. From 1816 to 1820, the mill was rented to William Smith, who manufactured chocolate for Chase & Page of Salem, Massachusetts.
