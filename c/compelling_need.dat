2500|$|Atwater {{had urged}} the Court {{to adopt a}} [...] "bright-line" [...] rule that the police not arrest anyone for an offense that did not carry jail time unless the {{government}} could show a <b>compelling</b> <b>need</b> to detain the person. [...] At first blush, the Court conceded, this rule appeared easily administrable by police officers, which would serve the government's interest in rules {{that are easy to}} apply on the spot. [...] But in thinking through many possible applications of the rule Atwater proposed, the Court found it more difficult to apply. [...] Court opinion stated that it is not reasonable to expect the average police officer to know the details of [...] "frequently complex penalty schemes," [...] especially since the penalty associated with seemingly identical conduct can vary with the facts that are difficult to discern at the scene of a crime, such as whether the suspect is a repeat offender or the weight of drugs. [...] Furthermore, even if the officer could make that distinction on the spot, he could not know how the district attorney will later choose to charge the offense.|$|E

It was past one o'clock when he rose stiffly from his seat among the sand knolls and, strolling back to the Tower, opened the door and entered. The cloth was laid for luncheon in the little sitting-room, but there were no signs of Hannah Cox. He passed on into the kitchen and came to a sudden standstill. Once more the memory of his own work passed away from him. Once more he was back again among that queer, clouded tangle of strange suspicions, of thrilling, half-formed fears, which had assailed him at times ever since his arrival at St, David's. He stopped quite short. The words which rose to his lips died away. He felt the breathless, <b>compelling</b> <b>need</b> for silence and grew tense in the effort to make no sound.|$|E

30|$|Nanofluid {{is a novel}} heat-transfer fluid {{prepared}} by dispersing nanometer-sized solid particles in traditional heat-transfer fluid to increase thermal conductivity and heat-transfer performance. Nanofluid was coined by Choi and colleagues [1 – 3] in 1995 at Argonne National Laboratory of the USA. Nanofluids with water, ethylene glycol, or oil as the base fluid were of great significance primarily because of their enhanced thermal properties. There are <b>compelling</b> <b>needs</b> in many industrial fields to develop oil-based heat transfer fluids with significantly higher thermal conductivity for energy-efficient heat exchangers. Many efforts have {{been focused on the}} oil-based nanofluids. Transformer oil, mineral oil, silicon oil, hydrocarbon fuels, and some organic solutions are used as the base fluids for studying nanofluids. The dispersion and thermal conductivities of the oil-based nanofluids containing Cu, CuO, Ag, or Al 2 O 3 particles have been recently reported [4 – 6].|$|R

Stratigraphically and chronologically the extinction appears to have been catastrophic, seemingly too sudden and extensive for either human predation or climate change to have been the primary cause. This sudden Rancholabrean termination at 10, 900 ± 50 B. P. appears to have coincided with the sudden climatic switch from Allerød warming to Younger Dryas cooling.

50|$|Secured a precedent-setting {{victory on}} behalf of nearly 5,000 abused and {{neglected}} children in a nearly three decade-long case involving the long-troubled Baltimore, Maryland foster care system. The defendants in the case, both Maryland state agencies, had argued that, {{as a result of}} a 2009 Supreme Court decision, foster care children had no rights to enforce federal child welfare laws. In the first ruling by an appellate court on this issue, Circuit Judge Allyson K. Duncan disagreed and found that the state agencies were misinterpreting the Supreme Court decision. Judge Duncan's decision ensures that federal child welfare laws will be enforced in the state of Maryland, meaning that a Baltimore federal court will be allowed to enter a decree negotiated between Venable's attorneys and two Maryland state agencies to <b>compel</b> <b>needed</b> reforms to the foster care system. As a result of the decision, Maryland must comply with 28 separate outcomes for the foster children, which are measured by over 100 performance measures.|$|R

40|$|Wetlands {{are highly}} {{productive}} and support {{a wide variety}} of ecosystem goods and services. Various forms of global change impose <b>compelling</b> <b>needs</b> for timely and reliable information on the status of wetlands worldwide, but several characteristics of wetlands make them challenging to monitor remotely: they lack a single, unifying land-cover feature; they tend to be highly dynamic and their energy signatures are constantly changing; and steep environmental gradients in and around wetlands produce narrow ecotones that often are below the resolving capacity of remote sensors. These challenges and needs set the context for a special issue focused on wetland remote sensing. Contributed papers responded to one of three overarching questions aimed at improving remote, large-area monitoring of wetlands: (1) What approaches and data products are being developed specifically to support regional to global long-term monitoring of wetland landscapes? (2) What are the promising new technologies and sensor/multisensor approaches for more accurate and consistent detection of wetlands? (3) Are there studies that demonstrate how remote long-term monitoring of wetland landscapes can reveal changes that correspond with changes in land cover and land use and/or changes in climate...|$|R
