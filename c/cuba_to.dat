5|$|After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a {{representative}} of the Fidel Castro government asked Árbenz to come to <b>Cuba,</b> <b>to</b> which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself.

His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E

Those changes were motivated by the upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey, De Soto spent March and April fruitlessly {{cruising}} for CSS Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico. As {{one of the}} few fast steamers in Bailey's command, De Soto {{possessed a}} speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey. This was demonstrated on 24 April, when De Soto sailors boarded and seized two sloops, Jane Adelie and Bright, sixteen hours out of Mobile, Alabama, and each laden with cotton. Two schooners, General Prim and Rapid, were then taken the very next day, and they too carried cotton. All four prizes were sent to Key West for adjudication. On 27 April, De Soto continued the run of good luck, seizing the British schooner Clarita en route from Havana, <b>Cuba</b> <b>to</b> Matamoras.|$|E
5|$|Cristóbal de Olid sailed from Mexico in January 1524, {{stopping}} off in <b>Cuba</b> <b>to</b> collect supplies {{set aside for}} him by Cortés. The governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, was an enemy of Cortés and persuaded Olid to take Honduras for himself. Olid arrived off northern Honduras in early May, some distance {{to the east of}} Puerto de Caballos. He disembarked with 360 Spaniards and 22 horses, and founded Triunfo de la Cruz, still known by this name, near the modern port of Tela. He claimed the new territory in Cortés' name, but after founding the new town he openly rejected him, {{with the support of the}} majority of his men. He then carried out a campaign of conquest in what is now western Honduras, subjugating the heavily populated towns of Naco and Tencoa, which did little to resist.|$|E

His were the first troops to take station in Cuba after the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Carpenter was appointed Military Governor of the province and remained in that capacity until June 12, 1899 when he was honorably discharged and reverted to his regular army rank of colonel. Colonel Carpenter was promoted on October 18, 1899, to brigadier general, Regular Army; he then retired the next day, at his own request, having served honorably for 38 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route15, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} initially extended from Hornell {{in the south}} to Caledonia in the north via Dansville and Mount Morris. Also assigned at this time was Route16, which went from <b>Cuba</b> <b>to</b> Rochester via Le Roy and Caledonia. Much of Route15 followed modern NY36; however, from Dansville to Mount Morris, it used what is now NY63 and NY408 instead. Route16, meanwhile, followed current NY36 from Caledonia to Mumford. From Jasper to Hornell, modern NY36 was part of the cross-state Route4. On March1, 1921, Route16 was truncated to end in Le Roy. Its former routing north of Caledonia became part of Route15.|$|E
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, <b>Cuba,</b> <b>to</b> {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E
