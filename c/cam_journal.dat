The Mexico blocks (all DEs except {{those found in}} the S series) {{implemented}} a distributor and oil pump drive similar to the L series; from the crank nose. They also used a single row chain for the upper timing assembly without valve cover mounted guide. In addition to this, they removed the rearmost <b>cam</b> <b>journal</b> in the Mexico head. The crank rides on individually capped bearings with a slightly smaller diameter than the Japanese block, with shorter, slightly lower compression pistons in cylinders that have thicker walls than the Japanese DE. They retained the knock sensor and piston oilers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Growing {{popularity}} of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) {{in the public}} sector is reflected in the scientific community by an increased number of research articles assessing its therapeutic effects. Some suggest that publication biases occur in mainstream medicine, and may also occur in CAM. Homeopathy {{is one of the most}} widespread and most controversial forms of CAM. The purpose of this study was to compare the representation of homeopathic clinical trials published in traditional science and <b>CAM</b> <b>journals.</b> Methods Literature searches were performed using Medline (PubMed), AMED and Embase computer databases. Search terms included "homeo-pathy, -path, and -pathic" and "clinical" and "trial". All articles published in English over the past 10 years were included. Our search yielded 251 articles overall, of which 46 systematically examined the efficacy of homeopathic treatment. We categorized the overall results of each paper as having either "positive" or "negative" outcomes depending upon the reported effects of homeopathy. We also examined and compared 15 meta-analyses and review articles on homeopathy to ensure our collection of clinical trials was reasonably comprehensive. These articles were found by inserting the term "review" instead of "clinical" and "trial". Results Forty-six peer-reviewed articles published in a total of 23 different journals were compared (26 in <b>CAM</b> <b>journals</b> and 20 in conventional journals). Of those in conventional journals, 69 % reported negative findings compared to only 30 % in <b>CAM</b> <b>journals.</b> Very few articles were found to be presented in a "negative" tone, and most were presented using "neutral" or unbiased language. Conclusion A considerable difference exists between the number of clinical trials showing positive results published in <b>CAM</b> <b>journals</b> compared with traditional journals. We found only 30 % of those articles published in <b>CAM</b> <b>journals</b> presented negative findings, whereas over twice that amount were published in traditional journals. These results suggest a publication bias against homeopathy exists in mainstream journals. Conversely, the same type of publication bias does not appear to exist between review and meta-analysis articles published in the two types of journals. </p...|$|R

In fact the 100 000 or so for volume 1 in 2004 was superceded impressively by 150 000 for volume 2 in 2005 to a remarkable 150 000 for one-half of volume 3, 2006. Let us see what happens at this year’s end as we enthusiastically open the covers for volume 4. What is waiting in the papers? With the end of volume 3 will the level rise to 200 000 ?

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to map the discourse about herbal medicine in Australia’s primary medical journal, the Medical Journal of Australia, over 4 decades. Manifest content analysis of 148 articles about herbal or complementary and alternative medicine (<b>CAM)</b> in <b>journal</b> articles from 1966 to 2008 was undertaken. Issues of risk dominated the discourse about herbal medicine in the journal (70 %), {{with a focus on}} adverse events (42 %) as the most significant risk of herbal and other complementary medicines. Toxicity (23 %) and drug interactions (18 %) were the most frequently mentioned specific risk items. Items that acknowledged efficacy (32 %) outweighed those suggesting ineffectiveness (11 %). Case reports, reviews, research articles, and letters all had risk frequencies of more than 70 %. Review articles and research articles had a high rate of reference to both risk and benefit. Review articles were found to have greater reference to benefit than risk. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Acupuncture {{has become}} popular and widely practiced in many {{countries}} around the world. Despite {{the large amount of}} acupuncture-related literature that has been published, broader trends in the prevalence and scope of acupuncture research remain underexplored. The current study quantitatively analyzes trends in acupuncture research publications in the past 20 years. A bibliometric approach was used to search PubMed for all acupuncture-related research articles including clinical and animal studies. Inclusion criteria were articles published between 1995 and 2014 with sufficient information for bibliometric analyses. Rates and patterns of acupuncture publication within the 20 year observational period were estimated, and compared with broader publication rates in biomedicine. Identified eligible publications were further analyzed with respect to study type/design, clinical condition addressed, country of origin, and journal impact factor. A total of 13, 320 acupuncture-related publications were identified using our search strategy and eligibility criteria. Regression analyses indicated an exponential growth in publications over the past two decades, with a mean annual growth rate of 10. 7 %. This compares to a mean annual growth rate of 4. 5 % in biomedicine. A striking trend was an observed increase in the proportion of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), from 7. 4 % in 1995 to 20. 3 % in 2014, exceeding the 4. 5 % proportional growth of RCTs in biomedicine. Over the 20 year period, pain was consistently the most common focus of acupuncture research (37. 9 % of publications). Other top rankings with respect to medical focus were arthritis, neoplasms/cancer, pregnancy or labor, mood disorders, stroke, nausea/vomiting, sleep, and paralysis/palsy. Acupuncture research was conducted in 60 countries, with the top 3 contributors being China (47. 4 %), United States (17. 5 %), and United Kingdom (8. 2 %). Retrieved articles were published mostly in complementary and alternative medicine (<b>CAM)</b> <b>journals</b> with impact factors ranging between 0. 7 and 2. 8 in the top 20 journals, followed by journals specializing in neuroscience, pain, anesthesia/analgesia, internal medicine and comprehensive fields. Acupuncture research has grown markedly in the past two decades, with a 2 -fold higher growth rate than for biomedical research overall. Both the increases in the proportion of RCTs and the impact factor of journals support that the quality of published research has improved. While pain was a consistently dominant research focus, other topics gained more attention during this time period. These findings provide a context for analyzing strengths and gaps in the current state of acupuncture research, and for informing a comprehensive strategy for further advancing the field...|$|R
40|$|Translating the {{attractive}} concept of collaborative adaptive management (CAM) into practice has proven very difficult. The papers {{included in this}} Special Feature explore why this is true and suggest how the challenges might be addressed. This summary highlights common themes, major challenges, and implications for research and practice. Many of the included papers emphasize the central importance of collaboration and stakeholder engagement {{as a response to}} complexity and uncertainty. Collectively, the papers make the case that a lack of knowledge about how to manage the human dynamics of comanagement poses a major challenge to implementing CAM. Human activities are the primary drivers of system change in most natural resource management systems, so attention to human dynamics is essential for developing useful change hypotheses and leading indicators that can provide useful and timely feedback for adaptive management. Institutions need to evolve to support adaptive and collaborative management processes. This will require thoughtful design of CAM processes, along with commitment of sufficient time and resources. Implementation challenges should be considered as a major focus for research rather than as simply barriers to progress. More effective ways of capturing practitioners' experiential knowledge are required to improve the practice of CAM. This Special Feature suggests that the concept of a <b>CAM</b> practitioners' <b>journal</b> has promise, but realization of that promise will require careful attention to the needs of and constraints on practitioners...|$|R
40|$|D-myo-Inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) is a {{critical}} second messenger involved in signal transduction, i. e. calcium homeostasis. InsP 3 -kinase directly regulates the levels of InsP 3 and D-myo-inositol 1, 3, 4, 5 -tetrakisphosphate (InsP 4). InsP 3 3 -kinase is a calmodulin (CaM) -dependent enzyme and is also a target for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC). Molecular cloning of cDNA's encoding proteins presenting InsP 3 3 -kinase activity establish the existence of distinct isoenzymes (at least three: A, B and C). These isoforms are differentially expressed and regulated by calcium/CaM. Site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification of InsP 3 3 -kinase A led to the identification of three charged residues involved in ATP/Mg 2 + binding among the catalytic domain and a hydrophobic residue taking part of the <b>CaM</b> binding site. <b>Journal</b> ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2014. Major: Communication Studies. Advisor: Mary Douglas Vavrus. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 259 pages. In this dissertation, I examine how CAM is discursively constructed in four major biomedical journals, The Journal of the American Medical Association, Nature, Science, and The New England Journal of Medicine, and three widely known women's popular health media sites, The Dr. Oz Show, Women's Health magazine, and Prevention magazine, {{and argue that}} risk is a major trope {{in the construction of}} CAM. In my analysis, I found that medical journals use risk discursively to circumscribe the extent to which CAM is accepted in the mainstream medical community and to reinforce institutional boundaries. In women's popular health media, I found that risk is used discursively to reinforce the importance of conventional beauty standards while also supporting CAM as a valid supplement to conventional medicine by emphasizing how using CAM may enhance or improve health. Finally, I argue that although medical journals use the risk of CAM to validate professional norms, and women's health media conflate health and appearance using CAM, women's popular health media also provide specific examples of resistance against both the construction of the riskiness of <b>CAM</b> by medical <b>journals</b> and the patriarchal discourses that inflect the popular media's coverage of CAM...|$|R
5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both <b>cam</b> and crank <b>journals.</b> Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|R
