40|$|Studies {{were made}} on the electrocardiograms and {{calculations}} of {{the two types of}} the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> in the normal horses {{as a part of the}} authors' project of electrocardiographic studies. The results thus obtained may be summarized as follows : 1. The changes of the electric potential of the ventricles and those of the endocardium caused by cardiac disorders may be recorded on the electrocardiograms in the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead.</b> 2. The electrocardiograms in leads II and III of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> I and in leads I and II of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> II were marked by high amplitudes and unvarying curves. On the contrary, in lead I of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> I and in lead III of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> II, the electrocardiograms showed small amplitudes and variable waves. It seems that these interesting facts may be caused by the relationship between the position of the electrodes and the anatomical heart axis. 3. Intricate diphasic and triphasic waves were found in 80 〜 90 % of the P waves. The appearance of this intricate type is usually recognized in the normal horse in the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> I and II. 4. Most of the PQ (PR) segments showed isoelectric waves. 5. Variation in the QRS complex in the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> I and II occurs more frequently in the former than in the latter. 6. The S wave was observed in 30 % of S_I of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> I and in S_ of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> II respectively. The other cases almost always showed the arc-curved S. 7. The monophasic negative T wave was observed in 70 〜 80 % in T_I and T_ of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> I. Diphasic waves were found in 70 - 80 % in T_I and T_ of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> II. Further, monophasic positive waves were usually observed in T_ of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> I and II. 8. It is impossible to compare the values of the amplitudes obtained in the experiment with those of the other investigators', because their selection of the electrode positions differed from that in our method. 9.

40|$|Unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> {{recorded}} in various positions {{higher on the}} chest wall, {{in addition to the}} conven-tional leads Vl to V 6, have been recommended from time to time by various authors for the recog-nition of underlying ischaemic heart disease (Rosen-baum, Wilson, and Johnston, 1946; Holtzmann, 1952; Prinzmetal, Kannamer and Massumi, 1957). They are most useful when the routine <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> are normal, but hitherto there has been little guid-ance as to when they should be recorded. In our patients the high <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> were {{recorded in}} the third intercostal space at locations perpendicular to leads Vi to V 6.

In addition, 818 standard 12 -lead tracings recorded from 332 cases of proven ischaemic heart disease over a period of five years were examined to estimate the incidence of these T wave changes in the limb leads during the evolution of myocardial infarction, when high <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> may confirm that the area ofinfarction involved a high location in the ventricles.

40|$|In {{connection}} with the serial electrocardiogram recorded {{by means of the}} limb <b>lead,</b> bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> I and II and semi-unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> were obtained on one each of 40 normal dairy cattle. The data derived from the analysis of these records can be summarized as follows : 1. In the electrocardiogram of the limb lead when the left and right olecranons and left patella were chosen for the positions of lead points, the triphasic and diphasic P wave in each lead, r type of QRS complex in lead I and R type in leads II and III, and monophasic negative and positive T waves are observed, respectively. 2. In case of the use of the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> I in which the left and right olecranons and withers were selected for the lead points, the triphasic P wave, qR and R type of QRS complex and monophasic negative T waves were observed in each lead respectively. 3. When the bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> II was employed using the withers, left shoulder blade and the apex of the heart on the left side for the lead points, W form of P wave in each lead, qR type in leads I and II, and qR, QR in lead III, and monophasic negative T wave in leads I and II, monophasic positive and diphasic waves in lead III were observed respectively. 4. In case of the use of the semi-unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead,</b> the waves in the lead at the upper portion of the heart showed negative P, and R type of QRS complex and negative T waves were also observed there. On the contrary in the lead at the apical portion of the heart, the positive P and QS type of QRS complex and positive T wave were traced. 5. On the basis of these experiments, the limb lead may not be suitable for clinical use in cattle because the variation of the electrical changes of the heart was not completely traced. The bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> I and II, however, may be applicable for clinic use, for the variation of the electrical changes of the heart were apparentely registered on the electrocardiogram. The semi-unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> may be of use in the diagnosis of disorders in the heart providing that different electrodes are placed close to the heart. From the findings described above, it may be considered that the use of bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> I and II together with semi-unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> is valuable for the clinical diagnosis of heart disorders...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY In seven {{patients}} with complete atrioventricular (AV) block, His bundle electrograms (HBEs), standard ECG recordings, bipolar esophageal ECGs and highly amplified, filtered, bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> ECGs were simultaneously recorded. The filtered <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> ECG was averaged to determine His-Purkinje activity (HPA). A simplified device, the "automated discrimination circuit, " {{was used to}} selectively eliminate the superimposed atrial and ventricular potentials that are characteristic of complete AV block and unsuitable for signal averaging. The processed <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> ECG was amenable to conventional techniques of signal averaging. In four {{patients with}} block proximal to the AV node diagnosed by HBE, there was no activity after the P wave in the surface-averaged ECGs. HPA was consistently recorded before the QRS in the surface-averaged ECG. The measurements of the HV and HPA-V intervals were very close, with a difference of < 2 msec. Three patients with block distal to the His bundle by HBE showed a loss of electrical potential before the QRS in the surface-averaged ECG, but had a consistent HPA after the P waves. The P-HPA intervals coincided well with PH intervals, with a maximal difference of 5 msec.

40|$|Background and Objectives：The {{standard}} 12 lead electrocardiography (ECG) is {{very valuable}} {{in the evaluation}} of myo-cardial infarction (MI), but it has many limitations for the diagnosis of posterior wall MI. We investigated the ECG pat-terns of the posterior <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> in the normal population and we also investigated the values of the posterior <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> when evaluating the involvement of the posterior wall in patients with MI. Subjects and Methods：To determine the nor-mal ECG patterns of the posterior <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> (V 7 - 9), 52 healthy young men undergoing military service and 60 patients with MI (acute MI: 50 patients, old MI: 10 patients) were enrolled. We compared the sensitivity and specificity between the leads V 1 - 2 and V 7 - 9 for diagnosing posterior wall MI. Results：In the normal population, the prevalence of the patholo-gic Q wave was 0 % in leads V 7 and V 8, and 7. 5 % in lead V 9. None of the controls had an ST elevation more than 0. 5 mm. For diagnosing posterior wall MI, the sensitivity was 36. 4 % for leads V 1 - 2 and 72. 7 % for leads V 7 - 9 and the specificity was 84. 2 % for leads V 1 - 2 and 86. 8 % for leads V 7 - 9. The left circumflex coronary artery lesions were more common in patients with concomittent inferior and posterior MI than in patients with isolated inferior wall MI (20. 0 % vs 6. 6 %, respectively, p=ns). All the patients with lateral wall MI or pure posterior wall MI had a lesion only in the left circumflex coronary artery. However, posterior wall involvement in patients with inferior wall MI did not exert any significant influence on the in-hospital course.

It is a widely available tool relatively inexpensive, simple to perform, and yields an instant result. AimTo determine whether heart failure (ECG) conveys prognostic and diagnostic information in {{patients with}} HF. MethodsThe study was carried out on 100 heart failure patients. All patients were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, standard 12 lead ECG (at admission, discharge, and 3 month follow up) for assessment of the following: (QRS voltage amplitude: in limb <b>leads</b> and in <b>chest</b> <b>leads,</b> total QRS voltage and transthoracic echocardiography were done for all patients (at discharge and at 3 month follow up (FU). ResultsThere were 75 males and 25 females, aged between 21 and 86 years (mean= 59. 14 ± 13. 41 years). Total QRS voltage, limb <b>leads</b> voltage and <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> voltage; all significantly increased from admission values (98. 54 ± 20. 64, 37. 87 ± 11. 06, and 60. 67 ± 15. 26 mm) to (110. 72 ± 21. 28, 43. 01 ± 11. 92, and 67. 71 ± 15. 22) at discharge (p< 0. 001 for all). Also {{there was a significant}} increase in voltage at FU (111. 72 ± 21. 28, 43. 30 ± 11. 96, and 68. 61 ± 16. 61 mm) (p< 0. 001 for all). There was a negative correlation found between left ventricular end diastolic and systolic dimensions (LVEDD and LVESD) with total QRS voltage, <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> voltage and limb leads voltage, both at discharge and at FU. The total QRS Voltage was significantly higher in patients having no lower limb (LL) edema than those with edema on admission, at discharge and on FU (p< 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractECG {{monitoring}} {{is common}} {{place in the}} hospital and even pre-hospital setting. The need for different types of lead systems in different settings has been emphasised. Simple three electrode bipolar recording is ubiquitous for monitoring. This can be used to record modified bipolar <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> as well. Using five leads gives the option of getting a <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> in addition to bipolar limb leads, enhancing detection of ischemia during procedures. Lead stability is important when the movement of the subject is maximum as in exercise testing. Mason-Likar modification with limb leads shifted to the torso is popular for exercise testing, though the diagnostic value of the ECG is altered. Lund system with leads on proximal part of limbs have both stability and fair diagnostic value. EASI lead system permits derivation of 12 leads from just five electrodes. Lewis lead and the newly devised modified limb lead system are useful in enhancing detection of atrial activity.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} done to {{determine}} whether electrocardiographic (ECG) isolated ST-segment elevation (ST↑) in posterior <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> can establish the diagnosis of acute posterior infarction in patients with ischemic chest pain and to describe the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of these patients. BACKGROUNDThe absence of ST↑ on the standard 12 -lead ECG in many patients with acute posterior infarction hampers the early diagnosis of these infarcts and thus may result in inadequate triage and treatment. Although 4 % of all acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients reveal the presence of isolated ST↑ in posterior <b>chest</b> <b>leads,</b> {{the significance of this}} finding has not yet been determined. METHODSWe studied 33 consecutive patients with ischemic chest pain suggestive of AMI without ST↑ in the standard ECG who had isolated ST↑ in posterior <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> V 7 through V 9. All patients had echocardiographic imaging within 48 h of admission, and 20 patients underwent coronary angiography. RESULTSAcute myocardial infarction was confirmed enzymatically in all patients and on discharge ECG pathologic Q-waves appeared in leads V 7 through V 9 in 75 % of the patients. On echocardiography, posterior wall-motion abnormality was visible in 97 % of the patients, and 69 % had evidence of mitral regurgitation (MR), which was moderate or severe in one-third of the patients. Four patients (12 %), all with significant MR, had heart failure, and one died from free-wall rupture. The circumflex coronary artery was the infarct related artery in all catheterized patients.

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{analysis}} of the bidomain theory in relation to anterior subendocardial ischemia. Using the static bidomain model, this analysis explains why simulations often do not produce ST depression when the ischemia is introduced into an anisotropic model. More precisely, if the ischemic border zone is represented as a smooth surface, then almost right angles between the normal vector of the border and the tangential plane of the fibers will lead to cancelling effects. The simulated transmembrane current flux, entering the ischemic region, will thus be underestimated, and the expected ST depression in <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> may not occur. We propose to solve this problem by either representing the ischemic border zone as a zigzag surface or by specifying the transmembrane current flux along the border zone, instead of the shift in the transmembrane potential. We employ the latter approach and show that this method always yields ST depression in <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> positioned above the lesion. A number of simulation studies will be presented, including clinical cases. Both the forward and the inverse problems of electrocardiography are addressed.

Most of the PQ (PR) segments showed descending and isoelectric curves. 5. The Q wave was generally observed in each lead. 6. The variation of the QRS complex being caused by the positional changes of the different electrode is as follows : On the position 2 the wave showed the negative deflection or diphasic; on the positions 3 and 4 the QRS complex takes the form of the positive wave with high amplitude; on the positions 5 and 6 the upward deflection was observed. 7. The S wave was found in the CA_ 1 〜CA_ 3,CA_ 8 and CA_ 9. The other leads almost always showed the arc curved S. 8. Diphasic wave with negative deflection after positive and negative monophasic waves was mostly observed in T wave. 9.

Results: 4 weeks and 8 weeks after chemotherapy, serum CEA, CA 15 - 3, TPS, CTGF, TGF-β, TSGF, VEGF and MK levels of both groups were significantly lower than those before chemotherapy, serum CK-MB and cTnI levels were significantly higher than those before chemotherapy, limb leads QRS amplitudes and <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> QRS amplitudes were significantly lower than those before chemotherapy, serum CEA, CA 15 - 3, TPS, CTGF, TGF-β, TSGF, VEGF, MK, CK-MB and cTnI levels of liposome group were significantly lower than those of control group, and the limb leads QRS amplitudes and <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> QRS amplitudes were significantly higher than those of control group. Conclusion: Targeted drug combined with adriamycin liposome therapy for HER- 2 -positive breast cancer can improve the curative effect and reduce the cardiotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives- Although {{exercise}} test is {{a highly}} reliable procedure for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), its value in assessing the extent and severity of CAD is yet unexplained. The present study aims to examine the relation between severity of ST segment depression in treadmill exercise test and left ventricular performance, number of involved arteries and severity of coronary artery disease. Patients and Methods- This prospective, cross-sectional case control study of 103 patients was conducted in 1995 at Shahid Rajaie Heart Center, Tehran, Iran. The inclusion criteria were a) having stable angina pectoris, having abnormal exercise test findings, being a candidate for coronary angiography and b) having abnormal coronary angiography findings and being a candidate for exercise test. Any evidence of unstable angina pectoris, or history of myocardial infarction or other heart disease comprised the exclusion criteria. Findings- ST segment depression in V 4 -V 6 <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> upon exercise test were meaningfully related to triple-vessel disease. However, no relation was found between severity and timing of ST segment depression in exercise test and triple-vessel disease. Depression of ST segment in the inferior <b>chest</b> <b>leads</b> with exercise test was an indicator of single-vessel disease; nevertheless, it did not suggest the disease of any particular vessel. No relation was observed between ST segment depression in exercise test and left ventricular dysfunction. The prevalence of ST segment elevation during exercise test was low an...|$|R
40|$|Negative U {{waves in}} the {{electrocardiogram}} are highly specific indicators of hypertensive, valvular or ischemic heart disease. Hypokalemia, on the other hand, is usually associated with large positive U waves. In this report we present a case where a routine preoperative electrocardiogram showed large negative U {{waves in the}} <b>chest</b> <b>leads.</b> Thorough cardiac evaluation ruled out any of the listed structural or functional abnormalities. At {{the time of the}} recording, the patient had profound hypokalemia. After normalization of the serum potassium, the large negative U waves resolved. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of negative U waves in hypokalemia. We offer a possible explanation for this unusual finding...|$|R
40|$|Coronary artery fistula: recanalisation after {{complete}} transcatheter coil occlusion A 56 -year-old woman {{presented with}} exertional chest discom-fort. The resting ECG showed minor repolarisation abnormali-ties in the <b>chest</b> <b>leads.</b> Coronary angiography revealed a fistula between left anterior descending artery and {{left pulmonary artery}} (figure 1 A) without any coronary stenoses. Cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed small extra-cardiac shunt. The fistula was treated percutaneously by the deployment of three Trufill platinum coils (2320, 3320, 4320 mm) through a microcatheter, resulting in complete cessation of flow (figure 1 B). The patient continued taking aspirin 75 mg daily. Initially symptoms improved, but 3 months later she returned to clinic with recurrence of discomfort. Radionuclide myocardia...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{propranolol}} on ST {{depression in the}} praecordial 16 lead electrocardiogram was observed in 52 patients before and after treatment, both at rest and after exercise. In a further 20 patients exercise tests repeated on separate days two months apart showed that the technique gave reproducible results. A variable relation between symptomatic relief and praecordial exercise-induced ST segment depression was noted. Use of a single fixed-position <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> (V 5) was shown to be less accurate. The relief of symptoms alone is probably an inadequate guide {{to the success of}} medical treatment, which should control not only angina but also the manifestations of ischaemia on the praecordial electrocardiogram...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one Shepherd {{dogs and}} 22 Karafuto dogs were examined. Limb lead (I, II&III), {{unipolar}} limb lead (aVR, aVL&aVF) and unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> (V 1 ∿V 6) were employed for these experiments. Classification {{was made of}} waves and measurements of each wave of each lead. The results are summarized as follows; 1. Arrhythmia was seen in 15 out of 21 cases in the S dogs and in 20 out of 22 cases in the K dogs. All of the arrhythmia were sinus arrhythmia including some cases of respiratory arrhythmia. The cases of sinus arrhythmia showed clinically abnormal heart sound. 2. Electrocardiogram of S dogs traced by three different kinds of lead methods are as follows. P wave mostly showed positive in each lead except for negative waves in leads aVR and V 1. PQ segment always showed flat wave paralleled with 0 -line except the waves in some cases of leads II and aVR. QRS complex may be divided into 12 types. Through out all lead recordings, qR type was mostly observed with R and Rs types being second. But the QRS complex which was constructed of only Q and S waves were observed in leads aVR, aVL and V 1. Further, no S wave was seen in leads II and aVF, and no Q wave was observed in V 3 and V 4. ST segment mostly showed the flat wave and upward waves. T wave showed mainly positive form but diphasic type was sometimes seen. Notching formation on QRS complex was traced mostly on the downward deflection of R and secondly on top of R waves. Close relation may be recognized between the form of ST segment and direction of deflection of T wave. 3. Electrocardiogram of K dogs are characterized as follows. P wave in most cases showed positive wave excepting negative one in leads aVR and V 1. PQ segment showed flat wave in limb lead, aVL and aVF, but in recordings from the unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> the segment showed downward deflection. QRS complex may be classified into 12 types. Rs and RS types were mostly seen but the QRS in aVR and aVL was mainly constructed of Q and S waves. In the unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead,</b> Q waves were not observed in recording of V 3. Upward deflection and 0 -line type of ST in limb lead, downward in aVL&aVR, and upward in unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> were respectively observed. Positive T waves were observed in most cases, but in aVR and aVL the T waves showed negative. Notchings on QRS were usually found on the downward deflection of R and next most frequently on upward deflection of R. In regard {{to the relationship between}} the forms of ST and T waves, same conclusions were reached as in the S dogs. 4. Some differences were observed between the electrocardiograms of S and K dogs, which were concerned with figure and measurement value of each wave in each lead. But fundamental differences were not observed electrocardiographically. 5. In regard to the clinical application of the electrocardiogram on dogs, the authors considered that the electrocardiograph is a useful instrument for diagnose of the heart conditions. First of all fixing method is important : the writers consider it best to put the dog on his back with extremities bandaged to the table, because the movement of the dog may be prevented during the recording of the electrocardiogram. The needle electrode is useful. The electrode is applied to the subcutaneous area under the lead position, then for some time the electrode should be kept as it is, so the injury current may be destroyed and no influence of injury currents may be recognized in the traced wave. It is needful for diagnosis of the heart condition that recording of the electrocardiogram should be made by many leads as possible. But in clinic many leads are not applied to the patient. Therefore, authors consider it practical and useful for clinical examination that diagnosis of arrhythmia be conducted by lead II of the limb lead, and then that unipolar lead be used to learn about the positional changes of the heart. Records from the unipolar <b>chest</b> <b>lead</b> are valuable for learning about the heart muscle condition especially to ascertain if there have been damages to the ventriclar muscles...|$|R
