5|$|Beginning in the 1820s, a fur trading route {{developed}} between the Red River Colony (in modern Manitoba) and the trading posts in Minnesota, first primarily at Mendota and later at Saint Paul. The system of ox cart trails {{came to be}} known as the Red River Trails and was used principally by the Métis as a way to avoid the fur trade monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company (which had absorbed the North West Company). Though this <b>cross-border</b> <b>trade</b> was entirely illegal and violated the policies of the Hudson's Bay Company, enforcement against the trade by American and British authorities was virtually non-existent. The trail system would reach its peak usage in the mid-19th century. The Hudson's Bay Company continued to expand its presence north of the U.S. border establishing new posts such as Fort Alexander and Rat Portage.|$|E

5|$|Free traders, {{independent}} of the Hudson's Bay Company and outside its jurisdiction, developed extensive commerce with the United States, making Saint Paul the principal entrepôt and link {{to the outside world}} for the Selkirk Settlement. The trade developed by and along the trails connecting Fort Garry with Saint Paul stimulated commerce, contributed to the settlement of Minnesota and North Dakota in the United States, and accelerated the settlement of Canada {{to the west of the}} rugged barrier known as the Canadian Shield. For a time, this <b>cross-border</b> <b>trade</b> even threatened Canada's control of its western territories. The threat diminished after completion of transcontinental trade routes both north and south of the border, and the transportation corridor through which the trails once ran declined in importance. That corridor has now seen a resurgence of traffic, carried by more modern means of transport than the crude ox carts that once travelled the Red River Trails.|$|E

Reaching an agreement over the Persian evacuation of Lazica and the delineation of the border in Armenia, the two envoys concluded a fifty-year peace between the two empires and their respective allies. The annual Roman subsidies to Persia would resume, but the amount was lowered from 500 to 420 pounds of gold. Further clauses regulated <b>cross-border</b> <b>trade,</b> {{which was to be}} limited to the two cities of Dara and Nisibis, the return of fugitives, and the protection of the respective religious minorities (Christians in the Persian Empire and Zoroastrians in Byzantium). In exchange for Persian recognition for the existence of Dara, whose construction had originally sparked a brief war, the Byzantines agreed to limit their troops there and remove the seat of the magister militum per Orientem from the city. As disagreements remained on two border areas, Suania and Ambros, in spring 562, Peter travelled to Persia to negotiate directly with the Persian Shah, Chosroes I, without however achieving a result.

40|$|The {{opening of}} borders in eastern Europe, {{accompanied}} by partial re-regulation and institutionalization of markets, created exceptional conditions for arbitrage {{in the form}} of <b>cross-border</b> <b>trading.</b> Whilst there is evidence that this is in decline in Central Eastern Europe, because of developments in the formal retail sector and convergence in trading and consumption, it persists as a significant alternative economic site in many other parts of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. This article explores three main aspects of <b>cross-border</b> <b>trading</b> in Trans-Carpathian Ukraine, a region at the frontier between 'colliding' economic systems. The article has three main objectives. First, it examines the roles of gatekeepers and operators, and their embeddedness in local economic and political systems. Secondly, based on a survey of 150 Ukrainian traders, it explores the socio-economic backgrounds and practices of the traders, especially gender differences, their modes of trading and capital accumulation. These are partly interpreted in terms of the uneven legacy of capital and social networks dating from the state socialist period. Thirdly, it considers the changing organizational forms of trading, especially a shift from petty <b>cross-border</b> <b>trading</b> to global sourcing of merchandise.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{integration}} of stock markets in the European Union. Theoretical background explaining the importance of developed stock market for the economy and the benefits of stock market integration is followed by the analyses of integration barriers: legislative framework of European stock markets, high costs of <b>cross-border</b> <b>trading</b> and currency risk. It is shown that the current legislative process is able to create integrated European stock market, even if the problems concerning coordination of regulation and enforcement of the directives continue. High costs of <b>cross-border</b> <b>trading</b> remain an important barrier of stock market integration as well as the currency risk.

25|$|Over 95% of <b>cross-border</b> <b>trade</b> {{within the}} region is {{unofficial}} and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to {{other countries in the}} Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including Somalia and Djibouti, generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure). This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allow disease to spread more easily across national borders.

25|$|The rate {{of human}} {{trafficking}} has directly increased in correlation with globalization. Globalization has increased <b>cross-border</b> <b>trade</b> {{and the demand}} for cheap labor; however, migration policies of the U.S. and other countries have not changed with the level of demand for cheap labor, thus forcing people illegally to immigrate. Illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles. With increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas, import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods. Their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy. Lastly, the technological advances that go hand in hand with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations.|$|E

The interior was either evacuated (Waddan, Hun and Suknan) or its posts left to isolated garrisons besieged by the Senussi and Bedouin. The Senussi objective of expelling the Italians, coincided with Ottoman war aims. In 1914, the British chose to appease the Senussi but the accession of Italy to the entente in May 1915 led to the British applying pressure to the Senussi to recognise the Italian occupation and stopping <b>cross-border</b> <b>trade.</b> The Senussi became more dependent on German and Ottoman imports and had to move to find food. The attempt by Mannesmann, a German agent, to fabricate a diplomatic incident on 15 August failed but the economic crisis caused by the British embargo pushed the Senussi towards war. The Ottoman sultan appointed Sayed Ahmed the governor of Tripolitania and Ahmed published the caliphal decree of jihad against the infidel British and their allies.|$|E

The Chinese government eventually recognised Sikkim as an Indian state in 2003, on the condition that India officially recognise Tibet as a part of China; New Delhi had originally accepted Tibet as a part of China in 1953 during the government of Jawaharlal Nehru.

40|$|A simple {{benchmark}} case {{is established}} to derive the optimum commodity tax on an externality-generating good {{that may be}} purchased abroad directly by domestic consumers. As the tax should under-cut the Pigovian level, this simple case supports the intuition that taxes should be moderated when commodities are <b>cross-border</b> <b>traded.</b> The analysis is extended in two directions. i) It is demonstrated that a fiscal tax, levied on a <b>cross-border</b> <b>traded</b> good, has more complex effects, weakening, or conceivably eliminating, the case for lowering the tax in response to cross-border shopping. Even if a tax cut alleviates distortions in favour of cross-border shopping, it would also induce a further distortion of consumption in the border region. ii) It is shown that when considering the taxation {{of more than one}} commodity purchased abroad, we should not neglect joint purchases, as done in previous research.
