The present study was undertaken to evaluate the area and personal exposure concentration of respirable particulate matters and silica in workplaces and in surrounding villages. PM 10, PM 4 and PM 2. 5 were considered for unit area measurement and PM 4 and PM 2. 5 were considered for personal exposure measurements. The ambient PM 10 and indoor respirable particulate sampling and analyses were carried out in two neighboring villages adjacent to a cluster of 100 stone <b>crushing</b> <b>units</b> in central India. The {{study was conducted in}} two years with varied seasons to provide baseline data on the existing particulate concentration with and without control intervention. Monitoring and analytical criteria were fulfilled according to the National Institute for Occupational safety and Health (NIOSH), USA protocol. The study reports the higher particulates and respirable silica with respect to the national and international guidelines in and around the study units. However, in nearby villages, the particulate concentrations and silica were comparatively less.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the personal exposure to respirable dust and quartz and in stone <b>crushing</b> <b>units</b> located at west of Iran. A size of 40 personal samples and 40 stationary samples were obtained and analysis was done by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results of personal sampling were shown the concentrations of respirable dust exposure level in workers of process, hopper and drivers were 1. 90, 2. 22, 1. 41 times greater than Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit (OSHA PEL). The average value of total dust and respirable dust emission from stationary sources was 9. 46 mg/m 3, 1. 24 mg/m 3 respectively, showing that 13. 8 % of total dust is respirable. The efficiency of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) to control of particles inside of industrial units was greater than 99 %. It is concluded from this research the particulate generated from stone crushing activities contain a significant amount of respirable particle. The amount of free silica in stone quartz is 85 to 97 percent that emission of particles effect to health workers.

India would require more than 6. 3 billion liters of ethanol to meet its ambitious target of 20 % EBP by 2017. Sweet sorghum is a promising dryland adapted biofuel feedstock that addresses food-versus-fuel issue favourably. Owing to its genetic variability in terms of stalk sugar traits such as total soluble sugars, green stalk yield, juice quantity and grain yield various research institutes in India and abroad have developed superior varieties and hybrids.

Limestone waste is obtained as a by-product during {{the production of}} aggregates through the crushing process of rocks in rubble <b>crusher</b> <b>units.</b> Using quarry waste as a substitute of sand in construction materials would resolve the environmental problems caused by the large-scale depletion of the natural sources of river and mining sands. This paper reports the experimental study undertaken to investigate the influence of partial replacement of sand with limestone waste (LSW), with marble powder (M.

Besides, proportions of 5 %, 10 % and 15 % marble powder were practiced in the concrete mixes. The effects of limestone waste as fine aggregate on several fresh and hardened properties of the concretes were investigated. The investigation included testing of compressive strength, indirect tensile strength, flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, and permeability. It was found that limestone waste as fine aggregate enhanced the slump test of the fresh concretes. But the unit weight concretes were not affected. However, the good performance was observed when limestone waste as fine aggregate was used in presence of marble powder...|$|R

These two processes were studied and {{compared with a}} view to implementation in an industrial unit. The various factors of hydrothermal treatment for conditioning the beans were studied at different scales (batch from 2 kg to 100 kg, and continuous flow at 100 kg/h) and the results showed the need for moist cooking to effectively deactivate the antitrypsin factors (FAT) while maintaining protein solubility. The extrusion-pressing was more effective for deoiling cakes than cookingpressing (5. 4 vs. 6. 7 %) but less robust for deactivation of FAT (6. 5 vs. 3. 8 TIU/mg). The techno-economical study was carried out to simulate the crushing costs and net margins of both processes in a plant capacity of 20 000 t / year. It showed that the costs of both methods were similar (about 33  €/t).
