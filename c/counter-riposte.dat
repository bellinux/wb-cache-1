50|$|When one sets up {{a second}} {{intention}} attack, the reactions of one's opponent must be predicted. A fencer may execute an attack expecting to be parried, preparing to counter-parry and <b>counter-riposte.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In Fencing, with a parry, {{the defender}} guides or checks the attacker's sword away from himself, rather than endure {{the force of}} a direct block; it likely is {{followed}} by riposte and <b>counter-riposte.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In Bare-Knuckle Boxing or Pugilism, with a parry, {{the defender}} guides or checks the attacker’s blow away from himself, {{attempting}} {{to cause the}} attacker to over commit to his blow and allow an easy riposte and <b>counter-riposte.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Erving Goffman {{points out}} that every 'crack or remark set up the {{possibility}} of a <b>counter-riposte,</b> topper, or squelch, that is, a comeback'. He cites the example of possible interchanges at a dance in a school gym: * A one-liner: Boy: [...] "Care to dance?" [...] Girl: [...] "No, I came here to play basketball" [...] Boy: [...] "Crumbles"* A comeback: Boy: [...] "Care to dance?" [...] Girl: [...] "No, I came here to play basketball" [...] Boy: [...] "Sorry, I should have guessed by the way you're dressed".|$|E
5000|$|Feint (or second intention) attack: An action {{which has}} all the {{attributes}} of a real attack (either simple or compound) apart from the intention of hitting the opponent. Feint attacks aim to provoke a specific reaction (such as a parry-riposte or a counterattack), which the attacker can then counteract to his own advantage (to keep with earlier examples, through a planned <b>counter-riposte</b> or counter-time respectively). In other words, one does not attack with the first movement(s) or intention, but, rather, attacks with a second intention, the goal {{of which is to}} provoke a specific reaction from the open end. It is analogous to counter-punching in boxing or martial arts.|$|E
