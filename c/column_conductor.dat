40|$|Nonvolatile {{electronic}} memory devices that store {{data in the}} form of electrical- resistance values, and memory circuits based on such devices, have been invented. These devices and circuits exploit an electrically-variable-resistance phenomenon that occurs in thin films of certain oxides that exhibit the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) effect. It is worth emphasizing that, as stated in the immediately preceding article, these devices function at room temperature and do not depend on externally applied magnetic fields. A device of this type is basically a thin film resistor: it consists of a thin film of a CMR material located between, and in contact with, two electrical conductors. The application of a short-duration, low-voltage current pulse via the terminals changes the electrical resistance of the film. The amount of the change in resistance depends {{on the size of the}} pulse. The direction of change (increase or decrease of resistance) depends on the polarity of the pulse. Hence, a datum can be written (or a prior datum overwritten) in the memory device by applying a pulse of size and polarity tailored to set the resistance at a value that represents a specific numerical value. To read the datum, one applies a smaller pulse - one that is large enough to enable accurate measurement of resistance, but small enough so as not to change the resistance. In writing, the resistance can be set to any value within the dynamic range of the CMR film. Typically, the value would be one of several discrete resistance values that represent logic levels or digits. Because the number of levels can exceed 2, a memory device of this type is not limited to binary data. Like other memory devices, devices of this type can be incorporated into a memory integrated circuit by laying them out on a substrate in rows and columns, along with row and <b>column</b> <b>conductors</b> for electrically addressing them individually or collectively...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} many reasons to {{consider}} a re-engineering of engineering education. New materials, new design, new manufacturing and assembly processes and methods, new models, new tools, and new application areas. We will first {{focus is on the}} implication on regular university education from these factors and from the Bologna process initiated in Europe for university education in general. Then we will elaborate on what this means to the actors in continuing engineering education. Background Engineering education has slightly different traditions in different countries [1]. In Sweden, the roots are from the mining schools in the early eighteen hundreds. Initially the education was mainly practical but during the 20 th century, there was a gradual shift towards theory and science. Today there is rather little direct connection between the academic curricula {{and the role of the}} professional engineer in industry. Science and math are the core components of the first two years in the curricula. The rationale is that the engineer is expected to use equations and formulas to be able to compute dimension or values of beams, shafts, rods, <b>columns,</b> resistors, <b>conductors,</b> etc., for each component or syste...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} problem-solving procedures to troubleshoot electrostatic accelerators. A novel technique to diagnose issues with high-voltage components is described. The main application of this technique is noninvasive testing of electrostatic accelerator high-voltage grading systems, measuring insulation resistance, or determining the volume and surface resistivity of insulation materials used in column posts and acceleration tubes. In addition, this technique allows verification of {{the continuity of the}} resistive divider assembly as a complete circuit, revealing if an electrical path exists between equipotential rings, resistors, tube electrodes, and <b>column</b> post-to-tube <b>conductors.</b> It is capable of identifying and locating a “microbreak” in a resistor and the experimental validation of the transfer function of the high impedance energy control element. A simple and practical fault-finding procedure has been developed based on fundamental principles. The experimental distributions of relative resistance deviations (ΔR/R) for both accelerating tubes and posts were collected during five scheduled accelerator maintenance tank openings during 2013 and 2014. Components with measured ΔR/R>± 2. 5 % were considered faulty and put through a detailed examination, with faults categorized. In total, thirty four unique fault categories were identified and most would not be identifiable without the new technique described. The most common failure mode was permanent and irreversible insulator current leakage that developed after being exposed to the ambient environment. As a result of efficient in situ troubleshooting and fault-elimination techniques, the maximum values of |ΔR/R| are kept below 2. 5 % at the conclusion of maintenance procedures. The acceptance margin could be narrowed even further by a factor of 2. 5 by increasing the test voltage from 40  V up to 100  V. Based on experience over the last two years, resistor and insulator failures are less common now due to the routine use of the noninvasive ultrahigh impedance technique...|$|R
