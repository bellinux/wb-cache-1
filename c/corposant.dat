60|$|Heeding him not, Babbalanja {{advanced}} {{toward the}} fore-most {{of those with}} the thongs,--one Nulli: a cadaverous, ghost-like man; with a low ridge of forehead; hair, steel-gray; and wondrous eyes;--bright, nimble, as the twin <b>Corposant</b> balls, playing about the ends of ships' royal-yards in gales.|$|E
60|$|She {{comes up}} nobly, but the {{laterals}} buffet her {{left and right}} like the pinions of angry angels. She is jolted off her course four ways at once, and cuffed into place again, only to be swung aside and dropped into a new chaos. We are never without a <b>corposant</b> grinning on our bows or rolling head over heels from nose to midships, and to the crackle of electricity around and within us is added once or twice the rattle of hail--hail that will never fall on any sea. Slow we must or we may break our back, pitch-poling.|$|E

[71] It is {{remarkable}} that when Dante, in 1297, as a preliminary [...] condition to active politics, enrolled {{himself in the}} guild of [...] physicians and apothecaries, he is qualified only with the title [...] poeta. The arms of the Alighieri (curiously suitable to him who [...] sovra gli altri come aquila vola) were a wing of gold {{in a field of}} [...] azure. His vivid sense of beauty even hovers sometimes like a [...] <b>corposant</b> over the somewhat stiff lines of his Latin prose. For [...] example, in his letter to the kings and princes of Italy on the [...] coming of Henry VII: [...] "A new day brightens, revealing the dawn which [...] already scatters the shades of long calamity; already the breezes of [...] morning gather; the lips of heaven are reddening!" ...|$|E

They say the red-coats ashore have had their turn of fortune, {{and it is time}} we honest seamen look out for our squalls. I have doubled the Horn, brothers, in a King's ship, and I have seen the bright cloud that never sets, and have held a living <b>corposant</b> in my own hand: But these are things which any man may look on, who will go upon a yard in a gale, or ship aboard a Southseaman: Still, I pronounce it uncommon for a vessel to see her shadow in the haze, as we have ours at this moment for there it comes again!--hereaway, between the after-shroud and the backstay--or for a trader to carry sail in a fashion that would make every knee in a bomb-ketch work like a tooth-brush fiddling across a passenger's mouth, after he had had a smart bout with the sea sickness." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Two Years Before the Mast, Richard Henry Dana, Jr. {{describes}} {{seeing a}} <b>corposant</b> in the Horse latitudes {{of the northern}} Atlantic Ocean. However, {{he may have been}} talking about ball lightning; as mentioned earlier it is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo's fire: [...] "There, directly over where we had been standing, upon the main top-gallant mast-head, was a ball of light, which the sailors name a <b>corposant</b> (corpus sancti), and which the mate had called out to us to look at. They were all watching it carefully, for sailors have a notion, that if the <b>corposant</b> rises in the rigging, it is a sign of fair weather, but if it comes lower down, there will be a storm".|$|E

40|$|Recently {{an active}} debate & {{discussion}} between architects, urban planners, landscapers & specialists {{on the loose}} of identity in our Arab country & cities is hold. An identity in progress loss {{which is due to}} the degradation of our public spaces morphology & to the applied imported design from urban western school. Western theory of public space design & management which were applied on traditional Arab cities that evolved over centuries by a long process of urban evolution, traditions & customs. Western urban theories that also generated the creation & the management of the contemporary Arab cities. Those Imported theory inspired from western citizen moral values & traditions were blindly cloned and applied all over the Arab world. The implementation of such imported urban principal over our cities had leaded to the creation of abnormal & unaccustomed cities that traditions & costumes differ from those of the west. The public & private spaces which were the canvas on which citizens had drew stealthily & during centuries their traditions & customs impregnate with religion. In the Arab world the religious have constituted the main <b>corposant</b> which have influenced & created Arab cities fabrics. Arab cities that could be identified according to their structure & especially to the typology & the relation between the public & private realm that could be classified in two categories: “Arab Christian cities” or “Arab Islamic cities”. A deep & objective look into the traditional Arab urban tissues could reveal urban norms if applied & modernized could contribute to the creation of contemporary urban tissues more coherent & sustainable. Cities in which Muslims and Christians could live in homogenous synchrony. Cities in which different religions shall respect each other private & public space unified by its common heterogeneous public spaces...|$|E
