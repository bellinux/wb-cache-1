40|$|The {{effects of}} malonic acid {{derivatives}} and acetic acid derivatives as coadsorbents on the photovoltaic performance of D 908 dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO 2 solar cells were investigated. Each of phenylmalonic acid (PMA) and cyclopentylacetic acid (CPEAA) coadsorptions was revealed to improve both the photocurrent and the photovoltage {{of the solar}} cells. The improved photocurrent was {{probably due to the}} suppression of self-quenching of the excited electrons in the dyes by <b>coadsorption</b> of PMA or CPEAA on the TiO 2 that increased in the electron-injection yields from the dye to the TiO 2. The improved photovoltage was probably due to suppression of recombination between the injected electrons and ions on the TiO 2 surface. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy indicated that PMA or CPEAA <b>coadsorption</b> increased the content of bound dye on the TiO 2 surface. This result suggests that PMA or CPEAA <b>coadsorption</b> improved the photocurrent of the solar cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that PMA or CPEAA <b>coadsorption</b> on the TiO 2 surface increased the charge recombination resistance (R 2) and decreased the diffusion resistance in the electrolyte (R 3).

40|$|Systematic {{periodic}} density functional calculations {{were conducted}} to clarify the mechanism for donors to exert steric and electronics influences on propylene polymerization using heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalysts. It was concluded that TiCl_ 4 preferentially adsorbs as mononuclear species on the MgCl_ 2 (1 1 0) surface, and the <b>coadsorption</b> of donors with it is energetically viable. The <b>coadsorption</b> of donors on the (1 1 0) surface reinforces the electron density of the Ti mononuclear species, and sterically transfers the underlying C_ 2 symmetry to convert the originally aspecific mononuclear species into isospecific one. The nearest <b>coadsorption</b> of ethylbenzoate (EB) not only sterically induces the isospecificity of the Ti mononuclear species but also electrostatically improves the regiospecificity in propylene insertion. In addition, EB prevents sterically-demanding chain transfer to propylene, increasing the molecular weight of the produced polypropylene.

The current-voltage characteristics under illumination and incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs showed that the <b>coadsorption</b> of DCA with the PCA dye results in a significant improvement in short circuit photocurrent and slight increase in the open circuit photovoltage, which lead to an overall power conversion efficiency. The enhancement of short circuit current was attributed to the increased electron injection efficiency from the excited state of PCA into the conduction band of TiO 2 and charge collection efficiency. The current-voltage characteristics in dark indicates a positive shift in the conduction which also supports the enhancement in the photocurrent.

40|$|High {{pressure}} {{high temperature}} CO adsorption and <b>coadsorption</b> with ethylene and propylene on Pt(111) was monitored in situ with infrared-visible sum frequency generation (SFG). At high pressures and high temperatures, CO dissociates on a Pt(111) surface to form carbon. At 400 torr CO pressure and 673 K, CO modifies the Pt(111) surface through a carbonyl intermediate, and dissociates to leave carbon on the surface. SFG {{was used to}} follow the CO peak evolution from monolayer adsorption in ultra high vacuum (UHV) to 400 torr CO pressure. At this high pressure, a temperature dependence study from room temperature to 823 K was carried out. Auger electron spectroscopy was used to identify carbon on the surface CO <b>coadsorption</b> with ethylene and CO <b>coadsorption</b> with propylene {{studies were carried out}} with 2 -IR 1 -visible SFG. With this setup, two spectral ranges covering the C-H stretch range and the CO stretch range can be monitored simultaneously. The <b>coadsorption</b> study with ethylene reveals that after 5 L ethylene exposure on a Pt(111) surface to form ethylidyne, CO at high pressures cannot completely displace the ethylidyne from the surface. Instead, CO first adsorbs on defect sites at low pressures and then competes with ethylidyne for terrace sites at high pressures. Propylene <b>coadsorption</b> with CO at similar conditions shows that propylidyne undergoes conformation changes with increased CO pressure and at 1 torr, is absent from the Pt(111) surface. Experiments on CO poisoning of ethylene hydrogenation was carried by 2 -IR 1 -visible SFG. At 1 torr CO, 10 torr ethylene and 100 torr hydrogen, CO was found to block active sites necessary for ethylene hydrogenation, Above 425 K, CO desorbs from the surface to allow ethylene hydrogenation to occur.

The preference for the adsorption site (atop versus hcp) is analyzed with density of states diagrams. Hydrogen layers can be densely packed; 1 ML could, in fact, correspond to more than 100 % coverage, where 100 % coverage would correspond to one addatom for each metal atom on the surface.

Within the potassium coverage range which has been examined in this study (theta sub K = 0. 10 - 0. 25 ML), <b>coadsorption</b> of about 0. 5 ML of oxygen results in the formation of a (3 x 3) pattern which is peculiar to the <b>coadsorption</b> of alkalis and oxygen on Ni(100). This structure is stable against further oxygen uptake or against adsorption of other species such as CO. However by means of O 1 s XPS and XAS observations an overall potassium enhanced oxidation rate of about two orders of magnitude has been determined. The O 1 s XPS data show that oxygen coadsorbed with K on Ni(100) is still bonded primarily to Ni and thus rule out the formation of potassium oxide or other K sub x O sub y compounds such as peroxide or superoxide. The line-shape analysis of the K 2 p XPS data show that upon oxygen <b>coadsorption</b> the alkali metal layer undergoes a metal-insulator type of transition.

The work function changes induced by O on the K precovered surface are consistent with the formation of a bi-layered structure in which oxygen is adsorbed underneath the alkali metal layer at K coverages above the work function minimum. However it was found that the alkali-induced minimum of the work function is not related to the occurrence of structural properties, in particular the formation of the (3 x 3) structure, or electronic properties such as the metal-insulator transition of the K layer.

We address the effect of surface chemistry by considering a numerical model of disordered porous carbons which has been modified to include heterochemistry (with a chemical composition consistent {{with that of the}} experimental sample).

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{extensive}} calorimetric study of krypton coadsorbed on graphite precoated with a saturated monolayer of carbon tetrachloride. Combining the heat capacity data with film equation of state measurements from a previous study [W. J. Weber and D. L. Goodstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3888 (1999) ] permits construction of the Kr/CCl 4 <b>coadsorption</b> phase diagram between 77 and 130 K. Kr succeeds in displacing the CCl 4 from the surface, by a continuous process which results, at lower temperatures, in a film indistinguishable from that of pure Kr adsorbed on graphite. At higher temperatures, a new first-order phase transition, unique to the <b>coadsorption</b> system, is observed and likely indicates a transition to a mixed Kr/CCl 4 film. Finally, measurements at higher Kr coverages reveal evidence for a high temperature extension of the reentrant layering phenomena previously observed for Kr on graphite...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} coadsorbed CO on {{potassium}} surface diffusion on Ru(001) {{has been studied}} using coverage grating-optical second harmonic diffraction method. The enhancement of the first-order diffraction peak at 0. 06 ML of CO <b>coadsorption</b> coverage demonstrates the very strong electronic interaction between these coadsorbates. At an initial potassium coverage of 1. 0 ML, the activation energy for the diffusion of K increases from 2. 7 kcal/mol on the clean ruthenium surface to 17. 0 kcal/mol {{in the presence of}} 0. 06 ML CO. At 280 K, the diffusion rate coefficient drops from D) 6. 4 10 - 10 cm 2 /s on clean ruthenium to D) 1. 5 10 - 14 cm 2 /s as a result of CO <b>coadsorption.</b> CO and K stabilize each other upon the formation of Ky-COx surface complexes that increase the apparent activation energy for potassium diffusion, thereby slowing its diffusion rate. 1...|$|E
40|$|SSurface {{enhanced}} Raman spectroscopy(SE:RS) {{has been}} used to study the electrochemical <b>coadsorption</b> of TU at silver electrodes in solutions containing nitric acid,sulphur ic acid and perchloric acid respectively or any, two of them. It was found that these different anions can br induce-coadsorbed simultaneously oil the silver surface through the protonated amino group of TU in the mixed acids system. The <b>coadsorption</b> ability of the anions are in the order of SO 42 - >NO 3 - > ClO 4 - at the potentials of greater than or equal to- 0. 6 V or SO 42 - > ClO 4 - > NO 3 - at the potentials of {{less than or equal to}} - 0. 8 V. The stability of TU on the surface of Ag electrode depends not only on the electrode potential but also on the nature of electrolyte anions coadsopbed...|$|E
40|$|Subject of {{the present}} work is the {{diffusion}} of adsorbed particles on single crystal planes, which is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and analyzed quantitatively. By evaluation of the atomic motion of oxygen atoms on Ru(0001) it is demonstated, how {{the transition from the}} microscopic to the macroscopic description of diffusion can be realized experimentally. Computer-aided image processing permits the statistical evaluation of long sequences of several thousands of atomic configurations, which were recorded with a fast STM system that allows frame rates of up to 20 frames per second. On the one hand, this enables the measurement of the jump rate of isolated oxygen atoms at room temperature as well as the influence of the mutual O-O interaction on that rate over distances of up to 3 lattice constants; from these data the pair potential can be derived. On the other hand the chemical diffusion coefficients were directly determined at various coverages by analysis of the particle number fluctuations. These are found to be in agreement with the microscopic jump rates under consideration of the mutual O-O interaction. Additionally, variable-temperature measurements on the diffusion of sulfur on Pt(111) with <b>coadsorption</b> of CO are reported. For the diffusion of sulfur an activation energy of 550 meV is found. <b>Coadsorption</b> of CO leaves this activation energy unchanged, however, the prefactor is increased by two orders of magnitude by <b>coadsorption</b> of half a monolayer of CO. Various models for this behavior are discussed...|$|E
