50|$|The Court of Appeal all {{held that}} the Board was in breach of contract, and that breach caused damage to the farm. The {{agreement}} showed the intention that the obligation would attach to the land, {{and it would not}} matter whose hands the land came into: the owner could enforce the covenant. Because the covenant ran with the land, under section 78 Law of Property Act 1925 it could be enforced by the <b>covenantee</b> and successors in title. Denning LJ's notable decision went as follows.|$|E
5000|$|A {{covenant}} {{is a type}} {{of contract}} in which the covenantor makes a promise to a <b>covenantee</b> to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (negative covenant). In real property law, the term real covenants is used for conditions tied to the use of land. A [...] "covenant running with the land", also imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes. Real covenant law in the United States has been referred to as an [...] "unspeakable quagmire" [...] by one court.|$|E
50|$|A prior, {{a tenant}} in fee simple, covenanted with the Lord of the Manor {{that he and his}} convent would sing for mass each week in the manor chapel. The {{plaintiff}} was the <b>covenantee's</b> successor, a tenant in tail. He sued to enforce the covenant.|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{covenants}} {{have received}} scant attention internationally {{as a tool}} for providing conservation. This paper examines their use in New Zealand where they have been almost the sole policy measure in protecting land under private ownership. Under these covenants landowners or managers surrender some of their property rights in perpetuity in return for little if any compensation. The motivation for this is important in understanding their applicability to other situations. A survey of <b>covenantees</b> in the Canterbury region of New Zealand did highlight a high proportion had entered the covenant for altruistic reasons the main attraction being protection in perpetuity. Whilst the covenanted land was managed less intensively three quarters had alternative uses mainly development and forestry implying a not insignificant positive opportunity cost for <b>covenantees.</b> However on the commercially managed holdings the covenanted land was only a small part. The survey highlights the fact that landowners or managers are more willing to providing conservation than may be expected given an appropriate mechanism. Conservation covenants may therefore have wider appeal especially where there are limited resources. They are suited best to areas of land which are small proportions of commercial holdings; uncontroversial and well defined management prescriptions which are static; little active management; and little conflict between the conservation and other objectives for the land...|$|R
50|$|The River Douglas Catchment Board {{agreed with}} a number of landowners between the River Douglas and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal) to carry out some work if some {{contribution}} to the cost was given. In 1940 Mrs S, one of the <b>covenantees,</b> sold her land ("Low Meadows") to Smith, which incorporated Snipes Hall Farm Ltd in 1944. In Autumn 1946 the Ellen Brook burst its banks and flooded Smith and Snipes Hall Farm land. They made a claim against the Board for damages in tort and breach of contract. The question was whether not having been privy to the original agreement was a bar to any recovery.|$|R
50|$|Unlike an easement, a {{covenant}} {{can only be}} acquired through agreement or possibly by an assurance, but not by prescription. In the most famous case, Tulk v Moxhay the owner {{of what is now}} Leicester Square promised a neighbour he would not erect buildings, but the subsequent purchaser (who knew of this deal) tried to build. Lord Cottenham LC held that a prior covenant may bind future owners if the covenant touched and concerned the land, the original <b>covenantees</b> intended the covenant to bind future owners, and the future owners with the same land had notice of the covenant. Under Law of Property Act 1925 section 78, successors in title to the person named to benefit from the covenant are deemed to have standing to enforce the covenant and Law of Property Act 1925 section 79 codified the presumption that {{a covenant}} is to be not personal, but proprietary, and binding on successors in title. That presumption, however, can be rebutted by construction of agreements between the neighbours. This happened in Morrells of Oxford Ltd v Oxford United Football Club where Robert Walker LJ held that Morrell's pub could not get an injunction against the Oxford UFC building a pub, because although Oxford UFC's predecessor had promised not to in 1962, the document failed to use language indicating successors would be bound in the pub clause, when it did in other clauses. A controversial aspect of covenants is that courts only enforce ones which restrict land's use, and thus far have refused to enforce covenants that require positive expenditure. In Rhone v Stephens this meant that a house owner could not be required to repair his roof, which protected a cottage underneath from water. Lord Templeman viewed this would contradict the rule that someone should not be made liable to a contract when they have not been privy to it. This has been mitigated slightly when all neighbours have reciprocal benefits and burdens. Halsall v Brizell held that if some Liverpool estate dwellers had the benefit of using the estate roads, drains, promenade, and sea walls, they could be required to pay for its upkeep. Covenants are enforceable, generally, through injunctions, but may also (if an injunction would be oppressive) enforceable through a payment of damages reflecting the loss of the right. For instance in Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd a developer who built homes in breach of a restrictive covenant was ordered by Brightman J to pay 5% of his anticipated profits in compensation. Finally, applications to the Land Tribunal may be made for declarations to extinguish covenants under Law of Property Act 1925 section 84 if it is obsolete, the beneficiary would lose little, or has implicitly agreed, or it impedes a reasonable user of land and the beneficiary can be compensated.|$|R
