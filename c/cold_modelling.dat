40|$|The {{quality of}} as-cast ingots and {{continuous}} cast products {{are controlled by}} solidification process mainly. Regarding to this, investigation on casting and solidification process of ingots and continuous cast products is considerable important {{in control of the}} quality of as-cast products especially for products with extremely heavy weight like several hundred tons. The present work focuses on the solidification process of large ingots. The complex solidification phenomena in large ingots have been investigated by means of three modelling methods, namely hot modelling, <b>cold</b> <b>modelling</b> and numerical modelling. In hot modelling, two series of ingot casting experiments has been performed for ingots with weight of 100 kg and 500 kg with various parameter combinations. The large ingots with weight of 500 kg solidify slowly in a specially designed isolating mould with the solidification time over several hours, and this slow solidification process simulates the solidification of industrial scale large ingots with weight between 3 to 6 t. Cooling curves have been measured by thermocouples during solidification, and as-cast structure and macrosegregation of solutes have been quantified. Based on this, solidification in large ingots has been investigated and three solidification regimes have been suggested and discussed. A-type Segregations could be produced in the laboratory for detailed studies. Meanwhile, water modelling (<b>cold</b> <b>modelling)</b> by using NH 4 Cl solution has been conducted with different cool conditions and initial solution temperature. A quasi 2 -D water model has been built up with glass and aluminium, where hot saturated NH 4 Cl solution are poured in and crystallized subjected to cooling conditions. During precipitation of solid NH 4 Cl, phenomena such as dendritic growth and sedimentation of crystals are similar to those in ingots solidification, therefore NH 4 Cl solution is used as transparent analog to provide information of the solidification process in large ingots. Besides the experimental work, numerical modelling of ingot solidification has been performed as well. A two-phase solidification model based on volume-averaging-technique has been developed. This solidification model has been applied for the ingots with weight of 100 kg and 500 kg, and the simulation results have been compared with the experimental results regarding as-cast structure and macrosegregation. Furthermore, a channel-segregation model has been developed for the determination of the A-type segregation formation. The effects of carbon concentration and flow velocity of the solute enriched melt on the widening and closing of the potential channel have been investigated. Overall, solidification in large ingots has been investigated experimentally and numerically. The relationship among as-cast structure, local solidification driving force and solidification sequence in large ingots has been intensively studied, and the formation mechanism of A-segregation has also been explored...|$|E

We present the tuning procedure of the IPHI aluminium <b>cold</b> <b>model,</b> that is (i) adjusting coupling capacitances and dipole rods for optimum stability and (ii) tuning the 96 slugs to achieve constant inter-vane voltage. Fields inside RFQ quadrants are measured by a fully automated bead-pull system. Tuning this 6 -meter long <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> is a comprehensive training in view of the future tuning of the copper RFQ with the variable voltage profile. THE IPHI <b>COLD</b> <b>MODEL</b> A 6 -meter aluminum <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> has been built to validate the tuning procedure of the IPHI RFQ. To tune it, several devices have to be adjusted at different steps of machining and assembling. The <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> can be divided in 2 -meter long segments with capacitive coupling in-between which can be set by additional shims (Figure 1). The tuning of the segment end regions is made by machining the thickness of the end and coupling plates, and by dipole rods length adjustments. Finally, irregular tuners distribution and RF inputs will be used to achieve the setting of the inter-vane voltage. Here, we will work with 24 slug tuners and 2 RF ports (used as slugs) per quadrant for the tuning procedure of the model (Figure 2). Moreover a fully automated test bench has been developed to measure the field distribution [1]. Based on the perturbation method, a bead is guided successively through 4 quadrants and field distribution of excited mode is obtained.

40|$|Experimental <b>cold</b> <b>modelling</b> of hearth {{drainage}} {{was performed}} at Bluescope Steel Research Laboratories {{to understand the}} impact of variable drainage rate on slag removal. These drainage studies were designed to simulate real operational aspects such as: continuous casting, variable tapping rate and inflow liquid distribution. During the analysis of these drainage experiments it was demonstrated that the residual-flowout correlation in use since the 1970 &# 146;s may possibly be incomplete or inaccurate. The removal of slag from the blast furnace hearth is the greater concern of the two liquids produced in the iron making process. In the 1970 &# 146;s operational difficulties arose when large volumes of residual slag remained in the furnace after casting. This prompted research related to the flow of viscous liquids through uniformly packed beds providing fundamental insight on {{the most effective means}} of removal of slag from the blast furnace hearth. The core subject of this study, the residual-flowout correlation developed by Fukutake and Okabe that is used to predict cast duration and liquid accumulation in the blast furnace hearth is discussed in detail. The residual-flowout correlation is examined for four different sets of conditions based on constant or increasing slag drainage, with and without liquid dripping. The outcome of this study will improve our understanding of the residual-flowout relationship and develop it further, so that drainage conditions whether for constant or increasing drainage rates, with or without dripping, will hold using the one general Fl equation...|$|E
40|$|The work by H. K. Worner and {{co-workers}} at CRA in the 1960 s, and early 1970 s, established that molten metals could be refined continuously utilising counter current flow {{of metal and}} slag. Worner also demonstrated that counter current refining could produce highly refined metal products. These developments coincided {{with the advent of}} high intensity metallurgical reactors in both the ferrous and non-ferrous industries (e. g. BaS, Q-BOP and later Sirosmelt) that utilised high levels of gas injection to produce rapid stirring and very fast reaction. These new generation of high intensity metallurgical reactors allowed high tonnage rates through relatively small volume vessels. Whilst, {{it is well known that}} the counter current flow of reacting phases offers the potential of efficient mass transfer and high purity products, the application of counter current reactors to molten metal/slag systems has been criticized on the basis that they suffer from either low intensity or, alternately, from poor refining due to excessive dispersion. These criticisms relate to the balance between intensity and the refining capacity of a reactor. That is, whilst high levels of mixing transversely to the direction of flow promotes high mass transfer, longitudinal mixing (dispersion) is detrimental to refining. Of course, mixing in one direction invariably leads to mixing in other directions, thus creating a playoff between high mass transfer and excessive dispersion. This balance between intensity and refining has been the subject of recent studies overseas, and at the University of Wollongong, using <b>cold</b> <b>modelling</b> techniques to evaluate the effect of mixing on dispersion in a counter current refining launder. These studies have shown that for a given geometry and mixing regime, dispersion decreases with increasing flow of liquid phases. This means that whilst high mass transfer cannot be achieved in a refining launder without sacrificing the degree of refinement, there is no impediment to achieving high productivity through such a system, in fact, high through puts may favour good refining. Thus, it may be possible to match a high productivity smelting operation with a equally productive counter current refining stage...|$|E
40|$|The Vanyukov Process is a {{nonferrous}} bath smelter incorporating side {{injection of}} the blast into a slag-matte emulsion. Used primarily for the smelting of copper and nickel sulphide ores, a claimed advantage over other commercial nonferrous smelters is the phenomena of coalescence of matte droplets in the bath. The subsequent increase {{in the rate of}} phase separation step is thought to lead to an increase in the overall efficiency of the process. The study of coalescence and breakage of dispersed phases in agitated emulsions has concentrated primarily upon mechanically stirred systems, where dispersed and continuous phases are approximately the same density. Gas agitated systems are less well reported and studies into coalescence in the Vanyukov process are the least published. The technique of <b>cold</b> <b>modelling</b> has been utilised by a range of researchers to address fluid flow issues, particularly in the steel industry. The methods are equally applicable to studies into nonferrous systems, and this was the experimental technique used in this study. A 1 / 6 scale model using an aqueous/paraffin oil analogue was adopted to represent a tuyere section from a Vanyukov Reactor. Digital cameras and image analysis was used {{in the study of the}} relationship between gas flow rates and mean droplet diameters. The effect of tuyere diameter on droplet diameters was also assessed. Analysis of droplet dispersions indicated that the use of digital camera technology was acceptable, however the technical specification of the camera had a significant bearing upon results generated. Of the two cameras utilised, both showed the same trend between gas flow rate and mean droplet diameter. However, the camera with improved feamres of high resolution and S-VHS signal processing, produced clearer images allowing more accurate measurement of droplets. In particular, droplets in the range 50 to l(X) |Lim could be measured, improving the accuracy of the results obtained. The results indicate that a relationship between gas flow rate and droplet size exists. It was observed that a maximum droplet size is obtained with a gas flow rate of 961 /min, which equates to 430 Nm^/m^/h in a full scale Vanyukov reactor. For flow rates lower than this value, coalescence is less likely to occur, and for flow rates increasing from 96 to 140 1 /min, a steadily decreasing mean droplet diameter is observed. No relationship was found between tuyere diameter and mean droplet diameter, over the gas flow rates and diameters studied...|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of bubbles}} within metallurgical vessels {{is important to}} crucial aspects of their operations, such as mass transfer, heat transfer and splash generation. Physical models {{have been used to}} investigate different aspects of bubbling and provide data for verification of mathematical models. In industry, spout eye area, which is formed while the gas escapes from the liquid surface during bottom gas stirring process, has been used to monitor the process. Vibration signals on the wall of vessels have also been measured in industry to monitor the gas flow. Sound signals of the bubbling have been correlated with different behaviour of the gas bubbles inside the bath, such as bubble formation, distortion, coalescence, volumetric oscillation and detachment. It is clear that these three types of signal, i. e. image from the disturbed top surface, sound of the bubbling and vibration {{on the wall of the}} vessel are all generated from the same physical process, and indicate some aspect of the bubbling phenomena. This study focuses on the investigation of the combined effect of all these three types of signals, which were collected simultaneously in well controlled cold model experiments, based on multivariate statistical analysis techniques. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of monitoring bubble flow with a combined signal, which depends on the variables that can be reliably measured, and if possible, how to simplify this combined signal from the large data base which carries all the information of the process. <b>Cold</b> <b>modelling</b> experiments were performed to establish techniques to analyse all these three types of signals simultaneously and quickly. A cylindrical cold model with a diameter of 420 mm and height of 500 mm, based on both dimensional and dynamic similarity criteria, was used to collect different types of signals simultaneously over a wide range of flowing conditions. The depth of the water bath which simulates steel was kept at 210 mm, and motor oil, which simulated slag, the height varied from 5 mm to 20 mm. Pressured gas were injected from the bottom of the vessel through a nozzle with a diameter of 3 mm, and the volume flow rate varied from 2. 0 l/min to 20. 0 l/min. Images of the disturbed top surface and sound of the bubbling signals were collected by a digital video camera installed above the vessel and vibration signals were collected by an accelerometer installed on the wall of the vessel. The size of the spout eye area was calculated by a threshold technique developed in this study, which takes approximately 0. 1 second to analyse each frame of the image files in average, and the sound and vibration signals were pre-treated in both time domain and frequency domain. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was applied in this study to investigate the data base collected from the cold model experiments. The results from PCA demonstrated that the three types of signals are highly correlated and can be combined into one latent variable, which explains most (about 86 %) of the total variation of the cold model experiments, and this latent variable can indicate the stirring process inside the bath effectively, because there exists a clear linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 96) between this latent variable (dominant principal component) and stirring power which was calculated from the same cold model data. Since there are established relationships between the overall mass transfer coefficients and inclusion removal rate with stirring power, it should be possible to predict the metallurgical operations inside the bath using this latent variable. The possibility of indicating the stirring process by just one or two channels of signals was further investigated and the PCA results showed that the signals from just one channel can only provide limited indication of the system, however, the combined signal from sound and vibration can capture most of the variation of the process (about 88 % of the total variation except the image signals), and there is also a clear linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 95) between stirring power and the latent variable which combined the signals from sound and vibration. This finding suggests new type of sensor can be developed, which can be applied to monitor the gas stirring process and provide a feedback signal for the control system, based on combination of vibration and sound signals alone. This finding is particularly important for the pyrometallurgical operations where it is difficult to install a digital camera above the vessel. The relationship between stirring power and Froude number, which is generally applied as a dynamic criteria for the gas bubbling phenomena, was investigated and the results showed that there is a clear linear relationship between the combined signal and Froude number specifically defined. A new variable 'BF (bubbling factor) ' was defined in this study based on the combined signal of sound intensity and vibration magnitude. PCA results based on the cold model data showed that BF can capture most variation of the process (91. 3 %), and a strong linear relationship was found between bubbling factor and stirring power (R 2 = 0. 92), which demonstrate that BF can monitor the bubble flow effectively and can be applied to predict the metallurgical operations inside the bath. Additionally, statistical analysis based on the cold model data showed that the sampling period can be reduced to 2. 0 seconds to collect sufficient information about the stirring process inside the bath, which means that the bubbling factor can give a feed back signal every two seconds. These findings should facilitate the development of online sensors that monitor the stirring process quickly and effectively, based on sound and vibration signals from the process...|$|E

To this end, a lab-scale <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> was first designed based on the empirical equations and scaling laws. The scaling laws was used to scale down the Tenaga Nasional Berhad-PETRONAS (TNBR-PETRONAS) pilot plant gasifier into a small scale laboratory model. Moreover, the empirical equations were utilized to determine the critical parameters such as bed pressure drop, height of the bed, number of orifices of the distributor plate and the pitch size. Finally a lab-scale hot flow model will be designed based on the <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> geometric dimensions but under a real operating conditions {{as that of a}} pilot plant...|$|R
40|$|The spiral {{structure}} of the Milky Way can be simulated by adopting percolation theory, where the active zones are produced by the evolution of many supernova (SN). Here we assume conversely that the percolative process is triggered by superbubbles (SB), the result of multiple SNs. A first thermal model takes into account a bursting phase which evolves in a medium with constant density, and a subsequent adiabatic expansion which evolves in a medium with decreasing density along the galactic height. A second <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> follows the evolution of an SB in an auto-gravitating medium {{in the framework of}} the momentum conservation in a thin layer. Both the thermal and <b>cold</b> <b>models</b> are compared with the results of numerical hydro-dynamics. A simulation of GW~ 46. 4 + 5. 5, the Gould Belt, and the Galactic Plane is reported. An elementary theory of the image, which allows reproducing the hole visible {{at the center of the}} observed SB, is provided.

40|$|To predict loads on {{propellers}} in ice, model {{tests can}} be used. Using regular (refrigerated) <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> ice in ice basins {{is a valid}} option. However, these tests are expensive, difficult to reproduce and bound to time and location, due to the required cooling in ice model basins. An alternative would be to use warm model ice, a material with the properties of model ice at room temperature. This paper proposes one variety, using only materials available from DIY 1 stores. Based on theoretical propeller-ice interaction models, {{it is assumed that}} the loads come from a crushing process. Hence, the compressive strength follows as dominant material property of ice. To match compressive strength of weak <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> ice, a large particle composite is proposed. Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) beads are used as particles, with paraffin as matrix to produce warm ice specimens. The compressive strength of these specimens were measured with a uniaxial compression test and matched with weak model ice. The specimens were designed for in-situ use in model scale propeller impact tests...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for predicting heat transfer coefficients in hot fluidized-bed combustors by translating results measured in a scaled-down, <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> bed. Provided the beds are scaled to hydrodynamic similarity, local heat transfer coefficients {{measured in the}} <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> bed can be translated into local hot-bed convective coefficients {{with the aid of}} existing correlations for the gas and particle convective components. To obtain the total hot-bed-to-surface coefficients, a radiative component is then added. The chief advantages of the proposed method are that existing convective heat transfer correlations can be applied locally in a bed, and that no a priori knowledge of the voidage close to the transfer surface is required. In a previous paper by Almstedt and Zakkay, measurements of the bubble activity in a pressurized fluidized-bed burning coal and in a scaled-down pressurized model bed operating at room temperature showed that a good hydrodynamic similarity can be obtained between the beds. The heat transfer translation method proposed here has been validated by comparing heat transfer coefficients measured in the same two beds, operating under scaled conditions. Average heat transfer coefficients for four different horizontal tube bundles, as well as local coefficients measured with probes in four different positions were compared. The results indicate good agreement between the hot-bed results measured and the results translated from the model bed measurements employing the proposed method. Furthermore, the present paper presents heat transfer measurements from the <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> bed for three different bed materials, at pressures of 0. 1, 0. 24 and 0. 5 MPa and fluidization velocities ranging from 0. 15 to 1. 3 m/s. The results are in good accordance with existing theory, but indicate that the gas convective component (as well as the particle convective component) is significantly dependent on the fluidization velocity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} evaluate the lateral mixing processes of bed material in bubbling fluidized beds. The method combines experiments and mathematical modeling and has the aim to constitute a tool for {{the investigation of the}} complex solids mixing phenomenon in fluidized bed units. The experimental method used is based on indirect measurements of a tracer agent. A batch of tracer is fed {{in one corner of the}} bed and the amount of tracer agent which traversed the bed is measured over time in a corner, diagonally opposite to the tracer feed point. The mathematical model is based on solving a diffusion-like partial differential equation describing the transient lateral dispersion of particles. From this, values of the lateral dispersion coefficient can be obtained. The method is applied to evaluate the lateral solids mixing in a fluid-dynamically downscaled 3 -dimensional <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> with cross-sectional dimensions of 0. 3 m x 0. 3 m. The <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> can be operated with a variable bed height up to 0. 16 m. Since the <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> is designed according to Glicksman’s full set of scaling laws the fluid dynamics is assumed to resemble that of an industrial-scaled bubbling fluidized bed operated at 900 °C with cross-sectional dimensions of 1. 5 m x 1. 5 m and bed heights up to 0. 8 m. The results show good qualitative agreement between experimental results and the mathematical modeling and it is concluded that the macroscopic lateral solids mixing behavior in the bed geometry investigated can be described by a diffusion-like partial differential equation. Four superficial gas velocities are investigated and the lateral dispersion coefficients obtained are found to increase steadily over the range of the superficial velocities investigated...|$|R

Motivated by the objective to employ a simple and robust accelerating structure at a resonance frequency of 352 MHz for the high energy part of Linac 4 (100 – 160 MeV), the normal conducting LEP cavity is restudied and its design is adopted for a medium application. The geometry of the accelerating cell is optimised, the necessary cell-to-cell coupling coefficient is analysed and a novel solution for {{the shape of the}} coupling slots is discussed.

40|$|To {{innovate}} an {{easy and}} economic way for removal of solid char product from a fixed-bed fire-tube heating pyrolysis reactor the fluid dynamics studies on its <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> are essential. Thus, {{two types of}} fluid dynamics experiments {{have been carried out}} on a <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> of the pyrolysis reactor: (i) to determine the ejection pressure of the solid char from the reactor, which was carried out {{with the help of an}} air compressor and artificial solid char and (ii) to investigate the flow pattern inside the reactor chamber during ejection of char that was conducted by laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurement and flow visualization test. The experimental results show that variation of char ejection pressure with respect to superficial air velocity always follows a polynomial of second-degree. The normalized pressure should be reached to a value about 1. 7 with a corresponding normalized superficial air velocity nearly to 1. 0, to be started the char product blown out from the reactor model properly. The LDV measurements and visualization test ensure that the spiral char exit port is not able to create a rotary motion inside the reactor chamber during the removal of solid char...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} for {{high quality steel}} especially high steel cleanliness has increased in recent years due to the rapid development of new technologies such as thin strip casting and new products such as ultra low carbon steel for deep drawing quality, which require high steel cleanliness. This {{has led to the}} development of the role of the tundish to enhance the removal of inclusions from steel. Two mathematical models have been developed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters on the removal efficiency of inclusions in a tundish. The first model was applied to predict the removal efficiency of the particle in a tundish without gas injection. Both models assumed that the fluid flow in the tundish consists of three regions; plug flow, mixed flow and dead flow region. In the plug flow region of flrst model, it was assumed that the removal efficiency of the particle was governed by Stoke rising velocity. The removal of partide in the mixed flow region was assunried to follow the kinetics of the flrst-order law. The dead region was not involved in the partide transfer process. The second model was devebped to predwt the rennoval effidency of particles in a tundish bubbled by gas. The transfer process of partk^le in the plug and dead flow region were assumed similar to the first model. In the mixing region, it was assumed that the removal of particles mainly occurs due to the adhesion of indusion to bubbles. The flotation rate of the partide therefore was assumed to be governed by collision efficiency between particles and bubbles. <b>Cold</b> <b>model</b> experiments were carried out to validate the proposed mathematical models. It was found that, the results from the first mathematical model were in good agreement with the results obtained from <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> experiments for a tundish without gas injection. Both mathematical and <b>cold</b> <b>model</b> experimental results showed that the efficiencies of particle removal in a tundish slightly increased with increasing fluid depth and decreased with increasing casting rate. It was also found that the removal efficiency of the particles was greatly dependent on the particle size. As predicted by the mathematicat model for removal of particles in a tundish bubbled by gas, the renrwival efficiency of partides in tfie tundish increased with increasing gas flow rates injected in tundish. Cold nrKXiel experiments showed the similar pattern wifri this mathematical prediction. <b>Cold</b> <b>model</b> experiments also indicated that at high gas flow rate the removal of particles decreased t) ecause of the reentrainment of the particles...|$|R
