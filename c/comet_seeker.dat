50|$|For example, in 1842 a 4-inch (10 cm) {{aperture}} <b>Comet</b> <b>Seeker</b> {{was added}} to Markree Observatory, which was used to discover 9 Metis in 1848.|$|E
50|$|A <b>comet</b> <b>seeker</b> {{is a type}} {{of small}} {{telescope}} adapted especially to searching for comets: commonly of short focal length and large aperture, in order to secure the greatest brilliancy of light.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{these basic}} optical types {{there are many}} sub-types of varying optical design {{classified}} by the task they perform such as astrographs, <b>comet</b> <b>seekers,</b> solar telescope, etc.|$|R
50|$|Later a 5-foot (1.5m) {{transit and}} a 3-foot (0.9m) Meridian Circle, fitted with an {{interchangeable}} 7-inch (17.75 cm) glass were added, {{which was the}} largest {{at that time in}} 1839. In 1842 a 4-inch (10 cm) <b>Comet</b> <b>Seeker</b> was added.|$|E
5000|$|Charles {{was soon}} {{replaced}} at Harvard by {{his younger brother}} Horace, who joined Truman Henry Safford, Sidney Coolidge, and Asaph Hall as observatory assistants. Horace became attached to a four-inch Merz <b>comet</b> <b>seeker,</b> which he placed on the balconies of the 15-inch refractor, spending many nights in search of new comets.|$|E
50|$|In 1848, Cooper’s assistant, Andrew Graham, {{discovered}} the asteroid 9 Metis with the <b>Comet</b> <b>Seeker.</b> Graham resigned his post at Markree in 1860, but continued his research at Cambridge Observatory {{until his retirement}} in 1905. E.J. Cooper died in 1863, but the observatory remained active until the death of Edward Henry Cooper MP in 1902.|$|E
5000|$|In 1887 Tuttle had a 6.5 inch broken-back {{reflecting}} <b>comet</b> <b>seeker</b> {{made for}} him by John Brashear. It was installed [...] "on the tin roof of the Naval Observatory." [...] A similar refractor cometseeker by Brashear is in the Naval Observatory collection. Here he made his last comet discovery, a recovery of Comet 1888V Barnard.|$|E
5000|$|On 25 April 1848, Graham {{used the}} Ertel <b>comet</b> <b>seeker</b> at Markree to {{discover}} a ninth minor planet.It was named [...] "9 Metis" [...] {{at the suggestion of}} the late Dr. Robinson, because its detection had ensued from the adoption of a plan of work laid down by Cooper.9 Metis was the only asteroid ever discovered by observation from Ireland,until the 2008 discovery of TM9.|$|E
50|$|From May to August, the comet's {{position}} made {{it difficult}} to spot because of its low altitude and the evening twilight. Both Flaugergues and Olbers were able to recover it in Leo Minor during August, Olbers noting a small but distinct tail, consisting of two rays forming a parabola, when viewing through a <b>comet</b> <b>seeker.</b> By September, in Ursa Major, it was becoming a conspicuous object in the evening sky as it approached perihelion: William Herschel noted that a tail 25° long had developed by October 6.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} the 20th century that they were {{gradually}} superseded by large reflecting telescopes for professional astronomy. A great refractor was often the centerpiece of a new 19th century observatory, but was typically used with an entourage of other astronomical instruments such as a Meridian Circle, a Heliometer, and Astrograph, and a smaller refractor such as a <b>Comet</b> <b>Seeker</b> or Equatorial. Great refractors were often used for observing double stars and equipped with a Filar micrometer. Numerous discoveries of minor planets, satellites, the planet Neptune, and double stars were made, and pioneering work on astrophotography was done, with great refractors.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, two observing domes were {{erected in}} the grounds {{north of the}} main building. These have diameters of 5 m and 3 m, resp. They house a Zeiss Cassegrain {{telescope}} (500 mm aperture, 7500 mm focal length) and a refractor with coudé focus (150 mm aperture, 2250 mm focal length). Two further domes {{on the roof of}} the main building house an astrograph (120 mm aperture, 600 mm focal length) and the historic Urania Refractor of 1888, which was transferred from the Berlin Urania. Two further shelters with roll-off roof on top of the main building contain a <b>comet</b> <b>seeker</b> (250 mm aperture, 1620 mm focal length) and a Newtonian telescope (250 mm aperture, 1978 mm focal length).|$|E
