40|$|This {{technology}} enables {{detection and}} measurement of x-rays in an x-ray polarimeter using a {{field-programmable gate array}} (FPGA). The technology was developed for the Gravitational and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer (GEMS) mission. It performs precision energy and timing measurements, as well as rejection of non-x-ray events. It enables the GEMS polarimeter to detect precisely when an event has taken place so that additional measurements can be made. The technology also enables this function to be performed in an FPGA using limited resources so that mass and power can be minimized while reliability for a space application is maximized and precise real-time operation is achieved. This design requires a low-noise, charge-sensitive preamplifier; a highspeed {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC); and an x-ray detector with a <b>cathode</b> <b>terminal.</b> It functions by computing a sum of differences for time-samples whose difference exceeds a programmable threshold. A state machine advances through states as a programmable number of consecutive samples exceeds or fails to exceed this threshold. The pulse height is recorded as the accumulated sum. The track length is also measured based on the time from the start to the end of accumulation. For track lengths longer than a certain length, the algorithm estimates the barycenter of charge deposit by comparing the accumulator value at the midpoint to the final accumulator value. The design also employs a number of techniques for rejecting background events. This innovation enables the function to be performed in space where it can operate autonomously with a rapid response time. This implementation combines advantages of computing system-based approaches with those of pure analog approaches. The result is an implementation that is highly reliable, performs in real-time, rejects background events, and consumes minimal power...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of solid tantalum capacitors {{are produced by}} high-temperature sintering of a fine tantalum powder around a tantalum wire followed by electrolytic anodization that forms a thin amorphous Ta 2 O 5 dielectric layer and pyrolysis of manganese nitrite on the oxide to create a conductive manganese dioxide electrode. A contact to tantalum wire is used as anode terminal and to the manganese layer as a <b>cathode</b> <b>terminal</b> of the device. This process results in formation of an asymmetric Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 [...] MnO 2 capacitor that has different characteristics at forward (positive bias applied to tantalum) and reverse (positive bias applied to manganese cathode) voltages. Reverse bias currents might be several orders of magnitude larger than forward leakage currents so I-V characteristics of tantalum capacitors resemble characteristics of semiconductor rectifiers. Asymmetric I-V characteristics of Ta [...] anodic Ta 2 O 5 systems have been observed at different top electrode materials including metals, electrolytes, conductive polymers, and manganese oxide thus indicating that this phenomenon is likely related to {{the specifics of the}} Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 interface. There have been multiple attempts to explain rectifying characteristics of capacitors employing anodic tantalum pentoxide dielectrics. A brief review of works related to reverse bias (RB) behavior of tantalum capacitors shows that the mechanism of conduction in Ta [...] Ta 2 O 5 systems is still not clear and more testing and analysis is necessary to understand the processes involved. If tantalum capacitors behave just as rectifiers, then the assessment of the safe reverse bias operating conditions would be a relatively simple task. Unfortunately, these parts can degrade with time under reverse bias significantly, and this further complicates analysis of the I-V characteristics and establishing safe operating areas of the parts. On other hand, time dependence of reverse currents might provide additional information for investigation of the processes under reverse bias conditions. In practice, there were instances when, due to unforeseen events, the system operated at conditions when capacitors experience periodically a relatively small reverse bias for some time followed by normal, forward bias conditions. In such a case an assessment should be made on the degree to which these capacitors are degraded by application of low-voltage reverse bias, and whether this degradation can be reversed by normal operating conditions. In this study, reverse currents in different types of tantalum capacitors were monitored at different reverse voltages below 15 %VR and temperatures in the range from room to 145 C for up to 150 hours to get better understanding of the degradation process and determine conditions favorable to the unstable mode of operation. The reversibility of RB degradation has been evaluated after operation of the capacitors at forward bias conditions. The effect of reverse bias stress (RBS) on reliability at normal operating conditions was evaluated using highly accelerated life testing at voltages of 1. 5 VR and 2 VR and by analysis of changes in distributions of breakdown voltages. Possible mechanisms of RB degradation are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{resonant}} tunneling diode (RTD) {{has found}} numerous applications in high-speed digital and analog circuits {{due to the}} key advantages associated with its folded back negative differential resistance (NDR) current-voltage (I-V) characteristics {{as well as its}} extremely small switching capacitance. Recently, the RTD has also been employed to implement high-speed and compact cellular neural/nonlinear networks (CNNs) by exploiting its quantum tunneling induced nonlinearity and symmetrical I-V characteristics for both positive and negative voltages applied across the anode and <b>cathode</b> <b>terminals</b> of the RTD. This paper proposes an RTD-based CNN architecture and investigates its operation through driving-point-plot analysis, stability and settling time study, and circuit simulation. Full-array simulation of a 128 128 RTD-based CNN for several image processing functions is performed using the Quantum Spice simulator designed at the University of Michigan, where the RTD is represented in SPICE simulator by a physics based model derived by solving Schrödinger’s and Poisson’s equations self-consistently. A comparative study between different CNN implementations reveals that the RTD-based CNN can be designed superior to conventional CMOS technologies in terms of integration density, operating speed, and functionality.

30|$|Biocathodes can be {{categorized}} into two groups: aerobic and anaerobic biocathodes. In aerobic biocathodes, oxygen is a terminal electron acceptor and hydrogen peroxide is an intermediate. Transition metals such as iron and manganese act as electron mediators between the electrode and oxygen. Fe (III) is reduced to Fe (II) by electrons generated from the biofilm, which is subsequently oxidized by oxygen. In this way, electrons are transferred from the <b>cathode</b> to the <b>terminal</b> electron acceptor, oxygen in this case [72]. In anaerobic type conditions, where oxygen is not present, nitrates and sulfates can be terminal electron acceptors. Figure 7 shows a biocathode in which biofilm catalyze the reduction of chemical active species such as nitrate and oxygen. The cathodic potentials of nitrate, manganese and iron are comparable to oxygen. In addition, an anaerobic biocathode has the advantage by preventing the loss of electrons through oxygen, which may diffuse to the anode through PEM.|$|R
