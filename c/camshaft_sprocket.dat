50|$|Chrysler {{has made}} various {{revisions}} to the 5.7 L for the 2009 model year. The first for all applications is what Chrysler calls Variable Camshaft Timing or VCT. VCT (which is essentially variable valve timing) uses an oil control valve which controls oil flow to a unique <b>camshaft</b> <b>sprocket</b> which contains a phasing device, which depending on {{the operation of the}} oil control valve either advances or retards camshaft timing.|$|E
50|$|In September 1989 the Series II of the VN Commodore was {{released}} with the EV6 engine. Some {{of the changes}} included a new cast exhaust manifold, new <b>camshaft</b> <b>sprocket</b> profile and timing chain, improved air and fuel distribution to combustion chamber, recalibrated ignition and injector firing within the engine management computer, wider conrod bearings and revised throttle uptake. The automatic transmission was also recalibrated to match the new engines torque characteristics. These revisions helped reduce initial torque levels whilst also improving the noise and vibration levels of the V6 engine.|$|E
50|$|For the 1990 model year, all Blazers {{now had a}} {{standard}} rear wheel anti-lock braking system. A new electronic speedometer system, with a 6 digit odometer on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990, along with non-asbestos brake linings. A new brake warning light on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990. The Blazer body also used double sided, galvanized exterior sheet metal. A new option for 1990 was power mirrors. The 5.7-liter V-8 (L05) engine was improved for 1990 {{with the addition of}} improved oil control rings, a redesigned rear crankshaft seal, a new <b>camshaft</b> <b>sprocket</b> design, non-asbestos intake manifold gaskets, and heavy-duty intake valves.|$|E

50|$|And for 1991, the 700R4 {{was renamed}} to 4L60. The TBI (throttle body injection) system {{used on the}} Blazer's {{standard}} 5.7-liter V-8 had longer throttle shaft bearings, new throttle return springs, and improved fuel mixture distribution. The 5.7-liter V-8 also had new heavy-duty intake valves and powdered metal <b>camshaft</b> <b>sprockets.</b> Standard on all engines was a lighter more powerful 100-amp CS130 alternator. Two new exterior colors, Brilliant Blue and Slate Metallic were offered.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines often use a timing chain {{to drive the}} camshaft(s). This is {{an area in which}} chain drives frequently compete directly with timing belt drive systems, particularly when the engine has one or more overhead camshafts, and provides an excellent example of some of the differences and similarities between the two approaches. For this application, chains last longer, but are often harder to replace, as they must be enclosed in a space into which lubricating oil can be introduced. Being heavier, the chain robs more power, but is also less likely to fail. The camshaft of a four stroke engine rotates at half crankshaft speed, so the <b>camshaft</b> <b>sprocket</b> has twice as many teeth as the crankshaft sprocket. Less common alternatives to timing chain drives include spur gears or bevel gears combined with a shaft.|$|E
50|$|Additional engine changes {{include a}} lighter <b>camshaft</b> <b>sprocket</b> and {{increased}} valve spring pressure (two springs per intake valve) which allow for higher revving. There are new piston rings that slide with less friction and increased internal engine oil flow. Redline is now 14,200 rpm, 700 rpm {{higher than the}} previous year's F4. To increase the bike's pulling capabilities at high speeds, 5th and 6th gears have been shortened slightly and the rear sprocket was enlarged from 45 teeth to 46.Also adding one clutch plate for greater durability to now making 8. The oiling holes in the camshafts have been enlarged by 0.5 mm (to 2.5 mm) and piston ring friction has been decreased to aid cooling at the higher rev ceiling. Spring pressures on the intake and exhaust valves have been increased to avoid valve float. Also, there are now two valve springs (inner and outer) on the intake side instead of the single item that resides on the exhaust side.|$|E
50|$|The {{timing chain}} was {{hydraulic}} tensioned {{and had a}} ratchet mechanism to keep the chain tight. The timing chain rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper timing chain guide in between the <b>camshaft</b> <b>sprockets.</b> The timing chain was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different timing chain sets.|$|R

5000|$|In the SOHC design, the {{camshaft}} operates the valves directly, traditionally via a bucket tappet; or via an intermediary rocker arm. [...] SOHC cylinder heads are generally {{less expensive to}} manufacture than double overhead camshaft (DOHC) cylinder heads. Timing belt replacement can be easier since there are fewer <b>camshaft</b> drive <b>sprockets</b> {{that need to be}} aligned during the replacement procedure.|$|R
5000|$|The 4A-FE is {{different}} from the 4A-GE in terms of performance and power. Although both have the same displacement and are DOHC, they were optimized for different uses. The first obvious difference are the valves, the engine's intake and exhaust valves were placed 22.3° apart (compared to 50° in the G-Engines). The second is that it employed a [...] "slave cam system", the camshafts being geared together and driven off one <b>camshaft's</b> <b>sprocket</b> (both camshafts' sprockets on the G-Engine are rotated by the timing belt). Some of the less directly visible differences were poorly shaped ports in the earlier versions, a slow burning combustion chamber with heavily shrouded valves, less aggressive camshaft profiles, ports of a small cross sectional area, a very restrictive intake manifold with long runners joined to a small displacement plenum and other changes. Even though the valve angle is closer to what is considered in some racing circles to be ideal for power (approximately 25 degrees), its other design differences and the intake which is tuned for a primary harmonic resonance at low RPM means that it has about 10% less power compared to the 4A-GE engine. This engine design improves fuel efficiency and torque, but compromises power. Power rating varied from 100-105 hp in the US market. Late-model engines are rumored to make slightly greater power but still received a 105 hp rating.|$|R
25|$|This {{model of}} SHO gained a {{reputation}} of being trouble-prone due to {{a large number of}} engine failures at around the 50,000-mile mark due to separation of the <b>camshaft</b> from its <b>sprocket.</b> However, this problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded. Possibly because of this, this generation of SHO sold substantially worse than its predecessor, with sales peaking at 9,000 in 1997. As a result, the SHO was discontinued outright after the 1999 model year.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the SHO V8 engine, widespread problems with the cam sprockets began to surface. Yamaha had used a relatively unusual method, called [...] "swaging", of affixing the cam <b>sprockets</b> to the <b>camshafts.</b> The cam <b>sprockets</b> were fastened to the hollow camshafts by forcing a metal ball which was slightly larger than the interior diameter of the camshaft {{through the center of the}} camshaft, thus expanding the metal slightly and creating a mechanical bond between the cam <b>sprocket</b> and the <b>camshaft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A 235 hp (175 kW) {{aluminum}} 3.4 L V8 engine {{with heads}} from Yamaha and block from Cosworth was specified for the SHO model, {{but it was}} given the same four speed transmission as the LX: the manual gearbox option was no longer offered on the SHO. Separation of the <b>camshaft</b> from its <b>sprocket</b> has been implicated in {{a growing number of}} engine failures, at around 50,000 miles (80,000 km). [...] This problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded. [...] The number of engines with failure has been documented at about 1,200 out of about 20,000 engines. [...] Other undocumented cases very likely exist. There was no SHO for the 2000 model year, some believed that the then President of Ford Motor Company Jac Nasser influenced the designers not to design a SHO model for he was focusing on the Premier Automotive Group that consisted of Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo, Aston-Martin and Land Rover built under that umbrella and the SHO would detract sales to that division of Ford Motor Company.|$|R
