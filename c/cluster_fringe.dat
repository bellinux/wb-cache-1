50|$|For {{the second}} half of the nineteenth-century, leaders of the Connexion pursued a policy of {{alignment}} with the mainstream. What had been birthed as a strident protest against staid religiosity was drifting back in that direction. The temperance movement, the Sunday School movement, and the Bible societies all served as avenues of service through which Connexion members could demonstrate to other denominations the many similarities this <b>cluster</b> of once <b>fringe</b> bodies now shared with the major religious organizations.|$|R

Here and there among the tombs and headstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the long green grass. The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight; the lilac, the hawthorn and the <b>clustering</b> meadowsweet which <b>fringed</b> {{the edge of the}} lazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy fragrance. The yellow-grey crumbling walls were green in places with wrinkled harts-tongues, and were topped with sweet-williams and spreading house- leek and stone-crop and wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for the drowsy repose of perfect summer.|$|R
40|$|An {{augmented}} {{theory of}} cooperative behavior is presented. This game-theoretic model details two obstacles to cooperation which often arise when stakeholders are negotiating local land-use conflicts. First, protracted involvement from outsiders can deter long-run cooperation. Second, if stakeholders fail {{to frame the}} expected pay-offs from cooperating similarly [...] both their ethical stances and their choices of language [...] then their likelihood of successful cooperation is reduced. Case studies of communities divided about whether and where to site livestock facilities in the rural-urban <b>fringe</b> (<b>clustering)</b> are invoked to demonstrate how deadlock can occur, even where long-term collaboration would appear more cost-effective than ongoing conflict between neighbors.

Yellow stripe-throated males ("sneakers") do not defend a territory, but <b>cluster</b> on the <b>fringes</b> of orange-throated lizard territories, and mate with the females on those territories while the orange-throat is absent, as the territory to defend is large. Blue-throated males are less aggressive and guard only one female; they can {{fend off the}} yellow stripe-throated males but cannot withstand attacks by orange-throated males. Orange-throated females lay many small eggs and are very territorial. Yellow-throated females lay fewer, larger eggs, and are more tolerant of each other.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade the ‘creative cluster’ has become a driver of urban renewal in China. Many cluster {{developments}} attract human capital and investment to post-industrial spaces. This paper looks at two developments which are more post-agricultural than post-industrial: the first is Songzhuang, a large scale contemporary art community situated on the eastern fringe of Beijing, the second is Hangzhou’s White Horse Lake Creative Eco-City, a ‘mixed variety’ cluster model which integrates elements of art, fashion, design and animation. The common factor in both cases is how they came into existence. In both districts urban creative workers moved into a rural environment. Drawing on interviews with planners, officials, and residents we investigate the challenges of sustaining such <b>fringe</b> <b>clusters...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{evolution}} of the Edinburgh fringe festival illustrates the dialectic between cultural and business entrepreneurship (Lee, 2012). Begun spontaneously by theater troupes that showed up {{to take advantage of}} the audience potential generated by an official festival, the phenomenon was labeled by a journalist who defined its identity, much like the naming of Silicon Valley, after the semi-conductor <b>cluster</b> appeared. The <b>Fringe</b> festival engendered an informal support organization that was eventually formalized under pressure of fringe festival growth but elected representatives still represent performers. The fringe has become a networking and booking venue for individuals and groups, across a wide range of popular and performing arts. Demonstrating the attractive power of an anchor cluster, it is a tourist attraction in its own right alongside the official International Arts Festival.|$|R

Specifically, the economic change will include property valuation change for residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural classes of property. A mapping of valuation changes in this region depicts the major shifts in capital wealth. Overall, a growing metro core city is ringed by high growth urbanized <b>clusters</b> at the <b>fringe.</b> Nonurbanized cities located within 20 miles of the metro core also grew strongly. Residential values declined in the core city while growing dramatically in the suburban fringes. Commercial values grew strongly in the metro core and even more so in the western suburbs.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a remarkable equivalence in structure measured by total X-ray scattering methods between very small metallic nanoparticles and bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), thus connecting two disparate fields, shedding {{new light on}} both. Our results show that for nanoparticle diameters < 5 nm the structure of Ni nanoparticles changes from fcc to the characteristic BMG-like structure, despite them being formed from a single element, an effect we call nano-metallic glass (NMG) formation. However, high-resolution TEM images of the NMG <b>clusters</b> exhibit lattice <b>fringes</b> indicating a locally well-ordered, rather than glassy, structure. These seemingly contradictory results may be reconciled by finding a locally ordered structure that is highly isotropic and we show that local icosahedral packing within 5 atomic shells explains this. Since this structure is stabilized only {{in the vicinity of}} a surface which highlights the importance of the presence of free volume in BMGs for stabilizing similar local clusters.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how representative wear scars of simulator-tested polyethylene (PE) inserts compare with retrieved PE inserts from total knee replacement (TKR). By means of a nonparametric self-organizing feature map (SOFM), wear scar images of 21 postmortem- and 54 revision-retrieved components were compared with six simulator-tested components that were tested either in displacement or in load control according to ISO protocols. The SOFM network was then trained with the wear scar images of postmortem-retrieved components since those are considered well-functioning at the time of retrieval. Based on this training process, eleven clusters were established, suggesting considerable variability among wear scars despite an uncomplicated loading history inside their hosts. The remaining components (revision-retrieved and simulator-tested) were then assigned to these established clusters. Six out of five simulator components were clustered together, suggesting that the network was able to identify similarities in loading history. However, the simulator-tested components ended up in a <b>cluster</b> at the <b>fringe</b> of the map containing only 10. 8 % of retrieved components. This may suggest that current ISO testing protocols were not fully representative of this TKR population, and protocols that better resemble patients’ gait after TKR containing activities other than walking may be warranted...|$|R
40|$|The 2009 case Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine) {{presented}} the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{with an opportunity}} to define and give meaning to the ambiguous and disputed phrase in Article 121 (3) : “[r]ocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own. ” The Court declined to provide a definitive definition for these words in its opinion, but by determining that Ukraine’s tiny Serpents’ Island should have no impact whatsoever on the maritime boundary, the Court reconfirmed that small uninhabited islands will generally have limited or no impacts on delimitations and that such features should not generate extended maritime zones. Serpents’ Island (also called Snake Island and Ostrov Zmeinyy) is virtually the only island in the Black Sea, except for a few that hug the coasts. It has 0. 17 square kilometers of land area (forty-two acres or seventeen hectares) and is thirty-five kilometers (about twenty nautical miles) east of the Danube Delta (also called Dragon’s Beard), 4 which forms the border between Ukraine and Romania. It lacks freshwater resources and has never been inhabited historically, although it has had a lighthouse on it since the 1800 s and recently Ukraine has built structures and a pier on it, apparently to strengthen its claim to the ocean space around it. Its name is said to have come from the snakes that lived in a temple built on the islet in ancient times. The ocean space around it has become a focus of great interest because recent explorations have indicated that high-quality oil and substantial amounts of natural gas may be found around this islet. Although sovereignty over Serpents’ Island was contested for many years, in 1997 Romania accepted that this feature belonged to Ukraine. Romania argued before the Court that Ukraine had agreed in the 1997 treaty that Serpents’ Island was a “rock” under Article 121 (3) and therefore that it could not affect the maritime delimitation between the two countries, but Ukraine rejected that contention, stating that the reference to Article 121 (3) was in a Romanian “declaration,” which Ukraine had not accepted, and that the Romanian assertion was “groundless. ” The Court’s opinion, issued February 3, 2009, avoided giving a comprehensive definition of the words in Article 121 (3), but it did address the role that Serpents’ Island should play in the delimitation and determined that this islet should have a twelve-nautical-mile territorial sea, but otherwise had no effect on the delimitation. Ukraine argued first that Serpents’ Island should be considered as part of Ukraine’s coast, because it “forms part of the geographical context and its coast constitutes part of Ukraine’s relevant coasts. ” Romania responded by arguing that Serpents’ Island “constitutes merely a small maritime feature situated at a considerable distance out to sea from the coasts of the Parties. ” The Court accepted Romania’s perspective on this matter, saying that “[t]he coast of Serpents’ Island is so short that it makes no real difference to the overall length of the relevant coasts of the parties. ” The Court {{went on to say that}} Serpents’ Island cannot be viewed as part of Ukraine’s coast because it is “lying alone and some 20 nautical miles away from the mainland” and thus “is not one of a <b>cluster</b> of <b>fringe</b> islands constituting ‘the coast’ of Ukraine. ...|$|R
40|$|Modern cities do {{not only}} aim at {{focusing}} on economic development solely, {{but they also}} need to provide high quality of urban living environment which could achieve social, economic and environmental sustainability. Public open space constitutes an indispensible part in achieving this planning objective. Nevertheless, open space is not a unitary planning concept. It has been being constantly redefined to suit changing social and economic needs. This study investigates the development of land supply and land-use planning of public open space in Hong Kong. It attempts to examine how open space was understood, planned, and provided in different periods in Hong Kong. Open space is presumed to be influenced by the interplay of three main social forces, namely the government, the capitalists, and the people. The interplay of the three forces changes in different periods of time in Hong Kong, resulting in the changing meaning and transformation of open space in the aspects of locations, forms, distributions, and ways of provisions. My key arguments are as follows: In the pre-Second World War colonial period, extraction was regarded as the primary objective of the colonial government. Since the colonial atmosphere shared the idea of earning from re-exporting trade and temporal stay, public open space, except for private leisure facilities, was not truly a concern of any of the social groups. While recreational opportunities and open space were still necessary to attract foreign investments and provide political functions, the colonial government provided open space in a residual manner, utilizing urban fringe areas of Victoria City and existing land-uses for open space functions. To maximize the use of open space, though the government was reluctant to provide, open space was utilized for political functions to preach social conforming behaviours and Western lifestyle to the Chinese immigrants as well as to new Chinese generations. The post-Second World War open space development was characterized by an expansion of the scope of open space, as well as political reform of the municipal governments and the planning institution. Triggered by the large influx of Chinese refugees that migrated to Hong Kong and the rising population of the local-born Chinese youngsters, elected representatives were introduced to the municipal councils. These elected representatives endeavoured to urge the government to provide open space where available, persuading the government by giving new meanings to open space. The planning institution, however, continued to plan open space in a residual manner. Inspired by the Abercrombie Plan, open space was planned towards the countryside and new forms of open space were introduced to expand the scope of open space. The contemporary pattern of public open space is examined by quantitative analyses. Three kinds of open space are examined, namely zoned open space, administered public open space, and public open space within private developments. Results show that large-scale zoned open spaces tend to <b>cluster</b> in urban <b>fringe</b> areas and countryside, whereas zoned open spaces in urban areas tend to be fragmentary. Waterfront and coastal areas, whether in urban or rural areas, are commonly utilized for open space purposes. These findings echo the planning strategy, aiming at shifting open space from the inner urban areas to the urban fringe and rural areas. Administered public open spaces are found {{to be related to the}} income level and the ratio of occupational status of a community. The analyses of planning applications further suggest that open space serves as the potential land reserve for various uses instead of being a mere recreational site. Public open spaces within private developments are provided more flexibly compared to conventional public open space in terms of their physical forms and regulations. The manipulations are found to be wittingly introduced by the developers to suit their parochial interests. It is expected that open space will be subject to constant redefinition under further socioeconomic developments and changing compositions of the three social forces. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
