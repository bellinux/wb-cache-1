40|$|PURPOSE: Establishing and obtaining {{consistent}} quantitative {{indices of}} retinal thickness {{from a variety}} of clinically used Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography scanners. DESIGN: Retinal images from five Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography scanners were used to determine total retinal thickness with scanner-specific correction factors establishing <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> thickness measurement across devices. PARTICIPANTS: 55 Fovea-centered Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography volumes from eleven subjects were analyzed, obtained from Cirrus HD-OCT, RS- 3000, Heidelberg Spectralis, RTVue and Topcon 2000, seven subjects with retinal diseases and four normal controls. METHOD: The Iowa Reference Algorithm measured total retinal thickness. Nonlinear model <b>of</b> <b>total</b> retinal thickness measurement comparisons was derived and used for device-specific comparisons. Bland-Altman plots and pairwise predictive equations yielded pairwise scanner-specific differences. Mendel test determined whether measurement biases were constant for each scanner pair. RESULTS: Mendel test revealed that all pairwise scanner differences <b>of</b> <b>total</b> retinal thickness were constant across the cohort (p= 0. 992). Individual measurements can thus be bias-corrected and the Iowa Reference Algorithm serve as a scanner-agnostic independent standard <b>of</b> <b>total</b> retinal thickness across the five tested SD-OCT scanners. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of the Iowa Reference Algorithm with scanner-specific bias correction yields cross-scanner <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> retinal thickness measurements, facilitating scanning-device independent quantitative assessment <b>of</b> <b>total</b> retinal thickness, longitudinal follow-up quantification without requiring patients to be imaged on the same scanner model, and allowing for multi-center studies with heterogeneous device utilization when using the Iowa Reference Algorithm.

40|$|Objective: Accurate {{representation}} of final infarct volume {{is essential for}} assessing the efficacy of stroke interventions in imaging-based studies. This study defines the impact of image registration methods used at different timepoints following stroke, and the implications for infarct definition in stroke research. Methods: Patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke were imaged serially using magnetic resonance imaging. Infarct volume was defined manually using four metrics: 24 -h b 1000 imaging; 1 -week and 1 -month T 2 -weighted FLAIR; and automatically using predefined thresholds of ADC at 24 h. Infarct overlap statistics and volumes were compared across timepoints following both rigid body and nonlinear image registration to the presenting MRI. The effect of nonlinear registration on a hypothetical trial sample size was calculated. Results: Thirty-seven patients were included. Nonlinear registration improved infarct overlap statistics and <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> infarct volumes across timepoints, and reduced infarct volumes by 4. 0 mL (13. 1 %) and 7. 1 mL (18. 2 %) at 24 h and 1 week, respectively, compared to rigid body registration. Infarct volume at 24 h, defined using a predetermined ADC threshold, was less sensitive to infarction than b 1000 imaging. 1 -week T 2 -weighted FLAIR imaging was the most accurate {{representation of}} final infarct volume. Nonlinear registration reduced hypothetical trial sample size, independent of infarct volume, {{by an average of}} 13 %. Interpretation: Nonlinear image registration may offer the opportunity of improving the accuracy of infarct definition in serial imaging studies compared to rigid body registration, helping to overcome the challenges of anatomical distortions at subacute timepoints, and reducing sample size for imaging-based clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|A dataset of ground, {{airborne}} {{and satellite}} data was measured during the comprehensive 2004 EAQUATE (European AQUA Thermodynamic Experiment) Italian campaign. We have used ground based and airborne data {{to evaluate the}} <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> Raman lidar temperature and humidity profiles with NAST-I (The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Airborne Sounder Testbed-Interferometer) spectral radiance measurements in clear conditions, and the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> cloud optical depth measured by the Raman lidar with the same quantity retrieved from NAST-I measurements. Lidar measurement of temperature and humidity profiles can resolve short time changes in mixing ratio due to its high time resolution. Brightness temperature simulations of clear sky, performed using lidar-derived profiles, are within 1 K difference with respect to data when averages over 25 cm− 1 and emission from layers below 7 km are considered. High spectral resolution simulations agree with NAST-I measurements with a mean percentage difference less than 0. 5 % in the whole ν 2 water vapour band. The simulations in cloudy conditions are based on crystal properties obtained assuming either an appropriatemixture of crystal habits (that {{for the first time}} is tested against high spectral resolution measurements) or pristine solid columns. Lidar-derived cloud base and top altitudes and lidar temperature and humidity profiles are exploited, for the first time, as inputs in a recently developed infrared cloud properties retrieval procedure. Total cloud optical depths, retrieved from 800 to 980 cm− 1 NAST-I radiances, have values that,when converted to short-wave wavelengths, are in the range 0. 05 – 2. 2 and agree with lidar measurements to within experimental errors. A closer agreement is obtained with the mixture of habits. Simulated high resolution brightness temperatures based on retrieved cloud parameters (optical depths and effective dimensions) are compared with measured values in all the atmospheric windows covered by the NAST-I sensor. The agreement obtained in the 800 – 980 cm− 1 interval is generally better for the mixture of habits, but solid columns produce smaller residuals in the 2000 – 2150 and 2400 – 2600 cm− 1 spectral intervals. Uncertainties related to the surface properties (i. e. skin temperature) are recognized to be the main sources of error inthe infrared retrieval of cloud properties and affect thecomparison between forward simulations and NAST-I data in all the infrared window bands not used for the inverse problem...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the reliability and}} discriminant validity of a new narrative measure, the Teddy Bear's Picnic (Mueller, 1996), in a small non-clinical community sample of 5 year olds (n= 35). The measure is designed for use with young children, and reveals internally represented psychosocial themes {{through the use of}} a story telling technique. The Teddy Bear's Picnic measure consists of nine incomplete story stems which are administered to children individually, using a range of age appropriate toys and props. Each story is based on an imaginative scenario involving a family of toy bears. Children are presented with the stories in a specific order, each of which poses an unresolved hypothetical conflict; following which they are asked to complete the unfinished story in response to the prompt "what happens next? " Concurrent parent and teacher measures were gathered as part of a larger ongoing study in the same community. Parents and teachers were asked to complete a brief 25 item rating scale, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ: Goodman, 1997), and one categorical question asking them to rate level of concern about the child's behaviour (based on the work of Stallard, 1995). The study aimed to examine the associations between coded thematic material generated from the Teddy Bear's Picnic, and parent and teacher rated behaviour problems and global concern about behaviour. Associations were all in the expected direction, but not statistically significant. Inter-rater reliability was acceptable for total positive theme scores (r=. 91, p<. 001), and approached acceptability for negative total theme scores(r=. 58, p<. 05). Problems were particularly apparent in the use <b>of</b> TBP composite <b>total</b> scores. Internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>total</b> theme scores and factor based subscale scores (derived from Mueller, 1996), revealed low alpha coefficients (alpha =. 42 -. 59). Discriminant function analysis demonstrated that in this study, the TBP was unable to correctly classify children into parent and teacher rated groupings, based on both measures. Further studies would benefit from larger samples than were available to Mueller (1996) and the present study. However, the measure appears promising as a method for eliciting psychologically relevant themes from young children, but findings suggest that further work is required in developing it's psychometric properties...|$|R

Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that social phobia can be conceptualized as a unitary construct consisting of five distinct but interrelated symptom clusters named Assertiveness, General Conversation, Physical/Cognitive Symptoms, Avoidance, and Public Performance. Internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the SPAI-C <b>total</b> scores and two subscales was good; correlations between SPAI-C total scores and SCARED total scores/subscales ranged from moderate to high (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, for social phobia), with the SCARED Social Phobia subscale as the best predictor <b>of</b> SPAI-C <b>total</b> scores. The results indicate that the SPAI-C is a reliable and sensitive instrument suitable for identifying Social Phobia in the young Italian general population. Reliable and valid self-report questionnaires could be useful as initial screening instruments for social phobia in both clinical settings and general populations.

30|$|The {{internal}} <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> the SPADI <b>total</b> and its subscales {{measured with}} Cronbach’s alpha coefficient were high (0.932 for SPADI-Total, 0.899 for SPADI-Disability, 0.905 for SPADI-Pain). Intraclass correlation coefficients showed excellent test–retest reliability (0.899 for Disability, 0.902 for Pain, and 0.929 for total SPADI). A significantly high positive correlation {{was found between}} the SPADI total score and its subscales, and Quick DASH for Pain and Disability. Significant correlations were also found between SPADI scales and EQ- 5 D variables. There was a moderate positive correlation with the variables “self-reliance” (r =  0.66), “common activities” (r =  0.58), and “pain/discomfort” (r =  0.49), and a weaker correlation with the “mobility” variable (r =  0.20). Factor analysis (PAF method) revealed a bidimensional formation of the SPADI. Eight items (five pain/three disability) weighted the first factor by > 0.5, and five disability items weighted the second factor.|$|R
40|$|Background: Validated {{questionnaires}} help community pediatric {{services to}} identify psychosocial problems. Our {{aim was to}} assess which of three short questionnaires was most suitable for this identification among pre-school children. Methods: We included 1, 650 children (response 64 %) aged 3 – 4 years undergoing routine well-child health assessments in 18 services across the Netherlands. Child healthcare professionals (CHPs) interviewed and examined children and parents. Parents were randomized regarding filling out the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) or the KIPPPI, a Dutch-origin questionnaire. In addition, all filled out the Ages and Stages Questionnaires: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We assessed the internal <b>consistency</b> and validity <b>of</b> each questionnaire, with CBCL and treatment status as criteria, {{and the degree to}} which each questionnaire could improve identification based solely on clinical assessment. Results: The internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>total</b> problems scale <b>of</b> each questionnaire was satisfactory, Cronbach's alphas varied between 0. 75 and 0. 98. Only the SDQ discriminated sufficiently between children with and without problems as measured by the CBCL (sensitivity = 0. 76 at a cut-off point with specificity = 0. 90), in contrast to the other two questionnaires (with sensitivity indices varying between 0. 51 – 0. 63). Similar results were found for the treatment status criterion, although sensitivity was lower for all questionnaires. The SDQ seemed to add most to the identification o...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{satisfaction}} of patients with their orthodontic treatment at the Department of Orthodontics at the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA) in The Netherlands. Materials and Methods: To analyze differences in satisfaction through time, the results of patients treated at ACTA in 2008 and 2009 were compared {{with the results of}} patients treated at ACTA in 2000. A validated questionnaire about patient satisfaction was used. The total scale was divided into six subscales. A questionnaire was sent to all patients younger than 30 years who finished orthodontic treatment in 2008 and 2009 at ACTA. Results: The internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>total</b> scale and the six subscales of the questionnaire was satisfactory. Respondents scored highest on items about satisfaction with the doctor-patient relationship (mean 4. 24; SD 0. 63) and lowest on items regarding their satisfaction with psychosocial improvement (mean 2. 88; SD 0. 87). Compared to the results of the sample from 2000, significant differences were found on the subscales doctor-patient relationship, residual category, and psychosocial improvement {{as well as on the}} total sum scale. Conclusions: The doctor-patient relationship remains the most important factor contributing to patient satisfaction. However, the results show that, overall, patients are more satisfied with their orthodontic treatment than patients were a decade ago...|$|R

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 150 mothers with 3 - 6 year old children {{in the city of}} Rasht were selected through cluster random sampling from the public and private kindergartens in 2010. After being confident about the translation validity, the degree of validation (content and structure) and validity (test-retest reliability and internal <b>consistency)</b> <b>of</b> the questionnaire was examined. Results: The degree of validation of questionnaire content, except questions 2, 16 and 46, was at a high level and these three questions were omitted. The method <b>of</b> the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> factors and <b>total</b> scores <b>of</b> the questionnaire was used to study the validation of structure, which was satisfactory and varied between 0. 30 - 0. 72. The validity of questionnaire was examined through test-retest and Cronbach's alpha methods. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was between 0. 80 - 0. 91 and Cronbach's alpha was between 0. 80 - 0. 90. Conclusion: In general, the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire (CFPQ) was proved to be valid and with respect to the results obtained from the {{present research}}, it can be used in the research on child diet...|$|R

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldThe aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the psychometric properties of an Icelandic translation of the self-report version of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS-SR). The Y-BOCS-SR was administered to a sample of 427 Icelandic university students along with another measure of OCD symptoms (OCI-R) and measures of general anxiety and worry (GAD-Q-IV and PSWQ). The internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the Y-BOCS-SR <b>total</b> severity score and its obsession and compulsion subscales was very good. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the original two- factor structure of the severity dimensions but a three-factor model with obsession, compulsion and resistance/control factors fitted the data equally well. Five factors described best the latent structure of the symptom dimensions. Support was found for the convergent and divergent validity of the Y-BOCS-SR. The results indicate that the Y-BOCS-SR is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the severity of obsessions and compulsions in a student population...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Since not {{all persons}} {{infected}} with helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{suffer from the}} same typical symptoms of an ulcer or a sequela such as gastric carcinoma {{it is possible that}} some strains of H. pylori are more virulent than others. Urease seems to be the key enzyme in the pathogenesis of infections caused by H. pylori. This poses the question whether the alleged differences of urease activity are reproducible or whether prognostic statements can be made. The purpose of the present work is to determine whether urease activity is consistent with the strain and therefore strain-specific. In order for this to be achieved, eleven different strains of H. pylori have been examined by photometer to determine the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the <b>total</b> activity <b>of</b> the respective urease.   Each strain was analysed under defined conditions for a <b>total</b> <b>of</b> between 10 to 14 times. Upon evaluation it could be established that the urease activity of all eleven strains of H. pylori, despite identical examination conditions, was highly scattered so that significant differences between the value groups could not be determined. In addition, the comparison with the gastroscopic findings showed an unacceptable diagnostic meaningfulness of the H. pylori usease. The urease still remains {{to be the most important}} diagnostic factor and is the method of choice in the direct demonstration of the infectious agent in practice. Nevertheless, the importance of this central enzyme of helicobacter pylori in terms of clinical prognosis should not be overrated. </p...|$|R
