30|$|Fortunately, we {{can store}} air in {{pipeline}} steel, which {{is commonly used}} in natural gas transportation. Pipeline steel refers to the hot rolled <b>coiled</b> <b>sheet</b> or heavy plate for large diameter welded pipe used in oil and gas transportation [36]. Since the 1960 s, with the continual upgrading, pipeline steel has been applied in long-distance pipeline transmission project worldwide, among which the laid X 80 pipeline steel has reached more than 4300  km, and related technology is very mature [37, 38]. The pipeline steel technology has also been implemented to some major projects, such as the West–East Gas Delivery project in China. Compared with constructing high-pressure air storage tank, the pipeline steel method can significantly reduce the system cost, which is of great value for the commercial utilization of CAES technique in the site even without cavern. The operation pressure of the CSHC- 100 NSF-CAES system is 8  MPa. This system has validated the engineering feasibility of pipeline steel based air storage technique.|$|E

40|$|An {{aluminum}} alloy and a pure copper material were butt-joined by {{friction stir welding}} and subsequently cold rolled. The cold-rolling operation proved to be very advantageous because small voids present after friction stir welding were closed, the interface area per material thickness was enlarged, a thin intermetallic layer was partitioned, and the joint was strengthened by strain hardening. Tensile test specimens fractured in the heat-affected zone in the aluminum material; tensile strengths of the joints exceeded the tensile strengths of the base materials and were as high as 335  MPa. During soft annealing of the composite material, a 6 - 8 -μm-thick intermetallic layer was grown at the interface. Nevertheless, tensile fracture still occurred in the heat-affected zone of the aluminum material. Electrical resistivity of the joint was smaller than resistivity of the aluminum material. Production of such composite material would result in <b>coiled</b> <b>sheet</b> material that could be subjected to further treatments such as electroplating and forming operations in an efficient and economically viable manner. The new composite material is promising for emerging automotive and industrial electrical applications. Funding Agencies|Sapa Group research program on Application Technology||</p...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: We {{describe}} a stand-alone algorithm to predict disulfide bond {{partners in a}} protein given only the amino acid sequence, using a novel neural network architecture (the diresidue neural network), and given input of symmetric flanking regions of N-terminus and C-terminus half-cystines augmented with residue secondary struc-ture (helix, <b>coil,</b> <b>sheet)</b> as well as evolutionary information. The approach is motivated by the observation of a bias in the sec-ondary structure preferences of free cysteines and half-cystines, and by promising preliminary results we obtained using diresidue position-specific scoring matrices. Results: As calibrated by receiver operating characteristic curves from 4 -fold cross-validation, our conditioning on secondary structure allows our novel diresidue neural network to perform as well as, {{and in some cases}} better than, the current state-of-the-art method.
