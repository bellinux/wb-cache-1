40|$|It is the {{differences}} between sperm and eggs that fundamentally underpin {{the differences}} between the sexes within reproduction. For males, it is theorized that widespread sperm competition leads to selection for investment in sperm numbers, achieved by minimizing sperm size within limited resources for spermatogenesis in the testis. Here, we empirically examine how sperm competition shapes sperm size, after more than 77 generations of experimental selection of replicate lines under either high or low sperm <b>competition</b> <b>intensities</b> in the promiscuous flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. After this experimental evolution, populations had diverged significantly in their sperm competitiveness, with sperm in ejaculates from males evolving under high sperm <b>competition</b> <b>intensities</b> gaining 20 % greater paternity than sperm in ejaculates from males that had evolved under low sperm competition intensity. Males did not change their relative investment into sperm production following this experimental evolution, showing no difference in testis sizes between high and low intensity regimes. However, the more competitive males from high sperm competition intensity regimes had evolved significantly longer sperm and, across six independently selected lines, there was a significant association between the degree of divergence in sperm length and average sperm competitiveness. To determine whether such sperm elongation is costly, we used dietary restriction experiments, and revealed that protein-restricted males produced significantly shorter sperm. Our findings therefore demonstrate that sperm competition intensity can exert positive directional selection on sperm size, despite this being a costly reproductive trait...|$|E

40|$|Both {{industry}} and private households have profited substantially from the liberalisation {{of the electricity}} markets, the former, however, to a significantly greater extent than the latter, which points at different <b>competition</b> <b>intensities</b> in the two markets.

Due to unresolved homemade structural problems, liberalisation has left incumbent electricity suppliers largely unchallenged in their position as local monopolists. This unsatisfactory situation has been further exacerbated by a substantial increase in market concentration caused by horizontal and vertical mergers of public utilities and the delayed implementation of legal "unbundling", i. e., the separation of network operation and electricity supply.

40|$|The {{index of}} {{relative}} competition intensity (RCI) has serious built-in biases, {{due to its}} asymptotic behavior when competition intensity is high and its tendency to obtain very low values when plants with neighbors intact perform better than neighbor removal plants. These biases have been partially corrected in the index of relative neighbor effect (RNE), but the existence of fixed {{upper and lower bounds}} (/ 15 /RNE 5 // 1) still creates problems and biases in communities where the average intensity of competition or facilitation is high and plant performance pronouncedly varies in space. The third commonly used index, the logarithm of response ratio (lnRR), is mathematically and statistically sound, but when computed from pair-wise comparisons between neighbor removal and control plants, this index reflects the geometric mean of the treatment effect. Moreover, linear patterns in lnRR reflect exponential patterns in the intensity of competition. As the interest of ecologists usually focuses on arithmetic means, we propose a corrected index of relative competition intensity, CRCI/arc sin (RNE).

40|$|I used a field {{experiment}} to measure total <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> and its above- and below-ground components in two wetlands that represent extremes in habitat productivity: an infertile sandy shoreline and a fertile bay.

(2) Is there an effect of standing crop on total, above- and below-ground <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> when the data from the two wetlands are combined? Both total and above-ground <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> were found to be greater in the high standing crop wetland but below-ground competition did not differ between wetlands (CITOTAL: p 0. 00001, CIABOVE: p = 0. 0013 CIBELOW: p = 0. 58). Mean total competition increased from 0. 16 to 0. 43, the above-ground component increased from - 0. 063 to 0. 21 and the below-ground component was close to 0. 20 in both wetlands. Total and above-ground <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> was significantly affected by standing crop in the wetlands studied but below-ground <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> was not (CITOTAL: p = 0. 0001, CIABOVE: p = 0. 0001, CIBELOW: p = 0. 89).

40|$|International audienceLight {{interception}} {{controls the}} growth potential of species and individuals in plant communities. However, {{the effects of}} competition for light on short term vegetation dynamics are still poorly understood. This is {{in part due to}} a lack of quantitative methods to estimate this resource capture by individual plants within a canopy. In this paper, we studied the light interception of herbaceous plants with contrasting architectures (monocultures and binary mixtures) grown at high or low density and sought to determine the important architectural features necessary to account for light partitioning among individual plants. It was shown that the plant populations studied were typical of a wide range of <b>competition</b> <b>intensities,</b> ranging from sparse plants to dense size-structured populations. Plant representations using whole plant envelopes with homogeneous leaf area density (LAD) were not reliable to estimate light partitioning, irrespective of the accuracy of envelope definition. Accounting for heterogeneous LAD within plants helped to solve this problem in both sparse and dense canopies. The relative importance of traits however changed with competition intensity and was different from reports made on isolated plants. Simple envelope-based reconstructions were finally shown robust enough to support parameterisation from a tractable set of traits measured in the field provided that height and vertical LAD gradient were characterised...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLocal {{competitive}} interactions strongly influence {{plant community}} dynamics. To maintain their performance under competition, clonal plants may plastically modify their network architecture {{to grow in}} the direction of least interference. The adaptive value of this plastic avoidance response may depend, however, on traits linked with the plant's structural blueprint and ontogeny. We tested this hypothesis using virtual populations. We used an Individual Based Model to simulate competitive interactions among clones within a plant population. Clonal growth was studied under three <b>competition</b> <b>intensities</b> in plastic and non-plastic individuals. Plasticity buffered the negative impacts of competition at intermediate densities of competitors by promoting clone clumping. Success despite competition was promoted by traits linked with (1) the plant's structural blueprint (weak apical dominance and sympodial growth) and (2) ontogenetic processes, with an increasing or a decreasing dependence of the elongation process on the branch generation level or length along the competition intensity gradient respectively. The adaptive value of the plastic avoidance response depended on the same traits. This response only modulated their importance for clone success. Our results show that structural blueprint and ontogeny can be primary filters of plasticity and can have strong implications for evolutionary ecology, as they may explain why clonal plants have developed many species-specific plastic avoidance behaviours...|$|E

Specific training and competition management necessitates information about exercise intensities and fitness, which are usually assessed by standardized exercise tests. Our purpose was to identify parameters whose measurement can be largely integrated in the daily training and competition routine and which provide information on fitness and adequacy of applied training. Further, we evaluated training and <b>competition</b> <b>intensities</b> of eventing horses, based on data generated by a proportionally large group of horses over several years. Data of 187 horses from 1 -star to 4 -star level over a time period of six years were collected during 410 training sessions and 916 Cross Country rides, including measurement of covered distance and speed (GPS, Fidelak EquiPILOT), continuously recording of heart rate (HR) (Polar T 52 H) and determination of blood lactate concentrations (BLC) (Dr. Lange photometer). Characteristics of the track, altitude profile, ambient temperature and humidity were recorded at each session. The results of the one-way ANOVA indicated a significant effect of competition level on HR (F 3, 373 = 23. 29; p< 0. 001) and BLC (F 3, 763 = 46. 12; p< 0. 001). Under competition conditions, HR and BLC increased from 1 -star to 3 -star level (1 -star: HR= 194 ± 9 bpm, BLC= 7. 7 ± 5. 6 mmol/l; 2 -star: HR= 198 ± 9 bpm, BLC= 9. 6 ± 6. 2 mmol/l; 3 -star: HR= 205 ± 10, BLC= 15. 6 ± 9. 8 mmol/l; 4 -star: HR= 207 ± 2 bpm, BLC= 12. 4 ± 9. 3 mmol/l), while under training conditions, they decreased with increasing competition level (1 -star: HR= 184 ± 29 bpm; BLC= 18. 9 ± 11. 1 mmol/l; 2 -star: HR= 182 ± 19 bpm; BLC= 12. 1 ± 9. 0; 3 -star: HR= 174 ± 25 bpm; BLC= 6. 9 ± 7. 1 mmol/l; 4 -star: HR= 161 ± 24 bpm, BLC= 4. 0 ± 5. 6 mmol/l). On 1 -/ 2 -star level, BLCs after training exceeded those after competition. Reverse applied for 3 -/ 4 -star level. On 3 -star level, the percentage of HRs above 200 bpm during Cross Country was considerably greater than on lower levels (1 -star: 33 %; 2 -star: 54 %; 3 -star: 94 %). The competition format (CCI/CIC) had no {{significant effect on the}} progress of HR. The altitude profile however, had a significant effect on HR (F 1, 201 = 26. 72, p< 0. 001) and BLC (F 1, 89 = 25. 56; p< 0. 001). Evaluation of physiological response to training and competition through implementation of measurement technology allows an assessment of the different impacts on exercise intensities and should be more commonly used to assess appropriateness of training and competition management in eventing horses. It should be further investigated if the detected discrepancies in the response to training and competition between levels are a result of different fitness ore varying training strategies. LP To meet the demands of international Eventing competitions, a systematic training of horses is necessary. Close monitoring of physiological response to exercise during training and competition can help to improve training. Keywords Exercise physiology; training; eventing; heart rate; lactate.

40|$|The {{long-term}} success of an introduced population {{depends on the}} ecological conditions in its new environment, but is also influenced by stochasticity. This is particularly clear {{in the first stage}} of an invasion when the population is still small and either goes extinct quickly or establishes a self-sustaining population. Once established, some populations grow and spread spatially, with potential impacts on native communities and ecosystems. The role of stochasticity during these later invasion stages remains unclear. Furthermore, {{little is known about the}} population genetic and evolutionary consequences of stochastic invasion trajectories. With this dissertation, I would like to contribute to a stochastic eco-genetic theory of the entire invasion process—from the first introduction up to potential impacts. The overarching questions in this dissertation are: a) How does a population’s movement through the invasion process depend on ecological factors influencing its average growth rate? b) How does it depend on factors influencing the stochastic variability in the population dynamics? c) How much genetic diversity do introduced populations harbor on average upon reaching a certain point in the invasion process? d) To what extent can the population-genetic consequences of invasion trajectories feed back onto the population dynamics? Together with my advisors and coauthors, I have conducted four studies, each addressing two or more of these questions for specific ecological scenarios. We employ several types of stochastic models: Markov chains, Markov processes, their diffusion approximations, and coalescent-like genealogy simulations. In Chapter 1 (Wittmann et al., 2013 a, appeared in Theoretical Population Biology), we focus on a factor influencing the introduced population’s average growth rate: the intensity of competition with an ecologically similar native species. Our results indicate that the expected time until the introduced species drives the native competitor to extinction is smallest for intermediate competition intensity. This phenomenon results from the opposing effects of competition intensity at different points of the invasion process: On the one hand, intense competition renders the establishment of the introduced population more difficult; on the other hand, it facilitates the later exclusion of the native species. In Chapter 1, we also investigate to what extent the native species’ extinction is accelerated if a reduction in population size entails a reduction in genetic diversity and thus a reduced ability to adapt to a changing environment. We find this eco-genetic feedback to be particularly strong at small <b>competition</b> <b>intensities.</b> In Chapter 2 (Wittmann et al., 2013 b, in press at Oikos), we compare introduction regimes with the same average number of individuals introduced per time unit, but with a different temporal distribution. Relative to regimes with many small introduction events, regimes with few large introduction events generate more variability in population-size trajectories. We show that this variability helps introduced populations to overcome difficult stages in the invasion process (those with a negative average growth rate), but is disadvantageous during easy stages (those with a positive average growth rate). In the light of our results, we can reinterpret three published data sets on invasion success under different introduction regimes. In Chapters 3 and 4 (Wittmann et al., 2013 c,d), we examine levels of genetic diversity in populations that have successfully overcome a strong demographic Allee effect. In this ecological scenario, the average population growth rate is negative below a certain critical population size and positive above, such that the first stage in the invasion process is difficult and the second one easy. In Chapter 3, we assume Poisson-distributed offspring numbers. We show that compared to successful populations without an Allee effect, successful Allee-effect populations are expected to harbor either more or less genetic diversity, depending on the magnitude of typical founder population sizes relative to the critical population size. Part of the explanation is that, counter-intuitively, successful Allee-effect populations escape particularly fast from the range of small population sizes where genetic drift is strongest. In Chapter 3, we also identify conditions under which the critical population size can be estimated from genetic data. In Chapter 4, we consider a range of offspring-number models leading to either more or less variability in population dynamics than the Poisson model. For a fixed founder population size, we observe that the Allee effect has a negative influence on genetic diversity for small amounts of variability, but a positive influence for large amounts of variability. We show that the differences between our various offspring-number models are so substantial that they cannot be resolved by rescaling the parameters of the Poisson model. Taken together, these results offer some general conclusions with respect to the four main questions raised above. a) How fast an introduced population completes the invasion process is mainly determined by the presence and severity of difficult stages. Therefore, an ecological change promotes invasion success if it lessens such difficult stages. b) From the perspective of the introduced population, variability is advantageous during difficult but not during easy stages of the invasion process. c) Because the strength of genetic drift depends on population size, a key to understanding the population genetic consequences of invasion trajectories is to consider how much time the population of interest spends in different population-size ranges. d) Feedbacks between a reduction in population size and a loss of genetic diversity are strongest in ecological scenarios where the population of interest spends considerable time at small population sizes. Some of the most striking results in this dissertation cannot be understood from a deterministic point of view, but only when considering stochasticity. Thus, stochasticity does not just add “noise” to some average outcome, but can qualitatively change the behavior of biological systems. Der langfristige Erfolg einer eingeführten Population hängt von den ökologischen Bedingungen in ihrer neuen Umgebung ab, aber auch vom Zufall. Besonders offensichtlich ist die wichtige Rolle des Zufalls für kleine Populationen im Anfangsstadium einer Invasion. In diesem Stadium entscheidet sich, ob die eingeführte Population nach kurzer Zeit ausstirbt oder sich dauerhaft etablieren kann. Manche etablierten Populationen wachsen dann weiter und breiten sich räumlich aus, zum Teil mit schwerwiegenden Folgen für einheimische Gemeinschaften und Ökosysteme. Bislang ist nicht klar, welche Rolle der Zufall in diesen späteren Invasionsstadien spielt und welche populationsgenetischen und evolutionären Auswirkungen vom Zufall geprägte Invasionsverläufe haben. Mit dieser Dissertation möchte ich beitragen zu einer stochastischen öko-genetischen Theorie des gesamten Invasionsprozesses – von der Einführung bis hin zu möglichen Auswirkungen. Meine übergreifenden Fragen sind: a) Welche Rolle für den Invasionsverlauf spielen ökologische Faktoren, die die durchschnittliche Wachstumsrate der eingeführten Population beeinflussen? b) Und welche Rolle spielen Faktoren, die die stochastische Variabilität der Populationsdynamik beeinflussen? c) Wie viel genetische Diversität weisen eingeführte Populationen im Durchschnitt auf, wenn sie einen bestimmten Punkt im Invasionsprozess erreichen? d) Inwiefern können die populationsgenetischen Auswirkungen von Invasionsverläufen wiederum die Populationsdynamik beeinflussen und so zu einer Rückkopplung führen? Zusammen mit meinen Betreuern und Koautoren habe ich vier Studien durchgeführt, die sich für bestimmte ökologische Szenarien jeweils mit mindestens zwei dieser Fragen befassen. Dazu kommen im Verlauf der Dissertation verschiedene Typen von stochastischen Modellen zum Einsatz: Markov-Ketten, Markov- und Diffusionsprozesse sowie Coalescent-artige Genealogie-Simulationen. In Kapitel 1 (Wittmann et al., 2013 a, erschienen in Theoretical Population Biology) konzentrieren wir uns auf einen Faktor, der die durchschnittliche Wachstumsrate der Population beeinflusst: die Stärke der Konkurrenz mit einer ökologisch ähnlichen einheimischen Art. Unsere Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die erwartete Zeit bis zum Aussterben des einheimischen Konkurrenten für mittlere Konkurrenzstärken am kleinsten ist. Das können wir dadurch erklären, dass die Konkurrenzstärke gegensätzliche Auswirkungen in verschiedenen Stadien des Invasionsprozesses hat: Einerseits erschwert eine hohe Konkurrenzstärke die Etablierung der eingeführten Art, andererseits führt eine hohe Konkurrenzstärke aber auch dazu, dass die einheimische Art schnell verdrängt werden kann. Zusätzlich untersuchen wir in Kapitel 1, wie stark eine öko-genetische Rückkopplung das Aussterben der einheimischen Population beschleunigen würde. Dazu berücksichtigen wir, dass ein Rückgang der einheimischen Populationsgröße zu einem Verlust an genetischer Diversität führt, und das wiederum zu schlechterer Anpassung an veränderte Umweltbedingungen und darum weiterem Schrumpfen der Population. Unsere Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass diese öko-genetische Rückkopplung dann besonders stark ist, wenn die Konkurrenz zwischen einheimischer und eingeführter Art eher schwach ist. In Kapitel 2 (Wittmann et al., 2013 b, im Druck bei Oikos) untersuchen wir für feste durchschnittliche Einführungsraten (Individuen pro Zeiteinheit), welche Rolle die zeitliche Verteilung der Individuen spielt. Besonders wichtig ist hierbei die Beziehung zwischen zeitlicher Verteilung und der Variabilität in der Größenentwicklung der Population. Wir zeigen, dass Fälle mit wenigen großen Einführungsereignissen zu mehr Variabilität führen als Fälle mit vielen kleinen Einführungsereignissen. Diese Variabilität hilft den eingeführten Populationen dabei, schwierige Stadien im Invasionsprozess (also solche mit einer negativen durchschnittlichen Wachstumsrate) zu bewältigen, ist aber anderseits in einfachen Stadien mit positiver durchschnittlicher Wachstumsrate von Nachteil. Im Lichte unserer Ergebnisse können wir aus der Literatur bekannte Daten zu Invasionsprozessen neu interpretieren. In den Kapiteln 3 und 4 (Wittmann et al., 2013 c,d) untersuchen wir die genetische Diversität von Populationen, die einen starken demografischen Allee-Effekt erfolgreich überwunden haben. Laut Definition ist dabei die durchschnittliche Wachstumsrate bei Populationsgrößen unterhalb einer gewissen kritischen Größe negativ und in größeren Populationen positiv, so dass das erste Stadium des Invasionsprozesses schwierig ist und das zweite einfach. In Kapitel 3 zeigen wir unter der Annahme Poisson-verteilter Nachkommenzahlen, dass erfolgreiche Allee-Effekt-Populationen je nach Startgröße entweder eine höhere oder eine niedrigere durchschnittliche genetische Diversität aufweisen als erfolgreiche Populationen ohne Allee-Effekt. Das kommt zum Teil daher, dass erfolgreiche Allee-Effekt-Populationen besonders schnell das schwierige erste Stadium des Invasionsprozesses verlassen, wo genetische Drift am stärksten ist. Außerdem untersuchen wir in Kapitel 3, unter welchen Bedingungen sich die kritische Populationsgröße aus genetischen Daten schätzen lässt. In Kapitel 4 betrachten wir eine Reihe von Modellen für die Anzahl an Nachkommen von Individuen oder Paaren in der Population. Manche dieser Modelle führen zu mehr stochastischer Variabilität in der Populationsdynamik, andere zu weniger Variabilität als das in Kapitel 3 betrachtete Poisson-Modell. Für feste Startgröße beobachten wir, dass der Allee-Effekt bei kleiner Variabilität einen negativen Einfluss auf die genetische Diversität hat und bei großer Variabilität einen positiven Einfluss. Wir zeigen weiterhin, dass die Unterschiede zwischen unseren Nachkommenzahl-Modellen so substanziell sind, dass sie sich nicht durch eine Umskalierung der Parameter des Poisson-Modells erklären lassen. Zusammen genommen erlauben uns diese Ergebnisse einige allgemeine Schlussfolgerungen bezüglich der vier oben aufgeführten übergreifenden Fragen. a) Wie schnell eine eingeführte Population den Invasionsprozess durchläuft, hängt hauptsächlich davon ab, ob es schwierige Stadien gibt, und wie schwierig diese sind. Deshalb begünstigt eine ökologische Veränderung den Invasionserfolg dann, wenn sie schwierige Stadien im Invasionsprozess mindert. b) Aus der Perspektive der eingeführten Population ist Variabilität in schwierigen Stadien des Invasionsprozesses von Vorteil, aber in einfachen Stadien von Nachteil. c) Da die Stärke der genetischen Drift von der Populationsgröße abhängt, können wir die populationsgenetischen Auswirkungen von Invasionsverläufen verstehen, indem wir analysieren, wie viel Zeit die betrachtete Population in verschiedenen Populationsgrößenbereichen verbringt. d) Rückkopplungen zwischen einem Rückgang der Populationsgröße und einem Verlust genetischer Diversität sind am stärksten, wenn die Population viel Zeit im Bereich kleiner Populationsgrößen verbringt. Einige der wesentlichsten Ergebnisse dieser Dissertation können aus einer deterministischen Perspektive nicht verstanden werden, sondern sind ein direktes Produkt von Stochastizität. Dies macht deutlich, dass Stochastizität nicht einfach einem gewissen Durchschnitts- ergebnis etwas Rauschen hinzufügt, sondern das Verhalten biologischer Systeme qualitativ verändern kann...|$|E

40|$|In {{economic}} terminology, 'competition intensity' {{can be used}} {{to mirror}} to a certain degree the status of industrial competition in a specific market, while in the construction market, it particularly involves the part of project <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> (PCI). Based on a road project in China, two forms of PCI, overt and covert, are identified in this study. To lower project construction cost thus enabling better project tendering performance, clients can facilitate higher levels of overt PCI by tailoring their tendering procedures, whereas, through covert PCI project competitors can adopt anti-competitive behaviours to attain the expected works. The difference between overt PCI and covert PCI indicates various practitioners' perspectives and impact on the levels of <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> in construction. The findings suggest a way to promote PCI studies in the future, and offer new insights into other parts of <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> in construction. <b>Competition,</b> project complexity index, attributes, case study, road, China,...|$|R

40|$|International audienceQuestions: 1. Can the {{importance}} and the <b>intensity</b> of <b>competition</b> vary independently along a nutrient gradient? 2. Are these variations species dependent? Location: Sub-alpine pastures of the northern French Alps. Methods: <b>Competition</b> <b>intensity</b> measures how much competition decreases the performances of an organism. Competition importance measures how much competition contributes to affect performance, among other processes (such as environmental stress or disturbance). <b>Competition</b> <b>intensity</b> and importance were measured on three co-occurring species: Festuca rubra, a perennial grass, and two forbs of contrasting basal area, Chaerophyllum hirsutum and Alchemilla xanthochlora. A neighbour removal experiment was performed on Festuca rubra in three sub-alpine grassland communities differing in fertility and on Chaerophyllum hirsutum and Alchemilla xanthochlora in the two more fertile of these communities. The importance of competition was quantified using an index proposed by Brooker et al. (2005). Results: <b>Competition</b> <b>intensity</b> and importance showed different patterns of variation along the fertility gradient for Festuca rubra: competition importance decreased with decreasing fertility whereas <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> did not change. The largest forb was the least affected by competition. Our results suggest that {{the importance}} of competition for all three species depended on their individual tolerance to low nutrient availability. Conclusions: 1. The distinction between {{the importance and}} the <b>intensity</b> of <b>competition</b> is helpful to explain conflicting results obtained on the variations of competition indices along productivity gradients. 2. The choice of a phytometer can affect the conclusions drawn from empirical studies...|$|R
40|$|How plant {{competition}} varies across environmental gradients {{has been}} a long debate among ecologists. We conducted a growth chamber experiment to determine the intensity and importance of competition for plants grown in changed environmental conditions. Festuca rubra and Trifolium pratense were grown in monoculture and in two- and/or three-species mixtures under three environmental treatments. The measured competitive variations in terms of growth (height and biomass) were species-dependent. <b>Competition</b> <b>intensity</b> for Festuca increased with decreased productivity, whilst competition importance displayed a humpback response. However, significant response was detected in neither <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> nor importance for Trifolium. Intensity and importance of competition followed different response patterns, suggesting that they may not be correlated along an environmental gradient. The biological and physiological variables of plants play an important role to determine the interspecific competition associated with <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> and importance. However, the competitive feature can be modified by multiple environmental changes which may increase or hinder how competitive a plant is. Key words: climate change; competition importance; competition intensity; interspecific interaction; species-dependent variation...|$|R

40|$|Hypothesising that {{competition}} {{is a major}} ecological factor that filters plants {{on the basis of}} traits, we tested whether <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> and importance were better explained by the functional structure of communities than by standing biomass. We re-analysed data of three experiments in which one to four species of phytometers have been transplanted with or without vegetation in communities displaying a range of standing biomass. Changes in performance of phytometers among communities were used to assess <b>competition</b> <b>intensity</b> and importance. The functional structure of each community was characterized by the mean and functional divergence of plant height, a trait significantly related to resource depletion by competition. Relationships between competition components and standing biomass or functional structure of communities were calculated for each experiment. Competition importance was explained more significantly by the mean of plant height than by the standing biomass of communities. When the range of functional diversity was large enough, the importance of competition was high in communities with low functional diversity because of similarity in functioning among highly competitive plants, and low in more diverse communities. <b>Competition</b> <b>intensity</b> generally showed lower or no relationship with standing biomass or functional structure of communities. These results confirm the dependence of competition on functional structure of communities...|$|R
