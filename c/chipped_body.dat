40|$|With the {{expanding}} use of automation in machining technology, the modern manufacturing aims toward achieving high productivity without close human supervision. This aim requires reliable machining processes. The chip control {{is one of}} major concern in automated machining system. It {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined parts, the convenience of chip disposal, and the possible power reduction. This thesis major deals with theoretical modelling for the 3 -D chip curling process, including geometry and mechanics consideration. These models are then used to develop a computer animation system to simulate the process of chip curling in 3 -D metal cutting. Hence the work described in this thesis is devoted to developing an effective theoretical technique for chip control in automated machining systems. Firstly, a new method to describe the development process of 3 -D chip curling is developed in accord with the mechanics and kinematics characters of chip curling in 3 -D machining. This analysis divided the process of 3 -D chip development into different stages based on the deformation mechanism and characteristics, i. e. chip forming stage, chip curling stage, chip breaking stage, and the kinematical characters according to whether the curled chip, after leaving the rake face, hits the backwall of breaker/groove, or/and workpiece, or/and backface of tool, or/and extends along the chip breaker. Then new basic chip curling forms, up-curling, side-curling and twisting, are proposed based on the continuum mechanics theory. It reveals that a 3 -D curling <b>chip</b> <b>body</b> m a y undergo longitudinal bending, transversal bending and torsional deformations. The analysis provides the fundament for the theoretical modelling of the 3 -D chip curling and breaking. Secondly, a general geometric model of 3 -D chip curling generated by typical chip breakers is developed by introducing the three-dimensional deformation state of the chip curling. The model, so developed, can be used to predict the 3 -D chip curling forms. The prediction includes a group of criteria for the effects of ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηo on the chip forms/shapes. The varying tendency of the chip radius and chip pitch with varying ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηO is further discussed based on a sensitivity analysis the results of which are summarised graphically. The sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the significance of three basic chip curling forms, namely up-curling, side-curling and twisting to the general helical chip form. Thirdly, a set of 3 -D mechanics models of chip curling with chip breaker for the internal resisting forces is developed for the 4 basic chip deformation cases of chip curling process based on the structural mechanics theory, These internal forces, in particular the bending moments and torques are expressed as variations along the length of the curled chip. The set of models considers a spatial force system including the longitudinal bending moment, transversal bending moment and the torsional torque. Then the distribution of the bending moments and torques along the <b>chip</b> <b>body</b> are discussed based on graphically presented calculated results. The models reveal, in theory, new insights into the chip breaking mechanisms. More importantly it provides a new approach to theoretically asses the curling chip breakability. Notably it is shown that the bending moment and torque are the main causes of chip breaking. Furthermore the bending moment and torque in the <b>chip</b> <b>body</b> are caused by the chip breaker and the obstacle the curling chip contacts. Finally, a computer animation system for 3 -D chip curling in machining process is developed based on the 3 -D chip curling developing process, geometry model and mechanics models of 3 -D chip curling presented in the research work. The 3 -D chip animation integrates the chip flow equation, chip curling patterns, chip geometrical features and mathematical expressions for the 3 -D helix surface. Based on the input conditions (namely chip breaker parameters and cutting conditions), a computer program is developed to convert the parametric prediction into a series of dynamic graphs demonstrating the chip formation process. Then the animation results are analysed and compared with the experimental observations. The methodology presented will provide assistance for machine operators to select machining conditions or for process planning designers to confidently and thoroughly plan the cutting process, control chip breakage and evaluate the chip control effect...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{innovative}} release {{method of}} polymer cantilevers with embedded integrated metal electrodes is presented. The fabrication {{is based on}} the lithographic patterning of the electrode layout on a wafer surface, covered by two layers of SU- 8 polymer: a 10 - m-thick photo-structured layer for the cantilever, and a 200 - m-thick layer for the <b>chip</b> <b>body.</b> The releasing method is based on dry etching of a 2 - m-thick sacrificial polysilicon layer. Devices with complex electrode layout embedded in free-standing 500 - m-long and 100 - m-wide SU- 8 cantilever were fabricated and tested. We have optimized major fabrication steps such as the optimization of the SU- 8 chip geometry for reduced residual stress and for enhanced underetching, and by defining multiple metal layers [titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), bismuth (Bi) ] for improved adhesion between metallic electrodes and polymer. The process was validated for a miniature 2 2 m 2 Hall-sensor integrated at the apex of a polymer microcantilever for scanning magnetic field sensing. The cantilever has a spring constant of = 1 N/m and a resonance frequency of = 17 kHz. Galvanometric characterization of the Hall sensor showed an input/output resistance of 200,a device sensitivity of 0. 05 V/AT and a minimum detectable magnetic flux density of 9 T/Hz 1 2 at frequencies above 1 kHz at room temperature. Quantitative magnetic field measurements of a microcoil were performed. The generic method allows for a stable integration of electrodes into polymers MEMS and it can readily be used for other types of microsensors where conducting metal electrodes are integrated in cantilevers for advanced scanning probe sensing applications.

There is an interest in miniaturization of the probes to obtain higher surface sensitivity, an increased spatial resolution and less damage to the sample.

A 200 -µm-thick SU- 8 <b>body</b> <b>chip</b> allows the handling of the device and the electrical connection to the measurement set-up. A SU- 8 cantilever with 10 µm thickness is split into four equally spaced micro-cantilevers at its freestanding extremity, each of them supporting a probe tip. This design and the high flexibility of SU- 8 ensure a stable electrical point-contact between samples and probe tips. The microscopic four-point probe is fabricated by surface micromachining using silicon as substrate and polysilicon as sacrificial layer. The mould for the probe tips is etched by KOH. 50 nm-Pt, 20 nm-Ti and 300 nm-Al are deposited by sputtering. The metal layer is structured using a chlorine-based plasma dry etch.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a fabrication process for an Aluminum single electron transistor, experimental results verifying its functionality, and its integration on the tip of a scanning probe for scanning probe microscopy. When an electron passes through a tunnel barrier, it changes the barrier's capacitance, which in turn builds up a voltage across the barrier. If the thermal activation energy is smaller than the charging energy, and the barrier resistance sufficiently suppresses quantum fluctuations, then this voltage buildup prevents any further electrons from tunneling. In other words, to be able to observe single electron charging effects in a tunnel barrier, its capacitance C must so small that the charging energy e 2 / 2 C is larger than the thermal energy kBT and the quantum fluctuations h/T=h/RC. If those conditions are observed, then tunneling is blocked, the current is suppressed, the conductance drops, and the device is in Coulomb blockade. A single electron transistor is a single electron charging effect based device, where two tunnel barriers are connected in series, defining a small island between them. This suppresses the quantum-mechanical uncertainty of the electron location. A gate is capacitively coupling to the island as third electrode. If the energies allow for observation of single electron charging effects, and a bias voltage is applied across the two tunnel barriers, then electrons may tunnel through both of them, resulting in a current, given that the tunnel barriers are not in Coulomb blockade. This is determined by the voltage applied to the gate electrode. A small change in the external polarization charge on the gate electrode (by fractions of the elementary charge) may move the single electron transistor from a conductive state into Coulomb blockade and vice versa. The current voltage characteristic of a single electron transistor is e-periodic with the gate voltage, since increasing the gate voltage allows {{to increase the number of}} electrons on the island one by one. A process to fabricate single electron transistors was developed from scratch, employing the double angle Niemeyer-Dolan evaporation technique. A resist stack of poly(methyl-methacrylate) on top of copolymer was exposed with an electron beam lithography system. Resistively heated thermally evaporated Al was controlledly oxidized, followed by a second Al evaporation step at a different inclination angle. The overlap of the two evaporation steps defines the tunnel junction area. The device's functionality was successfully tested in a 4 He and a 3 He- 4 He dilution cryostat for normal conductive and superconductive states. Given that single electron transistor is very sensitive to change in charge, the scanning of a single electron transistor over a sample allows to map the change in charge, or charge distribution. The change in gate electrode polarization is measured by the change in current in the single electron transistor. In short, the current in the scanning single electron transistor changes because the capacitive coupling between the gate electrode and charges in the sample changes. Such a tool is intended to be used for local probe experiments, such as to probe the electric potentials and fields of device built in a two dimensional electron gas. A self-sensing and self-actuating quartz tuning fork based atomic force microscope probe was chosen as a platform for the implementation of the scanning single electron transistor. A monolithic Si handling chip with a notch where the proximal U-shaped end of the tuning fork can be lodged, is microfabricated with anisotropical potassium hydroxide etch. A cantilever extends from the <b>chip</b> <b>body,</b> and its end slightly exceeds the distal end of the tuning fork, and narrows down to form a tip shape, where the single electron transistor is patterned. A scanning single electron transistor probe was fabricated, and shows the same electrical room temperature behavior as the successfully a low temperature tested test structure single electron transistors. But only experimental verification will be able to show if the fabricated scanning single electron transistors probes are functional or not...|$|R
