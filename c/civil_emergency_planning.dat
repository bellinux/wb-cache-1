Geochemical analyses were performed on volcanic glasses recovered from marine sedimentary deposits, called turbidites, associated with each individual stage of each multistage landslide. These analyses indicate only the lattermost stages of subaerial flank failure contain materials originating from respective coeval explosive eruption, suggesting that initial more voluminous submarine stages of multi-stage flank collapse induce these aforementioned explosive eruption. Furthermore, there are extended time lags identified between the individual stages of multi-stage collapse, and thus an extended time lag between the initial submarine stages of failure and the onset of subsequent explosive eruption.

40|$|The diploma {{thesis on}} the topic "The {{fulfillment}} of European union norms in area population protection" {{is divided into two}} parts, a theoretical and a practical part. Theoretical part is divided into three parts. First part is devoted to the description of the Czech system of population protection. It describes the development of population protection in the Czech Republic, introduces basic legislation in the area of population protection and elaborates tasks of population protection (evacuation, warning and notification, concealment, individual protection, emergency population survival and decontamination). The second part of the theoretical part is devoted to the international context of population protection. Describes the Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, and European Union Documents and norms in the area of population protection. The third part explains the term of <b>civil</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>planning.</b> In the practical part, the system of protection of the population (civil protection) in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the system of population protection in the Czech Republic were discussed. As a basis for this part of the work were used the National Security Strategy, the Civil contingency act and basic Czech legislation in this area. Finally, the system of population protection in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Czech Republic was compared. The aim of the diploma thesis is to clarify the problems of population protection, to describe the system of population protection in the Czech Republic and the European Union and to compare this area in the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis explains several terms from the area of civil protection, such as civil protection, international humanitarian law, extraordinary and crisis event, and describes {{the historical development of}} civil protection in an international environment and in the territory of today's Czech Republic. The thesis also characterizes international institutions while addressing some of them, namely ICRC, UN, NATO and EU, in more detail. It describes the history, characteristics and organization structure of international institutions, as well as involvement of the North Atlantic Alliance and European Union in <b>civil</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>planning.</b> In terms of the Czech Republic, the thesis examines particularly how the population protection is organized in its territory. Last but not least, the thesis specifies international rules of law connected with civil protection, rules of law of the NATO addressing civil protection, rules of law of the EU addressing civil protection and Czech rules of law addressing population protection. The objective of thesis is to compare and evaluate fulfilment of tasks of the Czech and international legislation in the area of civil protection. The thesis will also serve as a study material for students of the branches "Civil Emergency Preparedness" and "Population Protection with Specialization in CBRNE" and as a supporting material for the regional authority and the authorities of municipalities with extended competence. The first section of the research part of the diploma thesis examines selected rules of law of civil protection of the Czech Republic, NATO and EU and, last but not least, Geneva Conventions. In 2013 the new Population Protection Policy for the period until 2020 with an outlook until 2030 entered into effect in the Czech Republic, based on which six areas of population protection were created. A new document of <b>civil</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>planning</b> of NATO is the 2014 - 2017 Political Guidance of CEP. Decision No. 1313 / 2013 /EU on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism has been used as the principal document for civil protection within the EU since 1. 1. 2014. These three rules of law are the main documents used for the comparison and evaluation of fulfilment of tasks of the Czech and international legislation in this thesis and are examined in more detailed. The last of the documents mentioned {{in this part of the}} thesis are the Geneva Conventions, and the thesis examines particularly their embodiment in the Czech legal regulation. At the end of this part there is a summary table that matches Czech rules of law to international rules of law in individual areas. The rules of law of the EU and NATO constitute a superstructure above the rules of law of their Member States and cannot be directly compared; however, it is possible to determine whether the Czech rules of law comply with them. The Geneva Conventions have been embodied in the legal order of the Czech Republic, and other provisions thereof have been implemented through other Acts. As far as NATO is concerned, cooperation takes place particularly between organizations in individual cases. Cooperation and coordination between EU and Member States do not interfere in the primary responsibility for the protection of population, environment, property and cultural heritage of the Member States within their own territories. The Decision on the Mechanism also does not concern mutual rights and obligations of Member States that are embodied in bilateral or multilateral treaties in the area of civil protection. At the conclusion, the thesis proposes certain changes and amendments to the Czech rules of law, which could improve civil protection in the territory of the Czech Republic and facilitate interconnection with the international environment, which has not been working yet as it is supposed to since the new Population Protection Policy has not been in full compliance with the international rules of law...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{radiological}} and chemical weapons {{in the context of}} their use in terrorist attacks against the civilian population in relation to rescue and clean up operations of the Integrated Rescue System (IRS) of the Czech Republic. The objective of the thesis is to specify the terms of radiological and chemical weapons, to assess potential negative consequences of their use with the emphasis on the threat to life and health of the population, to evaluate the economic impact on society and to compare the IRS activities during the immediate intervention carried out after a terrorist attack. The topic is dealt with based on the research and the analysis of rules of law in force regulating activities of the IRS components in these major incidents and also of documents of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and other works focused on the misuse of radioactive and chemical agents in terrorist attacks. Severity and complexity of the issue is illustrated by information given on the radiological accident in Goiana in Brazil, sarin attacks of the Japanese sect Óm šinrikjó and consequences of the model example of the use of radionuclide 137 Cs. In the thesis the current methodology on which the IRS components operate in such emergencies is analyzed, and some aspects that are subject of the set of type activities, worked out by the <b>Civil</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee and DG Fire Rescue Service of the CR, which may become weak points during a real action of the IRS, are pointed out. One of major issues analyzed in this study is comparison of radiological and chemical attacks with the focus on the initial phase of the intervention of the IRS components. Presentation of differences in individual activities of the IRS components in such interventions can contribute significantly to understanding and subsequently managing the activities carried out by the IRS components in these major incidents...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} Thesis {{deals with}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Planning</b> (CEP) in the Czech Republic and its evolution and role within the Alliance. The theoretical {{section of the}} main body focuses on CEP at NATO and Czech national levels. In relation to NATO, this Thesis explains the concept of CEP, its origin and evolution within the Alliance. It describes the course of CEP development as NATO strategy concepts, priorities and CEP aims changed over the time due to changes in political situation. The important point to understand the whole issue is the depiction of tasks to be met by CEP within the Alliance, and the Ministerial Guidance being the primary CEP related document. Five basic tasks applicable {{from the very first}} edition of the Ministerial Guidance till now have been described in detail. An integral part of the NATO CEP is the visualisation of the organisational structure which is necessary for understanding the practical portion. The other section of the main body focuses on CEP as designed for the Czech Republic. At this level, the CEP is a methodological tool for management of incident and crisis planning guaranteeing their interaction and preventing duplicities with defence planning. It defines CEP´s areas of interest and it depicts legislative and institutional support. The practical portion is mainly focusing on meeting basic tasks by individual responsible entities working within four basic planning groups. To get the best possible view of tasks fulfilled based on the Ministerial Guidance, the following method has been chosen: main tasks defined by the Ministerial Guidance have been divided into three main parts in compliance with the task categories of the Ministerial Guidance. The tasks are coped with within the four planning groups. The planning groups are then assigned to ministries that are the responsible entities in terms of the Czech Republic. The result is a clear picture showing main tasks of public administration central bodies, and how these tasks are met within the Alliance plus their translation into the terms and conditions of the Czech Republic. The system also shows the history of each task depicting its conclusion or processing in which case it is transferred into the period of the next Ministerial, now Political, Guidance. The discussion analyses the issue of task fulfilment and importance of financial support to the CEP. The discussion concludes highlighting the necessity of interconnection between the national and NATO levels. This is ensured via permanent representatives in CEPC and representatives in individual planning groups. An example of some member nations shows, how the communication between CEP representatives works (or does not work) at various levels. The end of this Thesis evaluates legislative and institutional CEP interlinking of the Czech Republic and NATO. Unlike the institutional interlink, the legislative interlink is insufficient. The system of interlinking underlines the important role of the permanent representative in CEPC and representatives in planning groups. The main part of conclusion is dedicated to the facts resulting from outcomes and discussion giving clue whether the aims of this Thesis have been reached. The system, how the Czech CEP is working, has been found very efficient even in comparison with long-term members like Great Britain or France. Despite its clear quality and efficiency, it would be desirable to integrate the CEP into the legal system of the Czech Republic and thus to achieve its self-contained legal form. This change would not impact the work itself, but it could add to CEP´s political importance. At the end, a positive response is given to the research question evaluating whether the current status of CEP functioning in the Czech Republic is covering the needs of NATO...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a project}} where a method for {{assessing}} the robustness of a neighbourhood/residential area has been introduced and applied in Buffalo City Municipality in South Africa. The purpose {{of the project was}} to investigate and evaluate the use of the Swedish analysis method for assessing the robustness of a neighbourhood /residential area. The ideas of the robustness method have been developed by the National board of Housing and the former Swedish Agency for <b>Civil</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Planning</b> (ÖCB). The method has never before been used in South Africa. Robustness is a concept of a society’s ability of managing unwanted developments and events of threats in terms of preventing crises and serious events, and reducing the negative consequences. One of the main objectives of a robust society is to develop a local self-sufficiency so that essential needs can be provided in everyday situations as well as in events of different crisis, such as natural disasters, longer disruption of water and electricity supply etc. Robustness is formed by three different aspects ecological, technical and social robustness that in a larger perspective represents the robust society. Economical issues, which also can be referred to economical robustness, are included in all three aspects in different ways. The main focus was implementing the robustness method in Buffalo City. Three areas where selected for the implementation, which consisted of vulnerability and risk assessments that were applied according to the outlines recommended by the developers. The results were further used in a comprehensive analysis of the areas robustness. The studies were carried out in Duncan Village Proper, Amalinda and KwaDikidikana, areas with different preconditions and structures. Duncan village Proper is a very disadvantaged residential area with very poor social conditions and limited service. The area consists mainly of informal settlements and is part of the larger township Duncan Village, located in East London. Amalinda is a high serviced middle class residential area with a mixed population of Black and White residents that is located not far from Duncan Village. KwaDikidikana is located fairly isolated in the rural, in northwest Buffalo City, near the municipality’s second largest city King William’s Town. KwaDikidikana is a village with some traditional culture still preserved. The area has a moderate service of water and electricity. In general the service is very low. Most are self-sufficient in cultivation. Robustness in Duncan Village Proper is considered to be very low, mainly because of the poor social conditions, in terms of poor living conditions, exposed to hazards such as fire, crime, flooding, and landslides, and low self-sufficiency. Robustness in Amalinda is high compared to the other study areas, regarding better housing, social service and infrastructure. However, the residential area is very vulnerable to longer disruptions of service supply, because of the dependence of distribution and the lack of local supplements and is exposed to several hazards of significance. KwaDikidikana has a better survival level than the other areas, but is fragile in terms of robustness, which is considered moderate, practically low. Mainly because of the low level of essential needs, such as transportation, waste management and other vital facilities, which presently has a deteriorating affect on the environment and health. The robustness in these three areas varies considerably, which depends on the different preconditions and geographical locations. Robustness assessments must be formed by the distinguished preconditions of the society, such as geographic location, climate, technical development, and social conditions, essential factors that form the fundamental basis for ecological, technical and social robustness. The basic concept and the ideas of discussions are most necessary and relevant to social planning in the implementation process. Increasing public participation is vital to the democratic process in social planning as well as to robustness. Establishing social networks is a way to increase a better communication between residents and authorities. Theses are some of the important conclusions of the evaluation of the implementation. Detta är projekt innefattar användning och utvärdering av en svensk robusthetsanalys, utformad av ÖCB, i Buffalo City Municipality, Sydafrika. Syftet med arbetet är att utreda robustanalysens funktionsduglighet i Sydafrika genom att tillämpa metoden på tre områden i Buffalo City Municipality. Robusthet är ett koncept som innefattar tre aspekter: Ekologiska, Tekniska och Sociala aspekter. Dessa bildar en helhet som är grunden för det robusta samhället.
