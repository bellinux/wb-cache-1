50|$|In 2003, Cabinet {{approved}} the promulgation of the Air Navigation (Amendment) Regulations 2003. Cabinet based its decision on a submission by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, Josefa Vosanibola, {{who said that}} new regulations were needed to cater {{for changes in the}} aviation industry. “The aviation industry has gone through rapid changes {{in the last few years}} to respond to the needs of the market,” Mr Vosanibola said. He said the services that were normally provided by a state authority had been divided up among various corporations to bring about efficiency in the industry. The Minister said this division of responsibilities among profit making corporations required government to enact appropriate legislation to ensure that the safety of civil aviation was not compromised by commercial considerations. “The amendments also cover operational, safety and health issues arising from the acquisition of larger aircraft by Air Pacific,” he said. These included the manning of emergency doors on twin deck aircraft, and the need to ensure that the crew on these aircraft had adequate rest. Mr Vosanibola said the amended Regulations also return to CAAFI (Civil Aviation Authority of the Fiji Islands) some regulatory powers that were inadvertently passed on to Airports Fiji Limited by the Civil Aviation Reform Act, 1999. A total of 49 Regulations were amended to comply with safety standards and recommended practices introduced by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). These included <b>Certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> Providers; Regulatory Functions; Airworthiness of Aircraft; Licensing; and Flight Operations and Rules of the Air. A transition period of six months from the date of promulgation was provided to allow stakeholders to comply with the amended Regulations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} a new, statistical approach to the feature interaction problem. The approach is based on the ideas originating from Statistical Usage Testing, and aims at rationalizing the process of feature interaction detection during service creation by utilizing the statistical properties of system usage. The most probable combinations of service features should receive the most attention, whereas the combinations whose occurrence probabilities are extremely low or zero may not be considered. In this sense, the proposed statistical approach is an added value to other feature interaction detection methods. By taking advantage of the statistical distributions of the user’s behaviour, it is also possible to provide for efficient verification of service software and <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> quality from the feature interaction point of view. The paper discusses general aspects of the feature interaction problem. The principles of statistical testing and statistical usage modelling of services are outlined. The process of creating the usage specifications of telecom services is presented, and possible applications of the usage specification in feature interaction detection, service software verification, and service quality certification are discussed. 1...|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in trading ecosystem services {{is the need}} to quantify and commoditise services, for monitoring and verification as well as for trade. This is relatively straightforward for goods such as forest honey or shade-grown coffee, but potentially complex for services such as water purification, reducing risk from floods or other disasters or carbon sequestration. Developing certification systems for forest ecosystem services is one potential way to define, quantify and verify these services in a way that buyers can trust, and this is why <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> is promoted by a number of environmental and forestry NGOs. <b>Certification</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> is a useful concept, but many practical and theoretical obstacles must be addressed before it can be put into practice. This paper is a review of existing development in <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem <b>services,</b> with information useful for designing and implementing projects to evaluate the efficacy of new systems. We discuss the potential use of more holistic concepts for measuring management sustainability, which are to date undeveloped and untested, and recommend developing pilot projects that are specifically designed to address a number of challenges inherent to ecosystem service certification...|$|R

We discuss a series of challenges, and suggest that caution is needed: insufficient demand for multiple services, high biophysical service complexity, and elevated monitoring costs all indicate that opportunities for large-scale commercial viability of certified forest ecosystem services are limited. While some certification already exists for forest carbon services, we expect the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> other <b>services</b> to remain a minor niche that seldom justifies major subsidies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{main study}} {{objectives}} were: {{to develop a}} set of requirements of comprehensive breast centres; to establish a nationwide voluntary certification programme for breast centres based on such requirements, a certified quality management system (QMS), and scheduled independent, external audits and periodic recertification; and to demonstrate the general acceptance <b>of</b> such a <b>certification</b> programme {{with a view to}} introducing similar certification programmes for other major cancers. Methods Breast centres introduced a QMS and voluntarily participated in an external certification procedure based on guideline-derived Requirements of Breast Centres specifically developed for the application procedure, all subsequent audits and recertification. All data (numbers of pending and successful applications, sites/centre, etc.) were collected by a newly founded, independent organisation for <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> cancer <b>services</b> delivery. Data analysis was descriptive. Results Requirements of Breast Centres were developed by the German Cancer Society (DKG), the German Society of Senology (DGS) and other relevant specialist medical societies {{in the form of a}} questionnaire comprising 185 essential items based on evidence-based guidelines and the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists' (EUSOMA) requirements of specialist breast units. From late 2002 to mid 2008, the number of participating breast centres rose from 1 to 175. As of mid 2008, 77 % of an estimated 50, 000 new breast cancers in Germany were diagnosed and treated at certified breast centres, 78 % of which were single-site centres. Conclusion Nationwide voluntary <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> breast centres is feasible and well accepted in Germany. Dual <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> breast centres that involves <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> breast <b>services</b> to guideline-derived requirements in conjunction with independent <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> a mandatory QMS can serve as a model for other multidisciplinary site-specific cancer centres. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this report, I {{introduce}} a hybrid approach for certifying security properties <b>of</b> cloud <b>services</b> that combines monitoring and testing data. This report argues {{about the need}} for hybrid certification and examines the basic characteristics <b>of</b> hybrid <b>certification</b> models. The <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> cloud <b>service</b> security has become a necessity due to the on-going concerns about cloud security and the need to increase cloud trustworthiness through rigorous assessments of security by trusted third parties. Unlike the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> security in traditional software systems, which is based on static forms of security assessment (e. g., the Common Criteria model), the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> cloud <b>service</b> security requires continuous assessment. This is because cloud services are provisioned through dynamic infrastructures operating under security controls and other configurations that may change dynamically introducing unforeseen vulnerabilities. Cloud service security can also be compromised because of attacks on co-tenant services. Recent work on cloud service certification applies dynamic forms of security assessment, notably dynamic testing or continuous monitoring. These overcome some of the limitations <b>of</b> traditional security <b>certification</b> and audits (e. g. they produce machine readable certificates incorporating dynamically collected evidence). However, there are cases where existing approaches cannot provide an adequate level of assurance. Testing, for instance, may be insufficient for transactional services, as it is normally performed through a special testing (as opposed to the operational) service interface. Monitoring-based certification may also be insufficient if there is conflicting or inconclusive evidence in monitoring data; such data may, for example, not cover all traces of system events that should be seen to assess a property. To overcome such problems, I am working on a hybrid approach for certifying cloud service security that can combine both monitoring and testing evidence. For that reason, I designed a new cloud certification approach supporting the automated and continuous <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> security properties <b>of</b> cloud <b>services</b> based on the combination of dynamically acquired testing and monitoring evidence that can deliver the high level of assurance and can overcome the limitations of assessments based on each of these types of evidence in isolation. My approach is based on the cloud <b>certification</b> framework <b>of</b> the CUMULUS EU FP 7 project...|$|R
