A transposing structure may be a standard structure with special cross arms, or may be a dead-end structure. The transposing is necessary as there is <b>capacitance</b> <b>between</b> <b>conductors,</b> {{as well as between}} conductors and ground. This is typically not symmetrical across phases.

40|$|Moore’s law has, {{for almost}} half a century, {{described}} a trend in which the number of transistors in integrated circuits have been doubled every year. Properties, such as processing speed, memory capacity and physical size of circuits, are strongly linked to Moore’s prediction. Integrated circuits, such as microprocessors, therefore get smaller yet more and more powerful. The combination of smaller size and larger capacity allow more and more functionality {{to be included in}} small microprocessor devices, such as smart phones and smart cards. This includes security related functions, such as confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation. The use of microprocessor devices is said to make fraud more difficult, however, research has found them susceptible to side-channel attacks. Sensitive information can escape via side-channels such as power consumption or electromagnetic radiation (EMR). When a microprocessor executes its program, power consumption (or resulting EMR) can be used to reveal the content of program and/or data memory of the microprocessor. The correlation between power consumption and microprocessor activity has found many uses: to recover cryptographic keys, to reveal hidden hardware faults, to create a covert channel or to reverse engineer the code executed. This is concerning, considering the increasing demand for and dependability upon microprocessors in secure applications. This thesis contributes by building a more realistic model of the arsenal available to an adversary engaged in reverse engineering microprocessor content through the electromagnetic side-channel. This includes; (i) presenting a new attack, resembling wireless skimming, (ii) a method for in-depth analysis of EMR and better understanding of what and how much EMR is necessary to launch an attack, (iii) a new power model that better explains the underlying phenomena and (iv) a non-invasive method for reverse engineering physical properties based on EMR. The Wireless Covert Channel Attack (WCCA) contributes towards exploiting the electromagnetic side-channel in a new attack and attack scenario for microprocessor smart cards. The attack brings together knowledge from different fields; electromagnetic sidechannels, covert channels and subversion. The scenario assumes that a highly skilled insider is able to hide a small program (subversive code) on a microprocessor smart card in an early stage of the products life cycle. During normal use of the smart card, the subversive code intentionally manipulates the electromagnetic side-channel, creating a covert channel that can potentially broadcast the cards internal secrets to a nearby receiver. The attack is launched without possession of the card and is, therefore, unlikely to be detected by the user. The feasibility of the attack has been demonstrated on modern, high-security cards with all available security features activated, which demonstrates that attacks resembling wireless skimming are feasible. This contribution highlights the importance of life-cycle security focus for products used in secure applications. Challenges faced by WCCA and other side-channel attacks are: What and how much of the available EMR is necessary to launch an attack, and how do choices affect the efficiency of the attack? This thesis recognizes reverse engineering microprocessor content as a pattern recognition problem, and can therefore address these challenges as a feature selection problem. A comparison of several multi-class feature selection methods by their performance in a WCCA application is provided. Combining these results with the template attack provides a method for in-depth analysis of the electromagnetic side-channel. This method was applied to data transfer on the microprocessor’s internal buses, which gave new insight as to the underlying phenomena and revealed that commonly used power models are not suitable to explain the level of detail achieved by Bayesian classification (e. g. template attack). This thesis provides the hypothesis that the classification results can be explained by layout dependent phenomena (LDP). LDP include; (i) inductance and capacitance of conductors, (ii) inductance and <b>capacitance</b> <b>between</b> <b>conductors,</b> (iii) wireless transmission characteristics (i. e. antenna properties) of conductors and other circuit elements and (iv) complex combinations of these phenomena. Simulations and experiments are provided that give new insight as to how capacitance between bus-wires (capacitive crosstalk) influence the energy dissipation and the resulting radiated electromagnetic field in any physical implementation of a digital circuit (e. g. microprocessor). A new power model, based on capacitive crosstalk, is proposed, which better explains the classification results achieved. This can improved side-channel exploitation capabilities. The new power model shows that energy dissipation (i. e. EMR) is a function of internal physical structures of the microprocessor. It can therefore improve the performance of sidechannel attacks that rely upon a good power model to be successful (e. g. power analysis attacks). A spinoff of this result is that if the microprocessor activity is known, {{it should be possible to}} reverse engineer physical structures of the microprocessor. This thesis provides a non-invasive method for determining the relative position of internal bus wires based on known transition pattern and the influence of capacitive crosstalk on EMR. By including other LDP it should be possible to reverse engineer other physical structures of the microprocessor. This is, to the best of our knowledge, a new application area for electromagnetic side-channel information and holds potential for future work...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{technique}} to reduce the effective parasitic capaci-tance of interconnect routing conductors {{in a bid to}} simultaneously reduce power consumption and improve delay. The parasitic ca-pacitance reduction is achieved by ensuring routing conductors ad-jacent to those used by timing critical or high activity nets are left floating- disconnected from either VDD or GND. In doing so, the effective coupling <b>capacitance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>conductors</b> is reduced, because the original coupling <b>capacitance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>conductors</b> is placed in series with other capacitances in the circuit (series com-binations of capacitors correspond to lower effective capacitance).

We also introduce CAD tech-niques to maximize the likelihood that unused routing conductors are made to be adjacent to those used by nets with high activity or low slack, improving both power and speed.

In this paper, we describe an hierarchical capacitance extraction method that efficiently extracts 3 D interconnect capacitances of large regular layout structures such as RAMs and array multipliers. The method is based on a 3 D capacitance extraction method that uses a boundary-element technique and approximate matrix inversion to efficiently compute 3 D interconnect capacitances for flat layout descriptions. The latter method has a computation complexity O(Z), where Z is the size of the layout. In the worst case, the hierarchical extraction method has a computation complexity O(B+U), where B is the total size of the boundary area between all circuit parts in which the circuit is decomposed, and U is the total size of the parts of the circuit that are unique.

40|$|The {{electronics}} in {{the automotive}} industry is facing a new era where safety critical functions are electrified, as for example drive-by-wire technology. At {{the same time as}} the number of electrical loads in the vehicles is increasing, the time to market is decreasing. Full scale prototypes of a vehicle are often only available at a late stage in the development process where changes are rather costly. This implies that prediction and simulation of a system are of importance and are useful already at an early stage of the development process. There are economic benefits that can be gained by prediction and simulation of the system such as: reduction of time to market, virtual tests, virtual prototypes and optimization of electronic circuits with respect to safety margins of filters. The high number of electrical loads in the vehicle leads to different cable harnesses routed along the body and chassis of the vehicle. These cable harnesses will contain both power conductors and communication conductors, routed close together. When conductors are routed close to each other, a signal on one conductor can interfere with the signal on another conductor. This phenomenon is called crosstalk. Crosstalk can increase the noise levels, create unplanned spikes or destroy data on nearby conductors. Hence it should always be a prime suspect in an electromagnetic interference investigation or a candidate for prediction. Crosstalk <b>between</b> two <b>conductors</b> is coupled by the mutual inductance and capacitance. When these parameters are known, the crosstalk can be estimated by using a circuit simulation. The mutual inductance and <b>capacitance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>conductors</b> as well as the self inductance and capacitance of each conductor depend on the surrounding environment. This implies that the conductor layout is an important factor when it comes to designing a system that is robust against crosstalk. This thesis focuses on estimation of the parasitic components in a system with two conductors and a ground structure. Since the parasitic components are affected by the conductor layout, five different layouts are investigated. The parameters are estimated by using analytical calculations, electromagnetic simulations with the software CableMod and measurements. An approximate method for fast analytical calculations is proposed and evaluated. The parameter values estimated with the different methods are compared in the thesis. The values yielded from the accurate analytical calculation and the simulations agree well. Some of the measured values deviate from the theoretical values, and it is shown that the differences emanate from the fact that the theoretical models do not exactly describe the measurement setup. The different parameter setups from the different estimation methods and the investigated conductor layouts are employed in circuit simulations in the software LTSpice/ Switchercad III. The circuit simulations show that the proposed approximate analytical calculation method is sufficient to use for prediction of crosstalk and comparison <b>between</b> different <b>conductor</b> layouts...|$|R

40|$|Fast and {{accurate}} solvers for capacitance extraction are {{needed by the}} VLSI industry {{in order to achieve}} good design quality in feasible time. With the development of technology, this demand is increasing dramatically. Three-dimensional capacitance extraction algorithms are desired due to their high accuracy. However, the present 3 D algorithms are slow and thus their application is limited. In this dissertation, we present several novel techniques to significantly speed up capacitance extraction algorithms based on boundary element methods (BEM) and to compute the capacitance extraction in the presence of floating dummy conductors. We propose the PHiCap algorithm, which is based on a hierarchical refinement algorithm and the wavelet transform. Unlike traditional algorithms which result in dense linear systems, PHiCap converts the coefficient matrix in capacitance extraction problems to a sparse linear system. PHiCap solves the sparse linear system iteratively, with much faster convergence, using an efficient preconditioning technique. We also propose a variant of PHiCap in which the capacitances are solved for directly from a very small linear system. This small system is derived from the original large linear system by reordering the wavelet basis functions and computing an approximate LU factorization. We named the algorithm RedCap. To our knowledge, RedCap is the first capacitance extraction algorithm based on BEM that uses a direct method to solve a reduced linear system. In the presence of floating dummy conductors, the equivalent capacitances among regular conductors are required. For floating dummy conductors, the potential is unknown and the total charge is zero. We embed these requirements into the extraction linear system. Thus, the equivalent capacitance matrix is solved directly. The number of system solves needed is equal to the number of regular conductors. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we propose the selective coefficient enhancement method for increasing the accuracy of selected coupling or self-capacitances with only a small increase in the overall computation time. This method is desirable for applications, such as crosstalk and signal integrity analysis, where the coupling <b>capacitances</b> <b>between</b> some <b>conductors</b> needs high accuracy. We also propose the variable order multipole method which enhances the overall accuracy without raising the overall multipole expansion order. Finally, we apply the multigrid method to capacitance extraction to solve the linear system faster.
