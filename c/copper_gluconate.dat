40|$|An {{experimental}} formulation {{based on}} <b>copper</b> oxychloride and <b>gluconates,</b> which {{is able to}} penetrate vine foliar tissue, was tested for wood treatment {{against some of the}} fungi involved in the diseases included in the esca disease complex. In vitro trials were carried out to: i) test the effect of the formulationon the mycelial growth rate of Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (Pch), Phaeoacremonium aleophilum (Pal) and Fomitiporia mediterranea (Fmed), and on the conidial germination of Pch and Pal; and ii) conduct a preliminaryinvestigation of the presence of the copper formulation on the ability of Pal to produce toxic metabolites. Trials were also conducted on potted vines to i) measure copper penetration into the trunk of potted vines using atomic absorption spectrophotometry; and ii) test the effect of the copper formulation on colonization ofthe fungus in trunks. Finally, the copper formulation was field-tested in vineyards showing leaf stripe. The implications of the tests in the control of the esca disease complex are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background. Rates of iron {{deficiency}} (ID) remain high among children in Ukraine. ID contributes to burdened gastrointestinal pathology {{in children and}} adolescents, but evaluation {{of the impact of}} ID correction on the biliary tract dysfunction course is currently lacking. The objective was to determine the impact of latent ID correction on the clinical course of gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (GSOD) and iron status in schoolchildren. Materials and methods. A case-control study was conducted in 60 children aged 9 – 17 years, who had been undergoing the in-patient treatment for GSOD exacerbation and had latent ID. Children were divided into 2 groups: I — 30 patients treated with iron supplementation (50 mg elemental iron) daily for 125 days; II — 30 children having no iron supplementation. The study of anamnesis, clinical examination, complete blood count, determination of serum iron, transferrin saturation calculation, hair microelement profile evaluation, follow-up for 12 month were performed. Results. The study found that the use of iron supplement in children with GSOD and latent ID not only compensates ID in them, but also facilitates the GSOD course lowering the incidence of GSOD exacerbations by 30. 7 %. Conclusions. Latent ID correction with combined iron, <b>copper</b> and manganese <b>gluconate</b> supplement facilitates the clinical course of GSOD and improves iron status in schoolchildren...|$|R

40|$|The {{duodenal}} switch (DS) {{procedure is}} a type of restrictive-malabsorptive bariatric surgery that is typically reserved for severe morbidly obese people (body mass index > 50 kg/m 2) with obesity-related comorbidities, when diet, lifestyle changes, and pharmacologic therapy fail to achieve adequate weight loss. Patients who undergo the DS procedure are at risk for malabsorption, malnutrition, and nutrient deficiencies. Copper deficiency is a commonly reported long-term complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. However, data are limited on copper deficiency–associated complications and their treatment in DS patients. This article presents a case of a patient who developed hypocupremia with associated pancytopenia, myeloneuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy following DS and reviews the literature related to the pathophysiology of copper deficiency and copper replacement in bariatric surgery patients. When severe diarrhea was present, intravenous elemental copper 4 mg (as cupric chloride) /d in addition to daily oral <b>copper</b> <b>gluconate</b> was necessary to correct the hypocupremia and improve the hematologic indices and neurologic symptoms of copper deficiency. When diarrhea subsided, oral elemental copper 4 mg (as <b>copper</b> <b>gluconate)</b> 3 times daily maintained normal serum copper concentrations and avoided the relapse of severe neurologic dysfunction. Regular monitoring of serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations is recommended following DS surgery to detect any copper deficiency before irreversible neurologic damage occurs. Long-term copper supplementation is likely necessary to maintain normal copper status in DS patients. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|Diethyldithiocarbamate (ditiocarb), a {{metabolite}} {{of the old}} anti-alcoholic drug disulfiram (Antabuse), forms proteasome-inhibiting metal complexes with copper or zinc that suppress {{cancer cells}} both in vitro and in vivo. The drug {{has been used in}} a clinical trial (NCT 00742911) along with <b>copper</b> <b>gluconate</b> as a dietary supplement in patients with cancer spreading to the liver. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of synthetic complexes of disulfiram with four various metals (Mn, Fe, Cr and Cu) used as food supplements. These complexes may be spontaneously formed in the blood during the use of disulfiram with divalent metals and thus may suppress the growth of cancer in vivo. The cytotoxic effect of the compounds and the compounds' ability to inhibit the cellular proteasome were tested in the osteosarcoma cell line U 2 OS. After 48 h, copper and manganese complexes exhibited cytotoxic effect on the cell line, in sharp contrast to both iron and chromium complexes.

40|$|Kast, Richard E. et al. To improve {{prognosis}} in recurrent glioblastoma {{we developed a}} treatment protocol based {{on a combination of}} drugs not traditionally thought of as cytotoxic chemotherapy agents but that have a robust history of being well-tolerated and are already marketed and used for other non-cancer indications. Focus was on adding drugs which met these criteria: a) were pharmacologically well characterized, b) had low likelihood of adding to patient side effect burden, c) had evidence for interfering with a recognized, well-characterized growth promoting element of glioblastoma, and d) were coordinated, as an ensemble had reasonable likelihood of concerted activity against key biological features of glioblastoma growth. We found nine drugs meeting these criteria and propose adding them to continuous low dose temozolomide, a currently accepted treatment for relapsed glioblastoma, in patients with recurrent disease after primary treatment with the Stupp Protocol. The nine adjuvant drug regimen, Coordinated Undermining of Survival Paths, CUSP 9, then are aprepitant, artesunate, auranofin, captopril, <b>copper</b> <b>gluconate,</b> disulfiram, ketoconazole, nelfinavir, sertraline, to be added to continuous low dose temozolomide. We discuss each drug in turn and the specific rationale for use- how each drug is expected to retard glioblastoma growth and undermine glioblastoma’s compensatory mechanisms engaged during temozolomide treatment. The risks of pharmacological interactions and why we believe this drug mix will increase both quality of life and overall survival are reviewed. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the medical}} urgency {{presented}} by cubozoan envenomations, ineffective and contradictory first-aid management recommendations persist. A critical barrier to {{progress has been}} the lack of readily available and reproducible envenomation assays that (1) recapitulate live-tentacle stings; (2) allow quantitation and imaging of cnidae discharge; (3) allow primary quantitation of venom toxicity; and (4) employ rigorous controls. We report the implementation of an integrated array of three experimental approaches {{designed to meet the}} above-stated criteria. Mechanistically overlapping, yet distinct, the three approaches comprised (1) direct application of test solutions on live tentacles (termed tentacle solution assay, or TSA) with single image- and video-microscopy; (2) spontaneous stinging assay using freshly excised tentacles overlaid on substrate of live human red blood cells suspended in agarose (tentacle blood agarose assays, or TBAA); and (3) a “skin” covered adaptation of TBAA (tentacle skin blood agarose assay, or TSBAA). We report the use and results of these assays to evaluate the efficacy of topical first-aid approaches to inhibit tentacle firing and venom activity. TSA results included the potent stimulation of massive cnidae discharge by alcohols but only moderate induction by urine, freshwater, and “cola” (carbonated soft drink). Although vinegar, the 40 -year field standard of first aid for the removal of adherent tentacles, completely inhibited cnidae firing in TSA and TSBAA ex vivo models, the most striking inhibition of both tentacle firing and subsequent venom-induced hemolysis was observed using newly-developed proprietary formulations (Sting No More™) containing <b>copper</b> <b>gluconate,</b> magnesium sulfate, and urea...|$|E
