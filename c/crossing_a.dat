5|$|Darius' initial {{response}} was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's <b>crossing.</b> <b>A</b> core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was usual for Persian kings, Darius positioned {{himself in the}} centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of his large army. A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away from the coast. A mass of cavalry commanded by Nabarsanes occupied the Persian right.|$|E
