5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} {{veracity}} of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R.

Contemporary scholars Richard F. Burton and Jules Remy also dismissed the secrecy argument, in 1860 and 1855 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, the Flames signed Regehr {{to another}} five-year {{contract}} extension worth {{a total of}} US$20-million. The deal {{was considered to be}} worth less than he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> as an unrestricted free agent the following year, but he chose to take less to stay in a city his family enjoyed and on a team he felt was competitive. Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E
25|$|A fictional but illustrative example: a {{merchant}} is traveling from Florence to London. He buys {{a bill of}} exchange for 10 florins, {{with the understanding that}} the London branch will cash that bill at half a pound to the florin, for a total of 5 pounds. If he reaches London and discovers that the florin has become stronger against the pound, to the point where a florin buys a whole pound, he takes a loss: instead of the 10 pounds he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> had he not bought the bill of exchange, he will instead receive only 5. Similarly, if the florin weakens greatly, he could well reap a windfall {{at the expense of the}} London branch.|$|E

[...] She further elaborated that [...] "Don Draper is a sad character, true, {{but there is some}} real comic {{potential in}} his pretensions and vanity. The writers are tapping into this aspect of his characterization to a small degree, but they aren’t really satirizing it." [...] Hughes was not impressed with the Mad Men parody and sarcastically stated that the spoof was [...] "so sharp, you'll swear it's 2008".|$|E
500|$|By 1949, Van Buren's {{annual salary}} was $15,000. Despite the Eagles {{franchise}} struggling financially the previous season, Neale {{was willing to}} pay him more, but Van Buren declined. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> a good deal more," [...] he said. [...] "But you acted a little different when your team lost money." [...] He came into his sixth NFL season needing 104 rushing yards to break Clarke Hinkle's career record of 3,860, which he set after ten seasons with the Packers. Van Buren passed Hinkle's mark against the Detroit Lions in the second game of the season, {{and by the end of}} the year had broken his own single-season record as he rushed for 1,146 yards. He became the first running back in NFL history to achieve three consecutive rushing titles. Jim Brown twice, Earl Campbell, and Emmitt Smith have since managed the feat. The Eagles clinched the Eastern Division title in the tenth game of the season with a win over the Steelers. With Pittsburgh's defense designed to stop him, Van Buren ran for 205 yards on 27 carries, setting an Eagles single-game franchise record for rushing yards that stood for over sixty years. The Eagles won their final two games and advanced to their third NFL championship game in as many seasons.|$|E
500|$|The Volunteers {{started at}} their 27-yard line {{to begin the}} drive, but went three and out and punted back to the Hokies without gaining a first down. The kick was {{returned}} to the Tech 39-yard line, where the Hokies' offense started with 31 seconds remaining in the quarter. On the first play of the drive, wide receiver Bryan Still {{broke away from the}} Tennessee defense and was wide open for a pass. Maurice DeShazo threw the ball to Still, but Still dropped the pass after it bounced off his chest, thus denying the Hokies a touchdown. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer later cited the dropped pass as a critical turning point in the game, saying, [...] "I think if he could have made that catch, we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> back in the game." [...] Tech player Torrian Gray agreed, saying, [...] "When he dropped the ball, that took a lot out of us." [...] After Still's dropped pass, DeShazo threw two incomplete passes and Virginia Tech punted back to Tennessee. The kick was caught by near the Tennessee 10-yard line, and returned {{all the way to the}} Virginia Tech 37-yard line. At the end of the third quarter, Tennessee still led, 3516.|$|E

500|$|Nikki and Paulo {{were killed}} off due to being disliked by much of Losts fan base. Show runner Damon Lindelof {{admitted}} that the couple were [...] "universally despised" [...] by fans. Lindelof explained that [...] "back when we (the producers) had more good faith with the audience, we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> away with these shenanigans. Given the backlash against them, we had {{to clean up the}} mess." [...] The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in December 2006. It was also stated by Lindelof and fellow show runners Carlton Cuse that despite Nikki and Paulo's bad reception, they felt the episode was necessary to explain their original plan of introducing former background characters to the main cast. Lindelof suggested having the characters be buried alive. Although actress Kiele Sanchez said that she wasn't bothered by the general dislike of her character, she was very nervous during the burial scene, because she has claustrophobia. Speculation about the duo's deaths began months before the actual episode aired. Santoro {{said in an interview with}} Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character was going to die in the middle of the third season. Another clue about the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for the ABC show, Football Wives.|$|E
500|$|Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris), and Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{are worried}} because Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) has not left her abusive husband, Cooter (Eric Bruskotter), as she claimed. Beiste tells them that adult {{relationships}} {{are more complex}} and insists she is fine. Hockey player Rick [...] "The Stick" [...] (Rock Anthony) ridicules Puck for being seen in the dress; they agree to a fight outside the school. Rick gains the upper hand and Puck is thrown into a dumpster, but he emerges brandishing a switchblade. Coach Beiste breaks up the fight; in the locker room, Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop, and she retorts that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> expelled. Puck replies that he is flunking out anyway and a failure, telling her {{that she does not}} {{know what it feels like}} to be worthless. He breaks down, and Beiste comforts him as he cries. At home, Beiste tells Cooter that she is leaving him, and removes her wedding ring. He asks who else would love her; she answers: [...] "Me". Back at the school auditorium, she joins Puck in singing [...] "Mean", tells him that she has arranged for him to retake a crucial test to graduate, and promises to help him pass. As the episode ends, Rachel and Tina sing [...] "Flashdance... What a Feeling", and board the glee club's bus to Nationals.|$|E
2500|$|Although LeMay {{told the}} President that he {{considered}} {{the resolution of the}} crisis the [...] "greatest defeat in our history", his was a minority position.

2500|$|After a year's hiatus, Bale {{returned}} in 2004 to play Trevor Reznik, {{the title character}} in the psychological thriller The Machinist. Bale gained attention for his devotion to the role and for the lengths to which he went to achieve Reznik's emaciated, skeletal appearance. He went without proper rest for prolonged periods, and placed himself on a crash diet of generally coffee and apples, which reduced his weight by 63 pounds (...) {{in a matter of}} months. By the end of filming Bale weighed only 121 pounds (...) , a transformation he described as [...] "very calming mentally" [...] which drew comparisons to Robert De Niro's alternate weight-gaining regimen for his role as Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film Raging Bull. Bale claimed that he had not worked {{for a period of time}} before he was cast in the film: [...] " [...] just hadn't found scripts that I'd really been interested in. So I was really dying for something to arrive. Then when this one did, I just didn't want to put it down. I finished it and, upon the kind of revelation that you get at the end, I immediately wanted to go back and re-visit it, to take a look at what clues I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> throughout". The Machinist was a low-budget production, costing roughly US$5million to produce, and was given only a limited US release.
