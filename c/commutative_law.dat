500|$|The {{commutative}} property (or <b>commutative</b> <b>law)</b> is a property generally associated with binary operations and functions. [...] If the {{commutative property}} holds {{for a pair}} of elements under a certain binary operation then the two elements are said to commute under that operation.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} {{addition}} is commutative {{is known as}} the [...] "commutative law of addition". This phrase suggests that there are other commutative laws: for example, there is a <b>commutative</b> <b>law</b> of multiplication. However, many binary operations are not commutative, such as subtraction and division, so it is misleading to speak of an unqualified [...] "commutative law".|$|E

500|$|Noncommutative {{geometry}} is {{a branch}} of mathematics that attempts to generalize this situation. Rather than working with ordinary numbers, one considers some similar objects, such as matrices, whose multiplication does not satisfy the <b>commutative</b> <b>law</b> (that is, objects for which [...] is not necessarily equal to [...] ). One imagines that these noncommuting objects are coordinates on some more general notion of [...] "space" [...] and proves theorems about these generalized spaces by exploiting the analogy with ordinary geometry.|$|E
500|$|In geometry, it {{is often}} useful to {{introduce}} coordinates. For example, in order to study the geometry of the Euclidean plane, one defines the coordinates [...] and [...] as the distances between any point in the plane {{and a pair of}} axes. In ordinary geometry, the coordinates of a point are numbers, so they can be multiplied, and the product of two coordinates does not depend on the order of multiplication. That is, [...] This property of multiplication is known as the <b>commutative</b> <b>law,</b> and this relationship between geometry and the commutative algebra of coordinates is the starting point for much of modern geometry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{order in}} which real or complex numbers are multiplied has no bearing on the product; {{this is known as}} the <b>commutative</b> <b>law</b> of multiplication. [...] When {{matrices}} or members of various other associative algebras are multiplied, the product usually depends on the order of the factors. Matrix multiplication, for example, and multiplication in other algebras is in general non-commutative.|$|E
50|$|The natural mapping {{from the}} {{integers}} to the congruence classes modulo n that takes an integer to its congruence class modulo n respects products. This {{implies that the}} class containing 1 is the unique multiplicative identity, and also the associative and <b>commutative</b> <b>laws</b> hold. In fact it is a ring homomorphism.|$|R

2500|$|The hyperreal numbers {{satisfy the}} {{transfer}} principle, a rigorous version of Leibniz's heuristic Law of Continuity. [...] The transfer principle states that true first order statements about R are also valid in *R. For example, the <b>commutative</b> <b>law</b> of addition, x+y=y+x, holds for the hyperreals {{just as it}} does for the reals; since R is a real closed field, so is *R. [...] Since [...] for all integers n, one also has [...] for all hyperintegers H. [...] The transfer principle for ultrapowers {{is a consequence of}} Łoś' theorem of 1955.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>commutative</b> <b>law</b> of {{addition}} {{can be used}} {{to rearrange}} terms into any preferred order. In polynomials with one indeterminate, the terms are usually ordered according to degree, either in [...] "descending powers of [...] ", with the term of largest degree first, or in [...] "ascending powers of [...] ". The polynomial in the example above is written in descending powers of [...] The first term has coefficient , indeterminate , and exponent [...] In the second term, the coefficient [...] The third term is a constant. Because the degree of a non-zero polynomial is the largest degree of any one term, this polynomial has degree two.|$|E
2500|$|De Morgan professes {{to give a}} {{complete}} inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey, for he says, [...] "Any system of symbols which obeys these rules and no othersexcept they be formed by combination of these rulesand which uses the preceding symbols and no othersexcept they be new symbols invented in abbreviation of combinations of these symbolsis symbolic algebra." [...] From his point of view, {{none of the above}} principles are rules; they are formal laws, that is, arbitrarily chosen relations to which the algebraic symbols must be subject. He does not mention the law, which had already been pointed out by Gregory, namely, [...] and to which was afterwards given the name Law of association. If the <b>commutative</b> <b>law</b> fails, the associative may hold good; but not vice versa. It is an unfortunate thing for the symbolist or formalist that in universal arithmetic [...] is not equal to for then the <b>commutative</b> <b>law</b> would have full scope. Why does he not give it full scope? Because the foundations of algebra are, after all, real not formal, material not symbolic. To the formalists the index operations are exceedingly refractory, in consequence of which some take no account of them, but relegate them to applied mathematics. To give an inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey is an impossible task, and reminds one not a little of the task of those philosophers who attempt to give an inventory of the a priori knowledge of the mind.|$|E

40|$|Gyrogroups are {{generalized}} groups modelled on the Ein-stein groupoid of all relativistically admissible velocities {{with their}} Einstein’s velocity addition as a binary operation. Ein-stein’s gyrogroup fails {{to form a}} group since it is nonassocia-tive.

40|$|LP^⊃,F is a three-valued paraconsistent {{propositional logic}} which is {{essentially}} the same as J 3. It has most properties that have been proposed as desirable properties of a reasonable paraconsistent propositional logic. However, it follows easily from already published results that there are exactly 8192 different three-valued paraconsistent propositional logics that have the properties concerned. In this note, properties concerning the logical equivalence relation of a logic are used to distinguish LP^⊃,F from the others. As one of the bonuses of focussing on the logical equivalence relation, it is found that only 32 of the 8192 logics have a logical equivalence relation that satisfies the identity, annihilation, idempotent, and <b>commutative</b> <b>laws</b> for conjunction and disjunction.

Many quantum algorithms can be expressed as applications of operators formed by conjugating so-called classical operators.

We prove many new <b>commutative</b> <b>laws</b> between these different operators, and we use those to phrase and analyze old and new problems and algorithms. As an example, we review the Abelian subgroup problem. We then introduce the problem of determining a group homomorphism, and we give classical and quantum algorithms for it.

We show that ground AC rewrite systems are equivalent to Process Rewrite Systems (PRS) for which reachability is decidable [4]. However, the decidability proofs for PRS are cumbersome and thus {{we present a}} simpler and more readable proof {{in the framework of}} ground AC rewrite systems. Moreover, we show decidability of reachability of states with certain properties and decidability of the boundedness problem. 1 Introduction Ground AC systems are obtained by combining ground rewrite systems (i. e. rewrite systems without substitution) with the associative and <b>commutative</b> <b>laws</b> for a symbol denoted by +. These laws are applied as symmetric rewrite rules, i. e. from right to left and vice-versa. The reachability problem for ground AC systems has already been considered by A. Deruyver and R.

40|$|Abstract. A {{derivation}} in a transformational system {{such as a}} graph grammar may be redundant in {{the sense}} that the exact order of the transformations may not &ed the final outcome; all that matters is that each transformation, when applied, is applied to the correct substructure. By taking advantage of this redundancy, we can develop an efficient encoding scheme for such derivations. This encoding scheme has a number of diverse applications. It can be used in efficient enumeration of combinatorial objeds or for compact representation of program and data structure transformations. It can also be used to derive lower bounds on lengths of derivations. It is shown, for example, that n(n 1 ogn) applications of the associative and <b>commutative</b> <b>laws</b> are required in the worst case to transform an n-variable expression over a binary associative, commutative operation into some other equivalent expression. Similarly, it is shown that n(n 1 ogn) “diagonal flips ” are required in the worst case to transform one n-vertex numbered triangulated planar graph into some other one. Both of these lower bounds have matching upper bounds. An O(n log n) upper bound for associative, commutative operations was known previously, whereas here an O(n log n) upper bound for diagonal flips is obtained...|$|R
