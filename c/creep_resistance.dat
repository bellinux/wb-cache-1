5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, <b>creep</b> <b>resistance,</b> specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creep</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is a key}} {{property}} of the refractory metals. In metals, the starting of creep correlates with the melting point of the material; the creep in aluminium alloys starts at 200°C, while for refractory metals temperatures above 1500°C are necessary. This resistance against deformation at high temperatures makes the refractory metals suitable against strong forces at high temperature, for example in jet engines, or tools used during forging.|$|E
30|$|A {{change in}} {{mechanical}} properties {{can be achieved}} by further cross-linking of the polymeric structure, which leads to higher strength, elastic modulus and <b>creep</b> <b>resistances</b> [4]. For polyurethanes, the linear polyurethane macromolecules needs to be converted into a three-dimensional structure with an elastomeric or duromeric character [5, 6] by forming allophanate and biuret bonds from the reaction of urethane and urea bonds with free isocyanates. The occurrence of this chemical reaction depends mainly on the temperature, which ensures the necessary reaction energy of the active hydrogen at the nitrogen in the urethane bond.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the <b>creep</b> {{deformation}} <b>resistance</b> {{of a variety of}} metals is reduced by repeated reversed deformation at temperatures above 0. 4 Tm, where Tm is the absolute melting temperature of each metal. The reduction of <b>creep</b> deformation <b>resistance</b> due to stress reversals is most prominent at approximately 0. 5 Tm where the average creep rate may increase by as much as a factor of twenty due to 50 - 100 stress reversals. Metallographic studies show that the observed acceleration of creep at high temperatures is in part due to the enhancement of grain boundary sliding as a result of gradual grain boundary migration toward planes of maximum shear stress during reversed creep deformation...|$|R

25|$|Additionally, the {{molecular}} {{weight of the}} polymer of interest is known to affect its creep behavior. The effect of increasing molecular weight tends to promote secondary bonding between polymer chains and thus make the polymer more creep resistant. Similarly, aromatic polymers are even more creep resistant due to the added stiffness from the rings. Both molecular weight and aromatic rings add to polymers' thermal stability, increasing the <b>creep</b> <b>resistance</b> of a polymer.|$|E
25|$|Molybdenum based alloys {{are widely}} used, {{because they are}} cheaper than {{superior}} tungsten alloys. The most widely used alloy of molybdenum is the Titanium-Zirconium-Molybdenum alloy TZM, composed of 0.5% titanium and 0.08% of zirconium (with molybdenum being the rest). The alloy exhibits a higher <b>creep</b> <b>resistance</b> and strength at high temperatures, making service temperatures of above 1060°C possible for the material. The high resistivity of Mo-30W, an alloy of 70% molybdenum and 30% tungsten, against the attack of molten zinc makes it the ideal material for casting zinc. It {{is also used to}} construct valves for molten zinc.|$|E

40|$|The {{wear and}} <b>creep</b> {{deformation}} <b>resistances</b> of polymeric orthopedic bearing materials are both important for extending their longevity. In this study, we evaluated the wear and <b>creep</b> deformation <b>resistances,</b> including backside damage, of different polyethylene (PE) materials, namely, conventional PE, cross-linked PE (CLPE), and poly(2 -methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) - (PMPC-) grafted CLPE, through wear tests and finite element analysis. The gravimetric and volumetric degrees of wear of disks (3 or 6 [*]mm in thickness) {{of these materials}} against a cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy pin were examined using a multidirectional pin-on-disk tester. Cross-linking and PMPC grafting decreased the gravimetric wear of the PE disks significantly. The volumetric wear at the bearing surface and the volumetric penetration in the backside of the 3 -mm thick PE disk were {{higher than those of}} the 6 -mm thick PE disk, regardless of the bearing material. The geometrical changes induced in the PE disks consisted of creep, because the calculated internal von Mises stress at the bearing side of all disks and that at the backside of the 3 -mm thick disks exceeded their actual yield strengths. A highly hydrated bearing surface layer, formed by PMPC grafting, and a cross-linking-strengthened substrate of adequate thickness are essential for increasing the wear and <b>creep</b> deformation <b>resistances...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of cobalt content {{on the high}} temperature creep fatigue crack initiation resistance of three primary alloys was evaluated. These were Waspalloy, Powder U 700, and Cast U 700, with cobalt contents ranging from 0 up to 17 percent. Waspalloy was studied at 538 C whereas the U 700 was studied at 760 C. Constraints of the program required investigation at a single strain range using diametral strain control. The approach was phenomenological, using standard low cycle fatigue tests involving continuous cycling tension hold cycling, compression hold cycling, and symmetric hold cycling. Cycling {{in the absence of}} or between holds was done at 0. 5 Hz, whereas holds when introduced lasted 1 minute. The plan was to allocate two specimens to the continuous cycling, and one specimen to each of the hold time conditions.

The {{influence of}} cobalt content on <b>creep</b> fatigue <b>resistance</b> was not judged to be very significant based on the results generated.
