5|$|Warfarin {{first came}} into {{commercial}} use in 1948 as a rat poison. In 1954 it was approved for medical use in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Warfarin is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$1.12 to 7.20 for a typical month of treatment. In the United States it usually <b>costs</b> <b>less</b> than $25 a month.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} New York {{businesses}} found {{an increase of}} 8.5 percent in health care <b>costs,</b> <b>less</b> than the prior year's survey had expected. A 10 percent increase was expected for 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{government}} columbaria and 57 private ones. The government-operated columbaria are at Mandai, Yishun and Choa Chu Kang. (A fourth government columbarium at Mount Vernon {{is due to}} close at an unspecified date due to redevelopment of its surrounding area into a public housing estate.) Private columbaria are operated by the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Mary of the Angels in Bukit Batok, and the Singapore Soka Association, among others. As with crematoria, {{there is a significant}} price difference between niches in private and government columbaria. A standard niche in any government columbarium <b>costs</b> <b>less</b> than $900, but one at the Kong Meng San monastery costs more than $15,000. The government columbaria allocate niches sequentially, and charge an extra $250 for any location change request; for an extra price, the private columbaria allow families to choose niche locations subject to availability, and even to pre-book niches before death.|$|E

5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon <b>costs</b> <b>less</b> than a cent per liter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, {{commodity}} prices for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of manufacturing a nickel from 3.46 cents in fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 cents in fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily made of steel) still <b>costs</b> <b>less</b> than its face value to produce as of 2013. In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act (CMOCA), directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation declared that there is no material that would reduce the one-cent coin's manufacturing cost to below one cent, so it was removed from consideration. The report requested additional time to study the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expected demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.|$|E

25|$|When {{dentures}} {{no longer}} fit well, the correct action {{is to seek}} follow-up care.

Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a denture, but it is only a temporary solution; it does not solve the problem. Fortunately, dentures can often be relined with relining materials to restore the proper fit, and this process <b>costs</b> <b>less</b> than creation of new dentures.

Moreover, poor structural quality is strongly correlated with high-impact business disruptions due to corrupted data, application outages, security breaches, and performance problems.|$|E
