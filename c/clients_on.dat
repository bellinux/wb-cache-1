5|$|Clues from Mollaka {{point to}} corrupt Greek {{official}} Alex Dimitrios. Bond finds Dimitrios in the Bahamas and, after seducing his wife Solange, pursues him to Miami. Bond kills Dimitrios and follows his henchman to the airport. He thwarts {{the destruction of}} Skyfleet's airliner, costing Le Chiffre his investment. To recoup the money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government, which they will grant in exchange for information on his <b>clients.</b> <b>On</b> the train to Montenegro, Bond meets Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent there to protect the government's $10million buy-in.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{distributed}} computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing {{contributions to the}} project through a credit system. All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released. Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though {{through the use of}} a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority. Users may also receive credit for their work by <b>clients</b> <b>on</b> multiple machines. This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.|$|E

5|$|Sihanouk, {{hearing of}} the turmoil, headed for Moscow and Beijing in order to demand that the patrons of PAVN and the Viet Cong exert {{more control over their}} <b>clients.</b> <b>On</b> 18 March 1970, Lon Nol {{requested}} that the National Assembly vote {{on the future of the}} prince's leadership of the nation. Sihanouk was ousted from power by a vote of 92–0. Heng Cheng became president of the National Assembly, while Prime Minister Lon Nol was granted emergency powers. Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and constitutional and it received the recognition of most foreign governments. There have been, and continue to be, accusations that the U.S. government played some role in the overthrow of Sihanouk, but conclusive evidence has never been found to support them.|$|E

25|$|Goldman Sachs {{is one of}} {{the leading}} M {{advisory}} firms, often topping the Thomson Financial league tables in sizes of transactions. The firm gained a reputation as a white knight in the mergers and acquisitions sector by advising <b>clients</b> <b>on</b> how to avoid unfriendly hostile takeovers. During the 1980s, Goldman Sachs was the only major investment bank with a strict policy against helping to initiate a hostile takeover, which increased the firm's reputation immensely among sitting management teams at the time.|$|E

25|$|Nicholson and Avery set up SHAC in 1999, {{along with}} Natasha Dellemagne, to close Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS). The company was saved when the British {{government}} provided it with banking facilities, after the UK's major banks severed ties {{with it as}} a result of the campaign. HLS is Europe's largest contract animal-testing company, testing everything from pesticides to drugs, on behalf of commercial <b>clients,</b> <b>on</b> around 75,000 animals a year, including rats, rabbits, pigs, dogs, and primates. HLS was the subject of an undercover investigation by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection in 1989, which alleged that workers routinely mishandled the animals. Nicholson, Avery, and Dellemagne set up SHAC in November 1999, after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals obtained undercover footage showed HLS staff punching and shaking beagles in the company's laboratory in Cambridge, England.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{the work of}} Emily Kngwarreye, from the Utopia {{community}} north east of Alice Springs, became very popular. Although she {{had been involved in}} craftwork for most of her life, it was only when she was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. Her works include Earth's Creation. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece Kathleen Petyarre, Minnie Pwerle, Dorothy Napangardi, Lena Pwerle, Angelina Ngale (Pwerle) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, has become such an issue that some art centres have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective <b>clients</b> <b>on</b> a waiting list for work.|$|E

25|$|In June 1986 Mehmet and Ali start a cab {{firm called}} 'OzCabs' from a corner table in Ali's Café. Mehmet is married with three children, but monogamy is one {{sanctity}} of marriage {{that he is}} {{more than willing to}} overlook. Later that month punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) catches his eye, and so he bets his sceptical brother £10 that he can get Mary to have sex with him. Mary is well aware that Mehmet's intentions are dishonourable and initially refuses to have sex with him, but Mehmet persists and she finally relents and spends the night with him. A triumphant Mehmet then collects his winnings and gloats to his brother in the café. However, Mary overhears their entire conversation and she then sets about trying to get revenge on him by hoax calling his cab-firm and vandalising his car. Later in the year Mehmet acts as Pat Wicks's (Pam St. Clement) pimp, setting her up with <b>clients</b> <b>on</b> a regular basis and he even persuades Pat to convince Mary to go prostitute herself too. He also gets involved in Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) Knitting business, later conning her and disappearing with all her profits. After he gets into more trouble with his customers for overcharging on fares and then trying to seduce Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) — the wife of his employee — the residents of Albert Square decide to confront him. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) find him and give him a severe beating which involves having his arms pinned behind his back whilst taking a number of blows to the stomach.|$|E
