The review includes a comprehensive assessment {{of the quality of}} all 37 included observational studies. Studies in high-risk populations consisted of four cohort <b>studies,</b> 12 <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies,</b> and three case-control studies; general population studies consisted of one cohort <b>study,</b> 16 <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies,</b> and one case-control study. There is evidence of methodological heterogeneity between studies, and statistical heterogeneity was highly significant for both general population <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> (chi(2) = 132. 34; degrees of freedom [df]= 15; p< 0. 00001) and high-risk <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> (chi(2) = 29. 70; df= 10; p= 0. 001). Study quality was very variable and no studies measured the same set of potential confounding variables. Therefore, conducting a meta-analysis was inappropriate. Detailed quality assessment of observational studies can provide a useful visual aid to interpreting findings. Although most studies show an association between male circumcision and prevention of HIV, these results may be limited by confounding, which is unlikely to be adjusted for...|$|R
25|$|A {{longitudinal}} study {{is one that}} follows test subjects {{over a long period}} of time — as opposed to a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>study,</b> which gives a 'snap-shot' of a group at one point in time. Longitudinal studies tend to examine smaller groups in greater detail, whereas cross-sectional studies are often based on a more representative segment of the population over a short time.

25|$|PCBs {{have shown}} toxic and {{mutagenic}} effects by interfering with hormones in the body. PCBs, {{depending on the}} specific congener, {{have been shown to}} both inhibit and imitate estradiol, the main sex hormone in females. Imitation of the estrogen compound can feed estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells, and possibly cause other cancers, such as uterine or cervical. Inhibition of estradiol can lead to serious developmental problems for both males and females, including sexual, skeletal, and mental development issues. In a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>study,</b> PCBs were found to be negatively associated with testosterone levels in adolescent boys.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{psychological}} studies recruit college students to participate for reasons of convenience, and the studies on the social sharing of emotion were no exception. For this reason, the question was raised of whether the level of education {{plays a role in}} these sharing behaviors. A 1998 study addressed this question by analyzing data from a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>study</b> of girls in elementary school, middle school, high school, girls pursuing an undergraduate education in college, and girls pursuing a master's degree. Despite possible reasons to believe that education might increase the capacity to and likelihood of sharing behaviors, no differences were found.|$|E

25|$|Although {{opinions}} differ, others {{suggest that}} sexual activity {{is an essential}} part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex. Sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction. In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity according to one particular research study. In a rural upstate New York community, a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>study</b> of teenagers was completed in 2008 and 2009. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17. Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> {{represent}} the second line of evidence (after case reports) in {{the ladder of}} evidence aimed at defining disease aetiology. This study design is used to generate hypotheses about the determinants of a given disease but also to investigate the accuracy of diagnostic tests and to assess the burden of a given disease in a population. The intrinsic limitation of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies,</b> when applied to generate aetiological hypotheses, is that both the exposure under investigation and the disease of interest are measured {{at the same point}} in time. For this reason, generally the cross-sectional design does not provide definitive proofs about cause-and-effect relationships. An advantage of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> in aetiological and diagnostic research is that they allow researchers to consider many different putative risk factors/diagnostic markers at the same time. For example, in a hypothetical study aimed at generating hypotheses about the risk factors for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with chronic kidney disease, investigators could look at several risk factors as potential determinants of LVH (age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, inflammation, etc.) with minimal or no additional costs.

40|$|Background: Obesity is a {{well-known}} cause of cardiovascular disease burden and premature death, but effects on psychological morbidity remain uncertain. This article reports findings following a systematic review of epidemiological studies to determine whether obesity causes depression. Methods: Multiple databases were searched for English-language studies of etiology of obesity (exposure variable, analyzed as an ordered category) on depression outcomes (dependent variables, continuous or categorical). Studies in children and in women during pregnancy or postpartum were excluded, as were nonrepresentative <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies.</b> Searches and identification of studies for inclusion were performed by EA, whereas a descriptive synthesis of important study characteristics was undertaken independently by us. Results: We reviewed 24 out of approximately 4500 potentially relevant studies; 4 were prospective cohort studies and 20 were <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> (10 from the United States). Effect measures reported in all prospective cohort studies were consistent and suggested that obesity may increase the odds of future depression outcomes (symptoms or nonclinical diagnosis of depression). Effect measures reported in most <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> from the United States supported the hypothesized association between obesity and prevalence of depression outcomes for women but not men, in contrast most <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> from populations other than the United States consistently failed to find such associations. Conclusions: Overall, there is a weak level of evidence supporting the hypothesis that obesity increases the incidence of depression outcomes. Few high-quality prospective cohort <b>studies</b> exist, and <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>studies</b> account for the vast body of published evidence, and therefore firm conclusions for causality cannot yet be drawn. Our finding warrants additional high-quality etiological research on this topic. E Atlantis and M Bake...|$|R
