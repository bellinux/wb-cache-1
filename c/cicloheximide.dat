The term induced inaccessibility {{has been}} adopted to {{describe}} situations where early failed attacks by biotrophic pathogens to plant cells increase resistance to later attacks in that and neighboring cells. This kind of resistance widely relay in penetration resistance events however the particular cellular and molecular bases remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of de novo protein formation and cytoskeleton assembly on induce d inaccessibility of pea (Pisum sativum) cells. For this aim, we sequentially inoculated pea leaves of the susceptible cv. Mesire, with an inappropriate powdery mildew species (Blumeria graminisf. sp. avenae), which causes a non 2 host interaction and then with pea powdery mildew (Erysiphe pisi). The epidermal pea cells in which the inappropriate powdery mildew failed to penetrate a nd their neighboring cells showed inaccessibility to subsequent infections by the pea powdery mildew. However, when the pea plants were treated with cytochalasin, an specific inhibitor of actin polymerization and cytoesqueleton formation, or <b>cicloheximide,</b> a protein synthesis inhibitor, the inaccessibility were greatly repressed. Microscopic and proteomics approaches are being carried out to understand how this events influence the inaccessibility in pea. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Vanadium is a rare, soft, ductile grey-white element found {{combined}} in certain minerals and used mainly to produce certain alloys or as major trace element of fossil fuels. Vanadium oxide (V 2 O 5) {{is used as}} a catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid and maleic anhydride and in making ceramics, being a pollutant watering redistributed around the environment. Research on biological influence of vanadium has gained major importance because {{it is well known that}} exerts potent toxic, mutagenic, and genotoxic effects on a wide variety of biological systems, including vanadium pentoxide, which has been classified as carcinogenic agent for humans. Consequently the aim of this work was to use a wine wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae UE-ME 3 greatly resistant to metal stress, as eukaryotic model to evaluate its response to V 2 O 5 in range concentration from 0 to 2 mM. Cells were grown to mid-exponential phase at 28 ºC, in 250 -ml flasks containing 100 ml of YEPD medium with 2 % (w/v) of glucose. At mid-exponential phase were inoculated in the same condition in the absence or presence of V 2 O 5, during 200 min. The cultures were used for biomass determination, by wet weight, and to obtain the post-peroxissomal pellet which was used for determination of CAT A according Beers and Sizer (1952) and mitochondrial NADH cit c reductase according to Tzagoloff, et al. (1975). The resulting supernatant was used for determination of MDA production by a fluorescence method according to Ghkawa, et al. (1979). Enzymatic activities and MDA level were compared by one-way ANOVA, followed by a Dunnett's test to identify significant differences (p< 0. 01). The effect on protein synthesis inhibition was also evaluated determining the dose-response curves in same liquid medium containing V 2 O 5 at 0 - 2 mM and cycloheximide 50 mg/mL for 30 min. At the same time and conditions was performed a control assay without cycloheximide. Our results shows that V 2 O 5, for 2. 0 mM in culture media, induced in S. cerevisiae, a significant increase of lipid peroxidation and Catalase A activity and a decrease of wet weight and mitochondrial NADH cit c reductase. Also our results show that <b>cicloheximide</b> prevent cell death when cells grows 30 min in presence of 1. 5 mM V 2 O 5...|$|E
40|$|Recently, a novel {{phosphine}} copper(I) complex [Cu(thp) 4][PF 6] (CP), {{was identified}} as an efficient, in vitro antitumoral agents. It has also been demonstrated that it induces in colon cancer cells a programmed nonapototic cell death called paraptosis or type III cell death. In this study we evaluated CP antiproliferative activity on a panel of leukemia cell lines and it significantly inhibited cancer cells growth at micro and submicromolar concentration, especially against SEM and RS 4; 11 cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that CP did not affected cell cycle in RS 4; 11 and SEM cell line but we observed a concentration-dependent increase of the cell population with a hypodiploid DNA content peak (subG 1), suggesting that CP may induce apoptosis. To better characterize the mode of cell death induced by CP, a biparametric cytofluorimetric analysis was performed using propidium iodide (PI), which stains DNA and is permeable only to dead cells, and fluorescent immunolabeling of the protein annexin-V, which binds to PS in a highly selective manner. We found a concentration-dependent increase in annexin-V positive cells in well agreement {{with the appearance of}} hypodipolid peak. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the activation of the apical caspase- 9 and the two effector caspase- 3 and 7 occur after treatment with CP, while caspase- 8 was not affected by the treatment. Interestingly we did not observed mitochondrial depolarization or cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, suggesting that mitochondria was not involved in the process of cell death. Previous observations indicated that CP may induces functional suppression of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway thus triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress in solid tumor cells. We also evaluated if CP exerts ER stress in leukemia cell lines. Western blot analysis showed a remarkable increase of GRP 78 in RS 4; 11 and SEM, a well known marker of ER stress. Moreover the protein synthesis inhibitor <b>cicloheximide</b> significantly protected the cells from CP-induced cell death suggesting that protein synthesis machinery is involved in the mechanism of action. To evaluate if CP directly inhibits the proteasome, semipurified proteasome from cell extracts were incubated with increasing concentrations of CP and the chymotrypsin-like activity was measured. The results showed a decreased activity in a concentration-dependent way, with an IC 50 of approximately 12 μM. It is well known that copper represent an excellent catalyst of redox cycle and therefore it can stimulate ROS production. Interestingly the CP-induced cell death was significantly reduced in presence of ROS scavenger such as tocopherol, nacetyl cysteine (NAC) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) suggesting that also ROS may contribute to the process of cell death. Further experiments are in progress to elucidate the mechanism of action of this copper complex and the results will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: African {{histoplasmosis}} {{caused by}} the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii, is a rare endemic mycosis occuring in western and central regions of sub-Saharian Africa. For unknown reasons, although HIV infection and H. capsulatum var. duboisii coexist in Africa, this coinfection remains rare. In Europe, diagnosed cases of African histoplasmosis are all imported. We describe a case of African histoplasmosis on a Portuguese war veteran co-infected with HIV- 2 who fought in Guiné-Bissau in 1963 - 65 and Angola in 1972. Methods: We report {{a case of a}} 76 -year-old man, diagnosed with HIV- 2 infection in the previous year (under combined antiretroviral therapy) presenting an ulcerated skin lesion on the right tight (image 1), just above the knee. He was diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis the year before and was finishing one year treatment. The solitary skin lesion begun as a small non-pruriginous eritematous papule, evolving in 6 month to a painless 3 - 4 cm ulcer with raised borders surrounded by a hiperpigmented halo. There were no adenopathies or bone lesions. Respiratory samples and blood cultures were systematically negative for Histoplasma capsulatum. He was treated with IV liposomal Amphotericin-B for one month, followed by oral itraconazol (now on the first month), with a favourable clinical outcome. Results: Histopathology of skin biopsy revealed a superficial ulceration with underlying granulomatous infiltrate with many giant cells, where numerous round mononucleated yeasts measuring 7 - 8 µm were evident and highlighted with PAS and Grocott stain (image 2, left side). Skin biopsy was observed on a wet mount with KOH and revealed numerous round yeasts that were also seen on Gram stain, measuring 7 - 8 µm. Culture of skin biopsy on two Sabouraud dextrose agar (with and without <b>cicloheximide)</b> showed growth of a filamentous fungus compatible with Histoplasma capsulatum (image 2, right side), with large thick-walled spherical macroconidia with finger-like projections (tuberculate conidia) that arise from short conidiophores, and small oval microconidia arising on short stalks from undifferentiated hyphae. Reversion to the yeast fase has not been succeed yet. Identification was further confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA fragments using the universal fungal primers ITS 1 and ITS 4. The sequences obtained were compared with sequences deposited in the GenBank and the result was: Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii (99 % homology). Conclusion: With banalization of business or leisure trips, endemic mycosis are becoming frequently diagnosed in countries outside their natural geographic endemic areas and only a high index of suspicion makes the diagnosis possible. Apart from trips, nowadays in Portugal 4 % of the resident population is immigrant, mostly from Brasil (25. 5 %) but also from Angola and Guiné-Bissau (9. 2 %), being the former an endemic country of American histoplasmosis and the later of both American and African histoplasmosis. We consider histoplasmosis a probable underdiagnosed disease that should be suspected mainly in immunodeficient HIV positive individuals with a past history of travel or residence in an endemic area...|$|E
40|$|Malassezia pachydermatis (Pityrosporum canis) faz parte da {{microbiota}} da pele e quando ocorrem alterações no microambiente local como aumento da umidade, da temperatura e do substrato, determinando uma elevação do número de células, ocorre a transição da forma comensal para o parasitismo. O objetivo deste trabalho foi determinar a prevalência da infeçâo por M. pachydermatis e outros agentes infecciosos nas otites externas e dermatites de cães. Foram analisadas 78 amostras de cães com otite, 36 amostras de cães com o conduto auditivo normal e 24 com dermatite. Todas as amostras foram submetidas ao exame direto. cultivo em ágar sangue e em ágar Sabouraud dextrose, acrescido de cloranfenicol e cicloheximida. Ao exame direto, 50 % das amostras de otite e 16, 6 % das amostras de dermatite apresentaram numerosas células semelhante a M. pachydermatis, enquanto 83, 3 % das amostras de ouvidos saudáveis apresentaram ausência de células com esta morfologia. M. pachydermatis foi isolada em 25 % das amostras do conduto auditivo normal, em 80, 7 % das amostras de otite e em 37, 5 % das amostras de dermatite. Foram também isolados das amostras de otite Staphylococcus intermédias, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp, Actinomyces sp, Streptococcus sp e Otodectes cynotis e das de dermatite Staphylococcus intermédias, S. áureas, S. epidermidis Microsporum canis, M. gypseum,. Trychophyton sp e Demodex canis. M. pachydermatis foi o agente com maior prevalência nas otites externas e dermatites, sendo um agente oportunista que causa otite e dermatite quando há uma alteração do microambiente. The Malassezia pachydermatis (Pityrosporum canis) {{is found}} in the whole skin microflora. It seems to occur as a consequence of changes in the local microenvironment, such as moist increase, temperature or substrate enhancement, generating a raising on cell quantity, which brings the transition from commensal form to parasitism. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the prevalence of M. pachydermatis infection and other infectious agents in external otitis and dog dermatitis as well. We also examined 78 samples of dogs suffering from otitis, 36 samples of dogs having normal auditive tube and 24 having dermatitis. All samples were submitted to direct microscopic examination. They were cultured in blood agar, also in Sabouraud agar dextrose with cloranfenicol and <b>cicloheximide.</b> By direct examination showed that 50 % of the samples on dogs with otitis and dermatitis 16. 6 % showed several cels resembling M. pachydermatis. However from healthy ear sample 83. 3 % did not present cells with this form. M. pachydermatis was isolated on 80. 7 % of otitis samples, on 25 % of normal auditive tube samples and finally, 37. 5 % of dog dermatitis samples. It was isolated Staphylococcus intermedius, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp, Streptococcus sp and Otodectes cynotis from samples of animals with otitis. Cases of dermatites allowed also the isolation of Staphylococcus intermedius, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Microsporum canis, M. gypseum, Trychophyton mentagophytes and Demodex canis. M. pachydermatis was the most prevalent agent in cases of external otitis and dermatitis, being an opportunistic agent, that cause otitis and dermatitis when thereis a change in the microenvironmen...|$|E
