25|$|Hemiarthroplasty is a {{surgical}} procedure which replaces {{one half of}} the joint with an artificial surface and leaves the other part in its natural (pre-operative) state. This class of procedure is most commonly performed on the hip after a subcapital (just below the head) fracture of the neck of the femur (a hip fracture). The procedure is performed by removing the head of the femur and replacing it with a metal or <b>composite</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The most commonly used prosthesis designs are the Austin Moore prosthesis and the Thompson Prosthesis. More recently a composite of metal and HDPE which forms two interphases (bipolar prosthesis) has also been used. The monopolar prosthesis has not been shown to have any advantage over bipolar designs. The procedure is recommended only for elderly and frail patients, due to their lower life expectancy and activity level. This is because {{with the passage of time}} the prosthesis tends to loosen or to erode the acetabulum.|$|E

This study evaluates the resistance of biomaterial for abdominal wall prostheses against the development of postoperative infection in a rat model. Material and methods: In 75 rats, we intramuscularly implanted three different types of prostheses: (1) low-density polypropylene monofilament mesh (PMM), (2) high-density PMM, and (3) a <b>composite</b> <b>prosthesis</b> composed of low-density PMM and a nonporous hydrophilic film. Meshes were inoculated with a suspension containing 108 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Mycobacterium fortuitum, or Mycobacterium abscessus before wound closure. Animals were sacrificed on the eighth day postoperatively for clinical evaluation, and the implants were removed for bacteriologic analyses. Results: Prostheses infected with S aureus showed a higher bacterial viability, worse integration, and clinical outcome compared with infection by other bacteria. Composite prostheses showed a higher number of viable colonies of both M fortuitum and Staphylococcus spp., with poorer integration in host tissue. However, when the <b>composite</b> <b>prosthesis</b> was infected with M abscessus, a lower number of viable bacteria were isolated and a better integration was observed compared with infection by other bacteria. Conclusions: Considering M abscessus, a smaller collagen-free contact surface shows better resistance to infection, however, {{depending on the type of}} bacteria, prostheses with a large surface, and covered with collagen shows reduced resistance to infection, worse integration, and worse clinical outcome.

40|$|AbstractHernia repair {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} performed surgical procedures worldwide, with a multi-billion dollar global market. Implant design remains a critical challenge for the successful repair and prevention of recurrent hernias, and despite significant progress, there is no ideal mesh for every surgery. This review summarizes the evolution of prostheses design toward successful hernia repair beginning with a description of the anatomy of the disease and the classifications of hernias. Next, the major milestones in implant design are discussed. Commonly encountered complications and strategies to minimize these adverse effects are described, followed by a thorough description of the implant characteristics necessary for successful repair. Finally, available implants are categorized and their advantages and limitations are elucidated, including non-absorbable and absorbable (synthetic and biologically derived) <b>prostheses,</b> <b>composite</b> <b>prostheses,</b> and coated prostheses.

The idea of 3 D printed prosthetics components promises affordable, customizable devices, but these systems currently have major shortcomings in durability and function. In this paper, we propose a fabrication method for custom <b>composite</b> <b>prostheses</b> utilizing additive manufacturing, allowing for customizability, as well the durability of professional prosthetics. The manufacturing process is completed using 3 D printed molds in a multi-stage molding system, which creates a custom finger or palm with a lightweight epoxy foam core, a durable composite outer shell, and soft urethane gripping surfaces. The composite material was compared to 3 D printed and aluminum materials using a three-point bending test to compare stiffness, as well as gravimetric measurements to compare weight. The composite finger demonstrates the largest stiffness with the lowest weight compared to other tested fingers, as well as having customizability and lower cost, proving to potentially be a substantial benefit {{to the development of}} upper-limb prostheses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} done (1) to {{determine}} whether congenital indirect inguinal hernias in male pigs could be repaired by placing a polypropylene mesh prosthesis over the defect intra-abdominally, (2) to measure the incidence of adhesions between intra-abdominal viscera and the prosthesis with and without the adhesion barrier oxidized regenerated cellulose, (3) to determine the incidence of other complications, and (4) to assess the effect on fertility. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Several techniques for laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy are currently being evaluated {{to determine whether}} there are advantages over conventional inguinal herniorrhaphy. Perhaps the most controversial is the intraperitoneal onlay mesh procedure (IPOM). Its advantage is its simplicity (in that the repair is accomplished by placing a prosthesis over the hernia defect intra-abdominally, avoiding a groin dissection). Its disadvantage is the potential for complications because the prosthesis is in contact with the intra-abdominal viscera. METHODS: In male pigs, polypropylene mesh alone or polypropylene mesh plus the adhesion barrier oxidized regenerated cellulose (<b>composite</b> <b>prosthesis)</b> was fixed to the peritoneum surrounding the hernia defect. In phase 1 (6 -week follow-up), two groups of 13 pigs each underwent herniorrhaphy at laparotomy or laparoscopy. In phase 2 (7. 1 -month follow-up), 21 pigs underwent laparoscopic herniorrhaphy. RESULTS: All IPOM herniorrhaphies were successful. The prostheses adhered most frequently to the bladder, followed by small bowel, peritoneum, and cord structures. Prosthetic erosion into these organs was not observed. Laparoscopically placed prostheses in phases 1 and 2 had significantly less surface covered by adhesions (13 % +/- 13 % and 19 % +/- 27 %, respectively) and a lower adhesion tenacity grade (1. 5 +/- 0. 9 and 1. 3 +/- 1. 1, respectively) than those placed at laparotomy (44 % +/- 27 % and 2. 5 +/- 0. 7, respectively; p < 0. 01). In phase 1, a histologic evaluation of laparoscopically placed specimens demonstrated significantly thinner above-mesh fibrotic tissue compared with the prostheses implanted at laparotomy (p < 0. 04). In either phase, the use of the adhesion barrier did not produce any histologic difference between the polypropylene alone and the <b>composite</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Fertility studies were performed in phase 2 and showed no adverse effects caused by either prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the intraperitoneal placement of a polypropylene prosthesis was an effective technique for indirect inguinal herniorrhaphy in a pig. Furthermore, with laparotomy, the addition of oxidized regenerated cellulose significantly decreased the rate of adhesion formation to the prosthesis. However, oxidized regenerated cellulose would appear to have no value when used with a prosthesis placed laparoscopically...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To improve {{function}} after pelvic resection {{involving the}} acetabulum, using an anatomic composite implant built with screws and cement. Materialand method: Since 1990, 66 patients with peri-acetabular bone malignancies {{have been treated}} by extensive resection followed by hand-modelled innominate prosthesis with partially constrained total hip prosthesis. The handmodelled innominate prosthesis was made of a titanium cup, a set of long titanium screws {{and two or three}} packs of gentamycine-loaded cement. Results: Many postoperative complications were observed: deep infection (14 %), hip prosthesis dislocation (25 %) and local recurrence (15 %). Sixteen patients (25 %) had to be reoperated. Nevertheless, at last follow-up, 62 patients still had <b>composite</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The mean functional result, rated according to a modified Ennekingâ€™s staging system, was 80 % with unlimited walking without support, average hip flexion 100, length discrepancy less than 1 cm. Discussion: These results were similar to those described in the literature for custom-made innominate prostheses and much better than those of alternative reconstructive procedures. Hand-modelled composite prostheses are cheaper, easier, more adaptable and enables better anchorage than custom-made prostheses. Such a procedure can be used even after total iliac wing resection. Conclusion: The advantages of such a procedure plead for its extensive use after acetabular resection. But long-term followup is necessary to validate indications.

Methods: Between August 1992 and March 1997, 143 patients underwent aortic root replacement with the Carbo-Seal <b>composite</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The indication for surgery was acute type A dissection in 31 (22 %), chronic type A dissection in 9 (6 %), ascending aortic aneurysm without dissection in 100 (70 %), and false aneurysm of the ascending aorta in 3 (2 %). Twenty-seven patients (19 %) had undergone previous sternotomy, and 40 (28 %) were seen as emergencies. Concomitant procedures were performed in 38 (27 %), including 18 aortic arch or hemiarch replacements. Total follow-up is 270 patient-years. Follow-up is 100 % complete. Results: The early (30 -day) mortality was 7 % (10 patients). Permanent neurologic events occurred in 2 %. At a mean follow-up of 23 months, 94 % of survivors were in New York Heart Association functional class I. Freedom from reoperation was 97. 2 % Â± 1. 6 % (1 standard error [1 SE]) at 12 months and 95. 7 % Â± 2. 2 % at 48 months. Including early mortality, survival was 90. 1 % Â± 2. 6 % at 12 months and 83. 1 % Â± 3. 5 % at 48 months. Conclusions: Aortic root replacement with use of the Carbo-Seal prosthesis can be undertaken with a relatively low early mortality and morbidity. A low reoperation rate and high intermediate-term survival can be expected, but continued follow-up {{is needed to determine}} the long-term efficacy of this prosthesis.

Patients and methods: A single-arm, multicenter prospective study of 126 patients undergoing open ventral hernia repair with the PCO-VP was performed. Patient outcomes were assessed at discharge and at 10 Â days, 1, 6, 12, and 24 Â months postoperative. Results: All patients had hernioplasty for umbilical (n = 110, 87. 3 %) or epigastric hernia (n = 16, 12. 7 %). Mean hernia diameter was 1. 8 Â± 0. 8 Â cm. Mean operative time was 36. 2 Â± 15. 6 Â minutes, with a mean mesh positioning time of 8. 1 Â± 3. 4 Â minutes. Surgeons reported satisfaction with mesh ease of use in 95 % of surgeries. The cumulative hernia recurrence rate at 1 Â year was 2. 8 % (3 / 106). Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores showed improvement from 2. 1 Â± 2. 0 at preoperative baseline to 0. 5 Â± 0. 7 at 1 Â month postoperative (P < 0. 001), and this low pain level was maintained at 12 Â months postsurgery (P < 0. 001).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the outcome of these procedures at Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this study, 113 cases have been presented. Eleven cases were excluded (patients has a traumatic defect or they passed away before the completion of the studyâ€™s two-year follow up period). Each patient completed a questionnaire, went through a physical examination and, if indicated, X-ray information was collected. The patients were divided into three groups: chemotherapy, chemotherapy plus radiation therapy, and no-adjuvant-therapy. Results: Fifty-four cases were male and the mean age was 24. 5 Â± 5. 39. The number of cases and indications for surgery were: 33 cases of aggressive benign tumors or low grade malignant bone tumors (large bone defects) including 16 germ cell tumors, eight aneurysmal bone cysts, five low grade osteosarcomas, and four chondrosarcomas. Another 69 cases were high-grade malignant bone tumors including 42 osteosarcomas, 21 Ewingâ€™s sarcoma, and six other high grade osteosarcomas. Patients were divided into three groups: the first group received no adjuvant therapy, the second group received chemotherapy, and the third group received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. The location of tumors were as follows: eight cases in the pelvic bone, 12 in the proximal femur, 18 in the femoral shaft, 36 in the distal femur, 12 in the proximal tibia, and 16 in the humeral bone. The 12 cases of proximal femoral defects were reconstructed by allograft <b>composite</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> 18 diaphyseal defects with intercalary allograft, and 36 distal femoral defects were reconstructed using osteoarticular allograft. The rate of deep infection was 7 : 8 % (eight patients) and in this regard, we found a significant difference among the three groups, such that most cases of infection occurred in the adjuvant chemotherapy plus radiation therapy group. Allograft fracture occurred in six patients and prevalence was the same in all groups. Only in six cases of radio-chemotherapy nonunion occurred, so we used autogenous bone graft for union. Local recurrence was observed in six patients: three belonged to the adjuvant chemotherapy group and the other three were in the chemo-radiotherapy group; no significant difference was observed between these two groups. However, there was a significant difference between these two and the group that received no adjuvant therapy. Also, there were 11 cases of metastases and Restriction of knee joint motion occurred in 48 cases of osteo-cartilaginous grafts of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Conclusion: Although structural allograft is an appropriate choice in limb reconstruction after massive resection of involved tissues in malignant and invasive bone tumors, the risk of complications such as nonunion and infection in massive allograft increases in cases of adjuvant (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) modalities of treatment. Whereas the rate of tumor recurrence, metastasis, and restrictions in range of motion during a short term follow up after implantation showed no significant difference among the evaluated groups. Consequently, further attention and constant periodic visits of the patients and checking for local recurrence and distant metastasis should be done after surgery...|$|E

The possible options include a <b>composite</b> allograft/stem <b>prosthesis,</b> a modular type megaprosthesis or a custom-made megaprosthesis. Modularity allows versatility at reconstruction and avoids the delay required manufacturing a custom-made implant. Hypothesis {{and type of}} study: A retrospective radiological and clinical study investigated whether a special reconstruction modular stem design (JVC IXâ„¢) would provide medium term success {{in the treatment of}} severe proximal femur bone loss. Material and methodsBetween 1995 and 2005, 23 Â JVC IXâ„¢ hip replacements were performed for severe segmental proximal femur bone loss. Etiology was: 13 cases of tumor resection, eight {{of extensive}} osteolysis secondary to femoral implant loosening, and two traumatic situations. Follow-up was annual. Functional assessment used the Musculo-Skeletal Tumor Score (MSTS), and implant survival rates underwent Kaplan-Meier analysis, with surgical revision (to replace or remove the implant) as the end point. ResultsAll 23 Â patients (23 Â hips) were followed up for a mean 5. 4 Â years (Â± 3. 7 Â yrs). Mean MSTS was 16. 2 (max. = 30). All stems demonstrated good fixation at radiological assessment, except for one case of probable loosening in contact with a metastatic osteolysis. Four implants had to be revised: two for non-controlled infection, one for tumor extension, and one for stem fatigue fracture.

The new Megasystem C (Waldemar Link) modular prosthesis have been used in our institution from June 2001. We operated 199 patients, with Our experience of a new prosthesis modular system used from June 2001 is reported. We performed till March 2007 199 prostheses, 177 of which were megaprostheses, 16 <b>composite</b> <b>prostheses</b> (6 proximal femur, 11 proximal tibia) and 6 were total femoral replacement. Surgical superficial infection were observed in 3 patients, and resolved with wound surgical treatment. Deep late infection developed in 15 patients (7. 5 %) and required several accessory surgical interventions. Staphylococcus was involved alone or in association to polymicrobial infection in 73 % of the cases. Meticillin resistant bacteria were present alone or associated in more than 60 % of the patients. Infection was managed with debridment alone in 3 patients; the other 12 patients were operated and the prosthesis removed with insertion of a antibiotic loaded cement spacer (Vancocin 1 gr every cement dose). In two patients due to poor skin closure an arthrodesis nail (Waldemar Link) was implanted. Another patients was not reimplanted due to poor medical condition. Seven patients ha been operated with implantation of a new prosthesis. The last 3 patients are still under antibiotic treatment and the haematological values do not permit reimplantation. Even if the infection rate in our experience is not higher than other reports {{in the same kind of}} patient, the very high rate of meticillin resistant bacteria should recall attention for the emerging risk of serious complications and should lead to better use of antibiotic prophylaxi...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{evaluation}} of prosthetic device performance is often difficult, if not impossible. In particular, {{in order to}} deal with potential problems such as thrombosis, haemolysis, etc., which could arise when a patient undergoes heart valve replacement, a thorough understanding of the blood flow dynamics inside the devices interacting with natural or composite tissues is required. Numerical simulation, combining both computational fluid and structure dynamics, could provide detailed information on such complex problems. In this work, a numerical investigation of the mechanics of two <b>composite</b> aortic <b>prostheses</b> during a cardiac cycle is presented. The numerical tool presented is able to reproduce accurately the flow and structure dynamics of the prostheses. The analysis shows that the vortical structures forming inside the two different grafts do not influence the kinematics of a bileaflet valve or the main coronary flow, whereas major differences are present for the stress status near the suture line of the coronaries to the prostheses. The results are in agreement with in vitro and in vivo observations found in literature...|$|R
40|$|Many {{treatment}} options are currently available for single tooth replacement, such as metal-ceramic, all-ceramic, {{direct or indirect}} fiber-reinforced <b>composite</b> fixed dental <b>prostheses</b> (FDPs) or implants. Inlay-retained FDPs could be indicated especially when adjacent teeth have preexisting restorations and where implant placement is not possible or not indicated. In such cases, indication of both metal-ceramic and fiber-reinforced composite FDPs has certain disadvantages. This paper describes the use of all-ceramic inlay-retained FDPs with zirconia frameworks, veneered with a press-on technique. The retainer margins were made of pressed ceramic to make adhesive luting possible. In deep cavities, a full contour press-on ceramic all around the retainers increased the available surface area for the adhesive approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of total hip replacements in the younger clique has added to the demand for revision procedures. Revision situations are often encountered with infection, loss of bone stock and bone defects. There are various methods of reconstruction of acetabular defects. The management options of type 3 B Paprosky acetabular defects are limited with allograft and conventional cages. Trabecular metal technology has evolved to address these bone defects. Trabecular metal acetabular revision system (TMARS) cup-cage construct is a new technique to address massive acetabular defects. We describe a case of failed hip reconstruction done for a Giant cell tumour of proximal femur managed by a two stage procedure, initial debridement and second stage reconstruction of acetabulum with TMARS cup-cage construct and femur with allograft <b>prosthesis</b> <b>composite...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new <b>composite</b> silicone-metallic <b>prosthesis</b> was tested, {{studying}} {{the potential for}} respiratory epithelial covering over the biocompatible inner lining, in a rabbit survival model. Seven New Zealand White rabbits underwent near-total excision of their trachea and implantation of a sterile prosthesis. After 2 months, they were sacrificed and the prostheses were retrieved. Specimens were fixed and histologically examined for tissue reaction around the prosthesis, at the anastomotic lines, and particularly for {{the presence or absence}} of epithelialization of the inner lumen over the biocompatible surface. All rabbits survived the operation. At 2 months, the outer layer of the prosthesis was consistently covered with fibrosis and neutrophils. The inner layer showed necrotic cells and scant re-epithelialization over the biocompatible lining, up to 5 mm beyond the anastomosis, with no evidence of organized respiratory epithelium in the middle sections. The new prosthesis is a viable temporary solution for airway replacement in rabbits. Granulation tissue was not observed at the anastomosis, and re-epithelialization did occur, but failed to achieve full-length luminal covering. The potential for granulation tissue does not yet make this an ideal long-term solution. Improvements in prosthesis design or biocompatibility are required, and need to be re-evaluated before applicability for chronic us...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and radiographic outcomes and the survival rates of fiber-reinforced <b>composite</b> resin-bonded fixed <b>prostheses</b> (FRCRBFDPs) {{placed in the}} posterior area supported by two short (6 Â mm) implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients received 40 SLActive 6 -mm-long implants with a diameter of 4. 1 Â mm (nÂ =Â  29) or 4. 8 Â mm (nÂ =Â  11). Insertion torques and RFA (Resonance Frequency Analysis) were measured at implant installation. The prosthetic rehabilitation was performed after 8 Â weeks from insertion with a screw-retained two- or three-unit fixed dental prosthesis fabricated of FRCRBFDPs. Implant survival rates and marginal bone levels were evaluated at various time intervals until 5 Â years after loading. RESULTS: Two of 20 patients lost four implants supporting two FRCRBFDPs between the second and {{the third year of}} follow-up (cumulative survival rate: 90...|$|R
40|$|A fiber-reinforced <b>composite</b> (FRC) fixed <b>prosthesis</b> is an {{innovative}} {{alternative to a}} traditional metal restoration, {{as it is a}} conservative treatment method. This case report demonstrates a detailed procedure for restoring a missing anterior tooth with an FRC. A 44 -year-old woman visited our department with an avulsed tooth that had fallen out on the previous day and was completely dry. This tooth was replanted, but it failed after one year. A semi-direct technique was used to fabricate a FRC fixed partial prosthesis for its replacement. The FRC framework and the pontic were fabricated using a duplicated cast model and nanofilled composite resin. Later on, interproximal contact, tooth shape, and shade were adjusted at chairside. This technique not only enables the clinician to replace a missing tooth immediately after extraction for minimizing esthetic problems, but it also decreases both tooth reduction and cost...|$|R
40|$|Fiber-reinforced <b>composite</b> resin (FRC) <b>prostheses</b> {{offer the}} {{advantages}} of good aesthetics, minimal invasive treatment, {{and an ability to}} bond to the abutment teeth, thereby compensating for less-than-optimal abutment tooth retention and resistance form. These prostheses are composed of two types of composite materials: fiber composites to build the framework and hybrid or microfill particulate composites to create the external veneer surface. This review concentrates on the use of fiber reinforcement in the fabrication of laboratory or chairsidemade composite-fixed partial dentures of conventional preparation. Other applications of FRC in dentistry are briefly mentioned. The possibilities fiber reinforcement technology offers must be emphasized to the dental community. Rather than limiting discussion to whether FRC prostheses will replace metal-ceramic or full-ceramic prostheses, attention should be focused on the additional treatment options brought by the use of fibers. However, more clinical experience is needed...|$|R
40|$|From 1986 to 1994, 112 bone {{allograft}} reconstructions {{were performed}} {{in patients with}} high-grade osteosarcoma in whom neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The allograft reconstruction was used in arthrodesis in 44 cases (41 knees, three ankles), as an intercalary graft in 39 (28 femurs, 11 tibias), as an osteoarticular graft in 22 (three proximal and/or distal humeri, six distal femurs, 13 proximal tibias), and as an allograft and <b>prosthesis</b> <b>composite</b> in seven (two proximal humeri, one proximal femurs, four proximal tibias). In 20 patients an autologous vascularized fibula was used to augment the allograft. Functional results were excellent or good in 74 % of the patients after the primary surgery, and in 83 % of the patients after secondary surgery. Complications include delayed union (49 %) and fracture (27 %), although there were no cases of deep infection. The incidence of delayed union, but not infection or fracture, was increased {{by the use of}} chemotherapy...|$|R
5000|$|A new Deathlok debuted {{during the}} Original Sin storyline. Henry Hayes worked at Doctors Without Borders. During his duty, {{he lost a}} leg in a suicide bomber attack in Kandahar (or was brainwashed into {{thinking}} he did), Henry was {{taken care of by}} the company Biotek who provided him with a <b>composite</b> fiber <b>prosthesis.</b> Upon being placed under mind-control, Henry Hayes became Deathlok where he was used as an assassin, a soldier, a killer, a fighter, and an operative. He had participated in at least one armed conflict alongside organized troops, and assassinated countless people even in populated areas. He was even once close to being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. when a mission went bad in Russia. Henry Hayes was often memory-wiped and did not remember his assignments. While at MTA Metro-North station, he tried to engage discussion with another leg amputee and advised him to contact Biotek, as his own prosthesis (plastic ones as it was the only his pension afforded him) forced the man to use crutches. This man left, seemingly displeased with the discussion. Immediately afterward, he met Seth Horne, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent off duty who was present when the Eye of the Watcher exploded, releasing a blast of energy which revealed deep secrets to anyone in its radius. To Horne was revealed Hayes' true story. This level four agent wanted to congratulate him, stating that S.H.I.E.L.D. would wish to have him in their ranks. As Henry Hayes really did not know what Horne was talking about, he threatened to call the authorities forcing the agent to leave after a last congratulation. Immediately, Henry Hayes was ordered to kill him as the announcement board of the station indicated the words [...] "Whiskey David" [...] triggering Henry Hayes' Deathlok persona. After following Seth Horne into the restroom Deathlok quickly executed him, left, took some medications, and returned to his civilian life heading to the train to join his daughter Aria.|$|R
