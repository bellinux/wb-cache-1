5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more <b>cost-effectively</b> and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{originally}} planned to create {{many of the}} aliens with computer graphics, but those {{that would be more}} <b>cost-effectively</b> realized with masks and animatronics were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimodians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} from which S.thiersii derives its carbon is the {{cellulose}} of the decomposing plant material found in its grassland habitat. The enzymes that degrade cellulose are homologous to the enzymes used by ectomycorrhizal fungi that have symbiotic associations with plant roots. In {{an attempt to}} identify the genes involved in these processes, researchers at the United States Department of Energy and University of Wisconsin are jointly working to sequence the S. thiersii genome and to compare it with that of Amanita bisporigera, a species which forms mycorrhizal relationships with tree and which has already been partly sequenced. They hope {{to better understand the}} genetic pathways involved in the evolution of ectomycorrhizal associations. Another research objective is to establish whether the enzymes used by S. thiersii to degrade cellulose can be <b>cost-effectively</b> used in the conversion of crop residues into biofuels. S.thiersii seems to be expanding its range northwards and its genome may provide clues as to how it is adapting to climate change and further information on mycorrhizal relationships.|$|E

25|$|The aquifer of the Rio Puerco is too saline to be <b>cost-effectively</b> {{used for}} {{drinking}} purposes. Much of the rainwater that Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through {{a network of}} paved channels and arroyos, and emptied into the Rio Grande.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{priorities of}} energy policy {{are likely to}} be most <b>cost-effectively</b> served by promoting energy efficiency and expanding the role of renewables. However, the options of new investment in nuclear power and in clean coal (through carbon sequestration) need to be kept open, and practical measures taken to do this.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, San Jose International Airport (KSJC/SJC) {{was one of}} the first U.S {{airports}} to participate in the noise regulation program enacted by the U.S. Congress for delineation of airport noise contours and developing a pilot study of residential sound insulation. This program showed that residences near the airport could be retrofitted <b>cost-effectively</b> to reduce indoor aircraft noise substantially.|$|E
25|$|Most United Nations {{member states}} and nongovernmental {{agencies}} still consider UNBRO {{to have been}} a model UN operation that efficiently and <b>cost-effectively</b> provided essential support to more than 350,000 Cambodian civilians and {{played a major role in}} saving the lives of thousands living under the harsh control of the Khmer Rouge or who were subject to shelling by Vietnamese forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} from ethanol production is {{primarily in the}} fermentation of the feedstock and minor changes in distillation. The feedstocks {{are the same as}} for ethanol: energy crops such as sugar beets, sugar cane, corn grain, wheat and cassava, prospective non-food energy crops such as switchgrass and even guayule in North America, as well as agricultural byproducts such as bagasse, straw and corn stalks. According to DuPont, existing bioethanol plants can <b>cost-effectively</b> be retrofitted to biobutanol production.|$|E
25|$|At first some within NASA welcomed {{sharing of}} the cost with the USAF, but it was later agreed that NASA was better off {{operating}} Gemini by itself. Blue Gemini was canceled in 1963 by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who decided that the NASA Gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments. MOL was canceled by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird in 1969, when {{it was determined that}} unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more <b>cost-effectively.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hybrid Scorecard {{was created}} by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) to give {{consumers}} a comprehensive comparison of hybrid electric vehicles available in the U.S. market. The UCS Hybrid Scorecard ratings take into considerations fuel economy as rated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the environmental benefits as compared to its similar or closest conventional internal combustion engine counterpart; how <b>cost-effectively</b> a particular hybrid achieves its environmental performance; and premium features that are bundled on a hybrid as standard equipment raising its purchase price.|$|E
25|$|Husk Power Systems (HPS) is a Bihar-based {{start-up}} {{that provides}} power {{to thousands of}} rural Indians. HPS has created proprietary technology that <b>cost-effectively</b> converts rice husks into electricity. The organization uses this technology to produce, own, and operate 35-100kW “mini power-plants” that deliver electricity as a pay-for-use service to villages of 2000-4000 inhabitants in the Indian “Rice Belt. In 2009, the company won an inaugural global business plan competition sponsored by venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Cisco Systems. The company will receive a $250,000 investment from DFJ and Cisco to help take the technology to the next level.|$|E
25|$|A 1998 {{study was}} {{performed}} using three comparable Louisiana medium security prisons, {{two of which}} were privately run by different corporations and {{one of which was}} publicly run. The data from this study suggested that the privately run prisons operated more <b>cost-effectively</b> without sacrificing the safety of inmates and staff. The study concluded that both privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate, a lower rate of critical incidents, a safer environment for employees and inmates, and a higher proportional rate of inmates who completed basic education, literacy, and vocational training courses. However, the publicly run prison outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as experiencing fewer escape attempts, controlling substance abuse through testing, offering a wider range of educational and vocational courses, and providing a broader range of treatment, recreation, social services, and rehabilitative services.|$|E
25|$|Many natural {{products}} have very complex structures. The perceived complexity {{of a natural}} product is a qualitative matter, consisting of consideration of its molecular mass, the particular arrangements of substructures (functional groups, rings etc.) with respect to one another, the number and density of those functional groups, the stability of those groups and of the molecule as a whole, the number and type of stereochemical elements, the physical properties of the molecule and its intermediates (which bear on the ease of its handling and purification), all of these viewed {{in the context of}} the novelty of the structure and whether preceding related synthetic efforts have been successful (see below for details). Some {{natural products}}, especially those less complex, are easily and <b>cost-effectively</b> prepared via complete chemical synthesis from readily available, simpler chemical ingredients, a process referred to as total synthesis (especially when the process involves no steps mediated by biological agents). Not all natural products are amenable to total synthesis, cost-effective or otherwise. In particular, those most complex often are not. Many are accessible, but the required routes are simply too expensive to allow synthesis on any practical or industrial scale. However, in order to be available for further study, all natural products must yield to isolation and purification. This may suffice if isolation provides appropriate quantities of the natural product for the intended purpose (e.g. as a drug to alleviate disease). Drugs such as penicillin, morphine, and paclitaxel proved to be affordably acquired at needed commercial scales solely via isolation procedures (without any significant synthetic chemistry contributing). However, in other cases, needed agents are not available without synthetic chemistry manipulations.|$|E
500|$|As Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Romm was {{in charge}} of all policy and {{technology}} analysis and programmatic development for the Office, which was then developing PEM fuel cells, microturbines, advanced cogeneration, superconductivity, building controls, photovoltaics and other renewables, biofuels, and hydrogen production and storage. [...] Among other projects, he initiated, supervised, and publicized a comprehensive technical analysis in 1997 by five national laboratories of how energy technologies can best reduce greenhouse gas emissions <b>cost-effectively,</b> entitled Scenarios of U.S. Carbon Reductions.|$|E
500|$|The {{engine for}} God of War III {{was from the}} first two installments. Santa Monica senior {{producer}} Steve Caterson said that the development team ported God of War IIs engine to the PlayStation 3 {{and were able to}} quickly play the game. Everything that Kratos could do in previous games, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which allowed the developers to immediately begin designing new content. As the game was being developed, the code department would swap out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components. They replaced the renderer, the particle system, and the collision system. Feldman said that although they were re-using the engine from God of War II, the core engine for God of War III was brand new. Between the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and the time the game shipped, morphological anti-aliasing (MLAA) was added, which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said [...] "improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame-rate." [...] MLAA is [...] "now a popular edge-detection process that can <b>cost-effectively</b> remove jagged edges from each frame", which helped Santa Monica free up the processing cycle and [...] "allowed them to add to the spectacle in other ways." [...] Diamand also said that [...] "depth-of-field, motion blur, crepuscular 'god' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed" [...] during that same time period.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1938, McCall's Magazine did not renew Neysa McMein's {{contract}} to produce illustrations for the magazine. By then, magazines could <b>cost-effectively</b> publish color photographs using four-color machines. McMein entered {{the field of}} portraiture, at first using pastels to depict Dorothy Parker, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and [...] Helen Hayes. She painted portraits of presidents Herbert Hoover and Warren G. Harding, author Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and actors Charlie Chaplin and Beatrice Lillie. McMein also painted Katharine Cornell, Kay Francis, Janet Flanner, Dorothy Thompson, Anatole France, Charles Evans Hughes and Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin. She mentored photographer Lee Miller.|$|E
2500|$|This {{category}} measures how <b>cost-effectively</b> {{a particular}} hybrid achieves its environmental performance, and the scores vary from [...] "Very Poor" [...] to [...] "Superior." [...] Each hybrid model is evaluated {{by dividing the}} estimated cost of hybrid technology used in the vehicle by its reduction in global warming emissions over the conventional model expressed as a percentage. The ratings are assigned to each model based on the resulting incremental cost according to the range values shown in {{the table in the}} right. When a hybrid achieves a better smog certification level than its conventional counterpart, the hybrid technology cost should include the cost of any additional emissions controls used in the hybrid model.|$|E
2500|$|Hague's {{pride and}} joy was the Jersey City Medical Center, which he began {{creating}} {{almost as soon as}} he became mayor. By the 1940s it had grown into a 10-building complex that provided virtually free medical care to Jersey City residents. [...] At the time of its completion, the Medical Center {{was one of the biggest}} medical facilities in the country and included the Medical Center Hospital, Pollak Chest Diseases Hospital, Murdoch Hall, and Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital, named in honor of Hague's mother. The buildings, funded in part through federal funds obtained by Hague, are known for their Art Deco details, including marble walls, terrazzo floors, etched glass, and decorative moldings. Even at the time the Medical Center was too large to operate <b>cost-effectively.</b> In 2005 the 14 acre complex (much of which had fallen into disuse) was sold to a private developer who began converting two towers into a luxury condominium complex called the Beacon.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{research}} programs were {{implemented in the}} U.S. {{to assess the impact}} of medical helicopters on mortality and morbidity in the civilian arena. Project CARESOM was established in Mississippi in 1969. Three helicopters were purchased through a federal grant and located strategically in the north, central, and southern areas of the state. [...] Upon termination of the grant, the program was considered a success and each of the three communities was given the opportunity to continue the helicopter operation. [...] Only the one located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi did so, and it was therefore established as the first civilian air medical program in the United States. The second program, the Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) system, was established in Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio in 1969. This was an experiment by the Department of Transportation to study the feasibility of using military helicopters to augment existing civilian emergency medical services. [...] These programs were highly successful at establishing the need for such services. [...] The remaining challenge was in how such services could be operated most <b>cost-effectively.</b> [...] In many cases, as agencies, branches, and departments of the civilian governments began to operate aircraft for other purposes, these aircraft were frequently pressed into service to provide cost-effective air support to the evolving Emergency Medical Services.|$|E
