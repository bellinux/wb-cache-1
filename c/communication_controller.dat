50|$|The SCC, {{short for}} Serial <b>Communication</b> <b>Controller,</b> {{is a family}} of serial port driver {{integrated}} circuits made by Zilog. The primary {{members of the family}} are the Z8030/Z8530, and the Z85233. Developed from the earlier Zilog SIO devices (Z8443), the SCC added a number of serial-to-parallel modes that allowed internal implementation of a variety of data link layer protocols like Bisync, HDLC and SDLC. The SCC could be set up as a conventional RS-232 port for driving legacy systems, or alternately as a RS-422 port for much higher performance, up to 10 Mbit/s. Implementation details generally limited performance to 5 Mbit/s or less.|$|E

5000|$|CCe: {{based on}} Motorola MPC 604 {{processor}} running at 133 MHz with 512 KB L2-cache. The modules were connected together at 1 Gbit/s with high speed (HS) link technology {{according to the}} IEEE 1355 standard, allowing data transfer at up to 75 MB/s. The <b>communication</b> <b>controller</b> was integrated in the processor nodes through the PCI bus. The system board used the MPC 105 chip to provide memory control, DRAM refresh and memory decoding for banks of DRAM and/or Flash. The CPU bus speed is limited to 66 MHz while the PCI bus speed was 33 MHz at maximum.|$|E
50|$|Data {{communication}} in TTP is organized in TDMA rounds. A TDMA round {{is divided into}} slots. Each node has one sending slot, and must send frames in every round. The frame size allocated to a node can vary from 2 to 240 bytes in length, each frame usually carrying several messages. The cluster cycle is a recurring sequence of TDMA rounds; in different rounds different messages can be transmitted in the frames, but in each cluster cycle the complete set of state messages is repeated. The data is protected by a 24-bit CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). The schedule is stored in the MEDL (Message Descriptor List) within the <b>communication</b> <b>controller.</b>|$|E
50|$|Intel used SDLC {{as a base}} {{protocol}} for BITBUS, still popular in Europe as fieldbus and included support in several controllers (i8044/i8344, i80152). The 8044 controller is still in production by third party vendors. Other vendors putting hardware support for SDLC (and the slightly different HDLC) into <b>communication</b> <b>controller</b> chips of the 1980s included Intel, Zilog, Motorola, and National Semiconductor. As a result, {{a wide variety of}} equipment in the 1980s used it and it was very common in the mainframe centric corporate networks which were the norm in the 1980s. The most common alternatives for SNA with SDLC were probably DECnet with Digital Data Communications Message Protocol (DDCMP), Burroughs Network Architecture (BNA) with Burroughs Data Link Control (BDLC), and ARPANET with IMPs.|$|E

5000|$|The IBM 3745 is {{the latest}} and last of a 37xx family of {{communications}} controllers for the IBM mainframe environment. As of mid-2009 there were an estimated 7,000+ of the larger 3745 models still in active production status, down from 20,000 or more in 2007. The 3745 and associated 3746 models were once heavily used within financial, insurance and retail industries as well as within government agencies globally. However, today most organizations have migrated away {{from the use of}} 3745s. IBM's Enterprise Extender [...] and the <b>Communication</b> <b>Controller</b> for Linux on System z (CCL) [...] have largely displaced the older 3745s. IBM announced in September 2002 that it would no longer manufacture new 3745s, but IBM continues to support the hardware by providing worldwide maintenance service, by providing microcode releases and by supporting the associated software including NCP (Network Control Program) and the virtual telecommunications access method (VTAM). IBM has announced end-of-service dates for Japan, Europe and the Middle East, but has not yet announced end-of-service for the Americas and parts of Asia.|$|E

The results of fault injection show that in first form about 4. 57 % of faults lead to the babbling idiot failures. Also in second form about 0. 75 % faults lead to babbling idiot failures.
