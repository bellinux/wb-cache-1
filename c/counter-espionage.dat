5|$|Brand's {{involvement}} in smuggling Jews into Hungary began in July 1941, when Hansi Brand's sister and brother-in-law were {{caught up in}} the Kamianets-Podilskyi deportations. The Hungarian government sent 18,000 Jews to German-occupied Ukraine because they were unable to prove they were Hungarian citizens; 14,000–16,000 of them were shot by the SS. Brand paid a Hungarian <b>counter-espionage</b> officer to bring his wife's relatives back safely.|$|E
5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK was a {{dangerous}} environment for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated <b>counter-espionage</b> organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of <b>counter-espionage,</b> while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions of the Secret Service Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of <b>counter-espionage</b> in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E
5|$|The Czech revolutionary {{network in}} Europe {{also had a}} role in the {{uncovering}} of Bagha Jatin's plans. The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots. The American network, headed by E. V. Voska, was a <b>counter-espionage</b> network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Voska had begun working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities.|$|E

25|$|However, in the meantime, MI5's role {{had been}} {{substantially}} enlarged. Due to the spy hysteria, MI5 had been formed {{with far more}} resources than it actually needed to track down German spies. As is common within governmental bureaucracies, this caused the service to expand its role, to use its spare resources. MI5 acquired many additional responsibilities during the war. Most significantly, its strict <b>counter-espionage</b> role blurred considerably. It became a much more political role, involving the surveillance not merely of foreign agents but also of pacifist and anti-conscription organisations, and of organised labour. This was justified through the common belief that foreign influence was {{at the root of}} these organisations. Thus, {{by the end of the}} World War I, MI5 was a fully-fledged investigating force (although it never had powers of arrest), in addition to being a <b>counter-espionage</b> agency. The expansion of this role continued after a brief post-war power struggle with the head of the Special Branch, Sir Basil Thomson.|$|E
25|$|The War Department {{took over}} the Secret Intelligence (SI) and <b>Counter-Espionage</b> (X-2) Branches, which were then housed in a new unit created for this purpose—the Strategic Services Unit (SSU). The Secretary of War {{appointed}} Brigadier General John Magruder (formerly Donovan's Deputy Director for Intelligence in OSS) as the new SSU director. He oversaw the liquidation of the OSS and managed the institutional preservation of its clandestine intelligence capability.|$|E
25|$|Nathan's efforts, {{along with}} those of John Wallinger's Indian Political Intelligence Office (who Nathan worked closely with), were key in the British <b>counter-espionage</b> work. Nathan's work at the time {{identified}} the plans by Ghadar Party and the Berlin Committee to assassinate Lord Kitchener in 1915 through an associate of Har Dayal, Gobind Behari Lal. He was also responsible at this time, along with Basil Thomson, to turn Harish Chandra (who was associated with the Berlin Committee) into a double agent.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} {{head of the}} Army {{section was}} Vernon Kell of the South Staffordshire Regiment, who remained in that role until {{the early part of}} the Second World War. Its role was originally quite restricted; existing purely to ensure national security through <b>counter-espionage.</b> With a small staff and working in conjunction with the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police, the service was responsible for overall direction and the identification of foreign agents, whilst Special Branch provided the manpower for the investigation of their affairs, arrest and interrogation.|$|E
25|$|Much Cold War espionage and <b>counter-espionage</b> {{took place}} in Berlin, against a {{backdrop}} of potential superpower confrontation in which both sides had nuclear weapons set for a range that could hit Germany. In 1971, the Four-Power Agreement on Berlin was signed. While the Soviet Union applied the oversight of the four powers only to West Berlin, the Western Allies emphasized in a 1975 note to the United Nations their position that four-power oversight apply to Berlin as a whole. The agreement guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} {{failure of the}} service during the war {{was known as the}} Venlo incident, named for the Dutch town where much of the operation took place. Agents of the German army secret service, the Abwehr, and the <b>counter-espionage</b> section of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), posed as high-ranking officers involved in a plot to depose Hitler. In a series of meetings between SIS agents and the 'conspirators', SS plans to abduct the SIS team were shelved due to the presence of Dutch police. On the night of 8–9 November 1939, a meeting took place without police presence. There, the two SIS agents were duly abducted by the SS.|$|E
25|$|After this auspicious start, {{the history}} of MI5 becomes darker. It was {{consistently}} successful {{throughout the rest of}} the 1910s and 1920s in its core <b>counter-espionage</b> role. Throughout World War I, Germany continued trying to infiltrate Britain but MI5 was able to identify most, if not all, of the agents dispatched. MI5 used a method that depended on strict control of entry and exit to the country and, crucially, large-scale inspection of mail. In post-war years, attention turned to attempts by the Soviet Union and the Comintern to surreptitiously support revolutionary activities within Britain. MI5's expertise, combined with the early incompetence of the Soviets, meant the bureau was successful once more in correctly identifying and closely monitoring these activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{protagonist of}} the two first instalments, Kim Kimberley, is a tall, athletic, {{intelligent}} woman with brown eyes and fair hair. She {{was born and raised}} at Hampstead Crèche, which was closed when she was thirteen years old due to violations of the Android Protection Acts. She finished her education at the Milton Keynes School of Life in Malta, then returned to England for National Service. She started doing standard security work with the occasional surveillance of subversive members of society, but ended working as a <b>counter-espionage</b> agent. Whilst in her mid-twenties, Kim accepted to travel undercover on the Snowball 9 to be there as the last resort for the worst-case scenario.|$|E
25|$|The Security Service {{is derived}} from the Secret Service Bureau, founded in 1909 and concentrating {{originally}} on the activities of the Imperial German government as a joint initiative of the Admiralty and the War Office. The Bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign target espionage and internal <b>counter-espionage</b> activities respectively. This specialisation was a result of the Admiralty intelligence requirements related to the maritime strength of the Imperial German Navy. This specialisation was formalised prior to 1914 and the beginning of World War I, with the two sections undergoing a number of administrative changes and the home section becoming Directorate of Military Intelligence Section 5 (MI5), the name by which it is still known in popular culture.|$|E

25|$|In November 1916, she was {{travelling}} by steamer from Spain {{when her}} ship called at the British port of Falmouth. There {{she was arrested}} and brought to London where she was interrogated at length by Sir Basil Thomson, Assistant Commissioner at New Scotland Yard in charge of <b>counter-espionage.</b> He gave an account of this in his 1922 book Queer People, saying that she eventually admitted to working for the Deuxième Bureau. Initially detained in Cannon Street police station, she was then released and stayed at the Savoy Hotel. A full transcript of the interview is in Britain's National Archives and was broadcast, with Mata Hari played by Eleanor Bron, on the independent station LBC in 1980. It is unclear if she lied on this occasion, believing the story made her sound more intriguing, or if French authorities were using her {{in such a way}} but would not acknowledge her due to the embarrassment and international backlash it could cause.|$|E
25|$|After World War I {{broke out}} in 1914, Millais was taken into the secret service of the Royal Navy in Norway and in Iceland. As he later {{explained}} in his autobiographical book Wanderings and Memories, {{he was involved in}} <b>counter-espionage,</b> provided with the rank of Lieutenant-Commander and was appointed British Vice-Counsul at Hammerfest in northern Norway where he stayed until 1917. In August 1915 he met with two German spies at Christiania, and travelled with them to Lofoten. He was engaged in setting up and supporting a network of counter espionage. The importance of Norway to the war effort was that the northern seas provided a route for food and materials to reach British ports. Millais reported from Norway that whilst the Norwegian authorities were generally pro British, much of the population were pro German. In December 1917 he was nearly captured by the Germans but {{with the help of a}} harbour master he managed to get out of Norway, returning to Newcastle.|$|E
500|$|In late 1916, Mashbir {{applied for}} a {{commission}} in the Regular Army and was accepted with General Funston's support despite the Army's policy that married men not be accepted.

500|$|Pleased {{with his}} success in London, Clarke {{returned}} to Lisbon on [...] posing as a journalist for The Times named [...] "Wrangal Craker". His aim was {{to carry on the}} semi-undercover work of spreading rumours and misinformation to the Germans. Later that month, in Madrid, he was arrested while dressed as a woman. Guy Liddell, wartime <b>counter-espionage</b> head at MI5, said of the incident: [...] "I'm afraid to say that after his stay in Lisbon as a bogus journalist he has got rather over-confident about his powers as an agent." [...] Clarke was released, apparently at the behest of a German contact who believed him to be [...] "an important agent who was ready to assist the Germans", and made his way to Gibraltar.|$|E
500|$|Lody {{had been}} given no {{training}} in espionage before embarking on his mission and within {{only a few days}} of arriving he was detected by the British authorities. His un-coded communications were detected by British censors when he sent his first reports to an address in Stockholm that the British knew was a postbox for German agents. The British <b>counter-espionage</b> agency MI5, then known as , allowed him to continue his activities in the hope of finding out more information about the German spy network. His first two messages were allowed to reach the Germans but later messages were stopped, as they contained sensitive military information. At the start of October 1914, concern over the increasingly sensitive nature of his messages prompted [...] to order Lody's arrest. He had left a trail of clues that enabled the police to track him to a hotel in Killarney, Ireland, in less than a day.|$|E
500|$|The Secret Service Bureau's <b>counter-espionage</b> section had by {{now become}} part of the War Office's Directorate of Military Operations and was known as [...] At the {{outbreak}} of war it instituted widespread censorship of letters and telegrams sent abroad.

[...] "Burchard" [...] was later identified as a German agent by the name of K.Leipziger. [...] After Lody sent his telegram to [...] "Burchard", exposing his [...] "Charles Inglis" [...] alias on the telegram form, [...] Letter Interception Unit conducted a back-tracking exercise to find any other messages sent to the same place.

500|$|Another {{question}} that arose was whether Lody's trial {{should be held}} in public or in camera. Captain Reginald Drake, [...] head of <b>counter-espionage,</b> wanted Lody to be tried secretly {{so that he could}} implement [...] "an ingenious method for conveying false information to the enemy which depended on their not knowing which of their agents had been caught." [...] He was overruled, as the British Government believed that it would be more advantageous to publicise the threat of German spies to remove any doubt in the public mind that German espionage posed a serious threat in the UK. It was hoped that this would also generate support for the intelligence and censorship apparatus that was rapidly taking shape and would deter possible imitators. In the event, Lody's was the only spy trial in either World War held in public in the UK. In pursuing this policy the Government sacrificed the chance to [...] "turn" [...] captured spies and turn them into assets for the British intelligence services. It was an opportunity that was taken in the Second World War when the highly successful Double-Cross System was implemented.|$|E
500|$|Cholmondeley was {{a flight}} {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who had been seconded to MI5, Britain's domestic counter-intelligence and security service. He had been appointed as {{the secretary of the}} Twenty Committee, a small inter-service, inter-departmental intelligence team in charge of double agents (which gained its name from the Roman numeral XX (twenty), a visual pun on the phrase [...] "double cross"). In November 1942 the Twenty Committee turned down Cholmondeley's plan as being unworkable, but thought there may have been some potential in the idea. As there was a naval connection to the plan, John Masterman, the chairman of the committee, assigned Ewen Montagu, the naval representative, to work with Cholmondeley to develop the plan further. Montagu – a peacetime lawyer and King's Counsel who had volunteered at the outbreak of the war – worked under Godfrey at the Naval Intelligence Division, where he ran NID 17(M), the sub-branch which handled <b>counter-espionage</b> work. Godfrey had also appointed Montagu to oversee all naval deception involving double agents. As part of his duties, Montagu had been briefed on the need for deception operations to aid the Allied war aims in a forthcoming invasion operation in the Mediterranean.|$|E
