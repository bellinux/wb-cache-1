25|$|It is {{estimated}} that about 5,000 species of vascular plants {{are found in the}} Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant families: the Barbeyaceae and the Dirachmaceae. Among the other remarkable species, there are the <b>cucumber</b> <b>tree</b> found only on Socotra (Dendrosicyos socotrana), the Bankoualé palm, the yeheb nut, and the Somali cyclamen.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} of Socotra's plants is the dragon's blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari), which is a strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree. Its red sap was thought to be the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a dye, and today used as paint and varnish. Also important in ancient times were Socotra's various endemic aloes, used medicinally, and for cosmetics. Other endemic plants include the giant succulent tree Dorstenia gigas, the <b>cucumber</b> <b>tree</b> Dendrosicyos socotranus, the rare Socotran pomegranate (Punica protopunica), Aloe perryi, and Boswellia socotrana.|$|E
25|$|With {{the number}} of species increasing, the genus was divided into the two subgenera Magnolia and Yulania. Magnolia {{contains}} the American evergreen species M. grandiflora, which is of horticultural importance, especially in the southeastern United States, and M. virginiana, the type species. Yulania contains several deciduous Asiatic species, such as M. denudata and M. kobus, which have become horticulturally important in their own right and as parents in hybrids. Classified in Yulania, is also the American deciduous M. acuminata (<b>cucumber</b> <b>tree),</b> which has recently attained greater status as the parent responsible for the yellow flower colour in many new hybrids.|$|E

50|$|Cucumber is a census-designated place (CDP) in McDowell County, West Virginia. As of the 2010 census, its {{population}} was 94. It {{is centered on}} mining.

50|$|<b>Cucumber</b> <b>trees</b> are {{excellent}} shade trees for parks and gardens, {{though they are}} not recommended for use as street trees. In cultivation, they typically only grow 15 - 20 m tall, although they reach over 30 m in ideal forest situations. They can become quite massive: the United States national (and presumed world) champion in Stark County, Ohio measures eight feet (2.4 m) in diameter and 96 ft tall. They grow best in deep, moist, well-drained soils that are slightly acidic although they are tolerant of alkaline soils.|$|R

40|$|The sea cucumber, an {{important}} economic species, has encountered high mortality since 2013 in northern China because of seasonal environmental stress such as hypoxia, high temperature, and low salinity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are important in}} regulating gene expression in marine organisms in response to environmental change. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to investigate alterations in miRNA expression in the sea cucumber under different levels of dissolved oxygen (DO). Nine small RNA libraries were constructed from the sea <b>cucumber</b> respiratory <b>trees.</b> A total of 26 differentially expressed miRNAs, including 12 upregulated and 14 downregulated miRNAs, were observed in severe hypoxia (DO 2 mg/L) compared with mild hypoxia (DO 4 mg/L) and normoxic conditions (DO 8 mg/L). Twelve differentially expressed miRNAs were clustered in severe hypoxia. In addition, real-time PCR revealed that 14 randomly selected differentially expressed miRNAs showed significantly increased expressions in severe hypoxia and the expressions of nine miRNAs, including key miRNAs such as Aja-miR- 1, Aja-miR- 2008, and Aja-miR- 184, {{were consistent with the}} sequencing results. Moreover, gene ontology and pathway analyses of putative target genes suggest that these miRNAs are important in redox, transport, transcription, and hydrolysis under hypoxia stress. Notably, novel-miR- 1, novel-miR- 2, and novel-miR- 3 were specifically clustered and upregulated in severe hypoxia, which may provide new insights into novel “hypoxamiR” identification. These results will provide a basis for future studies of miRNA regulation and molecular adaptive mechanisms in sea cucumbers under hypoxia stress...|$|R

5000|$|Joseph and Marie Schedel {{purchased}} a hundred-acre tract of undeveloped land surrounding a charming Victorian mansion on the Portage River, near Elmore, Ohio (in the north-west {{portion of the}} state, near Toledo) in 1929. Extensively traveled, the Schedels had acquired many lovely possessions which they wished to display, such as Persian carpets, a world-class Jade collection, hand-wrought teak furniture, prayer rugs, Japanese silk embroidery, and a thousand-year-old Bronze sculpture. Around the mansion they developed an arboretum, planting 25 varieties of Japanese maple, 16 species of pine, including Bristlecone pine, Bald cypress, Golden chain <b>tree,</b> <b>cucumber</b> and umbrella magnolia, Japanese silver bell, various types of beech, bamboo, katsura, Franklin Trees, and nearly 50 lilac varieties. In several separate beds they introduced English-style landscapes, flowering displays, and a Japanese garden. They installed greenhouses, where annuals are prepared; each spring some 15,000 plants are transplanted from the greenhouse to the grounds, installed among perennials, trees, and shrubs. The Japanese Garden includes bridges, stone lanterns, and a stupa. Two waterfalls empty into pools or streams which flow into two lakes. The Schedels, who had no children, wished for their effort to continue {{for the benefit of}} the entire region. In 1963 they established The Joseph J. & Marie P.
