2500|$|Back {{in those}} days [...] it was RCA, our record label then, went over the edge with Virgin Killer. Today {{when you think of}} child {{pornography}} on the net, you would never do something like that. We never did this in the sense of pornography, we did it in the sense of art. It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that. Looking back from the band point of view it was never an album cover that we took home to our parents and said, [...] "Look what we just released.." [...] There was always mixed feelings about it and even 30 years later it caused a scandal at Wikipedia because the site for that album was blocked and even the FBI was getting involved. All of that after so many years, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that?</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The win {{attracted}} further {{attention on}} social media because Gun Runner ran the final half mile with a horseshoe caught in his tail: a shoe from Cautious Giant flew loose just as Gun Runner was starting his move. [...] "We watched the tape repeatedly, repeatedly," [...] said Asmussen, [...] "and if you never seen anything before, just wait around. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that?</b> I mean if we tried to throw one and stick in one's tail as he was standing, still we'd go 0-for-1,000 – let alone at a run, let alone Gun Runner, let alone in the Whitney – and it stayed. [...] how fast he was going , it was held out from him. When he slowed down to walk, then it came into him. We were obviously unaware of it until {{he came back to}} the winner's circle, but not a nick on him. I mean, there's still nails in it." [...] The race improved Gun Runner's rating to 127 in the World's Best Racehorse Rankings August update, maintaining his third place ranking worldwide.|$|E

Hear me, Father," [...] {{he went on}} hurriedly: [...] "these men have come from San Francisco--have been to Mazatlan. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it is {{possible}} that they have never heard of this woman's search for me? No! The quest of hate is as strong as the quest of love, and more merciless to the hunted." ...|$|E

You need not waste your sympathy, Lord John. These tears are purely alcoholic. The man has been drinking. By the way, Lord John, I called you a coxcomb just now, which was perhaps unduly severe.

We must know our dignity before we can feel our shame. We must see how high {{we have a right to}} stand, that we may see how low, alas! we have fallen.|$|R

I know their {{witnesses}} say that there are cross currents--that, as one witness says, there were three cross currents and two eddies; so far as mere statement, without experiment, and mingled with mistakes, can go, they have proved. But can these men's testimony be compared with the nice, exact, thorough experiments of our witnesses? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these floats go across the currents? It is inconceivable that they could not have discovered every possible current. How do boats find currents that floats cannot discover? We assume the position then that those cross currents are not there. My next proposition is that the Afton passed between the S. B. Carson and the Iowa shore. That is undisputed.|$|E

Why, how the devil <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Artamines, or what d'ye call him, fought singlehanded with a whole battalion? One to three is as great odds as ever fought and won, and I never knew any body that cared to take that, except old Corporal Raddlebanes. But these d--d books put all pretty men's actions out of countenance. I daresay you would think very little of Raddlebanes, if he were alongside of Artamines.--I would have the fellows that write such nonsense brought to the picquet for leasing-making." ...|$|E
6000|$|Excuse these remarks. I {{have been}} on the whole much interested, and {{sometimes}} amused. Are you aware that the praiser of this [...] "brave gymnasium" [...] has not seen a canoe nor taken a long walk since '79? that he is rarely out of the house nowadays, and carries his arm in a sling? Can you imagine that he is a back-slidden communist, and is sure he will go to hell (if there be such an excellent institution) for the luxury in which he lives? And <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> though it is gaily expressed, the thought is hag and skeleton in every moment of vacuity or depression? Can you conceive how profoundly I am irritated by the opposite affectation to my own, when I see strong men and rich men bleating about their sorrows and the burthen of life, in a world full of [...] "cancerous paupers," [...] and poor sick children, and the fatally bereaved, ay, and down even to such happy creatures as myself, who has yet been obliged to strip himself, one after another, of all the pleasures that he had chosen except smoking (and the days of that I know in my heart ought to be over), I forgot eating, which I still enjoy, and who sees the circle of impotence closing very slowly but quite steadily around him? In my view, one dank, dispirited word is harmful, a crime of lèse-humanité, a piece of acquired evil; every gay, every bright word or picture, like every pleasant air of music, is a piece of pleasure set afloat; the reader catches it, and, if he be healthy, goes on his way rejoicing; and it is the business of art so to send him, as often as possible.|$|E

6000|$|When we {{two were}} born, {{this country was}} still {{dominated}} by a selected class bred by political marriages. The commercial class had not then completed the first twenty-five years of its new share of political power; and it was itself selected by money qualification, and bred, if not by political marriage, at least by a pretty rigorous class marriage. Aristocracy and plutocracy still furnish the figureheads of politics; but they are now dependent on the votes of the promiscuously bred masses. And this, if you please, {{at the very moment}} when the political problem, having suddenly ceased to mean a very limited and occasional interference, mostly by way of jobbing public appointments, in the mismanagement of a tight but parochial little island, with occasional meaningless prosecution of dynastic wars, has become the industrial reorganization of Britain, the construction of a practically international Commonwealth, and the partition of the whole of Africa and perhaps the whole of Asia by the civilized Powers. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the people whose conceptions of society and conduct, whose power of attention and scope of interest, are measured by the British theatre as you know it to-day, can either handle this colossal task themselves, or understand and support the sort of mind and character that is (at least comparatively) capable of handling it? For remember: what our voters are in the pit and gallery they are also in the polling booth. We are all now under what Burke called [...] "the hoofs of the swinish multitude." [...] Burke's language gave great offence because the implied exceptions to its universal application made it a class insult; and it certainly was not for the pot to call the kettle black. The aristocracy he defended, in spite of the political marriages by which it tried to secure breeding for itself, had its mind undertrained by silly schoolmasters and governesses, its character corrupted by gratuitous luxury, its self-respect adulterated to complete spuriousness by flattery and flunkeyism. It is no better to-day and never will be any better: our very peasants have something morally hardier in them that culminates occasionally in a Bunyan, a Burns, or a Carlyle. But observe, this aristocracy, which was overpowered from 1832 to 1885 by the middle class, has come back to power by the votes of [...] "the swinish multitude." [...] Tom Paine has triumphed over Edmund Burke; and the swine are now courted electors. How many of their own class have these electors sent to parliament? Hardly a dozen out of 670, and these only under the persuasion of conspicuous personal qualifications and popular eloquence. The multitude thus pronounces judgment on its own units: it admits itself unfit to govern, and will vote only for a man morphologically and generically transfigured by palatial residence and equipage, by transcendent tailoring, by the glamor of aristocratic kinship. Well, we two know these transfigured persons, these college passmen, these well groomed monocular Algys and Bobbies, these cricketers to whom age brings golf instead of wisdom, these plutocratic products of [...] "the nail and sarspan business as he got his money by." [...] Do you know whether to laugh or cry at the notion that they, poor devils! will drive a team of continents as they drive a four-in-hand; turn a jostling anarchy of casual trade and speculation into an ordered productivity; and federate our colonies into a world-Power of the first magnitude? Give these people the most perfect political constitution and the soundest political program that benevolent omniscience can devise for them, and they will interpret it into mere fashionable folly or canting charity as infallibly as a savage converts the philosophical theology of a Scotch missionary into crude African idolatry.|$|E

(Age-inappropriate casting alert! Annabeth Gish, who played Anita, is only 11 years older than Meghan Ory, who portrays her onscreen daughter.) Between those three and all the knights who got their necks snapped in the Wolf Pack's secret furry lair, tonight's Once had a bigger body count than usual.
