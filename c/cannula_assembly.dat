40|$|Tympanic {{temperature}} (Tty) {{is considered}} a valid index of brain temperature (1). However, several researchers have questioned its validity {{as a measure of}} brain temperature because it may be significantly influenced by ambient temperature (2, 3). In spite of this controversy, use of a portable, noninvasive, infrared thermometer to assess tympanic temperature has become wide-spread. Although infrared thermometry has been validated against other indices of core temperature during hypothermic conditions in humans (4), comparison of infrared thermometry to direct assessment of brain temperature has not been made. Furthermore, whether infrared Tty may provide a better index of elevated brain temperature when ambient temperature is held constant is unknown. Therefore, {{the purpose of the present}} investigation was to compare Tty using infrared thermometry with brain temperature (fbr) during exercise and passive heating in ewes. METHODS Three adult Dorset ewes were chronically implanted with a multiple guide <b>cannula</b> <b>assembly</b> attached to the skull. Using roentgenograms, we determined the specific guide cannula for placement of a copper-constantan thermocouple into the 3 rd ventricle for assessment of Tbr. Using this model we have been able to simultaneously measure brain temperature and neuropeptides during exercise (5). Tty was determined using two brands of infraredthermometers (ftyl =Thermoscan®PRO-l; Tty 2 =FirstTemp®Genius™) set to the "core"...|$|E
40|$|During a 4 -year period, a {{total of}} 784 wrists of 640 {{patients}} were treated using a modified Chow's extrabursal dual portal endoscopic technique. All surgeries were performed under local anesthesia. A 1 -cm incision was marked 1 - 2 cm proximal to the distal wrist crease, in the midline, ulnar to the palmaris longus. A distal portal was established along a line bisecting an angle created by {{the intersection of the}} ulnar border of the abducted thumb and the third web space. An obturator and <b>cannula</b> <b>assembly</b> were inserted under the portal, and three blades were used to cut under endoscopic vision. Subjective results showed that 706 hands (90 %) had a reduction in the severity of pain after carpal tunnel release, 706 hands (90 %) had a reduction in the severity of paresthesia and 729 hands (93 %) had a reduction in the severity of numbness. Nocturnal pain and paresthesia were relieved in 745 cases (95 %). Compared with the conventional open carpal tunnel release, less postoperative pain and faster recovery have been reported following endoscopic carpal tunnel release. This study suggests that extrabursal dual portal technique is a safe and reliable treatment option for carpal tunnel syndrome with a high success rate...|$|E
40|$|Fluid Isolation in the {{medication}} vial: Air/ fluid isolation maneuvers {{were used to}} move {{the medication}} to the septum end of vial. This isolation may be achieved in multiple ways based {{on the experience of}} the astronaut with fluid management in microgravity. If vial adaptors/blunt <b>cannula</b> or syringe <b>assembly</b> is inserted into the to vial before fluid isolation commences, the stability of this assembly should be considered in an effort to limit the risk of "slinging off" of the vial during isolation. Alternatively, fluid isolation can be performed prior to attaching the syringe/vial adaptor assembly. Terrestrial practices for medication withdrawal from a nonvented vial require injection of an equivalent amount of air as the expected medication volume prior to withdrawing liquid. In microgravity, this action is still valid, however the injection of additional air into the vial creates a multitude of micro bubbles and increases the volume of medication mixed with air that then must be withdrawn to achieve the desired drug volume in syringe. This practice {{is more likely to be}} required when using vials > 30 ml in size and injection volumes > 10 mL. It is felt that based on the microgravity flight, the practice of air injection is more of a hindrance than help...|$|R
