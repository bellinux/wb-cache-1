Knowing what we know, our duty as good citizens is to give such information as may bring him to trial. I tell you plainly that, if I did not stand toward your mistress in the position of a relation as well as a legal adviser, I should think twice about running the risk--the very serious risk--on which I am now about to venture for her sake. As it is, I have taken the right measures to assure Mr. James Smith that he will not be treated according to his deserts. When he knows what the circumstances are, he will trust us--supposing always that we can find him. The search about this neighborhood has been quite useless. I have sent private instructions by to-day's post to Mr. Dark in London, and with them a carefully-worded form of advertisement for the public newspapers. You may rest assured that every human means of tracing him will be tried forthwith. In the meantime, I have an important question to put to you about Josephine. She may know more than we think she does; she may have surprised the secret of the second marriage, and may be keeping it in reserve to use against us. If this should turn out to be the case, I shall want some other chance against her besides the chance of indicting her for perjury. As to her motive now for making this horrible accusation, what <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> that, William?" ...|$|E

5000|$|When the candidatus Sergios, {{commander}} of the Byzantine army in Palestine was killed by the Saracens, I was at Caesarea and I set off by boat to Sykamina. People were saying [...] "the candidatus has been killed," [...] and we Jews were overjoyed. And they were saying that the prophet had appeared, coming with the Saracens, {{and that he was}} proclaiming the advent of the anointed one, the Christ who was to come. I, having arrived at Sykamina, stopped by a certain old man well-versed in scriptures, and I said to him: [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the prophet who has appeared with the Saracens?" [...] He replied, groaning deeply: [...] "He is false, for the prophets do not come armed with a sword. Truly they are works of anarchy being committed today and I fear that the first Christ to come, whom the Christians worship, was the one sent by God and we instead are preparing to receive the Antichrist. Indeed, Isaiah said that the Jews would retain a perverted and hardened heart until all the earth should be devastated. But you go, master Abraham, and find out about the prophet who has appeared." [...] So I, Abraham, inquired and heard from those who had met him that there was no truth {{to be found in the}} so-called prophet, only the shedding of men's blood. He says also that he has the keys of paradise, which is incredible.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that language development plays {{a critical role}} in childrens socio-cognitive understanding, as talking with others provides access to their emotional experiences and differing perspectives on situations (Astington 2 ̆ 6 Baird, 2005). While middle childhood marks a burgeoning awareness of others mental states (de Rosnay 2 ̆ 6 Hughes, 2006), most research on childrens emotion talk has focused on preschool childrens talk about basic emotions (e. g., sad, angry) as opposed to older childrens talk about complex emotions that require self-awareness (e. g., jealousy, envy). The present study used vignettes followed by probe questions to elicit talk about personal experiences involving relationship rivalry versus situations involving the child coveting another persons possessions or skills (i. e., envy). We examined the extent to which school-age children, like adults, would use the term jealous in reference to each type of situation (Smith et al., 1988), {{and the extent to which}} their usage of the term and their explanations of emotions were related to vocabulary size (PPVT), non-verbal intelligence (TONI), social perspective taking skills (Aldrich, 2014; Selman 2 ̆ 6 Byrne, 1974), and a standardized measure of emotion comprehension (TEC, Pons 2 ̆ 6 Harris, 2000). Eighty 5 -to- 11 -year-olds (40 girls, 40 boys) were presented two relationship rivalry (sibling, friendship) and two envy (possession, attribute) vignettes and were asked to identify and explain the main characters feelings as well as relate information about their own feelings in these situations (i. e., using the probe Have you ever felt like [character name]? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it?). Childrens responses to the probe questions were coded for emotion type (e. g., sad, jealous) and explanations of the characters/their own feelings (i. e., inclusion of new story details versus repeating story elements as told by the investigator). Although children used the term jealous to describe instances of both relationship rivalry and coveting anothers possessions and attributes, their speech varied across the two types of situations. Children first began to use the term jealous in their explanations of situations involving potential threats to relationships and status about a year earlier than in their explanations of situations involving envy. Childrens responses to probe questions about relationship rivalry included more frequent mention of sadness, whereas their responses to envy included more frequent mention of anger. Overall the children were more elaborative when explaining feelings of relationship rivalry versus wanting another persons possessions or attributes, by providing more new details about why they (or the character) felt that way. Simultaneous regression analyses showed effects of vocabulary size, but not age or non-verbal intelligence, on childrens use of the term jealous across both types of vignettes. TEC scores were also predictive of use of the term jealous in response to the envy vignettes. Taken together, the study demonstrates the efficacy of vignettes for eliciting talk about complex emotions in children as young as five years of age, and suggests discourse strategies for helping children cope with issues of interpersonal rivalry, envy, and other powerful negative experiences...|$|E
