5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of}} the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|Archaeopteryx is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the birds. Since {{the late}} 19th century, {{it has been}} accepted by palaeontologists, and celebrated in lay reference works, as being the oldest known bird, though a study in 2011 has cast doubt on this assessment, suggesting instead {{that it is a}} non-avialan dinosaur <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{striking}} {{differences in}} appearance, S.parthenopion {{may be most}} <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to S.nicholsi. Like the diminutive S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, is very small. The geographic range of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E

5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Babakotia is an extinct genus of {{medium-sized}} lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar {{that contains}} a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, {{commonly known as the}} sloth lemurs. The name Babakotia comes from the Malagasy name for the indri, babakoto, to which it and all other sloth lemurs are <b>closely</b> <b>related.</b> Due to its mix of morphological traits that show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the suspensory large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both groups and the <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> and extinct monkey lemurs.|$|E
