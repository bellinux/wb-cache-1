5|$|Many Metro {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Chicago architect Harry Weese, and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture. With their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of Brutalist design. The stations also reflect the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> vaults. Weese worked with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based lighting designer Bill Lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system. All of Metro's original Brutalist stations are found in Downtown Washington, D.C. and neighboring urban corridors of Arlington, Virginia, while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|The large throne hall {{stands on}} a 50cm high base, the roof is covered in green and orange tiles. The {{pediment}} is decorated with a mural depicting the Hindu god Indra. The main central door is reserved for use by royalty, while others must enter through the adjacent side doors. Within the hall there are two rows of square columns, five {{on the left and}} six on the right, adorned with Thai floral designs. The <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> is decorated with glass mosaic stars.|$|E
40|$|Paintings on <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings</b> are {{a set of}} {{compartments}} in {{a ceiling}} with images inside that can be decorative or figurative. Mostly in the Portuguese Baroque style some churches and chapels have paintings on <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings,</b> typically of rectangular or square format. The paintings on <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings</b> usually focus in sacrum-religious aspects, relating the lives of Jesus or Mary. Generally the themes are connected to a particular place or church, describing the life o a Saint. The investigation provides {{a better understanding of}} the paintings on <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings,</b> typologies, themes, conservation diagnosis and points out aspects which ought to be taken into consideration for their technical and material characteristics. It is through analytical methodologies that the conservator clarifies techniques and materials in works of art and makes the right conservation diagnostic in order to achieve the best possible methodologies for interventio...|$|R

50|$|The carved <b>coffer</b> <b>ceiling,</b> {{laminated}} {{with pure}} gold, is by Giuliano da Maiano (1470-1476).|$|R
5|$|The {{library is}} on the right of the hall, removed from the other rooms; it once held a billiard table. The walls are lined with tall bookcases {{containing}} rare books; the walls were otherwise covered in large square panel-like pieces of leather. The room has a richly <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> and had green and brown curtains. The house has bedrooms of various sizes, most large, with Mrs. Shepard's the biggest. Each room has distinct furnishings and from moderate to rich decoration. One particular was the Moorish room, furnished in the Moorish style, with mantel and furniture inlaid with mother of pearl. The third floor had bedrooms, a children's suite and a large playroom.|$|E
5|$|The present building, {{dating from}} around 1283 to 1537, mostly {{replaced}} the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 {{which was built}} in the Norman style. It is believed that the newer church was built around the older one. That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions, while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief. Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel. The transept has retained an early 16th-century <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> with decorated bosses, two of which are carved with the arms of HenryVIII and Cardinal Wolsey.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|Roofs are {{fitted with}} flat or <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings.</b> They are not left open as in Medieval architecture. They are {{frequently}} painted or decorated.|$|R
25|$|The <b>coffer</b> <b>ceiling</b> of {{the nave}} was {{replaced}} {{after the fire}} of 1595. The present gold-decorated ceiling carries the coat of arms of the Medici.|$|R
50|$|Inside the château {{there are}} murals from {{drawings}} of Primaticcio or Niccolò dell'Abbate, {{as well as}} <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings,</b> fine wood carvings, and various colorful ornaments.|$|R
25|$|Inside, a <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> adorns the {{terminal}} and protects travelers {{from the rain}} and snow.|$|E
25|$|Heating ducts {{are visible}} {{along the top}} of the west wall. The <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> is elliptical-arched with lateral beams {{springing}} from the pilaster capitals. The coffers themselves are intricately painted and gilded. In the center of the ceiling are stained glass skylights. The light they let in is supplemented by artificial light from hanging fixtures.|$|E
25|$|Latrobe {{originally}} planned a masonry dome with a lantern on top, but his friend Thomas Jefferson suggested a wooden double-shell dome (of a type pioneered by French master builder Philibert Delorme) with 24 half-visible skylights. For the inner dome Latrobe created a solid, classically detailed masonry hemisphere. Grids of plaster rosettes adorn its <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{background}} is a perspective {{representation of a}} classic architecture with arcades and a gilded <b>coffer</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Platina is pointing to an inscription, written by himself, which boasts Sixtus' deeds.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1875 and 1876 in {{the city}} of Gracias, Lempira, the General José María Medina {{occupied}} a house of adobe with a wooden <b>coffer</b> <b>ceiling</b> and tile clay as its seat of government.|$|R
25|$|Despite its {{imposing}} appearance, {{the diameter}} {{is in fact}} a little less than that of the Pantheon, a factor which led to considerable criticism of the architect. The interiors are richly decorated in a pure Neoclassical style with groups of statues by Pompeo Marchesi and frescoes by Angelo Inganni. The impressive hemispherical dome has a <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the castle's north-, east- and south-wing had to be demolished due to their state of disrepair. The west-wing housing the dance hall with a superb view of the enchanting gardens, still remains today. On the first floor the original renaissance wood carved, <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> can be admired by visitors.|$|E
25|$|While the building's {{exterior}} {{has been}} conserved, the architects had also {{to transform the}} interior into a five-star hotel. The room on the fourth storey, where the British Governor was first told of the British military's decision to surrender to the Japanese during World War II, was converted to an exclusive lounge. The room has a barrel-vaulted, <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling,</b> {{which is the only}} one of its kind in Singapore.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{of the house is}} constructed of brick, sandstone, and marble in the Victorian and Queen Anne styles. In the interior are mainly mahogany and oak mantles, cornices, <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings,</b> paneling and parquet floors.|$|R
50|$|The first- and second-storey {{interiors}} {{have eight}} columns with a moulded scroll design at the column-beam joint and a moulded column base. The <b>ceiling</b> is a <b>coffer</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{formed by the}} reinforced concrete longitudinal and cross beams complete with mouldings.|$|R
50|$|The single {{entrance}} to this underground station is {{in a small}} building {{on the north side}} of Bushwick Avenue between Aberdeen Street and DeSales Place. In this space are 11 ft high <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings,</b> suspended light fixtures, and fancy ironwork.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} shallow eastern apse {{was extended}} in 1884-8 by J. A. Chatwin into {{a much larger}} chancel, articulated by strongly projecting Corinthian columns. This bold design is made richer by the marbled surfaces of the columns and pilasters, the gilding of capitals and cornice and the ornately <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Chatwin also refaced {{the exterior of the}} building because the stone from the original quarry was very soft. The tower was refaced in 1958-59.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Prof. Christopher Charles Benninger the Girls' Hostel Building, an eleven-storey {{structure}} with exposed concrete finish, is {{built as a}} prototype for future hostels to be built on the campus. A connecting street opens into the Entrance lobby of the building with a double height <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> on the Ground Floor. Adjacent to it is a large dining space for 200 girls which flow out into the landscape through large windows. The building can accommodate up to 600 girls with 20 rooms per floor.|$|E
25|$|The Frick Auditorium is {{a lecture}} hall in room 324 of the Cathedral of Learning. Originally {{conceptualized}} as the Fine Arts Lecture Room intended {{to complement the}} Fine Arts Department then located on the seventh floor, the room was completed in 1939 and features stone mullions, chambranle, and other trim as well as wooden lecture seating and a <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling.</b> A centerpiece element {{in the room is}} a Nicholas Lochoff reproduction of The Resurrection by Piero della Francesca that was purchased for the lecture hall by Helen Clay Frick. Frick would later donate a large collection of Lochoff reproductions to the university which are on display in the Nicholas Lochoff Cloisture in the university's Frick Fine Arts Building.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{walls are}} mostly {{rendered}} brick and the floorboards are of pine. The main reception rooms feature <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings.</b> The ornate friezes, cornices and dados in the principal rooms, which were restored {{in the early}} 1980s, are thought to date from the 1880s.|$|R
50|$|The small dome {{resting on}} the church tower has {{an image of the}} Archangel Michael that is often mistaken as a {{portrait}} of Cortés. The <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings</b> with golden flowers on a blue background on the sacristy are the work of Nicólas de Ylleascas.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the primary {{corridors}} on the second level are clad in Kasota Cream marble. Two pairs of double walnut-panel doors with oval windows open into the District Courtroom. The <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings</b> feature ornamental plaster work, and the elaborate cornice is also plaster.|$|R
25|$|The grey Aberdeen granite Fullerton Building sits on 41,100 {{square metres}} (442,400 square feet) of land. The height of its walls {{measures}} 36.6 metres (120ft) from the ground. The building has Neo-classical architectural features {{which include a}} two-storey fluted Doric colonnades on their heavy base, and the lofty portico over the main entrance with trophy designs and the Royal Coat of Arms, crafted by Italian Cavaliere Rudolfo Nolli. Originally, there were five distinct frontages, each treated in the Doric order. 14 elevators served the four floors plus the basement floors. A hollow cellular raft foundation was proposed by the original contractors in the 1920s to save cost because bedrock lies directly below the building. The Fullerton Building also possesses {{the one and only}} barrel-vaulted, <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of opening in 1910, the {{addition}} was of French Renaissance design, carried out {{in a general way}} in the interior though there was a slight leaning toward the Spanish in the exterior details. The addition and the older structure were connected with a large courtyard between the two buildings, forming an angle at this point. The ground floor contained a large lobby. To its right was the main dining room and to the left, the Broadway Cafe. Just underneath the Broadway Cafe, down a flight of marble stairs, was the Grill. The Broadway Cafe contained walls of light, artificial stone and its ceiling was treated in the Italian Renaissance style, ornamented in low relief. The corridor walls were of Greek Skyros marble in gray and yellow with a slight veining of purple. The <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> carried out this color scheme. The large dining room was modelled after the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre. The first floor contained a foyer in Louis XIV style, with carved, dark oak woodwork and walls completely covered in tapestries of the period. From this foyer opened out the Tea Room whose walls of artificial stone were covered with wooden grillage, painted green while the skylight over the entire room was concealed by rafters and grillage with entwined vines. Adjoining this was a Flemish-style Banquet Room in dark oak. Carved wooden doors were set with panelled mirrors in the foyer hall. Elevator doors were of bronze.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion {{consider}} the heavily decorated late 17th-century ceilings {{of the house}} to be [...] "the finest single architectural legacy among the country houses of the region". As in Plas Taliaris and several other country houses in the county, the ceilings are panelled, with [...] "thick moulded beams and wreaths in the panels and winged cherubs' heads in the corners". The entrance hall contains a columned Doric screen with a 19th-century ribbed and bossed ceiling. The old dining room to the right of this features a <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> dated to the 17th century, containing [...] "low plaster relief mouldings including guilloché, acanthus and egg and dart". The chimney piece has been removed. The drawing room to rear of the property also features a richly adorned <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> with [...] "frieze bearing rosette bands" [...] and a [...] "centre oval with bay leaf design". The 17th-century staircase features thick balusters and prominent finials, with foliage patterns ingrained in the plasterwork of the handrail. [...] A billiard room was added to the house in 1896. A strongroom with [...] walls and heavy steel fire-proof doors was added in 1914, for the Dynevors to keep their important documents and valuables. On the upper floors are rooms with 18th-century fittings, including [...] "panelled dados, lugged architraves, low relief plaster ceilings and closets within angled turrets". The bedroom on the northeast of the house features a particularly detailed <b>coffered</b> <b>ceiling</b> with floral patterns.|$|E
50|$|The {{interiors}} are boldly Neoclassical {{with fine}} examples of simulated marble walls, pendentive or <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings</b> and Greek key friezes. The Egyptian Room {{was the first}} of its kind in Britain and contains elaborate hieroglyph plasterwork. The Entrance Hall features a columbarium fireplace with anthemion antefixes.|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} the castle palace was {{considered}} {{the height of the}} most luxurious European courts. The interior decoration of which nothing remains except a small remainder was composed of plasterwork, tiled and azulejos, stained glasses and gilded <b>coffered</b> <b>ceilings.</b> The floors and walls were covered with tapestries.|$|R
