In the early 1990s, the <b>cultivation</b> <b>method</b> developed in Washington was adopted in British Columbia by Fan Seafoods Ltd and the Underwater Harvesters Association (UHA), {{a group of}} 55 licence holders for geoduck and horse clam fishery. The UHA used this method to initiate a wild geoduck enhancement program by seeding depleted subtidal areas with cultivated juvenile geoducks thereby ensuring continued supply in the wild. It even invented a mechanical seeder that plants cultured juvenile geoducks on subtidal beds. Through a collaboration agreement between the provincial government's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Fan Seafoods Ltd. and UHA, five pilot sites were selected in 1996 to study the feasibility of a geoduck aquaculture venture. In 2007, the provincial government of B.C. licensed UHA to operate the first commercial geoduck farm on 25.3 ha off Hernando Island.|$|E

Approximately 10 – 48 % of bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia are not identified using conventional <b>cultivation</b> <b>methods.</b> This study evaluated the bacteriological causes of community-acquired pneumonia using a cultivation-independent clone library analysis of the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, and compared the results with those of conventional <b>cultivation</b> <b>methods.</b> Methods: Patients with community-acquired pneumonia were enrolled based on their clinical and radiological findings. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were collected from pulmonary pathological lesions using bronchoscopy and evaluated by both a culture-independent molecular <b>method</b> and conventional <b>cultivation</b> <b>methods.</b> For the culture-independent molecular method, approximately 600 base pairs of 16 S ribosomal RNA genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction with universal primers, followed by the construction of clone libraries.

In the Philippines, the best results were obtained from one-node cuttings from the lower parts of six-month-old culms. When a stem dies, the clump usually survives.
