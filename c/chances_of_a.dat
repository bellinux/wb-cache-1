5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> catch.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the debates and {{legislative}} maneuvering that went into crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions had shifted. A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second constitutional convention. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E
5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping spiders walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.|$|E

5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Bill of Rights was {{submitted}} to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties.

Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. <b>Chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E

5|$|In early March 1944, Parkinson became {{temporary}} {{major general}} and {{commander of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division after its nominal commander, Howard Kippenberger, was wounded. At the time, the New Zealanders, {{as part of the}} New Zealand Corps, were participating in the Battle of Monte Cassino. An offensive, largely planned by Kippenberger and involving the division, began on 15 March. Parkinson, already doubting the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful outcome, failed to follow Kippenberger's directions for dispersion of his troops and did not allow sufficient infantry to enter Monte Cassino immediately following an intensive air bombardment. Although later criticised for being overly cautious during the battle, he was awarded a bar to his DSO for his leadership during this time.|$|E
5|$|Maloin {{calls to}} the butcher's and drags Henriette from the store against her will and over the protestations of the butcher's wife (Kati Lázár). He brings her to the tavern for a drink, where he overhears the barkeep telling another patron the story of Brown's meeting with the inspector, {{revealing}} that Morrison had called the local police when Brown absconded. Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink stole. They return home {{to the consternation of}} Camélia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole. During Maloin's shift the next night he is visited by Morrison, who questions him as to the previous night's events as the body of the drowned man is retrieved from the quayside below.|$|E
5|$|More {{effective}} tactics {{had to be}} used {{if there}} were to be no greater resources for the Command. Two major changes adopted by Coastal Command were sweeps over convoy routes and sweeps against U-boat transit routes. According to German and Italian submarine logs, both were effective and denied them the chance of shadowing convoys on the surface. It also rapidly increased the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kill. The transit tactic over the Bay of Biscay resulted in many air-to-air and air-to-submarine combats, reaching its peak in 1943. As it was, in 1940 the Command was credited with just two sinkings with Navy vessels, one sunk unaided, and two damaged. The damaged ships could have been sunk had proper weapons been available.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, Seamer prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, Seamer enjoyed his cricket, and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing in the Sudan, the match started at {{seven in the morning}} to avoid the worst of the heat. Before their opponent's innings, Seamer and his team-mates got them drunk to improve their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> win.|$|E

5|$|On March 27, the Russians {{received}} {{word about the}} earlier disastrous defeat at Wschowa. Peter I realized that the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combined attack on Charles were now minimal. He ordered Ogilvy to attempt {{an escape from the}} encirclement at Grodno and a retreat towards Brest-Litovsk. Ogilvy carried out the order on April 4 and managed to break out unseen with his reduced army, leaving 8,000 men behind at Grodno who had died of starvation and sickness. Another 9,000 men were lost during the retreat as the Swedes pursued the Russians as far as Polesia, where they finally gave up the chase. Mazepa met a similar defeat, as he sent 4,700 men in an attempt to save the Cossacks trapped inside Lyakhavichy. Instead these were annihilated in the battle of Kletsk on April 30, after which the garrison in Lyakhavichy surrendered to the Swedes on May 12 and the fortress was destroyed. In total, almost 10,000 Cossacks were killed, out of the initial 14,000 who actively participated in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|With an Ebola {{epidemic}} devastating West Africa, Burwell began holding daily {{meetings on}} July 28, 2014, {{as part of}} the efforts of the United States government, including the Department of HHS, to prevent further spread of the disease. Starting on September30, other Obama administration officials began giving daily public briefings while Burwell took less of a public role, although she did take part in a number of public meetings. In the fall of 2014, the first known death from Ebola in the United States occurred. The Obama administration proposed devoting $6billion to fight the spread of Ebola, including $2billion for the State Department and USAID. The plan included provisions to help U.S. hospitals become better prepared and to support global health initiatives aimed at containing the disease in Africa. Congress allocated $5.4billion to fight Ebola in response to the Obama administration request. Burwell and other Obama administration officials sought to assure the public that the American health system was prepared to deal with Ebola cases and that the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full outbreak in the United States were low.|$|E
5|$|In June, {{predictions}} from CSU and TSR {{were similar}} to pre-season forecasts due to the a lack of an El Niño and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean. However, by July and August, CSU and TSR all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and above-average wind shear. NOAA also decreased the amount of activity in its final outlook, despite predicting a wetter-than-average western Africa and above-average sea surface temperatures in its report. On June3, CSU issued its first mid-season prediction {{for the remainder of}} the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165 units. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of the United States coastline; the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively. The following day, Tropical Storm Risk issued its third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950–2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. A month later, TSR lowered its numbers to 15named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. On August2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season, lowering its numbers slightly. However, the organization continued to state that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall. Finally, on August8, NOAA issued its second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down slightly from its May outlook.|$|E
