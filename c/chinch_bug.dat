50|$|The <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> {{a native}} to the United States and common in midwestern states, has had a great effect on humans. The <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> {{naturally}} feeds on wild prairie grasses. As the midwestern states were settled {{in the nineteenth century}} and crops of wheat, corn, sorghum and other grains were planted, they adapted well to these new species as habitat and food species. Throughout the 20th century, the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> was a major pest to farmers, as it quickly decimated corn or wheat fields. To deal with this problem, many farmers in the area changed their crops to soybeans, which were not a host to the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug.</b> This led to a huge decrease in the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> population in this area. Today they are mostly a common lawn pest and are commonly treated with pesticides and pest-resistant grasses.|$|E

40|$|Information on genetic {{diversity}} and relationship of native buffalograss germplasm is limited and genetic basis of agronomic traits is unknown. The objectives {{of this research}} were to determine: (1) the {{genetic diversity}}, relationships, and organelle DNA inheritance based on cpDNA and mtDNA, (2) <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance variation in natural buffalograss populations characterized for cpDNA and mtDNA; (3) the degree of correlation between total protein content, basal peroxidase level, <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury, and ploidy level, and (4) total protein content and peroxidase changes of resistant and susceptible germplasm in response to chinch bugs. Fifty-six, 48, 28, and, 6 buffalograsses were evaluated for organelle DNA, <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance, correlation analysis, and peroxidase changes, respectively. Six cpDNA and three mtDNA non-coding regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using universal chloroplast and mitochondrial primer pairs. Each amplified fragment was digested with 2 to 6 different restriction enzymes. For the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> study, genotypes were evaluated in replicated trials under greenhouse conditions. Leaf samples were collected for peroxidase changes from infested and control plants at 7, 14, 21, and 28 day after exposure (DAE) to chinch bugs. Peroxidase analyses were carried out using native gels stained for anionic peroxidases and enzyme kinetics were measured with a spectrophotometer. Forty-seven of 56 genotypes had identical cpDNA and mtDNA RFLPs and the rest showed only a few polymorphic markers, which suggests a single maternal origin for the four buffalograss ploidy levels. Based {{on the use of}} cpDNA primers amplifying intergenic region between psbC and trnS genes, and restriction enzyme Hae III, cpDNA was determined to be maternally inherited in buffalograss. The germplasm had considerable diversity for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance, with approximately 10 % of the germplasm having a high resistance level. There was no significant correlation between <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and ploidy level or <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and pubescence. Of the genotypes studied, 4 were highly resistant, 22 were moderately resistant, 19 were moderately susceptible and three were highly susceptible to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury, showing a continuous distribution. Basal peroxidase expression levels measured in the 28 non-infested plants of resistant and susceptible buffalograsses did not correlate with <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury. All six genoptypes evaluated for <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> activity showed an increased level of peroxidase levels in infested plants, suggesting upregulation in response to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> injury. Relatively low levels of peroxidase in a highly <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistant genotype, PX- 3 - 5 - 1, infers contribution of other genes to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance. Overall results indicate substantial genetic variation in buffalograss germplasm {{that can be used to}} enhance buffalograss breeding programs and increase understanding of the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance mechanism. ...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{germplasm}} collections {{may offer}} genetic variability useful in identifying insect resistance. The {{goal of this}} project was to evaluate buffalograss genotypes [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm. ] for resistance to the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> Blissus occiduus Barber (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), and to relate resistance to ploidy level, <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> number, and pubescence. Forty-eight buffalograss genotypes from diverse geographic locations were evaluated in replicated studies under greenhouse conditions. Of the genotypes studied, four were highly resistant, 22 were moderately resistant, 19 were moderately susceptible, and three were highly susceptible to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> damage. The mean number of chinch bugs was significantly different among the 48 genotypes. There was no significant correlation between <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and ploidy level or <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and pubescence. These results indicate the genetic source of resistance to chinch bugs exists in buffalograss germplasm.

40|$|In recent years, buffalograss, Buchloë dactyloides (Nuttall) Engelmann, has {{received}} considerable attention {{as an alternative}} turfgrass species because of its low maintenance requirements and excellent drought tolerance. Although few arthropods are injurious to buffalograss, the <b>chinch</b> <b>bug,</b> Blissus occiduus Barber, has emerged as an important insect pest of this warm-season grass. In my research I evaluated selected buffalograss germplasm for resistance to B. occiduus and explored antixenotic and tolerance mechanisms of chinch bug-resistant buffalograsses. ^ Based on turfgrass damage, NE 91 - 118, ‘Tatanka‘, ‘Bonnie Brae’, and ‘Cody’ were highly to moderately resistant. These four buffalograsses exhibited minimal <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> damage, although all were heavily infested with chinch bugs. NE 84 - 45 - 3 and ‘ 378 ’ were highly susceptible to B. occiduus. ^ The relative levels of tolerance, antibiosis, and antixenosis among the resistant buffalograsses (NE 91 - 118, Cody, and Tatanka) were determined by choice and no-choice studies. From the no-choice studies, NE 91 - 118, Cody, and Tatanka were characterized as tolerant to B. occiduus. Antibiosis studies found {{no significant differences in}} <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> fecundity, nymphal development, and <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> survival among the resistant and susceptible buffalograsses. Choice studies indicated the presence of antixenosis in NE 91 - 118, whereas Cody and Tatanka showed little or no antixenosis. ^ Another component of this research investigated physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying buffalograss tolerance to <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding. Studies investigating physiological differences between <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> susceptible and tolerant plants by measuring rates of photosynthesis demonstrated photosynthetic compensation in the tolerant buffalograss, NE 91 - 118. Enzyme activity assays and protein profiles showed that <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding leads to a loss in catalase activity in susceptible buffalograsses. Resistant buffalograsses, on the other hand, may be able to tolerate <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> feeding by increasing their peroxidase activity. ^ Development of chinch bug-resistant buffalograsses offers the most effective, economical, and environmentally-responsible approach for managing <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> populations affecting buffalograss. Results of this research provide essential information for developing improved turf-type buffalograsses with enhanced <b>chinch</b> <b>bug</b> resistance and for investigating the mechanisms of chinch bug-resistance in buffalograss. ...|$|E
