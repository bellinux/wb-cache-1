25|$|There {{are many}} {{feedback}} mechanisms {{in the climate}} system that can either amplify (a positive feedback) or diminish (a negative feedback) {{the effects of a}} change in <b>climate</b> <b>forcing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Between {{these two}} is the moist greenhouse, which occurs if the <b>climate</b> <b>forcing</b> {{is large enough}} to make water vapour (H2O) a major {{atmospheric}} constituent. In principle, an extreme moist greenhouse might cause an instability with water vapour preventing radiation to space of all absorbed solar energy, resulting in very high surface temperature and evaporation of the ocean. However, simulations indicate that no plausible human-made greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing can cause an instability and baked-crust runaway greenhouse effect.|$|E

25|$|Conceivable {{levels of}} human-made <b>climate</b> <b>forcing</b> could yield the low-end runaway greenhouse. A forcing of 12–16 W m−2 would require carbon dioxide (CO2) levels to {{increase}} 8–16 times. If the forcing were due only to CO2 change, this {{would raise the}} global mean temperature by 16–24nbsp&°C with much larger polar warming. A warming of 16–24nbsp&°C produces a moderately moist greenhouse, with water vapour increasing to about 1% of the atmosphere's mass, thus increasing the rate of hydrogen escape to space. If such a forcing were entirely due to CO2, the weathering process would remove the excess atmospheric CO2 on a time scale of 104–105 years, well before the ocean was significantly depleted. Venus-like conditions on the Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by a few tens of percents, which will take a few billion years.|$|E
25|$|Global warming of that {{magnitude}} {{would make}} {{most of the}} planet uninhabitable by humans. The human body generates about 100 W of metabolic heat that must be carried away to maintain a core body temperature near 37°C, which implies that sustained wet bulb temperatures above 35°C can result in lethal hyperthermia. Today, the summer temperature varies widely over the Earth's surface, but wet bulb temperature is more narrowly confined by the effect of humidity, with the most common value of approximately 26–27°C and the highest approximately of 31°C. A warming of 10–12°C would put most of today's world population in regions with a wetbulb temperature above 35°C. Given the 20°C warming that occurs with 4.8 times current CO2 levels, such a <b>climate</b> <b>forcing</b> would produce intolerable climatic conditions even if the true climate sensitivity is significantly less than the Russell sensitivity, or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO2 forcing required to produce intolerable conditions for humans is less than this amount.|$|E

50|$|By {{the twentieth}} century, prime {{fur-bearing}} animals were raised on farms. However, {{the most valuable}} pelts still come from the wilderness, because the farm-raised animals were believed to not have as luxurious pelts.

40|$|A bathing {{facility}} is distinguished by {{a warm and}} a humidity indoor climate, resulting in large internal <b>climate</b> <b>forces</b> on the <b>climate</b> shield and bearing system. These large <b>climate</b> <b>forces</b> {{are a result of}} the combination of warm air and increased air humidity, caused by the evaporation from water areas. This humidity issue results in a "construction risk" due to the increase in stress on the bathing facility. There are two key aims of this report. The primary aim is to increase the understanding of the impact of indoor climates on facilities in relation to temperature and humidity forces. Secondly, it is to clarify why moisture problems easily appear in these kinds of facilities. Five different bath facilities are alalysed in this study. The report presents the climate in two swimming halls, an adventure bath and two rehabilitation baths. By identifying the climate in these facilities, it is possible to estimate the size of the <b>climate</b> <b>forces.</b> Further to this, the influence of the climate on the installation systems and the bearing system are described. The majority of source data for this report come from interviews with consultant. Thereport also consists of a quatitative study of the climate in bath facilities in order to show the variation of temperature and humidity difference. Three different bath facilities are further analysed, which are a swimming hall, an adventure hall and a rehabilitation bath. These values are compared with the projected values and are used in a non stationary diffusion calculation on how the air humidity is distributed. Problems often occur in the roof structure and therefore the calculation is over the climate shelf of a roof. According to new norms in the Swedish Building Code from July 2006, new requirements of maximum state of humidity have been applied. A new verification method have been introduced which further strength the requirement on humidity safety...|$|R

50|$|Zooplankton {{abundance}} {{has been}} found to be associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the most influential <b>climate</b> <b>force</b> in the Northern Hemisphere. Periodically, pressure anomalies in the system shift from positive to negative as determined by the NAO Index, affecting temperatures and wind patterns. Abundant zooplankton populations have been linked to a positive NAO Index. As global temperatures increase, the NAO is predicted to shift more often and to greater intensities. These shifts will likely greatly affect the abundance of zooplankton, posing a great risk for right whale populations that cannot rapidly adapt to a new food source.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{ever-increasing}} human impact through {{land use}} and climate change on the environment, we crucially need to achieve {{a better understanding of}} those factors that influence the questing activity of ixodid ticks, a major disease-transmitting vector in temperate forests. We investigated variation in the relative questing nymph densities of Ixodes ricinus in differently managed forest types for three years (2008 – 2010) in SW Germany by drag sampling. We used a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach to examine the relative effects of habitat and weather and to consider possible nested structures of habitat and <b>climate</b> <b>forces.</b> The questing activity of nymphs was considerably larger in young forest successional stages of thicket compared with pole wood and timber stages. Questing nymph density increased markedly with milder winter temperatures. Generally, the relative strength of the various environmental forces on questing nymph density differed across years. In particular, winter temperature had a negative effect on tick activity across sites in 2008 in contrast to the overall effect of temperature across years. Our results suggest that forest management practices have important impacts on questing nymph density. Variable weather conditions, however, might override the effects of forest management practices on the fluctuations and dynamics of tick populations and activity over years, in particular, the preceding winter temperatures. Therefore, robust predictions and the detection of possible interactions and nested structures of habitat and <b>climate</b> <b>forces</b> can only be quantified through the collection of long-term data.
