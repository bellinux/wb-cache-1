40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{efficient}} blind certification protocol with interesting properties. It {{falls in the}} Groth-Sahai framework for witness-indistinguishable proofs, thus extended to a <b>certified</b> <b>signature</b> it immediately yields non-frameable group signatures. We use blind certification to build {{an efficient}} (offline) e-cash system that guarantees user anonymity and transferability of coins without increasing their size. As required for fair e-cash, in case of fraud, anonymity can be revoked by an authority, which is also crucial to deter from double spending...|$|E

50|$|The proponents {{submitted}} about 100,000 signatures to the Massachusetts Secretary of State for {{the first}} phase of signature collection. 76,084 of those signatures were determined to be valid, with a requirement that 66,593 must be valid for the initiative to proceed to the next step. The next step was for the Massachusetts State Legislature to take up the measure. They declined to pass it by the first Wednesday in May 2008, meaning that the proponents had to collect an additional 11,099 valid signatures by June 18, 2008. On July 3, it was announced that 15,913 additional <b>certified</b> <b>signatures</b> had been filed, making the measure extremely likely to appear on the ballot.|$|R

In contrast, we detail {{an attack on the}} composition of another implicit certificate scheme, proposed by Pintsov and Vanstone for Optimal Mail Certificates (OMC), and ECDSA. This composition attack forges an implicitly <b>certified</b> ECDSA <b>signature,</b> and is passive in the sense of needing no interaction with the signer or the certification authority.

50|$|Proposals {{to enact}} ranked choice voting have been {{introduced}} in the Legislature as early as 2003, but were rejected. After a 2010 charter change, the city of Portland began electing its mayor using ranked choice voting in 2011. There were new legislative proposals in 2011, though they were rejected as well. In 2014, upon releasing his supporters to vote for {{someone else in the}} 2014 election, Eliot Cutler encouraged his supporters to support ranked choice voting. Led by former independent State Senator Dick Woodbury, Ranked Choice Voting collected more than the 61,123 valid signatures necessary to put a proposal to voters, collecting some 40,000 on Election Day 2014. The group collected 75,369 signatures and delivered them to Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap by October 19, 2015. Dunlap ultimately <b>certified</b> 64,687 <b>signatures</b> by November 18, 2015, which put the proposal on the November 2016 ballot.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasingly}} {{widespread use}} of smartcards {{for a variety of}} sensitive applications, including digital signatures, creates the need to ensure and possibly certify the secure interoperability of these devices. Standard certification criteria, in particular the Common Criteria, define security requirements but do not sufficiently address the problem of interoperability. Here we consider the interoperability problem which arises when various applications interact with different smartcards through a middleware. In such a situation it is possible that a smartcard of type S receives commands that were supposed to be executed on a different smartcard of type S'. Such "external commands" can interleave with the commands that were supposed to be executed on S. We experimentally demonstrate this problem with a Common Criteria <b>certified</b> digital <b>signature</b> process on a commercially available smartcard. Importantly, in some of these cases the digital signature processes terminate without generating an error message or warning to the user.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In any {{organization}} to identification of any employee is necessary. To identifying or confirming {{the identity of}} an individual employee their name and signature is not enough, because any one can misuse other's identity so these type of problem occur in today. To overcome this problem we can use fingerprint recognition by which we can easily recognize any person, because human fingerprints are unique to each person and {{can be regarded as}} some sort of <b>signature,</b> <b>certifying</b> the person's identity. In this paper we propose a method for fingerprint matching based on minutiae matching. In addition, this paper describes all the records of employee and introduces verification of fingerprints without any biometric device...|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{formation}} of the United States, privateering in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the nations of the Barbary Coast prompted the U.S. to initiate a series of so-called peace treaties, collectively known as the Barbary Treaties. Individual treaties were negotiated with Morocco (1786), Algiers (1795), Tripoli (1797) and Tunis (1797), all of them more than once. The United States consul-general to the Barbary states of Algiers, Tripoli and Tunis was Joel Barlow, who dealt with the text of various treaties (including the Treaty of Tripoli) and supported U.S. diplomatic efforts in the Barbary Coast. Commissioner Plenipotentiary (and Minister to the Kingdom of Spain in Madrid) of the United States, David Humphreys, was given the right to establish a treaty with Tripoli and assigned Joel Barlow and Joseph Donaldson to broker it. It was Joel Barlow who <b>certified</b> the <b>signatures</b> on the Arabic original and the English copy provided to him. Later, Captain Richard O'Brien, USN established the original transport of the negotiated goods along with the Treaty, but it was the American Consul James Leander Cathcart who delivered the final requirements of payment for the treaty.|$|R
40|$|Although {{smartcard}}s {{are widely}} used, secure smartcard interoperability {{has remained a}} significant challenge. Usually each manufacturer provides a closed environment for their smartcard based applications including the microchip, associated firmware and application software. While the security of this "package" can be tested and certified for example based on the Common Criteria, the secure and convenient interoperability with other smartcards and smartcard applications is not guaranteed. Ideally one would have a middleware that can support various smartcards and smartcard applications. In our ongoing research we study this scenario with the goal to develop a way to certify secure smartcard interoperability in such an environment. Here we discuss and experimentally demonstrate one critical security problem: if several smartcards are connected via a middleware {{it is possible that}} a smartcard of type S receives commands that were supposed to be executed on a different smartcard of type S'. Such "external commands" can interleave with the commands that were supposed to be executed on S. Here we demonstrate this problem experimentally with a Common Criteria <b>certified</b> digital <b>signature</b> process on two commercially available smartcards. Importantly, in some of these cases the digital signature processes terminate without generating an error message or warning to the user. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
40|$|In today's {{multimedia}} world {{digital content}} is easily available to and widely used by end consumers. On {{the one hand}} high quality, {{the ability to be}} copied without loss of quality and the existence of portable players make digital content, in particular digital music, very attractive to consumers. On the other hand the music industry is facing increasing revenue loss due to illegal copying. To cope with this problem so called Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems have been developed in order to control the usage of content. However, currently no vendor and no DRM system is widely accepted by the market. This is due to the incompatibility of different systems, the lack of open standards and other reasons. This paper analyzes the current situation of DRM systems, derives requirements for DRM systems and presents technological building blocks to meet these requirements. Finally, a new idea for a DRM system was presented that respects both users and providers interests at the same time. The basic principle relies on the idea that in order to publish content, a user needs to sign that content with his <b>certified</b> digital <b>signature.</b> The concept is based on a five level approach that can be seen as an upgrade path adding functionality as the level increases. The system is open for future extensions and offers benefits both for users and content providers...|$|R

The signatures are {{a violation of}} an EPR steering inequality based on an uncertainty relation. The violation confirms an EPR steering between the two modes and involves certification of an inter-mode correlation for number, as well as quadrature phase amplitude measurements. We also explain how the <b>signatures</b> <b>certify</b> an Nth order quantum coherence, so the system (for larger N) can be signified {{to be in a}} superposition of states distinct by a mesoscopic value of the two-mode quantum number difference.
