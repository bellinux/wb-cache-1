5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
5|$|The concept {{behind a}} Qualifying Industrial Zone is {{credited}} to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, {{in anticipation of}} the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to seventy percent lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, {{which saw}} a rapid {{economic}} expansion between 1750 and 1850, {{there were signs}} of small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from industries connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying. Until the Industrial Revolution, Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner. The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> Cornwall's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then-largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both {{the north and the south}} of the country. In the north of Wales, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a significant industry, while in the south, a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil, where the four ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. In the 1820s, south Wales alone accounted for 40% of all pig iron manufactured in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} MacLachlan learned {{he was to}} be {{relocated}} to Malta. Twelve pilots and 207 men boarded HMS Argus in the River Clyde just off Greenock on 7 November 1940 and set sail for the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations. The convoy sent to Malta constituted a part of Operation Collar. The operation was to supply aircraft for the Island's defence. In June 1940 Italy had declared war on France when the country {{was on the verge of}} collapse at the hands of the German Wehrmacht. The Italians hoped they <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the weakened Allies by joining the Axis Powers. It was the Italian intent to launch a series of air, naval and land offensives throughout the Mediterranean and in particularly in North Africa. Malta lay across Italian sea communications between Sicily and Italian-held Libya. The island had the potential to be a useful base from which the British could disrupt Axis supplies to and from North Africa and the ensuing North African Campaign. The Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) resolved to eliminate the island by bombing shipping bringing in supplies and attacking the island directly. With air power crucial to both sides, the island was reinforced.|$|E
5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who <b>could</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E

25|$|The Kokutai Genri-ha {{had long}} {{supported}} a violent uprising against the government. The decision to finally act in February 1936 {{was caused by}} two factors.
