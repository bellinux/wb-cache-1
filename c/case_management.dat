The reasons for this have {{as much to do}} with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice.

5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which <b>case</b> <b>management</b> {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to follow}} up on the {{progress}} of the <b>case</b> study-based <b>management</b> accounting research since Zimmerman (2001) published his work "Conjectures regarding management accounting research". Zimmerman critiqued the lack of progress in case study-based research until the year 2001. Accordingly, this paper rejoins the progress of this body of research to date. A total of 57 direct citations of Zimmerman's (2001) work were analyzed using three statistical techniques: hypothesis testing (test of proportions), inter-rater agreement analysis, and Cohen's Kappa test of reliability. The statistical tests confirmed three hypotheses and rejected three others. The major finding shows that <b>case</b> study-based <b>management</b> accounting research has been evolving since 2001 in some areas and has remained in the same state as reported by Zimmerman in others (2001). More management accounting researchers should pursue <b>case</b> study-based <b>management</b> accounting research, so that a critical mass of researchers can be developed to advance the current body of knowledge in <b>case</b> study based <b>management</b> accounting research. The results from the analyses in this paper contribute {{to our understanding of the}} roles of practitioners and researchers in advancing <b>case</b> study-based <b>management</b> accounting research since Zimmerman's (2001) review...|$|R
