5|$|Antiandrogens such as <b>cyproterone</b> acetate and {{spironolactone}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{available}} {{options for}} antiandrogen therapy. Spironolactone, <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, and flutamide {{are some of}} the most well-known and widely used drugs. Compared to <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, spironolactone is considerably less potent as an antiandrogen by weight and binding affinity. However, despite this, at the doses of which they are typically used, spironolactone and <b>cyproterone</b> acetate have been found to be generally about equivalent in terms of effectiveness for a variety of androgen-related conditions, though, <b>cyproterone</b> acetate has shown a slight though non-statistically-significant advantage in some studies. Also, it has been suggested that <b>cyproterone</b> acetate could be more effective in cases where androgen levels are more pronounced, though this has not been proven.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyproterone</b> is a steroidal {{antiandrogen}} that competitively inhibits {{the binding}} of testosterone or DHT to AR. <b>Cyproterone</b> binds to ARs that are expressed by prostate cancer cells {{as well as}} to the AR that are expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Therefore, <b>cyproterone</b> blocks the negative feedback of androgens at the hypothalamic-pituitary level leading to increased luteinizing hormone (LH) serum levels. This rise in LH levels causes an increase in serum testosterone levels and ultimately diminishes the ability of <b>cyproterone</b> to compete for AR binding and to block androgenic stimulation.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used antiandrogens for transgender women are steroidal: spironolactone and <b>cyproterone</b> acetate. Spironolactone, which is relatively safe and inexpensive, is {{the most frequently used}} antiandrogen in the United States. <b>Cyproterone</b> acetate, which is unavailable in the United States, is more commonly used {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|NSAAs {{may be an}} {{appealing}} option for {{those who wish to}} preserve sex drive and function and/or fertility, as well as for those who desire more selective action with fewer side effects than spironolactone and <b>cyproterone</b> acetate (which increase the risk of depressive symptoms, among other adverse effects). Bicalutamide specifically may also be a safer drug than <b>cyproterone</b> acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity relative to <b>cyproterone</b> acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, bicalutamide does have a very small risk of hepatotoxicity itself, as well as of interstitial pneumonitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyproterone</b> acetate is a 6-chloro-1,2-methylene {{derivative}} of 17α-acetoxyprogesterone. It shows major antiandrogenic activity together with androgenic activities. <b>Cyproterone</b> acetate displays high affinity for AR in rats which increases when the 1,2-methylene group {{is removed from}} the compound. If the chlorine atom is replaced by a methyl group the binding slightly decreases, whereas further removal of the C6 double bond modifies the binding kinetics, see figure 7.|$|E
25|$|Flutamide {{became the}} first NSAA to be tested clinically. Later the NSAAs {{bicalutamide}} and nilutamide were developed. The alleged advantages of these compounds were {{that they did not}} affect libido or potency like the other centrally acting compounds under development, luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and <b>cyproterone</b> acetate. But this theory did not prove to be true. These NSAAs eventually crossed the blood–brain barrier, like <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, leading to a subsequent increase in serum testosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacological {{interventions}} {{are used to}} lower the sex drive in general, which can ease the management of pedophilic feelings, but does not change sexual preference. Antiandrogens work by interfering with the activity of testosterone. <b>Cyproterone</b> acetate (Androcur) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) are the most commonly used. The efficacy of antiantrogens has some support, but few high-quality studies exist. <b>Cyproterone</b> acetate has the strongest evidence for reducing sexual arousal, while findings on medroxyprogesterone acetate have been mixed.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens are {{medications}} such as flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and <b>cyproterone</b> acetate {{that directly}} block {{the actions of}} testosterone and DHT within prostate cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|Pure AR antagonists like {{flutamide}} and bicalutamide are potent progonadotropins with indirect estrogenic {{activity in}} males. This {{is because they}} block the AR in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus and thereby inhibit the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. This, in turn, results in increased gonadotropin secretion, activation of gonadal steroidogenesis, and an up to 2-fold increase in testosterone levels and 2.5-fold increase in estradiol levels. Conversely, AR antagonists that are also progestogens, like <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, are not progonadotropic, as activation of the PR is antigonadotropic, and, indeed, <b>cyproterone</b> acetate is potently antigonadotropic in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Flutamide, another {{frequently}} used antiandrogen which is nonsteroidal and a pure androgen blocker, though much less potent by weight and binding affinity than either spironolactone or <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, {{has been found}} to be more effective than either of them as an antiandrogen when it is used at the typical treatment doses. Unfortunately, the uses of both <b>cyproterone</b> acetate and flutamide have been associated with hepatotoxicity, which can be severe with flutamide and has resulted in <b>cyproterone</b> acetate never being approved in the United States. Bicalutamide is a more potent, safer, and more tolerable alternative to flutamide, but is relatively little-studied in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions aside from prostate cancer, though it has been used to treat hirsutism with success. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are another very effective option for antiandrogen therapy, but have not been widely employed for this purpose due to their high cost and limited insurance coverage despite many now being available as generics. As such, spironolactone may be the only practical, safe, available, and well-supported antiandrogen option in some cases.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyproterone</b> acetate is a {{powerful}} antiandrogen and progestin that suppresses gonadotropin levels (which in turn reduces androgen levels), blocks androgens from binding to and activating the androgen receptor, and inhibits enzymes in the androgen biosynthesis pathway. It {{has been used as}} a means of androgen deprivation therapy to treat prostate cancer. If used long-term in dosages of 150mg or higher, it can cause liver damage or failure.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{does not}} bind to the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and hence does not possess any direct androgenic or antiandrogenic activity. This {{is in contrast}} to many progestins, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., norethisterone, dienogest) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives (e.g., <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate), which do bind to the AR and have been associated with androgenic or antiandrogenic effects depending on the progestin in question.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} component of hormone replacement therapy in transgender women, especially in the United States (where <b>cyproterone</b> acetate is not available), usually in addition to an estrogen. Spironolactone significantly depresses plasma testosterone levels, reducing them to female/castrate levels at sufficient doses and in combination with estrogen. The clinical response consists of, among other effects, decreased male pattern body hair, the induction of breast development, feminization in general, and lack of spontaneous erections.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} the {{predictive}} markers for transgender women requesting breast augmentation, there was a significantly higher rate of those treated with spironolactone requesting breast augmentation compared to other antiandrogens such as <b>cyproterone</b> acetate or GnRH analogues, which was interpreted by the study authors as being potentially indicative that spironolactone may result in poorer breast development in comparison. This {{may be related to the}} fact that spironolactone has been regarded as a comparatively weak antiandrogen relative to other options.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens, {{including}} spironolactone, <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, flutamide, bicalutamide, and finasteride, {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of hirsutism. Although effective for reducing body hair, antiandrogens have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. Antiandrogens will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, antiandrogens are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as gynecomastia as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.|$|E
25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics, such as a deep voice, broad shoulders, and a masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, body odor, and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cyproterone</b> acetate was {{developed}} to overcome this problem. It is formed by adding an acetate group to <b>cyproterone,</b> see figure 3. <b>Cyproterone</b> acetate has a dual mode of action as it competes directly with DHT for binding to AR, but also inhibits gonadotropin secretion. It thereby reduces androgen, estrogen and LH levels. <b>Cyproterone</b> acetate acts both directly as an antiandrogen in prostate cancer cells and also functions to indirectly decrease serum testosterone levels. The latter causes the limitations of <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, which are central effects on androgen secretion, with subsequent loss of libido and sexual potency. Several reports also state that <b>cyproterone</b> acetate causes liver hyperplasia. These side effects gave pharmaceutical companies the incentive to search for alternative, [...] "pure" [...] NSAAs {{that would not have}} these side effects. [...] Pure antiandrogens block the androgen receptor without exerting any agonistic or any other hormonal activity.|$|E
2500|$|It {{became evident}} that {{androgen}} ablation alone was insuffient to cure patients with advanced prostate cancer. In the late 1960s, the androgen receptor (AR) was discovered and characterized. Screening of chemical libraries for AR blockers {{led to the}} discovery of the first antiandrogen, <b>cyproterone.</b> An acetate group was then added to <b>cyproterone</b> and created <b>cyproterone</b> acetate. In the 1970s, the antiandrogen flutamide was discovered.|$|E
2500|$|... 2000µg <b>cyproterone</b> acetate: only {{approved}} for severe acne or severe hirsutism in the UK (AU, RU: Diane-35, UK: Dianette, Bayer) ...|$|E
2500|$|Aromatase inhibitors {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or prevent the estrogenic effects of {{methyltestosterone}} and 5α-reductase inhibitors {{can be used to}} prevent its potentiation in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues and thereby improve its ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity and reduce its rate of androgenic side effects. Antiandrogens like bicalutamide and <b>cyproterone</b> acetate can block both the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS like methyltestosterone.|$|E
2500|$|Nonsteroidal antiandrogens (NSAAs) used in HRT for {{transgender}} women include flutamide, nilutamide, and bicalutamide, {{all three}} of which are primarily used {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer in cisgender men. Unlike steroidal antiandrogens such as spironolactone and <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, these drugs are pure androgen receptor antagonists. They do not lower androgen levels; rather, they act solely by preventing the binding of androgens to the androgen receptor. However, they do so very strongly, and are highly effective antiandrogens. Bicalutamide has improved tolerability and safety profiles relative to <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, as well as to flutamide and nilutamide, and has largely replaced the latter two in clinical practice for this reason. Enzalutamide is a more recently introduced NSAA with even greater potency and efficacy as an antiandrogen than bicalutamide, but it is still under patent protection and in relation to this is currently (and for the foreseeable future) [...] extremely expensive. Moreover, enzalutamide has been found to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor and has been associated with central side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and, most notably, seizures (in ≈1% of patients), properties that it does not share with bicalutamide.|$|E
2500|$|Flutamide is an arylpropionamide analog {{with pure}} antiandrogenic properties, {{seen in figure}} 4. It is {{completely}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first pass metabolism to its active form, 2-hydroxyflutamide, and hydrolysis product, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitroaniline. Hydroxyflutamide is a more potent AR antagonist than flutamide in vivo, with higher binding affinity for the AR. Hydroxyflutamide has an elimination half-life of about 8 hours in humans. Hydrolysis of the amide bond represents the major metabolic pathway for this active metabolite. By reversing the stimulatory effect of DHT on ventral prostate weight, flutamide is approximately 2-fold more potent than <b>cyproterone</b> acetate. Hydroxyflutamide has relatively low binding affinity to AR and is therefore generally used at [...] high doses {{in order to achieve}} complete AR blockage in therapy.|$|E
2500|$|The T877A, W741L and W741C {{mutations}} [...] {{are examples}} of known AR LBD mutations. The LNCaP prostate cancer cell line expresses AR with a T877A point mutation that causes proliferation {{in the presence of}} the antiandrogens hydroxyflutamide and <b>cyproterone</b> acetate. This mutation has also been discovered in patients with antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome being treated with these compounds. In another study, bicalutamide treatment of LNCaP cells resulted in two LBD mutations, W741L and W741C, causing bicalutamide to acquire agonist activity to both mutant ARs. The W741L mutation generates additional space such that the sulfonyl-linked phenyl ring of bicalutamide is accommodated at the location of the missing indole ring of W741. In non-mutant AR, the presence of the W741 side chain probably forces bicalutamide to protrude out thus precluding the active position of H12 on the AR receptor.|$|E
2500|$|GnRH {{action can}} be {{interrupted}} {{in one of}} two ways. GnRH antagonists such as abarelix and degarelix suppress the production of LH directly by acting on the anterior pituitary. GnRH agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin acetate suppress LH through the process of downregulation after an initial stimulation effect which can cause initial tumor flare. In order to prevent stimulation of tumor growth during the initial LH surge, an antiandrogen such as <b>cyproterone</b> acetate is prescribed a week before and three weeks after GnRH agonists are given. [...] Abarelix and degarelix are examples of GnRH antagonists, whereas the GnRH agonists include leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, and buserelin. Initially, GnRH agonists increase the production of LH. However, because the constant supply of the medication does not match the body's natural production rhythm, production of both LH and GnRH decreases after a few weeks.|$|E
2500|$|In {{practice}} however, although {{experience is}} limited, spironolactone {{has never been}} reported to cause observable feminization or any other congenital defects in humans. Among 31 human newborns exposed to spironolactone in the first trimester, {{there were no signs}} of any specific birth defects. A case report described a woman who was prescribed spironolactone during pregnancy with triplets and delivered all three (one boy and two girls) healthy; there was no feminization in the boy. In addition, spironolactone has been used at high doses to treat pregnant women with Bartter's syndrome, and none of the infants (three boys, two girls) showed toxicity, including feminization in the male infants. There are similar findings, albeit also limited, for another antiandrogen, <b>cyproterone</b> acetate (prominent genital defects in male rats, but no human [...] abnormalities (including feminization of male fetuses) at both a low dose of 2mg/day or high doses of 50 to 100mg/day). In any case, spironolactone is nonetheless not recommended during pregnancy due to theoretical concerns relating to feminization of males and also to potential alteration of fetal potassium levels.|$|E
2500|$|Spironolactone, {{similarly}} to other steroidal antiandrogens such as <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, is actually not a pure, or silent, antagonist of the AR, but rather is a weak partial agonist {{with the capacity}} for both antagonistic and agonistic effects. However, {{in the presence of}} sufficiently high levels of potent full agonists like testosterone and DHT (the cases in which spironolactone is usually used even with regards to the [...] "lower" [...] relative levels present in females), spironolactone will behave more {{similarly to}} a pure antagonist. Nonetheless, there may still be a potential for spironolactone to produce androgenic effects in the body at sufficiently high dosages and/or in those with very low endogenous androgen concentrations. As an example, one condition in which spironolactone is contraindicated is prostate cancer in men being treated with androgen deprivation therapy, as spironolactone has been shown in vitro to significantly accelerate carcinoma growth {{in the absence of any}} other androgens. In accordance, two case reports have described significant worsening of prostate cancer with spironolactone treatment in patients with the disease, leading the authors to conclude that spironolactone has the potential for androgenic effects in some contexts and that it should perhaps be considered to be a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), albeit with mostly antagonistic effects.|$|E
50|$|The English and {{generic name}} of CPA is <b>cyproterone</b> acetate {{and this is}} its USAN, BANM, and JAN. The English and generic name of unesterified <b>cyproterone</b> is <b>cyproterone</b> and this is its INN and BAN, while <b>cyprotérone</b> is the DCF and French name and ciproterone is the DCIT and Italian name. The name of unesterified <b>cyproterone</b> in Latin is cyproteronum, in German is cyproteron, and in Spanish is ciproterona. These names of <b>cyproterone</b> {{correspond}} for CPA to acétate de <b>cyprotérone</b> in French, acetato de ciproterona in Spanish, ciproterone acetato in Italian, cyproteronacetat in German, cyproteronacetaat in Dutch, and ciproteron acetat in Slavic.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to clarify that the term <b>cyproterone</b> is often used as a synonym for <b>cyproterone</b> acetate, and when the term occurs, what is usually being referred to is, confusingly, CPA and not actually <b>cyproterone.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{clinical}} studies, <b>cyproterone</b> {{was found}} to be far less potent and effective as an antiandrogen relative to CPA, likely in significant part due to its lack of concomitant antigonadotropic action. <b>Cyproterone</b> was studied as a treatment for precocious puberty by Bierich (1970, 1971), but no significant improvement was observed. In men, 100 mg/day <b>cyproterone</b> proved to be rather ineffective in treating acne, which was hypothesized to be related to its progonadotropic effects in males and counteraction of its antiandrogen activity. In women however, in whom the drug has no progonadotropic activity, 100-200 mg/day oral <b>cyproterone</b> was effective in reducing sebum production in all patients as early as 2-4 weeks following the start of treatment. In contrast, topical <b>cyproterone</b> was far less effective and barely outperformed placebo. In addition, another study showed disappointing results with 100 mg/day <b>cyproterone</b> for reducing sebum production in women with hyperandrogenism. Similarly, the drug showed disappointing results in the treatment of hirsutism, with a distinct hair reduction occurring in only a limited percentage of cases. In the same study, the reduction of acne was better, but clearly inferior to that produced by CPA, and only the improvement in seborrhea was regarded as satisfactory. The addition of an oral contraceptive to <b>cyproterone</b> resulted in a somewhat better improvement in acne and seborrhea relative to <b>cyproterone</b> alone. According to Jacobs (1979), “cyproterone proved to be without clinical value for reasons that cannot be discussed here.” In any case, <b>cyproterone</b> has been well-tolerated by patients in dosages of up to 300 mg/day.|$|E
