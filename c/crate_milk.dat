50|$|The {{processing}} plant {{is located in}} Downey with a cold storage facility in the neighboring city of South Gate. The dairy has hired six to 10 new employees annually from targeted Enterprise Zone employment areas within the local community, earning the business tax credits now worth approximately $100,000 a year.The company uses the Q5i Near Infrared In-Line Analyzer from Engineering Solutions Experts, Inc., improving quality control during the fluid milk standardization process. Rockview Farms uses HTST pasteurization to ensure maximum nutrition and taste.Rockview Farms processes about 800,000 to one million gallons of milk a week.Expenses facing the company include the theft of plastic <b>milk</b> <b>crates.</b> Rockview Farms wrote in support of California Assembly Bill 1583 saying that it purchases nearly 450,000 <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> annually {{at a cost of}} more than $1.7 million, yet police reports and investigations have found that <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> and plastic pallets are stolen and sold illegally to junk dealers/recyclers who then grind the plastic containers into chips to be resold for a lesser price.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> may {{have been influenced by}} the {{dimensions of}} the Tea chest. For all practical purposes, both hold similar internal volumes, but tea chests are designed for shipping over the open ocean.|$|R
50|$|Dairy mix is {{typically}} packaged in 2.5 gal bags, 1 gal jugs or half gallon cartons. Most dairies place these in <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> or boxes, {{depending on where}} or how they ship their product. These products are pasteurized under State and Federal guidelines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>crates</b> and bottle crates are {{a form of}} {{reusable}} packaging used to ship to retail stores and to return empty bottles to the bottler or packager. These are usually moulded plastic designs expected to make several round trip shipments. Wood structures are also used.|$|R

One night, Blondie attempts to repossess a car owned by King, and King and one of his associates assault him. While on a pornographic film set during a suggestive photo shoot, Jake knocks out King and his partner, takes King's keys, and repossesses his car. Jake has dinner with Jenny, and tells her that he originally quit racing after his wife passed away from illness while he raced in and won a time trial for the Indianapolis 500. When Jenny leaves to get more beer, Jake finds her hanging by a noose over a <b>milk</b> <b>crate,</b> and King warns him that he and Jenny will face consequences if Jake loses the upcoming drag race.

50|$|The {{lymphedema}} had {{a severe}} effect on Warren's {{personal life and}} health. He already weighed 300 lb {{before the onset of}} the condition and he suffered from high blood pressure and asthma. The swelling increased his weight to about 450 lb. Because his penis and testicles were enclosed by his gigantic scrotum, he was unable to urinate normally or to have sex. Simply keeping his scrotum under cover was a challenge in itself, which he eventually solved by wearing an upside-down full-size hooded sweatshirt over it with his legs in the sleeves. Traveling on buses required him to bring along a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> and a cushion on which to rest his scrotum during the journey. As travel was so difficult, he would spend {{most of his time in}} his apartment's living room watching television while propping his scrotum on top of the <b>milk</b> <b>crate.</b>|$|R

After Sonja entered the bathroom some time later, the attacker tried to rape her and began stabbing her with a knife.|$|R
30|$|Field {{work was}} {{conducted}} across four farms {{located in the}} Atherton Tablelands region (17 ° 16 ′S, 145 ° 53 ′E) of North Queensland over 3  days. All four farms had different farming and feed management practices {{including the use of}} a variety of hides (e.g. old car tyres or <b>milk</b> <b>crates,</b> etc.), time and frequency of feeding, pond fertilisation methods, water source, and supplemental feed provided.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers {{claim that}} this {{rectangular}} design has cut water use by 67% to 70%, according to one dairy, {{since there are no}} crates to be cleaned; the absence of dirty crates also reduces the risk of jugs carrying contamination. There is also the reduced cost with no crates to be stolen: Pennsylvania dairies alone spent US$6 million replacing <b>milk</b> <b>crates</b> in 2005, mostly from theft.|$|R
50|$|On July 5, 2006, workers began {{bulldozing}} {{the farm}} amidst protest {{and acts of}} civil disobedience. One protester chained himself to a bulldozer and another lay {{down in front of}} a bulldozer. Both were arrested. Two others were also arrested, one for throwing a <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> at a police officer and the other for assaulting a bulldozer driver. Ten people were arrested in total.|$|R

2500|$|Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, who {{returned}} to performing after Houdini's death, inherited his brother's effects and props. Houdini's will stipulated that all the effects should be [...] "burned and destroyed" [...] upon Hardeen's death. Hardeen sold much of the collection to magician and Houdini enthusiast Sidney Hollis Radner during the 1940s, including the water torture cell. Radner allowed choice pieces of the collection to be displayed at The Houdini Magical Hall of Fame in Niagara Falls, Ontario. In 1995, a fire destroyed the museum. The water torture cell's metal frame remained, and it was restored by illusion builder John Gaughan. Many of the props contained in the museum such as the mirror handcuffs, Houdini's original packing <b>crate,</b> a <b>milk</b> can, and a straitjacket, survived the fire and were auctioned in 1999 and 2008.|$|R

50|$|The Gyro UP was {{introduced}} in October 1985. It differs from the Gyro X by replacing {{the front and rear}} tie-down racks with a single heavy-duty baggage platform fixed directly to the rear engine pod, giving the appearance of a scooter pick-up truck. This platform has a rubber-mat loading area of 450 mm × 570mm that is rated for 30 kg. Honda claims it is sized for a 20 bottle beer crate, a container that is roughly similar to the plastic <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> common in other countries.|$|R

Strong well-conditioned trunk musculature has been forwarded as a counter measure towards reducing low-back injuries. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if strong well-conditioned trunk muscles relieve stresses encountered by the lumbar spine during stoop type lifting. Twelve male subjects (49. 7 ± 3. 7 yr) performed a session of stoop type lifting with a loaded <b>milk</b> <b>crate</b> (11. 5 kg), at 4 reps/min, for 15 min in accordance with the NIOSH lifting equation. Lateral fluoroscopic images were collected prior to and following the lifting session with the subjects positioned at the initiation (flexed trunk), mid-range, and completion of the lift (erect standing). The initial series of images were collected under a no-load condition, while the second series were collected with the subjects lifting the 11. 5 kg <b>milk</b> <b>crate.</b> Images were imported into AutoCAD where lumbar disc deformation and joint angles were measured by calculating changes in position of adjacent vertebra (L 3 - 4 and L 4 - 5). A reduction of deformation was deemed indicative of reduced stress. Trunk extension and flexion strength were measured with a Kin Com isokinetic dynamometer. Trunk flexion endurance was measured via a 60 s curl-up test. Trunk strength and endurance were compared to dis...|$|R
