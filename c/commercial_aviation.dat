5|$|Harding also {{wished to}} promote aviation, and Hoover again took the lead, {{convening}} a national conference on <b>commercial</b> <b>aviation.</b> The discussions focused on safety matters, inspection of airplanes, and licensing of pilots.

5|$|In December 2011, the FAA awarded $7.7 {{million to}} eight {{companies}} {{to advance the}} development of <b>commercial</b> <b>aviation</b> biofuels, with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel.

The research will test how the new fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie I asked the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to help him to {{establish}} an airline {{as part of his}} modernisation effort. According to the BBC News {{it is possible that the}} Emperor intended the creation of a quality national airline to help dispel impressions of Ethiopian poverty. In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a <b>commercial</b> <b>aviation</b> company in Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} for scheduled airline services. The British Airports Authority (BAA) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion pricing {{for all types of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>aviation.</b> In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy, with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. London-Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.|$|E

5|$|Diverse {{geographic}} destinations and cabin pressurisation alike on the Comet {{demanded the}} use of a high proportion of alloys, plastics, and other materials new to civil aviation across the aircraft in order to meet certification requirements. The Comet's high cabin pressure and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in <b>commercial</b> <b>aviation,</b> making its fuselage design an experimental process. At its introduction, Comet airframes would be subjected to an intense, high-speed operating schedule which included simultaneous extreme heat from desert airfields and frosty cold from the kerosene-filled fuel tanks, still cold from cruising at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, JAL debuted a Boeing777–300 (JA8941) with {{a special}} Oneworld livery to promote the airlines's entry to the global airline alliance. Previously this {{aircraft}} carried the Shingo Katori and the Saiyuki television livery. In 2008, JAL repainted a single Boeing 777–200 to have a green rather than red arc on its tail, along with a green origami airplane on the fuselage, and named it the Eco Jet, to highlight the company's efforts to reduce {{the environmental impact of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>aviation.</b> In 2009, JAL repainted JA8941 again, as well as a JTA 737-400 (JA8933) to promote Kobukuro and their new album Calling as well as a live concert tour in Okinawa and around Japan. This livery was released officially on 30 July 2009. It has since then been replaced {{with a special}} Doraemon livery.|$|E
5|$|In its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus {{estimated}} {{the demand for}} 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats : 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019. The market is estimated for two decades at more than 1,700 by Airbus and 700 by Boeing since 1999-2000, including freighters. In 2006, industry analysts Philip Lawrence of the Aerospace Research Centre in Bristol anticipated 880 sales by 2025 with Airbus having conducted the most extensive and thorough market analysis of <b>commercial</b> <b>aviation</b> ever undertaken, justifying its VLA plans to design the A380 by the spoke-hub distribution paradigm while Richard Aboulafia of the consulting Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia anticipated 400 {{with the rise of}} mid-size aircraft and market fragmentation reducing them to niche markets, making such plans unjustified in a point-to-point transit model.|$|E

The most fatalities in an aircraft collision occurred during 1977 in the Tenerife airport disaster when 583 people were killed. The {{greatest number}} of fatalities from a midair collision occurred at the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision, to the west of New Delhi, India on 12 November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard both the airplanes. The 11 September 2001 (9/11) coordinated attack of the World Trade Center claimed not only 157 passengers and crew, but an estimated additional 2,500 victims. In 2012, Boeing released a study of worldwide commercial jet airplane accidents between 1959 and 2011 reporting 1,798 accidents, 603 categorized as fatal, which accounted for 29,025 on-board fatalities and an additional 1,173 ground or non-commercial aircraft collision deaths.
