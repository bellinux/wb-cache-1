40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{mathematical}} models to explore the mixing and its related phenomena in converter bath. Specifically, first, a mathematical model of a physical model converter, which was scaled down to 1 / 6 th of a 30 t vessel, was developed in this study. A number of parameters were studied and their effects on the mixing time were recorded in a top <b>blown</b> <b>converter.</b> Second, a mathematical model for a <b>combined</b> top-bottom <b>blown</b> was built to investigate the optimization process. Then, a side tuyere was introduced in the <b>combined</b> top-bottom <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> and its effects on the mixing and wall shear stress were studied. Moreover, based on the above results, the kinetic energy transfer phenomena in a real converter were investigated by applying the mathematical models. A simplified model, in which the calculation region was reduced to save calculation compared to simulations of the whole region of the converter, was used in the mathematical simulation. In addition, this method was also used in the simulation of real converters. This approach makes it possible to simulate the Laval nozzle flow jet and the cavity separately when using different turbulence models. In the top <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> model, a comparison between the physical model and the mathematical model showed a good relative difference of 2. 5 % and 6. 1 % for the cavity depth and radius, respectively. In addition, the predicted mixing time showed a good relative difference of 2. 8 % in comparison to the experimental data. In an optimization of a <b>combined</b> top-bottom <b>blown</b> <b>converter,</b> a new bottom tuyere scheme with an asymmetrical configuration was found to be one of the best cases with respect to a decreased mixing time in the bath. An industrial investigation showed that the application effects of the new tuyere scheme yield a better stirring condition in the bath compared to the original case. Furthermore, the results indicated that the mixing time for a <b>combined</b> top-bottom-side <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> was decreased profoundly compared to a conventional <b>combined</b> top-bottom <b>blown</b> <b>converter.</b> It was found that the side wall shear stress is increased by introducing side blowing, especially in the region near the side blowing plume. For a 100 t converter in real, the fundamental aspects of kinetic energy transfer from a top and bottom gas to the bath were explored. The analyses revealed that the energy transfer is less efficient when the top lance height is lowered or the flowrate is increased in the top blowing operations. However, an inverse trend was found. Namely, that the kinetic energy transfer is increased when the bottom flowrate is increased in the current bottom blowing operations. In addition, the slag on top of the bath is found to dissipate 6. 6 %, 9. 4 % and 11. 2 % for the slag masses 5, 9 and 15 t compared to the case without slag on top of the surface of the bath, respectively.   QC 20151015 </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model for calculating the phosphorus distribution ratio between top-bottom <b>combined</b> <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> steelmaking slags and molten steel {{has been developed}} by coupling with a developed {{thermodynamic model}} for calculating mass action concentrations of structural units in the slags, i. e., CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -MnO-Al 2 O 3 -P 2 O 5 slags, based on the ion and molecule coexistence theory (IMCT). Not only the total phosphorus distribution ratio but also the respective phosphorus distribution ratio among four basic oxides as components, i. e., CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO, in the slags and molten steel can be predicted theoretically by the developed IMCT phosphorus distribution ratio prediction model after knowing the oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface or the Fe (t) O activity in the slags and the related mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples in the slags. The calculated mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples in the slags equilibrated or reacted with molten steel show that the calculated equilibrium mole numbers or mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples, rather than the mass percentage of components, can present the reaction ability of the components in the slags. The predicted total phosphorus distribution ratio by the developed IMCT model shows a reliable agreement with the measured phosphorus distribution ratio by using the calculated mass action concentrations of iron oxides as presentation of slag oxidation ability. Meanwhile, the developed thermodynamic model for calculating the phosphorus distribution ratio can determine quantitatively the respective dephosphorization contribution ratio of Fe (t) O, CaO + Fe (t) O, MgO + Fe (t) O, and MnO + Fe (t) O in the slags. A significant difference of dephosphorization ability among Fe (t) O, CaO + Fe (t) O, MgO + Fe (t) O, and MnO + Fe (t) O has been found as approximately 0. 0 pct, 99. 996 pct, 0. 0 pct, and 0. 0 pct during a <b>combined</b> <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> steelmaking process, respectively. There is a great gradient of oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface and in a metal bath when carbon content in a metal bath is larger than 0. 036 pct. The phosphorus in molten steel beneath the slag-metal interface can be extracted effectively by the comprehensive effect of CaO and Fe (t) O in slags to form 3 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 and 4 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 until the carbon content is less than 0. 036 pct during a top-bottom <b>combined</b> <b>blown</b> steelmaking process...|$|R

The phosphate capacity has {{a close relationship with}} the phosphate capacity index, whereas the logarithm of phosphate capacity is 12. 724 greater than that of phosphate capacity index at 1873 K (1600 degrees C). The developed phosphate capacity prediction model can be also used to predict the phosphate capacity index with reliable accuracy compared with the measured and the predicted phosphate capacity index of the slags by other models in literatures. The results from the IMCT phosphate capacity prediction model show that the comprehensive effects of iron oxides and basic components control the dephosphorization reaction with an optimal ratio of (pct FeO) /(pct Fe 2 O 3) as 0. 62. The determined contribution ratio of FetO, CaO+ FetO, MgO+ FetO, and MnO + FetO to the phosphate capacity or phosphate capacity index of the slags is approximately 0. 0 pct, 99. 996 pct, 0. 0 pct, and 0. 0 pct, respectively. The generated 2 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, 3 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, and 4 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 as products of dephosphorization reactions accounts for 0. 016 pct, 96. 01 pct, and 3. 97 pct of the phosphate capacity or phosphate capacity index of the slags, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work is to {{increase}} the knowledge of phenomena taking place during the initial stage in a top <b>blown</b> <b>converter.</b> The work has been done in a few steps resulting in four different supplements. Water model experiments have been carried out using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology. The system investigated was a fundamental top <b>blown</b> <b>converter</b> where an air jet was set to impinge on a water surface. The flow field of the <b>combined</b> <b>blown</b> case, where an air jet was introduced through a bottom nozzle, was also captured by the PIV. The work clearly showed that the flow field caused by an impinging top blown jet alone could not match that of the bottom blown case. The main re-circulation loop (or vortex) was investigated with respect to position and it was found that an increased flow rate pushes the center of the re-circulation loop downwards into the bath. However, for the top-blown case there is a point when the flow rate is too large to cause a distinguishable re-circulation loop since the jet becomes more plunging (i. e. penetrates deep into the bath) than impinging, with large surface agitation and splashing as a result. A numerical model with the same dimensions as the experimental system was then created. Three different turbulence models from the same family were tested: standard-, realizable- and a modified-(slight modification of one of the coefficients in order to produce less spreading of the air jet) k-ε turbulence model. It could be shown that for the family of k-ε turbulence models the difference in penetration depth was small and that the values corresponded well to literature data. However, {{when it comes to the}} position of the re-circulation loop it was shown that the realizable k-ε model produced better results when comparing the results to the experimental data produced from the PIV measurements, mentioned earlier. It was then shown how the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model could be coupled to thermodynamics databases in order to solve for both reactions and transport in the system. Instead of an air-water system, a gas-steel-slag system was created using the knowledge obtained in the previous simulation step described above. Reactions between gas-steel, gas-slag, steel-slag and gas-steel-slag were considered. Extrapolation of data from a few seconds of simulation was used for comparison to experimental data from the literature and showed reasonable agreement. The overall conclusion was that it is possible to make a coupling of the Thermo-Calc databases and a CFD software to make dynamic simulations of metallurgical processes such as a top-blown converter. A parametric study was then undertaken where two different steel grades were tested; one with high initial carbon content (3. 85 mass-%) and one with lower carbon content (0. 5 mass-%). The initial silicon content was held constant at 0. 84 mass-%. Different initial temperatures were tested and also some variation in initial dissolved oxygen content was tried. It was found that the rate of decarburization/desiliconization was influenced by the temperature and carbon concentration in the melt, where a high temperature as well as a high carbon concentration favors decarburization over desiliconization. It was also seen that the region affected by a lower concentration of alloys (or impurities) was quite small close to the axis where the impinging jet hits the bath. Add the oscillating nature of the cavity and it was realized that sampling from this region during an experiment might be quite difficult. QC 2010072...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{metallurgical}} {{processes are}} necessary {{for the production of}} steel grades with high quality standards. Most steelplants use them for the final refining of liquid steel. Changing the thermodynamic equilibrium by an increase of the total pressure is the principle for decarburisation and degassing. With an economic view on the vacuum treatment the kinetics of the physico-chemical reactions are particularly relevant. The kinetics largely determine the treatment time of the melt. To increase the decarburisation speed of chromium steel during the VOD process (vacuum oxygen decarburisation), it is possible to inject gaseous oxygen combined with oxidic powder.

Mechanisms of droplet generation and mechanisms of the effect of bottom blowing on droplet generation were investigated in a 2 -D water model, using high speed cinephotography.

The artist found that the soda-lime glass that he used to make the forms for this series had impurities in it that caused striations in the glass; these he felt, distracted from the appreciation of the sculptures. In subsequent series of fabricated glass sculptures Taylor created his forms in borosilicate glass, the same substance of which Pyrex laboratory glass is made.|$|R
5000|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1965 in Le Havre, France, Sidel {{has been developing}} packaging technologies for the beverage industry. In 1961 the company developed the first plastic bottle made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a container for edible oil and, later on, wine, milk and water. In 1973 Sidel released the first plastic HDPE (high-density polyethylene) bottle for milk, sterilised by ultra-heat treatment (UHT). In 1980 Sidel delivered its first PET blow moulding machine to the family-owned soft-drink company Barraclough in Great Britain. Sidel’s first international subsidiary opened in 1984 in Atlanta, USA. In the same year, Sidel also sold the first high-speed PET blow moulding machine. In the 1990s Sidel acquired the French companies Hema (1995), Cermex (1996) [...] and Gebo (1997). In 1997 Sidel introduced a system which <b>combines</b> <b>blow</b> moulding, filling and capping. In same year, the first Sidel dry preforms decontamination by H2O2 spray was launched with the Combi Disis. The development of an internal carbon-based coating in 1999 strengthened the barrier properties of PET packages to gases (O2 and CO2) and made PET-bottles usable for beer. In 2003 Sidel joined Tetra Laval and merged with the Italian company Simonazzi in 2005. Simonazzi was founded in 1850 and had its headquarters in Parma, Italy. In 2006, Sidel launched Predis™, its dry decontamination solution technology for preforms. In April 2013, Sidel announced the launch of a new company {{as part of the}} Sidel Group, Gebo Cermex. [...] Gebo Cermex focuses on engineering, line integration and end-of-line packaging. A partnership with Kortec was communicated in October 2013. The target of the co-operation is to develop new light-blocking PET milk bottles. In March 2014, the divestment of Swedish subsidiary, Tectubes, was announced.|$|R
40|$|Despite being {{ubiquitous}} in the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) of Canada, {{the role of}} snow in its energy and water budgets are still open to much speculation. This thesis presents a multi-scale analysis of the contribution of blowing snow to the hydrometeorology of the MRB. A climatology of adverse wintertime weather events is first presented and demonstrates that blowing snow events are rare within the forested sections of the MRB but become more frequent in the northern parts of the basin covered by Arctic tundra. It is these areas which experience the largest impacts of blowing snow transport and sublimation due to large-scale processes. To further assess the mesoscale and microscale effects of blowing snow to the northern regions of the MRB, {{the development of a}} bulk blowing snow model is then described. The single- and double-moment versions of the PIEKTUK blowing snow model are shown to produce equivalent results as a previous spectral version of the numerical model while operating about 100 times faster. The application of the double-moment PIEKTUK model (PIEKTUK-D) to a Canadian Arctic tundra site near the northern tip of the MRB reveals that blowing snow sublimation depletes ≈ 3 mm snow water equivalent (swe) from the snowpack over a period of 210 days during the winter of 1996 / 1997 at Trail Valley Creek, Northwest Territories. Various assumptions {{on the state of the}} background thermodynamic profiles and their evolution during blowing snow, however, can yield significantly higher (> 300 %) rates of sublimation over the same period. PIEKTUK-D is then coupled to the Mesoscale Compressible Community (MC 2) model for an interactive simulation of a ground blizzard at Trail Valley Creek. This coupled mesoscale simulation reveals that moistening and cooling of near-surface air associated with blowing snow sublimation is observed but mitigated in part by advective and entrainment processes. <b>Combined,</b> <b>blowing</b> snow sublimation and mass divergence are then shown to re...|$|R
2500|$|The {{band had}} {{recorded}} Blow Up Your Video (1988) with their original producers, Harry Vanda and George Young. It was a commercial success and sold more copies {{than the previous}} two studio releases <b>combined.</b> The <b>Blow</b> Up Your Video World Tour began in February 1988 in Perth, Australia. That April, {{on the eve of}} the North American leg of the tour, Malcolm Young announced that he was taking time off from touring, principally to begin recovery from his alcoholism. Another member of the Young family, their nephew, Stevie Young, temporarily took Malcolm's place on rhythm guitar. [...] Following the tour, drummer Simon Wright left the group to work on the upcoming Dio album Lock Up the Wolves, and was replaced by ex-Firm and Manfred Mann drum veteran Chris Slade, whom Malcolm remembered playing with Manfred Mann during an appearance in Sydney years earlier with Deep Purple and Free.|$|R
50|$|And {{as regards}} signation (the {{sign of the}} cross), in Western texts from {{as early as the}} Gelasian Sacramentary, the one gesture almost always precedes (or precedes and follows) the other, and their {{significance}} is often complementary if not identical. In Raban Maur's discussion of the baptismal liturgy, for example, the exsufflation is said to expel the devil, the signing to keep him from coming back. The two signs are frequently <b>combined,</b> the <b>blowing</b> done {{in the form of a}} cross, e.g. in the Syrian rite described by James of Edessa, in the modern Coptic rite, in the late 9th-century Ordo Romanus XXXI, in Wulfstan's Anglo-Saxon homilies and their Continental sources, in the 10th-century Ambrosian rites for catechumen and font, in the 11th-century North Italian catechumenal rites, in the 12th- through 15th-century English pontificals, in the Sarum Missal, and in the 13th-century Roman pontifical.|$|R
