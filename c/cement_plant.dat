40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} <b>cement</b> <b>plants</b> {{and their ability to}} shed or shift load to participate in demand response (DR). Relevant factors investigated include the various equipment and processes used to make cement, the operational limitations <b>cement</b> <b>plants</b> are subject to, and the quantities and sources of energy used in the cement-making process. Opportunities for energy efficiency improvements are also reviewed. The results suggest that <b>cement</b> <b>plants</b> are good candidates for DR participation. The cement industry consumes over 400 trillion Btu of energy annually in the United States, and consumes over 150 MW of electricity in California alone. The chemical reactions required to make cement occur only in the cement kiln, and intermediate products are routinely stored between processing stages without negative effects. <b>Cement</b> <b>plants</b> also operate continuously {{for months at a time}} between shutdowns, allowing flexibility in operational scheduling. In addition, several examples of <b>cement</b> <b>plants</b> altering their electricity consumption based on utility incentives are discussed. Further study is needed to determine the practical potential for automated demand response (Auto-DR) and to investigate the magnitude and shape of achievable sheds and shifts...|$|R

40|$|Alternative fuels {{are made}} up of {{mixtures}} of different wastes, such as industrial, municipal and hazardous wastes. These fuels need to have an appropriate chemical energy content which depends on the type of components and their organic content. An industry that is particularly well suited to the employment of alternative fuels is the cement industry. There are a number of factors that promote the use of alternative fuels in cement kilns. Of these factors, the most notable are: the high temperatures developed, the appropriate kiln length, the long period of time the fuel stays inside the kiln and the alkaline environment inside the kiln. There are a number of countries that use their own alternative fuels in <b>cement</b> <b>plants.</b> These fuels have different trade names and they differ in the amounts {{and the quality of the}} selected municipal and industrial waste fractions used. The fuels used should fall within the extreme values of parameters such as: minimum heating value, maximum humidity content, and maximum content of heavy and toxic metals. <b>Cement</b> <b>plants</b> in Poland also use alternative fuels. Within the Lafarge Group, the <b>cement</b> <b>plants</b> owned by Lafarge Poland Ltd. have initiated activities directed at promoting the wider use of alternative fuels. There are a number of wastes that can be incinerated as fuel in <b>cement</b> <b>plants.</b> Some that can be mentioned are: selected combustible fractions of municipal wastes, liquid crude-oil derived wastes, car tyres, waste products derived from paint and varnish production, expired medicines from the pharmaceutical industry and others. The experience gained by the <b>cement</b> <b>plants</b> of Lafarge <b>Cement</b> Poland Ltd confirms that such activities are economically and ecologically beneficial. The incineration of alternative fuels in <b>cement</b> <b>plants</b> is a safe method for the utilisation of waste that is ecologically friendly and profitable for the industrial plants and society alike.
