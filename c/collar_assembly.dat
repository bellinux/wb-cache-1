25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft of the bolt (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and <b>collar</b> <b>assembly.</b> During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E

A {{study was conducted to}} test the model with 55 blue collar workers of an automotive assembly line. Results indicate that the satisfaction of BPN in an industrial learning environment is systematically related to working conditions and employee potentials. The associations hint at the possibility of boosting employee potentials of blue <b>collar</b> <b>assembly</b> line workers and enhancing production quality through designing working and learning environments consistent with self-determination theory...|$|E
40|$|Assembly at the mother–bud neck of a {{filamentous}} collar containing five septins (Cdc 3, Cdc 10, Cdc 11, Cdc 12, and Shs 1) {{is necessary}} for proper morphogenesis and cytokinesis. We show that Cdc 10 and Cdc 12 possess GTPase activity and appropriate mutations in conserved nucleotide-binding residues abrogate GTP binding and/or hydrolysis in vitro. In vivo, mutants unable to bind GTP prevent septin collar formation, whereas mutants that block GTP hydrolysis do not. GTP binding-defective Cdc 10 and Cdc 12 form soluble heteromeric complexes with other septins both in yeast and in bacteria; yet, unlike wild-type, mutant complexes do not bind GTP and do not assemble into filaments in vitro. Absence of a p 21 -activated protein kinase (Cla 4) perturbs septin collar formation. This defect is greatly exacerbated when combined with GTP binding-defective septins; conversely, the septin <b>collar</b> <b>assembly</b> defect of such mutants is suppressed efficiently by CLA 4 overexpression. Cla 4 interacts directly with and phosphorylates certain septins in vitro and in vivo. Thus, septin collar formation may correspond to septin filament assembly, and requires both GTP binding and Cla 4 -mediated phosphorylation of septins...|$|E
50|$|Multi-jackbolt {{tensioners}} {{can be used}} on many {{press column}} applications, especially where large thread sizes are required. Thrust <b>collars</b> ease <b>assembly</b> and disassembly on large press columns, while greatly reducing critical problems such as thread galling and seizing. Multi-jackbolt tensioners are also used on tie-rods, bearing blocks, high-pressure piping, die cushions, cylinder ram bolting, and anchor bolts.|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the magnetic field}} at room temperature and at 1. 8 K on more than twenty, 1 -m long, single aperture LHC superconducting dipole models. The magnets feature either a 5 -block coil geometry or the baseline 6 -block geometry foreseen for the LHC. Comparison of warm and cold measurements show that the coil geometry is essentially unchanged during cooldown. We have therefore used mechanical measurements taken on the coil and <b>collars</b> during <b>assembly</b> to estimate the azimuthal coil length. Based on these measurements we show here that the sensitivity of allowed harmonics on coil size is in good agreement with the prediction obtained from the numerical model used for designing the LHC magnets...|$|R
25|$|Seeking {{experiences}} to write about, Alvin and Heidi Toffler {{spent the next}} five years as blue <b>collar</b> workers on <b>assembly</b> lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work. He compared his own desire for experience to other writers, such as Jack London, who in his quest for subjects to write about sailed the seas, and John Steinbeck, who went to pick grapes with migrant workers. In their first factory jobs, Heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked. Alvin became a millwright and welder. In the evenings Alvin would write poetry and fiction, but discovered he was proficient at neither.|$|R
