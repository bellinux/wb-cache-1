5000|$|Birdsville {{was known}} as Diamantina Crossing from 1881. [...] There {{are a number of}} {{different}} theories as to the origin of the name.

However, in 1882, G. and R. Wills, of Adelaide, misaddressed a <b>consignment</b> of <b>goods</b> as going to Birdsville and that name stuck. Another is that a man named Burt established a store and called it Burtsville which corrupted to Birdsville.

They are normally hollow and it is presumed that they were worn on a string or chain round the neck. Many have only images, often very finely carved, with no writing, while others have both.

The coal trader Schmitt in Iggelheimer Straße even had its own siding. Other freight handling involved mainly vegetables, livestock and building materials of all kinds.

40|$|Border inspection, and the {{challenge}} of deciding which of the tens of millions of consignments that arrive should be inspected, is a perennial problem for regulatory authorities. The objective of these inspections is to minimise the risk of contraband entering the country. As an example, for regulatory authorities in charge of biosecurity material, <b>consignments</b> of <b>goods</b> are classified before arrival according to their economic tariff number (Department of Immigration and Border Protection, 2016). This classification, perhaps along with other information, is used as a screening step to determine whether further biosecurity intervention, such as inspection, is necessary. Other information associated with consignments includes details such as the country of origin, supplier, and importer, for example. The choice of which consignments to inspect has typically been informed by historical records of intercepted material. Fortunately for regulators, interception is a rare event, however this sparsity undermines the utility of historical records for deciding which containers to inspect. In this paper we report on an analysis that uses more detailed information to inform inspection. Using quarantine biosecurity as a case study, we create statistical profiles using generalised linear mixed models and compare different model specifications with historical information alone, demonstrating the utility of a statistical modelling approach. We also demonstrate some graphical model summaries that provide managers with insight into pathway governance. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
