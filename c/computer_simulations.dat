5|$|The clumpy {{structure}} of the dust belt {{may be explained by}} gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 orbital resonance. In <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.3. Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between minor planets known as plutinos.|$|E
40|$|About the book: This book {{addresses}} possible {{applications of}} <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> to theory building in management and organizational theory. The key {{hypothesis is that}} modelling and <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> provide an environment to develop, test and articulate theoretical propositions. In general, <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> provides an experimental environment where researchers are able to play with symbolic representations of phenomena by modifying the model’s structure and activating or deactivating model’s parameters. This environment allows to both generating hypotheses to ex post explain observed phenomena or to ex ante generate distributions of unrealized events thereby envisioning areas for further empirical investigations. Under a methodological perspective, the volume investigates logics and techniques to design a research strategy grounded on <b>computer</b> <b>simulation.</b> In particular, the articles in the book concentrate on two different techniques, and philosophies, {{to set up a}} simulation study: System Dynamics, which is grounded on differential equations and feedback theory, and agent-based modeling. The book describes how <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> helps to look into research issues typical to strategic management and organizational theory. In this respect, such themes as firms’ diversification strategies, competitive strategy, rivalry and the impact of role dynamics on organizational performances are explored through the lenses of <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> models...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{methodology}} {{for the application}} of <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> to evacuation certification of aircraft is suggested. This involves the use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulation,</b> historic certification data, component testing, and full-scale certification trials. The methodology sets out a framework for how <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> should be undertaken in a certification environment and draws on experience from both the marine and building industries. In addition, a phased introduction of computer models to certification is suggested. This involves as a first step the use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> in conjunction with full-scale testing. The combination of full-scale trial, <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> (and if necessary component testing) provides better insight into aircraft evacuation performance capabilities by generating a performance probability distribution rather than a single datum. Once further confidence in the technique is established the requirement for the full-scale demonstration could be dropped. The second step in the adoption of <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> for certification involves the introduction of several scenarios based on, for example, exit availability, instructed by accident analysis. The final step would be the introduction of more realistic accident scenarios. This would require the continued development of aircraft evacuation modeling technology to include additional behavioral features common in real accident scenarios...|$|R

5|$|The {{longitudinal}} (or linear) dunes {{were initially}} {{presumed to be}} formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material. Recent <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> indicate that the dunes {{may be the result}} of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. These storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second when they reach the surface.|$|E

It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7km. Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving, which means its surface became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the contribution of a <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> to students’ learning of physics concepts (weight and mass).
