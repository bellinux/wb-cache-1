Input validation testing (IVT) checks user inputs {{to ensure that they}} conform to the program’s requirements, which is particularly important for software that relies on user inputs, including Web applications. A common technique in Web applications is to perform input validation on the client with scripting languages such as JavaScript. An insidious problem with client-side input validation is that end users can bypass this validation. Bypassing validation can reveal faults in the software, and can also break the security on Web applications, leading to unauthorized access to data, system failures, invalid purchases and entry of bogus data. We are developing a strategy called bypass testing to create IVT tests. This paper describes the strategy, defines specific rules and adequacy criteria for tests, describes a proof-of-concept automated tool, and presents initial empirical results from applying bypass testing. ...|$|E

40|$|The current {{world of}} post {{industrial}} value generation sees companies increasingly analyzing their internal operations against their external organizations to identify supply/demand fluctuations along the supply chain. Within these integrated relationships between {{internal and external}} parties in the supply chain, knowledge and information have become very important production resources. The existence and success of an increasing number of organizations strongly depend on their capabilities to utilize knowledge and information for profit generation. By managing more efficient information sharing, the volume of <b>company</b> <b>confidential</b> information passing through the supply chain increases, and this brings about more incidences of knowledge leakage and information leakage. A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2014 shows information security spending over the next 12 months would increase 60. 27 % in Asia and 48. 98 % in all regions. This emphasizes the importance of information privacy and therefore the necessity to study the information and knowledge leakage in integrated supply chain. The objectives of this study are to investigate the factors triggering information and knowledge leakage and create a mitigation framework to soften the impact of leakages on performance. The above objectives will be met by formulating and examining several hypotheses of a conceptualized information leakage (IL) and knowledge leakage (KL) framework. A case study derived from a structured interview is adopted as a methodology in this research. As a result, this paper contributes a novel theoretical model that characterizes information and knowledge leakage in an integrated supply chain. Therefore, it also adds new knowledge of managing information and knowledge leakage to supply chain management...|$|E
40|$|Modern society {{relies on}} and profits from {{well-balanced}} computerized systems. Each {{of these systems}} has a core mission such as the correct and safe operation of safety critical systems or innovative and effective operation of e-commerce systems. It might {{be said that the}} success of these systems depends on their mission. Although the concept of “well-balanced” has a slightly different meaning for each of these two categories of systems, both have to meet customer needs, deliver capabilities and functions according to expectations and generate revenue to sustain today’s highly competitive market. Tighter financial constraints are forcing safety critical systems away from dedicated and expensive communication regimes, such as the ownership and operation of dedicated communication links, towards reliance on third parties and standardized means of communication. As a consequence, knowledge about their internal structures and operations is more widely and publicly available and this can make them more prone to security attacks. These systems are, therefore, moving towards a remotely exploitable environment and the risks associated with this must be controlled. Risk management is a good tool for controlling risk but it has the inherent challenge of quantitatively estimating frequency and impact in an accurate and trustworthy way. Quantifying the frequency and impact of potential security threats requires experience-based data which is limited and rarely reusable because it involves <b>company</b> <b>confidential</b> data. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} publicly available data sources that can be used in risk estimation. This paper presents a risk estimation model that makes use of one such data source, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS Risk Level Estimation Model estimates a security risk level from vulnerability information as a combination of frequency and impact estimates derived from the CVSS. It is implemented as a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) topology, which allows not only the use of CVSS-based estimates but also the combination of disparate information sources and, thus, provides the ability to use whatever risk information that is available. The model is demonstrated using a safety- and mission-critical system for drilling operational support, the Measurement and Logging While Drilling (M/LWD) system...|$|E

These potential problems are predicted using Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. To evaluate the magnitudes of potential of problems, a measure named Level of Potential (/LoP/) is adopted. The severity of each problem is calculated based on the results of an empirical survey, which was conducted in Thailand. This paper examines the relations between the conditions of occurrence of problems and the profiles of the respondents. The problem “Using previous <b>company’s</b> <b>confidential</b> information ” is found to be the severest among all the investor countries considered; the second severest problem is “Unintentional sharing of confidential information ” while the problems of “Concealing faults made by friends”, “Lower priority to information security management”, “Lack of interest in information security management ” and “Lack of interest in information outside duties ” are also severe.

40|$|Portfolio Approach for Agro Enterprises in Sri Lanka The {{industrial}} sector has been continuously growing {{during the last}} few decades. The sector’s development is, nevertheless important as the sector has a high potential for contributing to poverty reduction. Therefore, agriculture, a principal sector in most developing countries should be accorded a high priority. Still the investments in agriculture, at both national and global levels have declined. But the performances shown in rubber based products, food and beverages hindered the reality by up lifting the figures and statistics. There is an urgent need for revising this trend with the evident of benefits highly gained through agricultural research and development investments in both public and private sector by industrial countries. It is more vital to bring the private sector in to the stage. The research conducted with the aim of analyzing agro enterprises in Sri Lanka and the objectives were lined up as identifying {{the extent to which the}} portfolio management is practiced in selected agro enterprises and their risk and return behavior in observing the context of portfolio approach. Five agricultural entities were purposively selected from the agro companies population registered under Colombo Stock Exchange. Two major companies were analyzed in detail and referring figures published by RAM ratings Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. And the risk and return behavior of all five companies were observed. The return on equity, debt to equity ratio, annual revenue, market capitalization and percentage change in annual equity were statistically analyzed through correlation. The figures of non agro companies also were cross analyzed to strengthen the findings. Results show that none of the agro companies researched do not use any specific portfolio approach in investing but rather use their own strategic approaches agreed and approved by the management. Almost all companies show significant positive relationship between market capitalization and annual revenue. In concluding, theories like capital asset pricing model, markovitz approach and random walk theory only concern the assets where it is not practicable in agro businesses only to rely upon assets. In addition, research findings reveal the importance of consideration of market capitalization and annual revenue of the company in assuring right investment decision. The <b>company</b> <b>confidential</b> data and the representativeness of corporate financial figures limited the study. It is recommended to repeat the research for subsectors. It is worth to research for new optimization techniques for investment decision which covers different project aspects...|$|E
40|$|A {{vital part}} in the {{transmission}} for Scania lorries is the shaft in the rear axle. Since this shaft {{is divided into two}} identical parts, these are termed half shafts. Close control of the manufacturing process of these is required. Influence of flow rate, temperature and polymer concentration of the quenchant was investigated. An important controlling factor is the cooling rate used in the hardening process. This factor was selected for investigation in the present study. It was found that high flow rate, low temperature and low polymer concentration gives high cooling rates. Further investigation was performed how the residual stresses, surface hardness and the case depth of the half shafts were affected by the cooling rate. The results show that residual stresses are particularly affected by the cooling rate. Higher cooling rates results in higher residual stresses. Since residual stresses are important for fatigue lifer, a fatigue study was also undertaken. Five half shafts were quenched with a polymer concentration of 5 %, and another five with 15 %. All ten half shafts were fatigue tested in torsion, using a Scania standardized method. The shafts were loaded in torsion torque with <b>company</b> <b>confidential</b> amplitude, mean equal to zero number of cycles to failure was recorded. In normal production the half shafts are quenched with 10 % polymer concentration. No tests with a polymer concentration of 10 % were carried out in this investigation since results from this concentration are available from earlier studies. Residual stresses were measured using a relatively new method developed by Scania, called the core drilling method. A 20 cm long portion of the shaft was center drilled in steps, gradually increasing the drill diameter. After each step, the relaxation of surface strain was measured in the longitudinal and transversal directions. Having obtained these data, stresses can be calculated. Residual stresses were also measured by x-ray diffraction. Only surface stresses are obtained in this way, however. These measurements were made {{for each of the three}} polymer concentrations. An attempt was also made on trying to simulate the stress formation in the shafts during the heat treatment with FEM and also to calculate the residual stresses after the treatment. Results from the measurements were then compared with the FEM calculated results. Since the number of tested shafts is small, results are not statistically relevant. One may conclude, though, that fatigue life increases with increasing cooling rate, i. e. with decreasing polymer concentration. The fatigue life requirement for all tested shafts was fulfilled. The compressive residual stresses for 5 % and 10 % polymer concentration are of same magnitude and higher than for those quenched with 15 % polymer concentration. The result also shows that the cooling rate does not affect the surface hardness, nor the case depth...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is {{to explain the}} meaning of the {{expression}} "non- competition clause" and to analyse its legal regulation in Czech labour law. The reason why I chose this topic is that non-competition clause is a very dynamic subject with a lot of changes in a historical point of view as you can see above. First of all, non-competition clause is an instrument of labour law which protects an employer against the abuse of the <b>company's</b> <b>confidential</b> information, knowledge and other know-how by the employee. According to the Czech legislation, non- competition clause means a voluntary agreement between employer and employee whose purpose is to protect employer's interests by reducing employee's job opportunities which would have a competitive character to the employer after the determination of an employment with the employee. There are several conditions need to be achieved in order to conclude a valid non- competition clause. For example, this contract needs to be agreed in writing. Secondly, the non-competition clause may be valid for only a certain period of time, not exceeding one year. Moreover, an employer is obliged to pay the employee some kind of a financial compensation every month. The amount of this compensation needs to be at least one average monthly salary of the employee. This [...] ...|$|R

It allows employers to observe what employees do {{on the job and}} review employee communications, including e-mail and internet activity that employees consider private. In a survey done among the software development organizations in Sri Lanka, it was found that majority of the companies use some means of electronic technology to monitor their employees. Most of the time, employee perception towards electronic monitoring at work, contradicts with the need for law enforcement within the organization as intended by the top management. Employers justify electronic monitoring at workplace in terms of protecting the <b>company’s</b> <b>confidential</b> information, preventing the misuse of the organizational resources while uplifting the quality of work and productivity. On the other hand, the mutual trust that should be there between the employer and the employee is brought into question by such monitoring. The research results presented in this paper are based on a study that investigated electronic monitoring in multiple perspectives from the view point of software professionals in Sri Lanka. The study focused on analyzing managerial incentives for electronic monitoring at workplace, to find how it could significantly influence organizational IT security policy making. The research was based on an empirical study with a structured questionnaire, utilizing disproportionate stratified random sampling.
