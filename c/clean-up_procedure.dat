40|$|A {{clean-up}} {{method for}} organochlorine compounds in fatty samples based on normal-phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) is described. To this end, an existing <b>clean-up</b> <b>procedure</b> which uses column switching for {{the separation of}} organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the fat matrix was simplified to a single silica LC column procedure. The use of an LC column packed with 3 μm silica enables complete fat/OCP separation in a total fraction volume of 12 ml, and results in a fully automated <b>clean-up</b> <b>procedure</b> that takes only 32 min per sample. The method showed average recoveries of 80 - 110 % in the concentration range of 1 - 510 μg/kg, with relative standard deviations of less than 10 %.

40|$|Abstract — In {{preparation}} of samples for chromatographic determination of ochratoxin A, two types of columns were used for sample cleanup (SPE and immunoaffinity columns). The first method consisted of liquid-liquid extraction {{with a mixture of}} chloroform and phosphoric acid, followed by ion-exchange cleanup on Waters Oasis MAX columns. The second method consisted of extraction with a mixture of water and methanol, followed by LCTech OtaCLEAN immunoaffinity column cleanup. Recoveries of the methods were determined at three levels in three repetitions for maize flour, and they were 84 % (%RSD = 19. 2) for the first method of sample preparation and 101 % (%RSD = 2. 2) for the second method. Values of LOQ for OTA were 0. 25 and 1. 00 μg/kg for the IAC and SPE clean-up procedures, respectively. Both methods comply with present regulations, but the MAX sample <b>clean-up</b> <b>procedure</b> should be used as an alternative, since the immunoaffinity column <b>clean-up</b> <b>procedure</b> is characterized by better reproducibility, accuracy, and efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Organoclorine {{pesticides}} (OCP) are {{the first}} class of compounds of synthetic pesticides introduced in agricultural and civil uses to counteract noxious insects and insect-born disease. In general they are lipophilic compounds with noticeable chemical and environmental stability. They tend to concentrate in the higher trophic organisms, as they amplify through the food chain. Food is generally recognized as {{the main source of}} human intake of pesticides, their metabolites and their residues. Preparation of samples, especially in food samples for quantitative analysis of organochlorined pesticides has an important role in recognizing the real levels. For the analysis of these micro-trace compounds in food samples is a constant search for new analytical methods.
