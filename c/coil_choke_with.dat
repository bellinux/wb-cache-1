50|$|Some DIY {{car audio}} hobbyists use <b>choke</b> <b>coils</b> <b>with</b> car audio systems (specifically in the wiring for a subwoofer, to remove high {{frequencies}} from the amplified signal).|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the design and {{construction}} of component parts of resistance saw. Mechanical parts consist of a movable bracket and a taut cutting wire of Constantan. Electrical parts are designed to supply and control temperature of the cutting wire. The current intensity in the cutting wire is compared with the required current intensity. The difference of these two measurements is fed into a PI - controller. The next part is a PWM generator which generates the square wave signal. The pulse ratio of this signal is proportional to the required temperature of the cutting wire. This signal switches a switching converter that consists of a power transistor P-MOSFET IRF 5210 and a diode MBR 20100 CT. <b>Choking</b> <b>coil</b> <b>with</b> a ferrite E core and with the cutting wire is connected to the output of the converter...|$|R
50|$|MPP cores are {{primarily}} used in inductors {{that require a}} core to have higher saturation point while maintaining other valuable magnetic properties. A standard MPP core saturates at around 7500 Gauss. A ferrite core saturates at around 4500 Gauss. Molypermalloy powder cores are commonly used in the making of: flyback transformers, resonant circuits, quartz filters, loading <b>coils,</b> <b>choke</b> <b>coils,</b> pulse transformers, and other industrial and military circuits.|$|R

40|$|The {{asphyxia}} by suffocation (<b>choking)</b> <b>with</b> {{foreign bodies}} are dramatic. Among these, the <b>choking</b> <b>with</b> food {{are responsible for}} most of these deaths.
