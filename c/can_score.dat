5|$|In the ride's {{narrative}} of events preceding those that occur during the ride, King Adelsten entered {{the mountain to}} fight a dragon called Ormaar. During the battle, the king lost his crown. Stansein, one of the king's servants, guides riders through the mountain to find and retrieve the crown. Throughout the ride, riders <b>can</b> <b>score</b> points by hitting objects on the screen with their light guns. At the end, the highest scores are placed in the 'Wonder Mountain's Guardian Hall of Fame'.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} player's turn batting or plate {{appearance is}} complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball {{that results in}} the team's third out, {{even if it is}} recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus <b>can</b> <b>score</b> at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.|$|E
5|$|Eleven goaltenders {{have scored}} {{a total of}} {{fourteen}} goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper <b>can</b> <b>score</b> by either shooting the puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; {{in the case of}} own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals.|$|E

5|$|Konami, who had {{distributed}} the original Q*bert to Japanese arcades in 1983, produced {{a game with}} the title Q*bert for MSX computers in 1986, released in Japan and Europe. However, the main character is a little dragon, and the mechanics are based on Q*bert's Qubes. The player once again turns around colored cubes by jumping from cube to cube, {{trying to reach the}} displayed target pattern. Contrary to Mylstar's arcade game, each of the 50 stages has a different pattern of cubes, in addition to the known rule extensions in later stages. The game also features a competitive 2-player mode, where each side is assigned a different pattern, and the players <b>can</b> <b>score</b> points either by completing their pattern first, or by pushing the other off the board.|$|E
5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks <b>can</b> <b>score</b> points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
25|$|A related though {{different}} style of bidding {{is for the}} players to bid individually, and partners' bids are then summed. The winning bid only decides trump; both (or all) teams' bids become their contract, meaning any team <b>can</b> <b>score</b> or be set. This creates a more balanced game.|$|E

25|$|The dealer scores {{his hand}} last {{and then turns}} the cards in the crib face up. These cards are then scored by the dealer as an {{additional}} hand, also {{in conjunction with the}} starter card. Unlike the dealer's own hand, the crib cannot score a four-card flush, but it <b>can</b> <b>score</b> a five-card flush with the starter.|$|E
25|$|Sudden {{death has}} been {{perceived}} as a particularly poor fit for gridiron football because the process gives an inherent advantage to the team who gains possession of the ball: they <b>can</b> <b>score</b> and end the game immediately (even by driving a relatively short distance into field goal range and then kicking a field goal), but the team on defense cannot (other than through far rarer scoring strategies such as the pick-six or the safety) score immediately.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows that}} the most {{effective}} field placements for aggressive fast bowling are to pack the outfield and the slips cordon and gully since these are the positions in which the batsman {{is most likely to}} be caught. Placing fielders in the outfield has the additional benefit of limiting the number of places where a batsman <b>can</b> <b>score</b> a boundary. Other close fielding positions such as silly mid on/off and the various midwicket and cover positions are generally redundant.|$|E

25|$|The right {{hippocampus}} {{is clearly}} necessary for familiarity in spatial tasks, whereas the left hippocampus {{is necessary for}} familiarity-based recollection in verbal tasks. Some researchers claim the hippocampus {{is important for the}} retrieval of memories, whereas adjacent cortical regions can support familiarity-based memories. These memory decisions are made based on matching already-existing memories (before the onset of pathology) to the current situation. According to Gilboa et al., patients with localized hippocampal damage <b>can</b> <b>score</b> well on a test if it is based on familiarity.|$|E
25|$|Three hoops {{are placed}} {{on either side of}} the pitch of differing heights (0.91m, 1.37m and 1.83m), placed two broomsticks apart (2.34 m). Chasers and keepers <b>can</b> <b>score</b> by {{throwing}} the quaffle through any one of the hoops, from either front or back, gaining ten points for their team per score. Any player experiencing a knock-out effect from either dismounting their broomstick or getting hit with a bludger must touch with any part of their body excluding the broom any one of their hoops before returning to play.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} version of pinochle involves a partial deal of twelve cards to both players in sets of four, leaving a stock of 24 cards. A player <b>can</b> <b>score</b> one meld after each trick won {{of the first}} 12 tricks. Melded cards can even be used to win tricks. After each trick, players draw one card from the stock into their hand starting with the trick-winning player. For the last 12 tricks, melds are taken into each player's hand and are no longer announced by the player who wins the trick. The traditional trick-taking rules apply only for these last 12 tricks.|$|E

The testing process gauges the claimant’s ability to perform up to 17 activities; these activities are {{set out on the}} ESA claim form. For each activity, a claimant <b>can</b> <b>score</b> 15, 9, 6 or 0 points: the more severe their disability, the more points they will score. Points are scored by having physical impairments, mental ones or a mixture of the two (if they are likely to significantly affect the claimant's ability to work). In order to be entitled to ESA, a person will need to score at least 15 points in total.|$|E
25|$|A team <b>can</b> <b>score</b> a {{field goal}} by {{shooting}} the ball through the basket being defended by the opposition team during regular play. A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two points if shot from {{in front of the}} line. A team can also score via free throws, which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. The team with the most points {{at the end of the}} game wins, but additional time (overtime) is mandated when the score is tied at the end of regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by passing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). It is a violation to lift, or drag, one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.|$|E

He finished the season playing in the 1981 Scottish Cup Final side, which ended in a 4–1 defeat to Rangers after a replay. Milne was now being described by manager Jim McLean as [...] "potentially... the most exciting player in Scotland", describing Milne as a [...] "winger with pace who <b>can</b> <b>score</b> goals".

500|$|According to Rowson, White's first {{advantage}} is that, [...] "The {{advantage of the}} first move has some similarities with the serve in tennis in that White <b>can</b> <b>score</b> an 'ace' (for instance with a powerful opening novelty), he has {{more control over the}} pace and direction of the game, and he has a 'second serve' in that when things go wrong his position is not usually losing." [...] Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, [...] "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players." [...] Third, some players are able to use the initiative to [...] "play a kind of powerful 'serve and volley' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess." [...] Fourth, [...] "If White wants to draw, it is often not so easy for Black to prevent this. This {{advantage is}} particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition, because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether White is bluffing." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the last}} day of the 2013 January {{transfer}} window, Morison signed for Championship side Leeds United as part of a swap deal. The transfer involved Luciano Becchio moving to Norwich, as well as Norwich paying Leeds a [...] "further undisclosed sum". On signing Morison, the then-Leeds manager Neil Warnock said that – [...] "Steve meets all the requirements of the striker we've been looking to bring in. For me, he is a player who has everything. He <b>can</b> <b>score</b> goals from anywhere – whether it's 25 yards or a tap-in – he has pace, and he has all the attributes you want". He made his Leeds debut on 9 February 2013, playing the whole match in the club's 2–2 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Morison scored his first goal for the club on his home debut on 20 February, netting the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Blackpool. He scored twice for Leeds in the club's 2–2 draw against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on 9 March.
