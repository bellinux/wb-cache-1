The study has been conducted in an urban settlement in the Ikorodu – Epe region to develop and optimize a suitable propagation model based on the existing propagation models. The proposed propagation models are the Free Space Path Loss Propagation Model, Okumura – Hata Model, COST 231 <b>Model,</b> <b>SUI</b> <b>Model</b> and Ericsson Model.

Animal <b>models</b> of <b>SUI</b> in the rat include vaginal distention as simulated birth trauma, pudendal nerve crush or transection, urethral sphincter injury by electrocauterization, transabdominal urethrolysis, periurethral botulinum-A toxin injection, and pubo-urethral ligament transection. Functional and histopathological changes in the continence mechanism after injury are different between models. CONCLUSIONS:　Using animal models for sensory neurons, intrathecal and intravenous administration of certain drugs can be tested whether they affect the bladder afferent pathways from the spinal cord to the PAG.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the binational state model is and should be {{considered}} as a <b>model</b> <b>sui</b> generis. Concentrating on three levels of analysis (recognition, autonomy, and authority i. e the majority prolem), an operational definition of binationalism allows for an idealtypical discussion of the homogeneity problem and the question of state sovereignty, showing that the problem of power imbalance (assymetry) is, in fact, a theoretical (and concrete) impasse, leading usually to the conclusion of "impossibility" of the binational state construction. However, an attempt to define the aforesaid symmetry/asymmetry (as drawn from Constraint Theory) in terms of stability of outcomes rather than in terms of power exclusively, offers a perspective that does not condemn the binational state model as fatally precarious...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays the Worldwide Interoperability of Microwave Access (WiMAX) {{technology}} becomes {{popular and}} receives growing acceptance as a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) system. WiMAX has potential success in its line-of-sight (LOS) and non line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions which operating below 11 GHz frequency. There {{are going to}} be a surge all over the world for the deployment of WiMAX networks. Estimation of path loss is very important in initial deployment of wireless network and cell planning. Numerous path loss (PL) models (e. g. Okumura Model, Hata Model) are available to predict the propagation loss, but they are inclined to be limited to the lower frequency bands (up to 2 GHz). In this thesis we compare and analyze five path loss models (i. e.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the international diffusion of business cycle {{on the basis}} of a rigorous dynamic microeconomic foundation. The seminal work of Laursen and Metzler (1950) suggests that the employment-isolation effect under the flexible exchange rate system is imperfect even if international capital mobility is completely prohibited. Assuming a small <b>country</b> <b>model</b> instead of the two <b>country</b> <b>model</b> by Laursen and Metzler (1950), we obtain the following results: (i) The business fluctuation of the world economy diffuses to the small country through a change in the inflation rate resulting from the change in the real exchange rate. In this sense, the employment isolation is imperfect. (ii) Domestic monetary expansion does not necessarily improve the employment level. This is because the depreciation of the real exchange rate (worsened terms of trade) should always be compensated by the lowered inflation rate and thus reduces the consumption demand...|$|R
