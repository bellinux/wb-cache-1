50|$|Like many similar venues, Twinlakes {{is divided}} into {{geographic}} 'zones' to help visitors find their way around. However, unlike other places {{there seems to be}} little similarity between the individual attractions within each zone. Attractions at present include: small zoo, falconry <b>centre,</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, log flume, assault course, toboggan slide, go karts, and a boating lake. A miniature railway with a Wild West style transports visitors between various parts of the park.|$|E

Pinch and zoom operates when the user touches the interactive screen with two fingers thus utilizing {{the function of the}} <b>centre</b> mouse <b>roller</b> for Windows XP, Vista and 7.|$|R
50|$|While working, {{motor drives}} the hanger of the {{grinding}} roller to rotate through V pulley and <b>centre</b> bearing. The <b>roller,</b> which is hung by bearing and pendulum shaft, will roll along {{the inner circle}} of the roll ring while the hanger is rotating. A dust removal blower will generate negative pressure at the inlet and outlet of the grinder to prevent dust and radiating the heat in the machine.|$|R
50|$|With {{the cost}} of {{aspiring}} to full Grand Prix racing prohibitive, they instead aimed ERA's efforts at the smaller voiturette—1500cc supercharged—class of motor racing, the Formula 2 equivalent of the day. Humphrey Cook financed the operation—using the wealth from the family drapery business, Cook, Son & Co., of St Paul's Churchyard, London. Berthon {{was responsible for the}} overall design of the cars, while Mays became its principal driver—having already successfully raced several other makes including Vauxhall, Bugatti and Riley.A new chassis was conceived by British designer Reid Railton (who had also successfully designed the Bluebird land speed record cars for Malcolm Campbell) and was constructed by Thomson & Taylor at Brooklands. The engine was based on the well-proven Riley six-cylinder unit, albeit this was modified in a number of significant ways. A stronger forged crankshaft with a large <b>centre</b> Hyatt <b>roller</b> bearing was made and an entirely new aluminium cylinder head designed. The engine was supercharged using a bespoke supercharger designed by Murray Jamieson who had worked with Mays and Berthon on the White Riley. The ERA engine was designed around three capacities—a base 1500cc, an 1100cc and also was capable of being expanded up to 2000 cc. It ran on methanol and in its 1500cc form was capable of producing around 180-200 bhp and in excess of 250-275 bhp in 2000cc form.|$|R
5000|$|Notable {{commercial}} outlets {{include the}} first ParknShop Hong Kong Superstore, which was opened in 1996 in Whampoa Garden Phase 12 with a floor space of 4200 m2; , {{there are over}} 50 superstores in Hong Kong. Also, The Whampoa is a 110 m-long boat-shaped shopping centre built in the original No. 1 Dry Dock, in Phase 6. During the 1980s and 1990s, the structure housed a playground {{on the top and}} [...] "deck" [...] level, seafood restaurants, a cinema on other floors above ground levels; the department store Yaohan on ground and basement level, and an indoor family theme park (開心一號）with an arcade game <b>centre</b> and a <b>roller</b> skating rink on lower basement level. In late 1990s, the department store was taken over by JUSCO department store. The JUSCO department store was renamed to AEON in 2013, to be consistent with the name change adopted by its parent company in Japan. In May 2016, the department store was renovated and renamed as AEON STYLE after its reopening in September the same year.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{conventional}} wheel {{with a series}} of rollers attached to its circumference. These rollers typically each have an axis of rotation at 45° to the plane of the wheel and at 45° to a line through the <b>centre</b> of the <b>roller</b> parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel. A typical configuration is the four-wheeled one of the URANUS omni-directional mobile robot (pictured) or a wheel chair with Mecanum wheels (similar to that pictured). By alternating wheels with left and right-handed rollers, {{in such a way that}} each wheel applies force roughly at right angles to the wheelbase diagonal the wheel is on, the vehicle is stable and can be made to move in any direction and turn by varying the speed and direction of rotation of each wheel. Moving all four wheels in the same direction causes forward or backward movement, running the wheels on one side in the opposite direction to those on the other side causes rotation of the vehicle, and running the wheels on one diagonal in the opposite direction to those on the other diagonal causes sideways movement. Combinations of these wheel motions allow for vehicle motion in any direction with any vehicle rotation (including no rotation at all).|$|R
