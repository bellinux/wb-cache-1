5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is a much}} less approachable bird than the Eurasian rock pipit. It is warier than its {{relative}} and if approached it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the rock pipit typically travels only a short distance, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> before it alights.|$|E
5|$|Although most flies {{live and}} fly <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> {{a few are}} known to fly at heights and a few like Oscinella (Chloropidae) {{are known to be}} {{dispersed}} by winds at altitudes of up to 2000ft and over long distances. Some hover flies like Metasyrphus corollae have been known to undertake long flights in response to aphid population spurts.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{is used in}} {{the poultry}} {{industry}} to asphyxiate birds, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.|$|E

5|$|Its {{nesting site}} is more {{important}} than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the habitat of the black-throated blue warbler. The black-throated blue warbler is an open-nesting species, that nests very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> so it has to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is a much}} more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short distance, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> before it alights, whereas its {{relative}} is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela actively defends food trees, {{engaging in}} aggressive bill-wiping both {{in response to}} a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree. It is very antagonistic even towards its own species; the males fight by grappling in mid-air and falling <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> before disengaging. It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy, though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species.|$|E

5|$|This bird {{can be seen}} to perch in both {{shrubbery}} {{and even}} trees, something characteristic of the forest rails. The grey-necked wood rail rarely flies, although when it is flushed out, it will generally move to a branch <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> If it is being observed, it is generally cautious.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E
50|$|The diet {{consists}} of small mammals, such as mouse opossums (Marmosa), mice, birds, lizards, and frogs. Juveniles tend <b>to</b> remain <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> feed on small frogs and lizards.|$|R
50|$|Striated pardalotes feed on {{insects and}} insect larvae. They usually {{do so in}} the high foliage of {{eucalypt}} trees, but may come <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> where there are lower shrubs.|$|R
50|$|High wing aircraft, {{where the}} wing {{is located on}} top of the fuselage, are {{configured}} more safely from a wing strike perspective. Low wing aircraft have <b>the</b> wing <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The black drongo {{is found}} {{predominantly}} in open country and usually perches and hunts <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> They are mostly aerial predators of insects but also glean {{from the ground}} or off vegetation. They are found as summer visitors to northeastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan but are residents from the Indus Valley until Bangladesh and into India and Sri Lanka. Some populations show seasonal movements that are poorly understood. The black drongo {{can be found in}} savannas, fields, and urban habitats.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, it {{has been}} noted that during {{migration}} the birds may fly <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> than normal; possibly foraging for insects. There is speculation that feeding also occurs at higher altitudes.|$|R
30|$|Consequently, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} the {{quantized}} pairwise gossip scheme summarized by (8) during the gossip stage as this results in a sequence that is <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> truth sequence of {R(k)}_k.|$|R
50|$|Females tend <b>to</b> fly <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{in search}} of {{suitable}} larval food plants, and if already mated, will signal their unavailability in flight by raising the abdomen and lowering <b>the</b> wings <b>to</b> display <b>the</b> sphragis.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Nigersaurus are grouped within the subfamily Nigersaurinae {{of the family}} Rebbachisauridae, {{which is part of}} the sauropod superfamily Diplodocoidea. Nigersaurus was probably a browser, and fed with its head <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The region of its brain that detected smell was underdeveloped, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a riparian habitat, and its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other dinosaurian megaherbivores, as well as large theropods and crocodylomorphs.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the blackmouth {{catshark}} {{is one of}} the most abundant sharks over the upper and middle continental slope. It is nomadic in nature and may be found alone or in groups. Relatively slow, this shark swims with strong eel-like (anguilliform) undulations of its body. It often cruises just above the sea floor, perhaps taking advantage of the ground effect (a reduction in the drag on a wing when <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground)</b> to save energy. It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom. Known predators of the {{blackmouth catshark}} include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) and the European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus). Parasites that have been documented from this species include the tapeworm Ditrachybothridium macrocephalum and the protist Eimeria palavensis.|$|E

50|$|Shastri {{was killed}} in a train {{accident}} on 23 November 1977. Shastri gave his seat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man sleeping in the bunk below him, a sign of respect in Hindu culture as the lower bunk is <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> man in the bunk above him survived, while Shastri lost his life. He was survived by his wife and two children.|$|R
50|$|The {{object of}} Sky Diver is {{to jump out}} of a plane, release a {{parachute}} and land on <b>the</b> landing pad. <b>To</b> get higher points, the player must release <b>the</b> parachute <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> player has nine jumps. If the landing pad is missed, the player loses points. The highest score possible is 99 points (11 points maximum per jump).|$|R
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E
5|$|All swifts feed on insects {{caught in}} flight, and the Pacific swift has been {{recorded}} as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught {{a wide variety of}} insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts additional lift. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored body fat.|$|E
50|$|This kind {{of ground}} effect is easily {{illustrated}} {{by taking a}} tarpaulin out on a windy day and holding it <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground: it can be observed that when <b>close</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>the</b> tarp will be drawn towards <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> This is due to Bernoulli's principle; as <b>the</b> tarp gets <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>the</b> cross sectional area available for the air passing between it and <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> shrinks. This causes <b>the</b> air <b>to</b> accelerate {{and as a result}} pressure under the tarp drops while the pressure on top is unaffected, and together this results in a net downward force. The same principles apply to cars.|$|R
50|$|Yucca schidigera {{is a small}} {{evergreen}} tree {{growing to}} 5 m tall, with a dense crown of spirally arranged bayonet-like leaves {{on top of a}} conspicuous basal trunk. The bark is gray-brown, being covered with brown dead leaves near the top, becoming irregularly rough and scaly-to-ridged <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> leaves are 30-150 cm long and 4-11 cm broad at the base, concavo-convex, thick, very rigid, and yellow-green to blue-green in color.|$|R
50|$|Platform beds {{which might}} be {{recognized}} as more accurate representations of today's platform beds were better defined as loft beds. The beds were originally situated high off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> allow for more living space below. Over time <b>the</b> beds moved <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>to</b> their present placement.|$|R
