5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|Fort Ricasoli {{was built}} between 1670 and 1698 {{commanding}} the eastern {{arm of the}} Grand Harbour. It has an irregular plan following the coastline, with bastions, <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> ravelins. The fort was improved {{later on in the}} 18th century. Fort Saint Angelo was also extensively modified in the 1690s, when it was upgraded with the building of various batteries and other defences.|$|E

40|$|The Iron <b>Curtain</b> <b>and</b> Its Heritage in the Context of Transformations of the Borderland of Czechia in the Second Half of the 20 th Century This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the Iron <b>Curtain</b> <b>and</b> its heritage, which is related how the Iron Curtain is commemorated to us today, {{and how we can}} {{look at the history of}} the Czech borderland affected by this former barrier. The thesis first introduced the phenomenon of the Iron <b>Curtain</b> <b>and</b> the problem of defining the borders. Then there is the form of discussion with the literature discussed how the Czech borderland changed by the Iron <b>Curtain</b> <b>and</b> its subsequent fall, and what was in this context of the research. It is discussed what is heritage of the Iron <b>Curtain,</b> <b>and</b> its possible use. Own research here is established at first, which is the comments of the Iron <b>Curtain</b> today, <b>and</b> what we can say these comments. Another part of the thesis is focused about the presentation the past of the Iron <b>Curtain,</b> <b>and</b> what people, visitors to the Museum of the Iron Curtain perceive about it. Different types of interviews are detected another interesting finding information on the borderland and the influence of the Iron Curtain.

5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, {{under the door}} of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace {{initially}} panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> out of the second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind {{the rest of his}} team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

5|$|Carus's death, amid a {{successful}} war with Persia and in mysterious circumstances – he was believed (perhaps {{as a result}} of later Diocletianic propaganda) to have been struck by lightning – left his sons Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from his post in Gaul as imperial commissioner and arrived there by January 284, becoming legitimate Emperor in the West. Numerian lingered in the East. The Roman withdrawal from Persia was orderly and unopposed. The Sassanid king Bahram II could not field an army against them as he was still struggling to establish his authority. By March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa (Homs) in Syria; by November, only Asia Minor. In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health: he issued the only extant rescript in his name there, but after he left the city, his staff, including the prefect (Numerian's father-in-law, and as such the dominant influence in the Emperor's entourage) Aper, reported that he suffered from an inflammation of the eyes. He traveled in a closed coach from then on. When the army reached Bithynia, some of the soldiers smelled an odor emanating from the coach. They opened its <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> inside they found Numerian dead. Both Eutropius and Aurelius Victor describe Numerian's death as an assassination.|$|E

25|$|Filtration is the {{equilibrium}} soil-to-geotextile interaction {{that allows for}} adequate liquid flow without soil loss, across {{the plane of the}} geotextile over a service lifetime compatible with the application under consideration. Filtration applications are highway underdrain systems, retaining wall drainage, landfill leachate collection systems, as silt fences and <b>curtains,</b> <b>and</b> as flexible forms for bags, tubes and containers.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, the Luftwaffe {{paid for}} a {{small-scale}} replica of Frederick the Great's palace of Sanssouci {{to be built in}} an orchard at Carinhall for her to play in. Some 50 metres long, 7 metres wide and 3½ metres high, this had within it a miniature theatre, complete with stage and <b>curtains,</b> <b>and</b> was known as Edda-Schlößchen ("Edda's little palace").|$|E
25|$|The second {{strategy}} is to reduce populations of the adult yellow fever mosquito. Lethal ovitraps can reduce Aedes populations, but with a decreased amount of pesticide because it targets the mosquitoes directly. <b>Curtains</b> <b>and</b> lids of water tanks can be sprayed with insecticides, but application inside houses is not recommended by the WHO. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets are effective, {{just as they are}} against the Anopheles mosquito that carries malaria.|$|E

25|$|In 1984 the Zenit-automat entered production. This had a Pentax K mount (which was {{proposed}} as an open standard by Pentax and distributed freely) and a focal shutter with horizontal-travel cloth curtains. The only operation mode was aperture-priority. The camera was modified in 1988, to include shutter FZL-84 with vertical-travel metal <b>curtains,</b> <b>and</b> was reissued as the Zenit-AM. The Zenit-AM2 was a cheaper {{version of the}} AM without the self-timer.|$|E
25|$|The items used in {{decoration}} {{may also}} have been darker and heavier than those used today, simply as a matter of practicality. London was noisy and its air was full of soot from countless coal fires. Hence those who could afford it draped their windows in heavy, sound-muffling <b>curtains,</b> <b>and</b> chose colours that didn't show soot quickly. When all washing was done by hand, curtains were not washed as frequently as they might be today.|$|E
25|$|Pico House was {{a luxury}} hotel built in 1870 by Pío Pico, a {{successful}} businessman {{who was the}} last Mexican Governor of Alta California. With indoor plumbing, gas-lit chandeliers, a grand double staircase, lace <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> a French restaurant, the Italianate three-story, 33-room hotel was the most elegant hotel in Southern California. It had a total of nearly eighty rooms. The Pico House is currently listed as a California Historical Landmark (No. 159).|$|E

25|$|Clothing {{and shoes}} were quickly rationed as shops sold out. Jersey opened the Summerland factory to make clothes out of blankets, <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> sheets. Nothing was thrown away, knitted objects were unravelled and remade. Other clothes were patched and repaired. Clothes in houses {{that belonged to}} {{evacuated}} people were requisitioned. As people lost weight due to the diet, new clothes needed to be found or clothes adjusted. Elastic supplies ran out. Shortages of needles and thread were relieved with supplies from France.|$|E

Fr Dixon was conditionally emancipated and permitted to celebrate Mass. On 15 May 1803, in vestments made from <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> with a chalice made of tin he conducted the first Catholic Mass in New South Wales.|$|E
