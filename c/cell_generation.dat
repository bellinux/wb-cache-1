40|$|Mitosis is {{regulated}} by checkpoints that delay mitotic progression when chromosome segregation errors occur. Inaccuracy in checkpoint processes {{can lead to}} chromosome instability both in number and structure (CIN). Arsenic is reported to induce CIN by perturbing mitotic spindles and checkpoints, however, its carcinogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. We previously studied the long-term progression of chromosomal instability in V 79 cells treated acutely with arsenite (10 M, 24 hr) followed by growth in arsenic-free medium for 120 <b>cell</b> <b>generations,</b> and found time-dependent increase of aneuploid cells. Here, we treated V 79 -derived G 12 cells with sub-lethal doses (0. 1 - 1. 0 µM) of arsenite for 10 days followed by growth in arsenite-free medium for 40 <b>cell</b> <b>generations.</b> Cytogenetic analysis {{at the end of}} treatment showed concentration-dependent increases in the frequency of aneuploid cells that was even higher after 40 <b>cell</b> <b>generations.</b> Furthermore, the mitotic index (MI) of arsenite-exposed cells was higher than untreated cells {{at the end of the}} 10 -day treatment or after 40 <b>cell</b> <b>generations</b> without arsenite. Surprisingly, we found that submicromolar 10 -day arsenic exposure induced a large amount of cells in anaphase with premature centromere division. These aberrant mitotic figures dramatically increased after 40 <b>cell</b> <b>generations.</b> Taken together, these results raise the possibility that chronic exposure to sub-lethal arsenic doses induces bypass of the spindle assembly checkpoints and may be mechanistically involved in the induction of cell transformation...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{long-term}} progression of chromosomal instability in V 79 cells treated acutely with arsenite (10 mM, 24 hr) followed by growth in arsenic-free medium for 120 <b>cell</b> <b>generations.</b> Indirect immunostaining using anti-ß-tubulin antibody showed severe alterations in spindle morphology after only 6 h treatment and cytogenetic investigations {{carried out at}} the end of treatment revealed that the percentage of cells with 21 chromosomes (modal number of the cell line) decreased, making way for aneuploid cells. The acquired instability remained and propagated within the cell population. Moreover, we treated V 79 -derived G 12 cells with sub-lethal doses (0. 1 - 1. 0 μM) of arsenite for 10 days followed by growth in arsenite-free medium for 40 <b>cell</b> <b>generations.</b> Cytogenetic analysis at the end of treatment showed concentration-dependent increase in aneuploid cells frequency that was even higher after 40 <b>cell</b> <b>generations.</b> In addition to this finding a large amount of cells in anaphase and cells with chromosomes showing premature centromere division was observed. Western blotting analysis showed dose-dependent upregulation of Mad 2 that returns to normal after 40 <b>cell</b> <b>generations</b> and persistent aberrant expression of the spindle assembly complex proteins p-BubR 1 and Cenp-E. Taken together, these results demonstrate that arsenic induces aneuploidy independently of mode of treatment; in particular, results from chronic exposure to sub-lethal doses raise the possibility that arsenic induces bypass of the spindle assembly checkpoints which may be mechanistically involved in the induction of cell transformation...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which arsenic-induced genomic instability is initiated and maintained are poorly understood. To investigate potential epigenetic mechanisms, {{in this study we}} evaluated global DNA methylation levels in V 79 cells and human HaCaT keratinocytes at several time points during expanded growth of cell cultures following removal of arsenite exposures. We have found altered genomic methylation patterns that persisted up to 40 <b>cell</b> <b>generations</b> in HaCaT <b>cells</b> after the treatments were withdrawn. Moreover, mRNA expression levels were evaluated by RT-PCR for DNMT 1, DNMT 3 A, DNMT 3 B, HMLH 1, and HMSH 2 genes, demonstrating that the down regulation of DNMT 3 A and DNMT 3 B genes, but not DNMT 1, occurred in an arsenic dose-dependent manner, and persisted for many <b>cell</b> <b>generations</b> following removal of the arsenite, offering a plausible mechanism of persistently genotoxic arsenic action. Analyses of promoter methylation status of the DNA mismatch repair genes HMLH 1 and HMSH 2 show that HMSH 2, but not HMLH 1, was epigenetically regulated by promoter hypermethylation changes following arsenic treatment. The results reported here demonstrate that arsenic exposure promptly induces genome-wide global DNA hypomethylation, and some specific gene promoter methylation changes, that persist for many <b>cell</b> <b>generations</b> following withdrawal of arsenite, supporting the hypothesis that the cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming at both the gene and genome level that is durable over many <b>cell</b> <b>generations</b> in the absence of further arsenic treatment. These DNA methylation changes, in concert with other known epigenome alterations, are likely contributing to long-lasting arsenic-induced genomic instability that manifests in several ways, including aberrant chromosomal effects.

Although connective tissue cells {{are exposed to}} inflammatory cell-derived mediators in vivo and such mediators {{have been shown to}} alter connective tissue cell behavior, it is unclear whether the persistence of metabolic defects in vitro could result from remote in vivo exposure to these mediators.

In vitro lines derived From all 3 lymphomas had less H- 2 antigens and more MLV-determined cell-surface antigen(s) than the corresponding in vivo lines in syngeneic hosts.
