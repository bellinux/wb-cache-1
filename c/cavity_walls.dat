5|$|Stony corals {{are members}} of the class Anthozoa and like other members of the group, do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. The {{individual}} animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The base of the polyp secretes the stony material from which the coral skeleton is formed. The body wall of the polyp consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis. The mouth is at the centre of the oral disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the interior of the body and tentacles. Unlike other cnidarians however, the cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the <b>cavity</b> <b>walls.</b> The polyp is retractable into the corallite, the stony cup in which it sits, being pulled back by sheet-like retractor muscles.|$|E

25|$|The {{floating}} {{drift tube}} klystron {{has a single}} cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, {{this is similar to}} the two cavity oscillator klystron with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the <b>cavity</b> <b>walls,</b> and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.|$|E

The second stage involves the actual digestion of keratin by A.fulvescens, which then grows into the remaining space.

2500|$|The blood {{does not}} come into {{direct contact with the}} parenchymal cells and tissues in the body (except in case of an injury causing rupture of one or more blood vessels), but {{constituents}} of the blood first exit the microvascular exchange blood vessels to become interstitial fluid, which comes into contact with the parenchymal cells of the body. Lymph is the fluid that is formed when interstitial fluid enters the initial lymphatic vessels of the lymphatic system. The lymph is then moved along the lymphatic vessel network by either intrinsic contractions of the lymphatic passages or by extrinsic compression of the lymphatic vessels via external tissue forces (e.g., the contractions of skeletal muscles), or by lymph hearts in some animals. The organization of lymph nodes and drainage follows the organization of the body into external and internal regions; therefore, the lymphatic drainage of the head, limbs, and body <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> follows an external route, and the lymphatic drainage of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvic cavities follows an internal route.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} irradiation time on two light-curing methods on the marginal sealing and <b>cavity</b> <b>wall</b> adaptation of resin-based composite restorations. METHODS: Cylindrical cavities, 1 mm deep and 3 mm in diameter (C-factor = 2. 3) were prepared on flat superficial bovine dentin surfaces. The teeth were restored with Clearfil Photo Bond, Clearfil Liner Bond 2 or Super-Bond D-Liner adhesive systems followed by Photo Clearfil Bright resin-based composite. The resins were cured using a conventional method at an output of 600 mW/cm 2 for 60 s, or 600 mW/cm 2 for 30 s, or the slow-start curing method at an output of 270 mW/cm 2 for 10 s + 5 s (interval) + 600 mW/cm 2 for 50 s or 270 mW/cm 2 for 10 s + 5 s (interval) + 600 mW/cm 2 for 20 s. After thermocycling, a dye penetration test was carried out. The dye penetration length was calculated {{as a percentage of}} the total <b>cavity</b> <b>wall</b> length. RESULTS: Slow-start curing method; 270 mW/cm 2 10 s + 5 s (interval) + 600 mW/cm 2 for 50 s showed the best marginal sealing and <b>cavity</b> <b>wall</b> adaptation. A shorter irradiation time increased <b>cavity</b> <b>wall</b> adaptation when the conventional curing method was used.
