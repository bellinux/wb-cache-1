2500|$|One Victory Park: A large office {{building}} {{across the street from the}} American Airlines Center and the W Hotel; houses the Dallas office of Big 4 accounting firm Ernst & Young, corporate headquarters for PlainsCapital Bank, and the Dallas offices of Haynes and Boone. The buildings ground level features a [...] Balducci's, a luxury gourmet grocer, Lucy Boutique and a Starbucks. [...] This building features an environmentally friendly underfloor air system. [...] <b>Conditioned</b> <b>air</b> for the occupants is provided by raised floor custom air handling units located in the tenant space that delivers 62 degree air into a raised access floor plenum. This underfloor air system provides users with the ability to control their own space temperature as well as improving the ventilation effectiveness. When building churn occurs, workstation moves can be performed easier with lower cost and less product waste.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, Nash added a {{thermostat}} to its system, {{making it}} the first thermostatic automobile climate control system. [...] The Weather Eye [...] "was the first truly good heating and ventilating system." [...] Additionally, defoggers (defrosters) were incorporated {{with the introduction of}} the 3900 series cars that year. [...] The Nash HVAC system was designed by Nils Eric Wahlberg and it continues to be the basis for use in modern automobiles. Nash included the first automatic temperature control for the airside of the heating system with the thermostat sensing the temperatures of the incoming outside air, the heater's discharge, and interior of the car; so that a change in any of these three air temperatures resulted an automatic adjustment to maintain passenger comfort. [...] Nash's <b>Conditioned</b> <b>Air</b> System heater was now marketed as the [...] "Weather Eye" [...] and consumer sales literature explained that the thermostat's [...] "mechanical eye" [...] watched the weather, hence the name.|$|E

50|$|Though every {{situation}} is different, {{there is some}} controversy {{about the effectiveness of}} attic fans. It has been theorized that in some cases the negative pressure that an attic fan produces in the attic can cause <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> from living spaces to be pulled into the attic through cracks and lighting fixtures. This loss of <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> can negate the energy conservation gains that might be expected from forced cooling of the attic with a fan.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{claims to}} have innovated the {{refrigerator}} light, the upright freezer, and the [...] "Air Sweep" [...] mechanism for distributing <b>conditioned</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is {{actually}} an air distribution device and is not intended as a conduit for <b>conditioned</b> <b>air.</b> The term fabric duct is therefore somehow misleading; fabric air dispersion system would be the more definitive name. However, as it often replaces hard ductwork, {{it is easy to}} perceive it simply as a duct. Usually made of polyester material, fabric ducts can provide a more even distribution and blending of the <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> in a given space than a conventional duct system. They may also be manufactured with vents or orifices.|$|E

50|$|In the U.S., {{underfloor}} {{air distribution}} {{is becoming a}} more common way to cool a building by using the void below the raised floor as a plenum chamber to distribute <b>conditioned</b> <b>air,</b> which {{has been done in}} Europe since the 1970s. In data centers, isolated air-conditioning zones are often associated with raised floors. Perforated tiles are traditionally placed beneath computer systems to direct <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> directly to them. In turn, the computing equipment is often designed to draw cooling air from below and exhaust into the room. An air conditioning unit then draws air from the room, cools it, and forces it beneath the raised floor, completing the cycle.|$|E
50|$|By their operation, {{dehumidifiers}} extract {{water from}} the <b>conditioned</b> <b>air.</b> This collected water (usually called condensate) is not normally used for drinking, and is often discarded. Some designs, such as the ionic membrane dehumidifier, dispose of excess water in a vapor rather than liquid form. The energy efficiency of dehumidifiers can vary widely.|$|E
50|$|An Air sock or sox duct is {{a textile}} or fabric duct used for draught-free air {{distribution}} {{and delivery of}} <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> {{as an alternative to}} traditional spiral or rectangular steel ducts with grilles and diffusers.

50|$|Beyond {{issues with}} venting exhaust, other improvised {{efficiency}} efforts with conventional dryers attempt to harvest an input source of pre-heated air {{rather than using}} the <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> of the living space. One notable source of heat to pre-heat dryer air is to install ductwork allowing the device to suck hot air from a dwelling's attic.|$|E
50|$|The {{air from}} the lobby {{constantly}} leaks into the elevator shaft due to elevator movements as well as elevator shaft ventilation requirements. Using this <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> in the elevator does not increase energy costs. However, by using an independent elevator air conditioner to achieve better temperature control inside the car, more energy will be used.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> is {{supplied}} {{directly into the}} occupied space, supply air temperatures must be higher than mixing systems (usually above 63 °F or 17 °C) to avoid cold draughts at the floor. By introducing the air at supply air temperatures close to the room temperature and low outlet velocity {{a high level of}} thermal comfort can be provided with displacement ventilation.|$|E

5000|$|These are {{bladders}} or canisters of compressed air. A {{source of}} compressed air {{is required to}} maintain them. Air springs are rubber bladders which provide damping as well as isolation and are used in large trucks. Some pneumatic isolators can attain low resonant frequencies and are used for isolating large industrial equipment. Air tables consist of a working surface or optical surface mounted on air legs. These tables provide enough isolation for laboratory instrument under some <b>conditions.</b> <b>Air</b> systems may leak under vacuum <b>conditions.</b> The <b>air</b> container can interfere with isolation of low-amplitude vibration.|$|R
50|$|The {{fresh air}} comes {{in through the}} air inlet of the AC unit. The <b>conditioned</b> <b>air</b> is transported in heat {{insulated}} aluminum ducts mounted below the roof and distributed through the perforated ceiling into the passenger room.

50|$|Many modern {{computer}} and equipment rooms employ an underfloor air distribution to ensure even cooling {{of the room}} with minimal wasted energy. <b>Conditioned</b> <b>air</b> is provided under the floor and dispersed upward into the room through regularly spaced diffuser tiles, blowers or through ducts directed into specific equipment. Automatic fire protection shutoffs may be required for underfloor ventilation, and additional suppression systems may be installed in case of underfloor fires.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine in most cars and trucks is cooled by a water and antifreeze mixture that is circulated through the engine and radiator by a water pump to enable the radiator to give off engine heat to the atmosphere. Some of that water can be diverted through the heater core to give some engine heat to the cabin, or adjust {{the temperature of the}} <b>conditioned</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

In total it has six <b>air</b> <b>conditioned</b> coaches. It became the first train in South Central Railway to run with two first class cum second class <b>air</b> <b>conditioned</b> coaches. It has such a huge patronage such that a supplementary train, Cocanada AC Express, a fully <b>air</b> <b>conditioned</b> train, was introduced between Kakinada and Secunderabad in 2012 to cater to the rush.

50|$|A final {{advantage}} is increased dehumidification. Because VAV air flow is reduced under part-load <b>conditions,</b> <b>air</b> {{is exposed to}} cooling coils for a longer time. More moisture condenses on the coils, dehumidifying the air. Thus, although a constant-volume and a single-zone VAV unit maintain the same room temperature, the VAV unit provides more passive dehumidification and more comfortable space conditions.|$|R
