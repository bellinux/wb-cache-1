The light was {{converted to a}} 30 <b>candle</b> <b>power</b> electric light powered by batteries taken ashore for recharging with a revolving reflector in 1913 that produced a flash rated at 80,000 <b>candle</b> <b>power</b> and {{was said to be}} the first such system in the world. In 1915 this light was replaced with an oil/gas conventional lens lantern.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{are equipped with}} modern technology and specialist equipment including rescue winches, Nite sun searchlights (30million <b>candle</b> <b>power),</b> forward-looking infra red (FLIR), high definition video camera system, microwave down-linking of live pictures, digital radio communications and advanced integrated touch screen digital glass cockpits with global positioning satellite (GPS) navigation systems.|$|E
25|$|The two {{searchlights}} were {{manufactured by}} the Sperry Company and had dedicated diesel generators at both locations, one above White Lady, a rock formation in Horseshoe Bay, {{the other in}} Florence Bay. The fully automatic lights were 3000000 <b>candle</b> <b>power,</b> Carbon Arc and were capable of spotting aircraft at 30000 feet. 20 engineers supervised the operation of these searchlights.|$|E
50|$|In December 1878 Victoria Embankment {{became the}} first street in Britain to be {{permanently}} lit by electricity. The light was provided by 20 Yablochkov <b>candles</b> <b>powered</b> by a Gramme DC generator. 16 March 1879 the system was extended to 40 lamps and 10 October to 55 lamps. Previously the street had been lit by gas, and in June 1884, gas lighting was re-established as electricity was not competitive.|$|R

50|$|On {{application}} of the electric supply, the fuse wire 'blows' and strikes the arc. The arc then continues to burn, gradually consuming the carbon electrodes (and the intervening plaster) as it does so. The first <b>candles</b> were <b>powered</b> by a Gramme machine.|$|R
25|$|An {{incandescent}} vapour light, {{the first}} of its kind in Queensland, was purchased from Chance Brothers and installed in 1910 and by 1912 its 1400 <b>candle</b> <b>power</b> was visible at least 22 to 25 miles out to sea. Many mariners considered it the best light on the Queensland coast and the key to successfully traversing Moreton Bay. As a result, by 1920 all vessels entering and leaving the Port of Brisbane at night had to use the North West Channel.|$|E
500|$|A new flare, {{designated}} MLU-32/B99, {{also referred}} to as Briteye, was put into development. The new flare burned at 5 million <b>candle</b> <b>power</b> for over five minutes and produced a signal that could be heard by pilots indicating when it was about to burn out. Additionally, the Navy’s Mk 33 Mod 0 flare warhead for the 5” Mk 16 “Zuni” rocket motor was tested under Shed Light. [...] Projected delays in the procurement of the MLU-32/B99 led to a proposal to test the Swedish Lepus flare as an interim measure. The Lepus flare was tested, but found to be inferior to the MLU-32/B99.|$|E

5000|$|In 1885, as {{a result}} of {{exhaustive}} tests of lamp life, he determined the relative lives of lamps at different initial <b>candle</b> <b>powers,</b> obtaining an exponent of efficiency which was the subject of an important paper read before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1888. He also invented an automatic machine for treating the carbon filament which eliminated the grave fire hazards of former process and which for many years was used in electric lamp manufacture, both in this country and in Europe; a four-head vertical sealing-in machine (1896) which was the first modern glass working machines used in the electric lamp industry; and, in collaboration with William Russell Burrows, a stem making machine (1901) which superseded the hand method of making electric lamp stems. In all, some fifty patents were granted him.|$|R

50|$|The Paris Exposition of 1878 {{presented}} Yablochkov {{with the}} {{unique opportunity to}} make a spectacular demonstration for a world audience, and through the promotional efforts of Gramme was successful in having 64 of his arc lights installed along the half mile (0.8 km) length of Avenue de l'Opéra, Place du Théâtre Français (today Place André-Malraux) and around the Place de l'Opéra. It was first lit in February 1878. Yablochkov candles required high voltage, and it was not long before experimenters reported that the arc lights could be powered on a 7-mile (11 km) circuit. Yablochkov candles were superior to Lontin-Serrin regulator arc lights that each required a separate Gramme generator. Beginning in 1880, the Paris Hippodrome's 20 Serrin lights powered by 20 generators were replaced by 68 additional Yablochkov candles, based on two years of positive experience with 60 <b>candles</b> <b>powered</b> by just three generators. The impact of the 1878 Paris demonstration was a depression in the value of gas company shares which did not recover until 1880. French, English, and American businessmen quickly set up companies licensing Yablochkov's patents.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the year}} ended June 1908 the wick burners were {{replaced}} by a Chance incandescent petroleum vapour burner and the light output was increased from 45,000 to 200,000 <b>candle</b> <b>power.</b> [...] This was increased to 327,000 candles in February 1927 and the current mercury float pedestal and clockwork (now electrified) mechanism was installed in March 1929.

Due to this legend the church got the name [...] "Theoskepasti" [...] from the Greek words [...] "Theos" [...] and [...] "skepazo" [...] which mean [...] "God" [...] and [...] "to veil" [...] respectively.

40|$|Restricted Access. Following the {{investigation}} of the radio luminosity function by Harnett, two samples of galaxies have been observed with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope at 843 MHz. These comprise 176 E and S 0 galaxies from the sample by Sadler, and 21 galaxies with δ ≤ - 45 °, a subset of Harnett's sample. The resulting local radio luminosity function (LRLF) has been extended to radio powers of ≡ 1018 W Hz- 1 sr- 1. At such low luminosities, the irregular galaxies apparently begin to dominate the LRLF. Spirals on the other hand, continue to be confined to radio powers in the range 1019 - 22 W Hz- 1 sr- 1. E and S 0 galaxies appear unimportant to the LRLF at low radio luminosities but behave like similar standard <b>candles</b> above <b>powers</b> of ≡ 1022. 5 W Hz- 1 sr- 1. The radio properties of S 0 galaxies depend on their absolute optical luminosities and hence their masses. The most massive appear similar to radio ellipticals, but at lower optical luminosities comparable to those of spirals, S 0 galaxies resemble early-type spirals closely both in their detection rate and correlation between radio and optical luminosities...|$|R
40|$|We present {{analytic}} formulae for {{the integral}} number count distribution of cosmological bursting or steady sources valid {{over the entire}} range of uxes, including density evolution and either standard <b>candle</b> or a <b>power</b> law luminosity function.

Applications to the spatial distribution of cosmological gamma ray burst sources are discussed, both with and without an intrinsic energy stretching of the burst time proles, and the implied ranges of redshift z are considered for a specic time dilation signal value. The simultaneous consideration of time dilation information and of ts of the number distribution versus peak ux breaks the degeneracy inherent in the latter alone, allowing a unique determinatio...|$|R
50|$|Because it had surplus {{generation}} capacity {{the freezing}} works had since 1905 been supplying electricity {{to the nearby}} town of Gore, while due to the town's financial situation Mataura residents were still using <b>candles</b> and kerosene <b>powered</b> lamps. It wasn’t until 1911 the Borough Council was able to reach agreement with the freezing works for them to increase their generating capacity so that they could supply the Mataura load. After taking out a loan to finance the expansion of the generation capacity and the installation of a distribution system around the town the first power began being supplied from 5 October 1912.Mataura retained its own independent power system until 1932 when due to technical issues it became impossible for the freezing works to continue supplying the town. As a result, the borough council accepted an offer to sell their power system to the Southland Electric Power Board, which took over responsibility for supplying the town from its distribution network.|$|R
