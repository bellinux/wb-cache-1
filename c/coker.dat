5|$|Both of Coker's older {{brothers}} {{were involved in}} Scouting and <b>Coker</b> first became involved when he joined Cub Scouts in late 1951. He completed the Cubbing program and joined Troop 32. Troop 32 had about a dozen members at that time but had over 60 members when <b>Coker</b> made Eagle Scout in 1959. During this time the troop formed an Explorer Post and Sea Scout unit. After making Eagle Scout, <b>Coker</b> joined the Sea Scout unit and worked at summer camp before the joined the Navy in October 1963. When <b>Coker</b> returned to Linden after being released from captivity, the Scouts were his biggest supporter. Troop 32 now had over 100 members. Local citizens turned out by the hundreds to greet him. <b>Coker</b> visited many of the local Scouting units. <b>Coker</b> was then inactive in Scouting during a busy Naval career, but got involved again when his son joined Cub Scouts as a Tiger Cub after the family had settled in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He became the den leader of 7 boys, all of whom earned their Arrow of Light, the highest recognition in Cub Scouting. They moved on to Troop 62, Virginia Beach, in May 1994; with five of them later becoming Eagle Scouts, including his son.|$|E
5|$|Troop 62's adults asked <b>Coker</b> {{to become}} Scoutmaster, a {{position}} in which he served for several years. <b>Coker</b> is also a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow (OA). <b>Coker</b> served as the lodge adviser for Tidewater Council's OA lodge, Blue Heron Lodge, from December 2005 until December 2007. He was honored by the Boy Scouts of America with their Distinguished Eagle Scout Award on August 9, 2005.|$|E
5|$|George <b>Coker</b> {{was born}} in Amarillo, Texas in 1943. In 1951, {{his family moved to}} Linden, New Jersey, where he became a New Jersey high school state wrestling {{champion}} in the 142lb weight class and played high school varsity football at Saint Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey. <b>Coker</b> attended Rutgers University from 1961–1963, where he also wrestled. While at Rutgers, he participated in an aviation officer cadet program and was commissioned an Ensign in the United States Navy. After his release from Vietnam, he returned to college and graduated from the University of San Diego in 1976 with a BS in political science. He studied education and mathematics at Old Dominion University from 1982 to 1986. <b>Coker</b> is married and has three children; two daughters and a son, Theresa, Elizabeth, and Thomas Jr.|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, we proved that Smarandache’s {{definition}} of neutrosophic paraconsistent topology {{is neither a}} generalization of <b>Çoker’s</b> intuitionistic fuzzy topology nor a generalization of Smarandache’s neutrosophic topology. Recently, Salama and Alblowi proposed a new definition of neutrosophic topology, that generalizes <b>Çoker’s</b> intuitionistic fuzzy topology. Here, we study this new definition {{and its relation to}} Smarandache’s paraconsistent neutrosophic sets...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} week, the Hurricanes lost to Virginia Tech, 17-10, as ESPN College Football analysts questioned <b>Coker's</b> {{management of}} the clock in the game's final minutes.

5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} {{indicated}} signs of activity from the palaeolithic period, with burial and occupation sites located principally {{to the south}} of the modern town, particularly in Hendford where a Bronze Age golden torc (twisted collar) was found. Yeovil is on the main Roman road from Dorchester to the Fosse Way at Ilchester. The route of the old road is aligned with the A37 from Dorchester, Hendford Hill, Rustywell, across the Westland site, to Larkhill Road and Vagg Lane, rejoining the A37 at the Halfway House pub on the Ilchester Road. The Westland site has evidence of a small Roman town. There were several Roman villas (estates) in the area, including finds at East <b>Coker,</b> West <b>Coker</b> and Lufton.|$|E

5|$|<b>Coker</b> {{was awarded}} the Navy Commendation Medal for his actions {{as part of a}} coordinated 23-aircraft attack on {{petroleum}} storage tanks in Hai Phong on August 2, 1966, consisting of four waves of A-6 Intruders and A-4 Skyhawks, firing a combination of 750 and 1,000 pound bombs and rockets. The attack was the third in a series of attacks on North Vietnamese oil storage depots dating back to June. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, <b>Coker</b> provided accurate guidance to the pilot on airspeed, altitude and dive angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and electronic countermeasures. Despite adverse weather conditions, Coker's actions contributed to an attack that destroyed {{all but one of the}} facility's storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|He {{managed to}} {{complete}} two sections by February 1940, but finished the rest during that month. John Davy Hayward, Herbert Read and others helped review and edit it. East <b>Coker</b> {{was published in}} the March 1940 New English Weekly for its Easter edition. It was later reprinted May and June, and it was published on its own by Faber and Faber in September. With the completion of the poem, Eliot began creating the Four Quartets as a series of four poems based on the same theme with Burnt Norton as the first in the series and East <b>Coker</b> as the second.|$|E

5|$|Iowa {{defeated}} Michigan 24–16 after Michigan {{was unable}} to score a touchdown from the three-yard line {{at the end of}} the game. Iowa scored first with a four-yard touchdown run by Marcus <b>Coker.</b> Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown catch by Fitzgerald Toussaint, their only points of the first half; however, the extra point was botched due to a bad snap. In the second quarter, Iowa's Brad Herman caught a one-yard pass from James Vandenberg for a touchdown. Iowa's Mike Meyer then kicked a 42-yard field goal to add to the Hawkeyes' lead. After halftime, Michigan's Brendan Gibbons scored the only points of the 3rd quarter with a 32-yard field goal. Iowa then scored its only points of the second half when Marcus <b>Coker</b> scored his second touchdown of the day, this time with a 13-yard rush. Michigan responded with a seven-yard touchdown catch by Kevin Koger.|$|E

50|$|Don MacPherson of thefourthrail.com, {{reviewing}} the first issue, {{was surprised by}} the range of Winick’s writing, stating that Winick’s strong characterization was the common element in his humor, biographical, and superhero comics, and now showed in his horror work. He commended the stark, textured realism of Tomm <b>Coker’s</b> art, and the surreal tone added by Jason Wright’s colors. MacPherson was impressed by Winick and <b>Coker’s</b> depiction of Adam’s hepatitis, which with Josh and Nicky’s offbeat characters, added a mature, twisted sense of fun to the story.|$|R

5|$|American mycologist William Murrill {{called it}} Ceriomyces curtisii in 1909, but Ceriomyces (as defined by Murrill in 1909) {{has since been}} subsumed into Boletus. In his 1947 {{monograph}} on boletes of Florida, Rolf Singer transferred the species to the genus Pulveroboletus, and made it the type of his newly described section Cartilaginei, which featured species with a glutinous or sticky stem, and a leather-colored to brownish hymenophore. Species in Pulveroboletus are characterized {{by the presence of}} pigments based on the chemical structure of pulvinic acid, a yellow-orange compound found in some species of Boletales. The pigments responsible for the color of B.curtisii are, however, entirely different from the pulvinic acid compounds found in Pulveroboletus species, which invalidates the chemotaxonomical rational for generic placement in Pulveroboletus. Otto Kuntze once placed the species in Suillus, but it lacks the partial veil and glandular dots associated with that genus. William Chambers <b>Coker</b> and Alma Beers considered Charles Horton Peck's Boletus inflexus (described from New York in 1895) as well as Henry Curtis Beardslee's 1915 B.carolinensis to be the same species as B.curtisii. <b>Coker</b> and Beer's suggested synonymy, however, is not recognized by the taxonomical authorities MycoBank or Index Fungorum.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} feelings and experience, especially on the great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East <b>Coker,</b> was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E

50|$|There used to {{be another}} fishing pond in Gunville. Although smaller than Gunville Lake, <b>Coker's</b> Pond {{nevertheless}} afforded {{some of the best}} carp fishing on the island and even attracted fishermen from the mainland to fish there. However, like Gunville Lake, it too suffered from the tipping of rubbish and earth over the years, especially in 1957, when excavations for the new nearby Carisbrooke College was needlessly dumped in the pond. <b>Coker's</b> Pond now no longer exists, after being filled in when a new housing estate was built over the site in 1994. The pond was under the land where Linnet Close and The Finches now lie.|$|R
5|$|<b>Coker</b> {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959.

5|$|East <b>Coker</b> is {{described}} as a poem of late summer, earth, and faith. As in the other poems of the Four Quartets, each of the five sections holds a theme that is common to each of the poems: time, experience, purgation, prayer, and wholeness. The time theme is stated in the first section as 'In my beginning is my end' which, given proper attention, might prove to lead into the eternal moment.|$|E
5|$|East <b>Coker</b> is {{the second}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. It was started {{as a way for}} Eliot to get back into writing poetry and was {{modelled}} after Burnt Norton. It was finished during early 1940 and printed for the Easter edition of the 1940 New English Weekly. The title refers to a small community that was directly connected to Eliot's ancestry and was home to a church that was later to house Eliot's ashes.|$|E
