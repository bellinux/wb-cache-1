5|$|In 1974, Thomas Henry Flewett {{suggested}} the name rotavirus after observing that, when viewed through an electron microscope, a rotavirus particle {{looks like a}} wheel (rota in Latin); the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide. Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, rotavirus from humans was first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys, by adding trypsin (an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate) to the <b>culture</b> <b>medium.</b> The ability to grow rotavirus in culture accelerated the pace of research, and by the mid-1980s the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded in growing the organism on a simple <b>culture</b> <b>medium,</b> but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E

In this interest, as supernatant we used bidistilled water, either on sucrose, glucose or fructose solutions, in different concentrations, which were applied over the inoculated protocorms on agarized <b>medium</b> <b>cultures.</b> The basic <b>medium</b> <b>culture</b> used by us in these experiments was Murashige – Skoog (1962) [13].

40|$|Application {{of compost}} and compost {{leachate}} as organic fertilizers can improve plant growth, nutrients uptake and increase phytoavailability of nutrients in soil. A factorial experiment (4 × 4 × 2) {{was conducted in}} a completely randomized design to evaluate the effect of compost and compost leachate on growth and chemical composition of barley and bioavailability of some nutrients in calcareous clay loam soil and sandy soil under greenhouse conditions. Treatments consisted of four levels of compost (0, 15, 30, and 60 g kg- 1), four levels of compost leachate (0, 10, 20, and 40 g kg- 1), and two <b>culture</b> <b>mediums</b> (clay loam soil and sandy soil) with three replicates. Results indicated that application of compost and compost leachate significantly increased barley shoot dry matter, the number of tillers, spikes and grain yield in clay loam soil and sandy soil. The maximum barley shoots dry matter and numbers of tillers in both <b>culture</b> <b>mediums</b> were obtained {{at the highest level}} of compost or compost leachate, and the maximum number of spikes and grain yield were obtained at the lowest level of compost or compost leachate. Application of compost in clay loam soil and sandy soil increased shoot and root concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), Iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu). However, addition of compost leachate only increased shoot concentrations of Fe and P. Increasing compost levels increased post harvest concentrations of NO 3 - N, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and also electrical conductivity and organic matter content of clay loam soil and sandy soil. Addition of compost leachate significantly increased concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu and also electrical conductivity and organic matter content of both <b>culture</b> <b>mediums.</b> In both <b>culture</b> <b>mediums</b> and both compost and compost leachate treatments, post harvest concentrations of micronutrients were above critical levels. Therefore, addition of these nutrients is not required for the next cultivation. Generally, compost and compost leachate are appropriate organic fertilizers for barley production; however, high salinity level in compost leachate, the rate and frequency of leachate application, particularly in sand, needs intensive control and monitoring. Prior to any fertilizer recommendation, {{the results of this study}} need to be verified under field conditions, as well...|$|R

Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells, referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the media because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).|$|E
25|$|Germanium dioxide {{is used in}} algaculture as an {{inhibitor}} {{of unwanted}} diatom growth in algal cultures, since contamination with the comparatively fast-growing diatoms often inhibits the growth of or outcompetes the original algae strains. GeO2 is readily taken up by diatoms and leads to silicon being substituted by germanium in biochemical processes within the diatoms, causing a significant reduction of the diatoms' growth rate or even their complete elimination, with little effect on non-diatom algal species. For this application, the concentration of germanium dioxide typically used in the <b>culture</b> <b>medium</b> is between 1 and 10mg/l, depending {{on the stage of}} the contamination and the species.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{bacterial}} cloning vectors (e.g. pUC19 {{and later}} derivatives including the pGEM vectors) use the blue-white screening system to distinguish colonies (clones) of transgenic cells {{from those that}} contain the parental vector (i.e. vector DNA with no recombinant sequence inserted).

Insertion of the foreign DNA into the beta-galactosidase coding sequence disables the function of the enzyme, so that colonies containing transformed DNA remain colorless (white).

25|$|The {{source of}} {{luminescence}} is symbiotic bacteria that dwell {{in and around}} the esca. In some species, the bacteria recruited to the esca are incapable of luminescence independent of the anglerfish, suggesting they have developed a symbiotic relationship and the bacteria are unable to synthesize all of the chemicals necessary for luminescence on their own. They depend on the fish to make up the difference. Electron microscopy of these bacteria in some species reveals they are Gram-negative rods that lack capsules, spores, or flagella. They have double-layered cell walls and mesosomes. A pore connects the esca with the seawater, which enables the removal of dead bacteria and cellular waste, and allows the pH and tonicity of the <b>culture</b> <b>medium</b> to remain constant. This, as well as the constant temperature of the bathypelagic zone inhabited by these fish, is crucial for the long-term viability of bacterial cultures.|$|E
