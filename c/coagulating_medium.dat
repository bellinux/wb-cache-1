50|$|Artificial fibres {{are made}} by {{extruding}} a polymer through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens. Wet spinning (rayon) uses a <b>coagulating</b> <b>medium.</b> In dry spinning (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. In melt spinning (nylons and polyesters) the extruded polymer is cooled in gas or air and sets. All these fibres will be of great length, often kilometers long.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} aramid-g-PEO copolymers {{was employed to}} fabricate ultrafiltration (UF) membranes by the conventional method of phase inversion, using N,N-dimethylformamide as the solvent and water as the <b>coagulating</b> <b>medium.</b> By adjusting the dope concentration for each polymer, porous membranes were attained which were suitable for UF operations and were tested using a laboratory-scale cross-flow test unit. The water flux of the membranes showed a strong dependency on the chemical composition, with water permeability increasing with increasing PEO content in the copolymer. Their separation potentials were investigated using standard solutions of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the feed, {{and the performance of}} the membranes in UF operations was systematically compared. A relationship between the dope concentration and the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) could be observed, with higher concentrations resulting in a lower MWCO. In contrast, it was observed that the higher the content of PEO in the copolymer the greater the MWCO. In fouling tests performed using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution, aramid-g-PEO UF membranes exhibited very good antifouling properties compared to a commercially sourced polysulfone membrane and to polyamide UF membranes. The results of this work indicate that aramid-g-PEO copolymers are promising materials for the fabrication of fouling resistant membranes for biomacromolecules' separations. © 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of naturally derived materials with wet stable fibrous architectures is paramount {{in order to}} mimic the features of tissues at the molecular and microscopic scale. Here, we investigated the {{formation of}} wet-spun fibres based on collagen-derived polypeptides with comparable chemical composition and varied molecular weight. Gelatin and hydrolysed fish collagen (HFC) were selected as widely available linear amino-acidic chains {{of high and low}} molecular weight, respectively, and functionalised in the wet-spun fibre state in order to preserve the material geometry in physiological conditions. Wet-spun fibre diameter and morphology were dramatically affected depending on the polypeptide molecular weight, wet-spinning solvent (i. e. 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide) and <b>coagulating</b> <b>medium</b> (i. e. acetone and ethanol), resulting in either bulky or porous internal geometry. Dry-state tensile moduli were significantly enhanced in gelatin and HFC samples following covalent crosslinking with activated 1, 3 -phenylenediacetic acid (Ph) (E: 726 ± 43 – 844 ± 85 MPa), compared to samples crosslinked via intramolecular carbodiimide-mediated condensation reaction (E: 588 ± 38 MPa). Resulting fibres displayed a dry diameter in the range of 238 ± 18 – 355 ± 28 μm and proved to be mechanically stable (E: 230 kPa) following equilibration with PBS, whilst a nearly complete degradation was observed after 5 -day incubation in physiological conditions...|$|E
40|$|The author {{tried the}} long tube culture of Fusarium niveum, {{to see the}} total Iength of the mycelial growth of this fungus during one summer season. Culture tubes used were about one meter long and ten to {{fourteen}} millimeter in diameter After injecting the culture medium written below into these tubes, they were sterilized and placed horizontally for coagulation. Then each of them was inoculated with the fungus in question, at {{one side of the}} <b>coagulated</b> <b>medium.</b> After this, mycelial growth, maximum and minimum temperature were recorded everyday. To compare this with some pathogenic fungi of local necrotic diseases, Valsa mali and Sclerotinia libertiana were chosen. The culture medium used consisted of the followings, onion decoction 100. 00 cc KH 2 PO 4 1. 00 gr, MgSO 4, 0. 50 gr, grape sugar 20. 00 gr, agar 20. 00 gr, water 900. 00 cc. It was found {{to be one of the}} most excellent media for the mycelial growth of this fungus. 本報告は曩に發表した本研究の第一報 (3) に於て報告したると全然同一の目的を以て行はれた研究の報告であり, ただ異なるところは, 第一報告の場合には, 葉の乾燥物質の重量及びその粉末容積の大きさを示すための對比値として含灰量を利用したのを, 此場合には葉内セルローズ含有量を以てした點にある (第一報緒言參照) 。即ち茲に葉内セルローズ含有量を對比値としたのは, 成熟した葉に於ける該含有量は一日間の如き短かい期間に於ては餘り著しい變化をなすものでないてふことを前提としたものであり, こは第一報の場合に於ける含灰量と同樣に, 葉内に於ける普通の物質代謝現象に就ての在來の知見から推論し得ることであるが (4 參照), 先づ以て實驗的にこの前提の確否を定めて置く必要がある。在來の文獻にして, この種の問題を取扱ひ確信を與ふるに足る成績を示してゐるものあるを知らないので, 本研究はその第一階梯としてこの點を實驗的に證明し, 次で研究の主眼點に入ることとした...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{in vitro}} technique {{was used to}} compare the ability of different endotoxins to inhibit the migration of macrophages from explants of rabbit spleen cultured in a <b>coagulated</b> plasma <b>medium.</b> The order of potency was different from that observed in chick embryo assays, and in assays with mice, of the same endotoxins. In general, however, the sensitivity of the macrophage inhibition test was comparable to that of other bioassay methods. A highly purified endotoxin from Salmonella enteritidis (Ribi) in a concentration of 0. 004 μg/ml regularly inhibited macrophage migration. The in vitro method was used to detect a progressive loss of biological activity in fractions obtained during acid hydrolysis of the purified endotoxin. The selective toxicity of very low concentrations of endotoxin for mammalian macrophages was important in estimating the degree of specificity of the reaction. The pattern of cellular response in explant cultures made it possible to differentiate endotoxic damage from the specific cytotoxic action of antigen associated with delayed hypersensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteriology}} of diphtheria {{has often}} been regarded as a subject upon which further work would be unprofitable. This opinion was formed, no doubt, from the brilliant 'and decisive studies of Loeffler (1884; 1887), and of those who followed within a decade and developed the fundamentals of both theory and method in the bacteriology and toxicology of this disease. Loeffler's staining method is to this day preferred by many workers. The <b>coagulated</b> serum <b>medium</b> devised by him is regarded as superior to any culture mediuim since advocated for {{the rapid growth of}} diphtheria bacilli. He also emphasized the importance of distinguishing the true virulent diphtheria bacilli from the pseudo-diphtheria bacilli by testing the virulence on guinea pigs and not relying altogether on the microscopical diagnosis. In reading Loeffler's classical papers one is {{struck by the fact that}} the enormous amount of work done on this subject since then [with the exception of the discovery of diphtheria toxin by Roux and Yersin (1888), and antitoxin by Behring (1890) ] has been largely along the lines layed down by him in his publications of 1884 and 1887. The voluminous literature appearing since these early re-searches has dealt with biochemical characteristics, cultivation, morphology and staining, virulence and toxin production, the major portion of the work (modifications of Loeffler's methods...|$|R
40|$|Cytocompatible polysaccharide-based {{functional}} scaffolds {{are potential}} extracellular matrix candidates for soft and hard tissue engineering. This paper describes a facile approach to design cytocompatible, non-toxic, and multifunctional chitosan-cellulose based hydrogel beads utilising polysaccharide dissolution in sodium hydroxide-urea-water solvent system and coagulation under three different acidic conditions, namely 2 M acetic acid, 2 M hydrochloric acid, and 2 M sulfuric acid. The effect of <b>coagulating</b> <b>medium</b> {{on the final}} chemical composition of the hydrogel beads is investigated by spectroscopic techniques (ATR–FTIR, Raman, NMR), and elemental analysis. The beads coagulated in 2 M acetic acid displayed an unchanged chitosan composition with free amino groups, while the beads coagulated in 2 M hydrochloric and sulfuric acid showed protonation of amino groups and ionic interaction with the counterions. The ultrastructural morphological study of lyophilized beads showed that increased chitosan content enhanced the porosity of the hydrogel beads. Furthermore, cytocompatibility evaluation of the hydrogel beads with human breast adenocarcinoma cells (soft tissue) showed that the beads coagulated in 2 M acetic acid are the most suitable {{for this type of}} cells in comparison to other coagulating systems. The acetic acid fabricated hydrogel beads also support osteoblast growth and adhesion over 192 h. Thus, in future, these hydrogel beads can be tested in the in vitro studies related to breast cancer and for bone regeneration...|$|E

The isolates also differed in the changes that they induced in MGM composition during protoplast growth and in the rates of glucose utilization and protein secretion. The serum of c. fumiferana larvae contained protein(s) which we believe adhere to the cell membranes of the protoplasts of E. egressa. Evidence is presented for hemocyteplasn interaction in the presence of protoplasts. Components in the larval serum were found to influence protoplast growth patterns. The possibility of antiprotoplast serum activity is presented. Melanin, toxic levels of ninhydrinpositive compounds and antiprotoplast proteins may have been involved in this activity.
