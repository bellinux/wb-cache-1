TCL responded by initiating a formal <b>creditors</b> <b>meeting,</b> in order to attempt their proposed financial reconstruction of the WHLR Company. The effect of this was to prevent the OR from going to the High Court until the outcome was known. An initial <b>creditors</b> <b>meeting</b> was held on 23 July 1984, but was adjourned, when the Department of Transport announced it would sell its debentures (some 42% of the total) to the highest bidder.

Results on the pitch improved slightly with November finishing with two wins, one draw and one defeat, but Zola's men were given a swift reminder of the up hill battle they faced to survive in the Premier League at the hands of Manchester United, as they lost 4–0 at home. More bad luck followed with the loss of top goal scorer Carlton Cole for two months to injury along with young Zavon Hines with a knee injury, leaving Zola over the Christmas break with just Franco and Frank Nouble up front. West Ham also lost Valon Behrami for most of December along with facing a scare with goalkeeper Robert Green, who went off early during the Manchester United game. This since proved to be just down to illness rather than injury.|$|R

40|$|Effective {{creditor}} {{participation in}} insolvency proceedings {{has been widely}} seen as an essential feature of any well-developed insolvency administration system. This notion has been expressed in different ways in national systems of insolvency law, ranging from principles such as the pari passu rule and the conduct of <b>creditor</b> <b>meetings</b> to decide matters of importance in the insolvency proceedings, {{to the role of}} insolvency representatives in such proceedings. The last decade has seen the emergence of a number of multilateral efforts to more clearly articulate insolvency norms or 'best practice' guidelines; these have included such outcomes as the Asian Development Bank’s 2000 Good Practice Standards, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s 2005 draft Principles for Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systems and the monumental 2004 UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law. The emergence of these multilateral statements has recognised the regional and global significance of insolvency laws and the role that they play in providing a foundation for a market economy. This article examines the creditor participation standards evident in this body of international best practice norms. Ultimately, it is argued that creditor participation in insolvency is an essential element in a rule of law based market economy...|$|R

However the remaining debentures were owned by three local councils. One of them (Dwyfor), at the last minute, changed its mind and voted with others, including GCC, to block the move, preventing the 75% majority required. Had the 75% target been reached (Dwyfor's vote would have taken the majority to 78%) the next stage {{would have been for}} TCL to go to the Companies Court, to ask for the WHLR Company to be taken out of liquidation. If this had been successful, then it was TCL's stated intention to offer to lease successive sections to WHLR (1964) Ltd. It is understood that GCC lent on Dwyfor prior to the meeting.|$|E

Everyone owed money was being treated as an unsecured creditor, with no secured creditors or claims from employees. The overall budget for all Alt-Fest bands was said to be around £800,000. Marilyn Manson had received a £100,000 deposit for his scheduled performance, but remained a creditor as he was owed more. One festival food vendor, Deli Kate, was known to have lost £2,500 in pitch and trading costs. Dom and Missy were paid £6,400 each over the two-year period in which the event was organised, and had also received a £21,546 director's loan. The liquidator stated that they had no visible means to pay this back, and would in all probability have to file for personal bankruptcy as a result.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the current Australian courts’ definitions of employee and independent contractor. It highlights where the franchisee fits, being indistinguishable at times from an employee {{and at other}} times from an independent contractor. The paper examines the policy behind insolvency legislation in Australia and queries whether it would be appropriate to accord franchisees specific status in the franchisor’s insolvency; like that enjoyed by employees. In most situations, the definition is relatively unimportant. The Franchise Agreement, ancillary contracts and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) regulate the franchisor/ franchisee relationship. If the franchisor becomes insolvent, the failure of the law {{to keep pace with the}} franchise business model is bought into sharp focus. Whereas the employee and the independent contractor have clearly understood rights, enshrined in statute, the franchisee has no specific rights. Unless the franchisee is a creditor of the franchisor, it does not have a right to attend <b>creditors</b> <b>meetings.</b> At its most vulnerable, the franchisee is categorized as an asset or a liability in the insolvent estate. The franchisor – franchisee relationship, however, has many features that make the franchisee more vulnerable than an employer whose employer becomes insolvent. If the franchisor becomes insolvent, the franchisee may loose the value of sunk investments, the right to occupy premises, and may not be able to free itself from onerous contracts that were only entered into because of its position as a franchisee...|$|R
5000|$|In 1915, Claridge's Patent Asphalte Co. {{supplied}} asphalt for the Strand {{offices of}} the Government of the Dominion of New Zealand. [...] In July 1915, Clarmac Roads was in financial difficulties owing to the First World War, and the Claridge Company directors, believing those difficulties to be temporary, deposited {{a large amount of}} debentures with the Clarmac Company's bankers to secure an overdraft. However, the Clarmac Company never recovered. On 16 October 1915, a decision was made to wind up Clarmac Roads and a liquidator duly appointed, and <b>creditor's</b> <b>meeting</b> called. In January 1916, R.T. Wilkinson retired from his position as a director of Claridge's Company, after an association of 63 years. The failure of Clarmac Roads had a flow-on effect to Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company, with a petition to wind it up lodged with the High Court on 2 November 1917 by company director William Allback. Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company finally ceased operating on 10 November 1917, after becoming insolvent following the failure of the joint venture entered into in 1914. The sequel to this was legal action by the liquidator to recover lost funds from Allback, who had played a prominent role in the promotion of Clarmac Roads and investment of funds therein. This case itself is sometimes cited in corporate law, as an early example of exemption from legal liability where the directors of a company sought and obtained legal advice in good faith.|$|R
50|$|The {{examiner}} divides creditors {{into various}} classes (e.g. unsecured creditors, leasing creditors, {{retention of title}} creditors, floating chargeholders, fixed chargeholders, Revenue Commissioners, contingent creditors, etc.) and once proposals for a scheme of arrangement are formulated, they are circulated to each creditor and member and the examiner then convenes meetings of the various classes of <b>creditors</b> together with <b>meetings</b> of appropriate classes of shareholders.|$|R

His slaughter yard was probably the source of meat for the butchers shop trading as Rod Marks & Co, in Adelaide Road. In August 1879, the directors of Rod Marks & Co; John Rod, Jabez Marks and Henry Saint, attended a <b>creditors</b> <b>meeting</b> and appear to have narrowly escaped bankruptcy. [...] Subsequently, John continued to reside at Porirua Ferry, but using Thomas Bosher's address, he offered to lease a shop and also a slaughter house and paddock.John’s brother, Henry Rod, arrived in 1884 and joined the staff of J Rod & Co later establishing his own butcher shop in Constable Street. [...] In 1887, John took a lease to purchase a house and shop on the corner of Main Road and Railway Terrace, Johnsonville. By 1890, John's brother, James Rod, had joined him at Johnsonville and together they traded as [...] "Rod Bros", eventually opening another butchers shop at 51 Courtenay Place. [...] John acquired a modest butcher shop on the corner of Johnsonville Rd and Frankmoore Ave, later increasing it to two stories with the interior decorated with the same cattle themed tiles imported from England that also adorned his Courtenay Place shop. John became Vice-President of the United Butchers Association during 1900.|$|E

50|$|Where a {{liquidator}} who is appointed {{pursuant to}} a members' voluntary winding-up subsequently determines {{that the company}} is not in fact insolvent in his opinion (contrary to the solvency declaration made by the board of directors), then the liquidator must either (a) apply to the Court for the company to be wound-up on an insolvent basis, (b) appoint an administrator to the company, or (c) convene a <b>meeting</b> of <b>creditors.</b> If a <b>meeting</b> of the <b>creditors</b> is convened, then {{from the time of the}} meeting the winding-up will be treated as a creditors' voluntary winding-up.|$|R
40|$|Bail-ins {{could prove}} an {{effective}} way to replace the unpopular bail-outs. In the EU the doom-loop between bank and sovereign indebtedness left governments with a major conundrum. Thus, the EU resolution regime requires the prior participation of bank <b>creditors</b> in <b>meeting</b> the costs of bank recapitalisation before any form of public contribution is made. But, there is a danger of over-reliance on bail-ins. Bail-in regimes will not remove the need for public injection of funds, unless the risk is idiosyncratic. This suggestion raises concerns for banks in the periphery of the euro-area, which present very high levels of non-performing assets, crippling credit growth and economic recovery. To avoid pushing Eurozone banks with high NPL levels into bail-in centred recapitalisations, we have considered the benefits from and legal obstacles to the possible establishment of a euro-wide fund for NPLs that would enjoy an ESM guarantee. Long-term (capped) profit-loss sharing arrangements could bring the operation of the fund as close to a commercial operation as possible. Cleaning up bank balance sheets from NPLs would free up capital for new lending boosting economic recovery in the periphery of the Eurozone...|$|R
