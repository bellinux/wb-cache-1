40|$|It is {{expected}} that the massive expansion <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods {{that went on in}} past couple of decades will soon resume after the worldwide recession. Due to its flexibility, speed, ability to deliver "door to door", low price and other positive qualities the most popular type <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> is <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road, which is also the type <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods that this thesis is mainly focused on. The goal of the thesis is to describe and explain legal aspects <b>of</b> international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road with a special focus on the liability of the carrier. The most important legal regulation that governs the area <b>of</b> international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road is the Convention on the Contract for the International <b>Carriage</b> <b>of</b> Goods by Road (hereinafter the CMR Convention) that has been signed on May 19, 1956.

40|$|This {{rigorous}} thesis titled Contract <b>of</b> <b>Carriage</b> in the International <b>Carriage</b> <b>of</b> Goods by Road {{deals with}} the legislation in respect of a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road. This involves general interpretation {{of the system of}} rules in the international private law, of the difference between a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and a forwarding contract, and detailed interpretation of the legal sources of a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road, especially of the CMR Convention. The main objective of the rigorous thesis is to describe and analyze rights and obligations of the participants to the contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by road, including the recipient, not a party to the contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> The thesis further provides the interpretation of the breach of obligations under the contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and <b>of</b> liability {{on the part of the}} carrier, and/or the sender, as a result of breaching the duties under the contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> The rigorous thesis also presents the obligation to pay damages on the part of an international road carrier, proviso and complaints under the CMR, special statute of limitation under the CMR, and resolutions of disputes in relation to a contract <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> in the international carriage by [...] ...|$|R

40|$|During {{a two-year}} period from January 1979, 260 {{patients}} {{have been involved in}} an outbreak <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> and infection due to gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria. We have examined the duration <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> such enterobacteria and have compared the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> Klebsiella with that of other resistant enterobacteria. <b>Carriage</b> <b>of</b> gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria occurred most frequently and was least sporadic in the intestinal tract. Vaginal carriage was observed in 49 out of 68 patients tested and occurred more frequently in older patients. Oral carriage was noted in 36 % of patients but was more sporadic than intestinal <b>carriage.</b> Rates <b>of</b> oral <b>carriage</b> were greater among moribund patients. Carriage at skin sites was related to their proximity to the perineum. Intestinal <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> gentamicin-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiellae but not Klebsiella oxytoca nor Citrobacter persisted for long periods (half lives of 140 and 100 days respectively). Cessation <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> gentamicin-resistant Klebsiellae was due to loss of both the organism and its plasmid rather than a shedding of the plasmid.
