5000|$|PCB pins are {{soldered}} {{directly to}} {{a printed circuit board}} and not to a wire. Traditionally through hole plated (THP) board style pins were used (print) but increasingly gull wing surface mount (SMD) connections are used, although the latter frequently exhibit solder pad contact problems when exposed to mechanical stress. These connectors are frequently mounted at a right angle to the PCB, allowing a cable to be plugged into the edge of the PCB assembly. While angled connectors traditionally occupied significant room on the PCB, flat SMD <b>connector</b> <b>variants</b> are produced by various manufacturers. Electrical/mechanical anchor points (often soldered) for the connector shell and locking screws are also provided, but significantly differ in their position between US and EU <b>connector</b> <b>variants,</b> so that the correct type must be used unless the PCB was designed to accept them both. The PCB connectors are available in variants with either inch or metric pitch of the soldered contacts. Tolerances are typically large enough to allow the mounting of the smaller connectors regardless of the pitch variant used, but this does not hold true for the larger connectors.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Triaxial BNC <b>connector.</b> Newer <b>variants</b> {{have three}} locking lugs {{rather than the}} two used here to prevent {{accidental}} interconnection with regular BNC connectors.|$|R
40|$|Connectors {{are used}} in component-based systems as {{first-class}} entities to abstract component interactions. In this paper, we propose a way to compose connectors by using fine-grained elements, each of them representing a single, well-defined function. We identify an experimentally proven set of connector elements, which, composed together, model four basic component interconnection types (procedure call, messaging, streaming, blackboard), and allow for <b>connector</b> <b>variants</b> to reflect distribution, security, fault-tolerance, etc. The presented results {{are based on a}} proof-of-the-concept implementation where connectors are semi-automatically generated...|$|R
5000|$|The four-pin mini-DIN {{connector}} is {{the most}} common of several S-Video connector types. The same mini-DIN connector is used in the Apple Desktop Bus for Macintosh computers and the two cable types can be interchanged. Other <b>connector</b> <b>variants</b> include seven-pin locking [...] "dub" [...] connectors used on many professional S-VHS machines, and dual [...] "Y" [...] and [...] "C" [...] BNC connectors, often used for S-Video patch panels. Early Y/C video monitors often used phono (RCA connector) that were switchable between Y/C and composite video input. Though the connectors are different, the Y/C signals for all types are compatible.|$|R
40|$|Connectors {{are used}} in component-based systems as {{first-class}} entities to abstract component interactions. To explain their responsibilities, several taxonomies have been published to date. However, most of them mix different levels of abstraction and fail to provide any guidelines that address different component interconnections through “real connectors ” (employed in assembling real-life applications). In this paper, we propose a way to compose connectors by using fine-grained elements, each of them representing only a single, well-defined functionality. We identify an experimentally proven set of connector elements, which, composed together, model four basic component interconnection types (procedure call, messaging, streaming, blackboard), and allow for <b>connector</b> <b>variants</b> as well (to reflect distribution, security, fault-tolerance, etc.). The presented results {{are based on a}} proof-of-the-concept implementation where connectors are automatically generated (assuming description of connector structure and middleware technologies are provided). Thanks to the element composition approach, such connectors can support more middleware technologies at the same time...|$|R
50|$|Equipment {{requiring}} video with stereo audio input/output sometimes uses 3.5 mm TRRS <b>connectors.</b> Two incompatible <b>variants</b> exist, of 15 mm and 17 mm length, {{and using}} the wrong variant may either simply not work, or could cause physical damage.|$|R
50|$|Most SR <b>connectors</b> are <b>variants</b> of SR-50 (50 Ω) or SR-75 (75 Ω) versions, {{with the}} SR-75 {{typically}} having a thinner center pin. They often resemble C connectors in shape, and have threaded inserts similar to N connectors. Further numerical suffixes denote specific kinds of connectors, for instance the CP 75-164 {{is a much}} larger high power connector, designed for upwards of 3000W, with a similar appearance to an N or UHF type. The various letters after the number refer to the dielectric material used.|$|R
50|$|Triaxial (also {{known as}} triax) <b>connectors</b> are a <b>variant</b> on BNC that carry a signal and guard {{as well as}} ground conductor. These are used in {{sensitive}} electronic measurement systems. Early triaxial connectors were designed with just an extra inner conductor, but later triaxial connectors also include a three-lug arrangement to rule out an accidental forced mating with a BNC connector. Adaptors exist to allow some interconnection possibilities between triaxial and BNC connectors. The triaxial may also {{be known as a}} Trompeter connection.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{the limited}} {{frequency}} {{range of a}} 14 mm connector and its high manufacturing cost overcame its ease of assembly and the GR-874 was supplanted generally by the 7 mm type N <b>connector</b> and its <b>variants,</b> the BNC <b>connector</b> and the TNC connector, and the later higher frequency 3.5 mm SMA connectors. General Radio, then still {{a major source of}} RF test equipment, designed the incompatible GR-900 as a 14 mm successor to the GR-874, filling the industry's need for a higher performance sexless connector for fully reversible lab standards and related test equipment. The GR-900 was in turn succeeded in this essential niche role by the completely sexless APC-7 connector.|$|R
40|$|In planar micropolar {{elasticity}} theory {{the degree}} of micropolarity exhibited by a loaded heterogeneous material is quantified by a dimensionless constitutive parameter, the coupling number. Theoretical predictions of this parameter derived by considering the mechanical behaviour of regular, two dimensional lattices with straight connectors suggest that its value {{is dependent on the}} connectivity or topology of the lattice with the coupling number in a square lattice predicted to be noticeably higher than in its hexagonal counterpart. A second constitutive parameter reflecting the intrinsic lattice size scale, the characteristic length, is also predicted to be topology dependent. In this paper we compare the behaviour of alternative two dimensional heterogeneous materials in the context of micropolar elasticity. These materials consist of periodic arrays of circular voids within a polymeric matrix rather than a lattice of straight <b>connectors.</b> Two material <b>variants</b> that differ only in their matrix topology are investigated in particular. Values of the additional micropolar constitutive parameters are obtained for each material from both experimental tests and finite element analyses. The values determined for these parameters, particularly the coupling number, suggest that their topological dependence differs appreciably from the theoretical predictions of the lattice models...|$|R
