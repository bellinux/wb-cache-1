Studies of this material date {{at least as far}} back as 1931, and it has found applications in magnetic <b>card</b> <b>strips,</b> speakers, and magnetic tapes. One area in particular it has found success in is long-term data storage; material is magnetic and resistant to temperature, corrosion, and oxidization.|$|R

50|$|Christmas crackers—also {{known as}} bon-bons—are part of Christmas {{celebrations}} {{primarily in the}} United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. A cracker consists of a segmented cardboard tube wrapped in a brightly decorated twist of paper with a prize in the central chamber, making it resemble an oversized sweet-wrapper. The cracker is pulled apart by two people, each holding an outer chamber, causing the cracker to split unevenly and leaving one person holding the central chamber and prize. The split {{is accompanied by a}} mild bang or snapping sound produced by the effect of friction on a shock-sensitive, chemically impregnated <b>card</b> <b>strip</b> (similar to that used in a cap gun). One chemical used for the friction strip is silver fulminate.|$|R

40|$|The {{fields of}} {{biometrics}} and handwriting recognition {{can benefit from}} the aggressive compression techniques presented here. A novel approach to compressing the on-line handwriting signal without losing the dynamic information (i. e., velocity) is presented which provides the means to fit almost any signature sample within the ¡£ ¢-byte limit {{of one of the}} free magnetic strips on the back of conventional credit cards. The method starts with segmenting the on-line handwriting signal into portions which may be approximated with a set of features from which the velocity and position may be reconstructed. These features are then compressed further using a standard compression technique. Here, a Huffman coding technique is used to bring the size of the average signature including its dynamic information below ¡£ ¢ bytes which is the magic limit imposed by conventional, magnetic credit <b>card</b> <b>strips.</b> Normally two of these strips are blank and may be used for storing the template of the owner’s signature for future verification. 1...|$|R
40|$|Current payment methods, {{that are}} based on cash and {{magnetic}} <b>strip</b> <b>cards,</b> are either expensive to use, or they do not offer enough security for payments. Smart card based payment systems offer several benefits over currently used cash and magnetic <b>strip</b> <b>cards.</b> Building and delivering smart card based payments systems is not an easy task. It includes several risks {{and some of them are}} addressed in this paper. We conclude that worst risks in delivering smart card systems are the lacking knowledge of merchants and card users needs and the cost of building wide-scale payment system. ...|$|R
5000|$|... 48-card decks {{have nine}} ranks of pip cards (1-9) and three ranks of face cards (10-12). They are usually sold with two comodines (Jokers) {{for a total}} of 50 <b>cards.</b> <b>Stripped</b> decks have 40 cards and lack ranks 8, 9 and comodines. The four suits are bastos (clubs), oros (literally [...] "golds", that is, golden coins), copas (cups) and espadas (swords). Unlike the suits found in {{northern}} Italy, Spanish swords are straight and the clubs resemble knobbly cudgels instead of ceremonial batons. Swords and clubs also don't intersect (except in the 3 of clubs card). The popularity of the stripped deck is due to game of Ombre which became a craze throughout Europe during the 17th century. Each card has an outline frame to distinguish the suit without showing all of your cards: The cups have one interruption, the swords two, the clubs three, and the gold none. This mark is called [...] "la pinta" [...] and gave rise to the expression: le conocí por la pinta ("I knew him by his markings"). La pinta first appeared around the mid-17th century.|$|R
