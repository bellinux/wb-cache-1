A "gravity leg" {{was used to}} control {{the position of the}} liquid-liquid interface level in the cell. A study of the extraction of cobalt into HDTMPP was carried out to determine the effect of the following variables on the extraction, namely: (i) aqueous phase cobalt concentration, (ii) aqueous phase ionic strength, (iii) interfacial area, (iv) extractant concentration, (v) modifier concentration in the organic phase, (vi) pH, (vii) hydrodynamic conditions in both phases and (viii) temperature. It was found that the mechanism of the extraction process was more accurately described using activities rather than concentrations. Both the aqueous phase cobalt activities and concentrations were calculated at high concentrations, up to 0. 50 kmol m- 3. The extraction resistance was found to arise from (1) the aqueous phase boundary layer, (2) the interface and (3) the organic phase boundary layer. These three resistances were observed to be independent of each other. The interfacial resistance was dependent on pH. The boundary layer resistances were dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions of the aqueous and the organic phases. The thickness of the aqueous phase boundary layer was estimated. The apparent activation energy of this extraction process was found to be 39. 4 kJ mol- 1.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. The {{purpose of this}} work is to design and {{investigate}} mesostructured material as a potential support for {{the reaction of the}} methane with surface NOx species. Several objectives have been pursued in achievement of the goals. The first objective is to develop a facile procedure for the synthesis of mesoporous silica-zirconia mixed oxide supports that are modified with the sulphate (SO 4 2 -), cobalt (Co 2 +) and palladium (Pd 2 +) ions. The support with requisite catalytic properties was obtained through the adjustment of the synthetic steps and optimisation of the composition. The second objective is to explore the effect of cobalt and zirconia loading in the reaction of the NOx species with methane over the Co-, Pd-, and Co-Pd-silica-sulfated zirconia (Si-SZr). A one-pot synthesis procedure has been developed to prepare the mesoporous silica-zirconia (Si-Zr), Si-SZr supports and the supermicroporous Co(II) incorporated Si-SZr catalysts {{with a wide range of}} zirconia loadings. Introduction of the Co(II) active sites by various post-synthesis methods leads to the modification of the surface, whereas the direct (co-precipitation) techniques have provided the modification of both surface and bulk of the supports. The palladium ions were introduced by the conventional impregnation methods onto the calcined solid materials. The detailed analysis of the materials has revealed that the silica and zirconia are well mixed in the framework, whereas the <b>cobalt</b> and <b>sulfate</b> ions are uniformly dispersed on the internal surface of the silica-zirconia supports. The materials prepared in this thesis possess sufficient stability, requisite catalytic properties, as well as good Bronsted and Lewis acidity. However, the high cobalt loading renders the catalytic performance of the Pd-Si-SZr catalysts. Among the investigated catalysts, the interaction of the NOx species with the CH 4 takes place at the lowest temperature over the Co-, Pd-, Co-Pd-supported zirconia rich (Zr/Si = 28) Si-SZr catalysts.
