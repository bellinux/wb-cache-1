40|$|Messinian foraminiferal stable {{oxygen and}} carbon {{isotopes}} of the Montemayor- 1 core (Guadalquivir Basin, SW Spain) have been investigated. This record is exceptional {{to study the}} Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) impact on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and global climate during the Messinian because the core is near the Guadalhorce Corridor, the last Betic gateway to be closed during the early Messinian. Our results allow dating accurately its closure at 6. 18 Ma. Constant benthic d 18 O values, high difference between benthic and planktonic d 18 O, and low sedimentation rates before 6. 18 Ma indicate {{the presence of a}} two-layer water column, with bottom winnowing due to an enhanced Mediterranean outflow current. The enhanced contribution of dense MOW to the North Atlantic Ocean likely fostered the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). After 6. 18 Ma, benthic d 18 O values parallel that of the global glacioeustatic curve, the difference between benthic and planktonic d 18 O is low, and sedimentation rates considerably increased. This indicates a good vertical mixing of the water <b>column,</b> <b>interruption</b> of the MOW, and a dominant glacioeustatic control on the isotopic signatures. According to the role of MOW in the modern Atlantic thermohaline circulation, the reduction of the MOW after the closure of the Guadalhorce Corridor might have resulted in a decreased NADW formation rate between 6. 0 and 5. 5 Ma weakening the AMOC and promoting northern hemisphere cooling. After the Gibraltar Strait opening, the restoration of the MOW and related salt export from the Mediterranean could have promoted an enhanced NADW formation...|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} type {{originated with}} the cathedral of Antwerp: instead of round columns {{with a capital}} impost, bundled pillars profiled in the <b>columns</b> continue without <b>interruption</b> through the ribs of vaults and arches - a style followed for churches in 's-Hertogenbosch and Leuven. In addition, the pier arches between nave and aisles are exceptionally wide, and the triforium is omitted. Instead, a transom of tracery is placed above the pier arches. This type was followed by other major churches in Antwerp city, St. Martin Church in Aalst, and St. Michael's Church in Ghent.|$|R
5000|$|Editors at the Chicago Tribune noted his {{originality}} {{and growing}} popularity at the Journal and so {{made him a}} generous offer. Taylor accepted, and created and conducted his own column at the Tribune called [...] "A Line o Type or Two". He worked {{on the top floor}} of the new Tribune building, which was a seventeen-story skyscraper built in 1902 on the corner of Madison and Dearborn streets referred to as [...] "Tribune corner". He conducted his column autonomously with little supervision for two years before resigning in 1903. He and Emma relocated back east and bought a home in Cos Cob (Greenwich) Connecticut while their daughter, Alva, attended Harvard. Taylor first wrote a column for the Morning Telegraph called [...] "The Way of the World". Then in 1904, he became one of the contributing editors of Puck, replacing W.C. Whitney who had died that year. During this time back east, he also contributed articles to the New York Sun. Meanwhile, editors at the Tribune met little success in sustaining the same quality of Taylors [...] "Line". James Keeley, a hiring manager at the Tribune, made a lucrative offer to Taylor in hope to lure him back to the paper. Taylor accepted the offer and returned to Chicago in 1909 where he resumed conducting his <b>column</b> without <b>interruption</b> until his death.|$|R
40|$|The arc {{parameters}} {{of an electric}} arc that is subjected to rapid temporal changes of the arc current, experience temporal and spatial variations due {{to the effects of}} reaction kinetics, conduction, convection, diffusion,viscous dissipation and radiation. The purpose of this report is to present in concise form the results of the numerical simulation of a decaying, free burning, infinitely long, axissymmetric, laminar argon arc <b>column.</b> The current <b>interruption</b> is idealized as a step function in time and the thermodynamic properties of the plasma are described by a mode 1,which assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium and quasi-neutrality. The transport coeff. are obtained from measurements performed on a free burning arc / 5 / and from kinetic calculations / 3, 6 /. The resulting system of equations consists of the momentum (1), energy (2) and continuity (5) equations and of the conservation equation for the atoms (6) and the thermal equation of state (7). This set of equations is supplemented with the heat flow equation (3), the particle current density equation (4) and the mass fraction deÂ£ initions (8) ...|$|R
40|$|Five Mucacu speciosa monkeys {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} between the order of two tactile stimulus presentations (proximal-distal vs. distal-proximal) to the lateral calf. Psychophysical thresholds for tactile sequence recognition were obtained by varying {{the distance between the}} spots stimulated. Stabilized preoperative thresholds for stimulation on the lateral calf averaged 10. 4 mm, which is comparable to point localization thresholds for sequential contact of the proximal limbs of humans. Complete interruption of the ipsilateral fasciculus gracilis produced elevations of thresholds within the first 3 postoperative weeks to an average of 3. 6 times the control values. With training over 6 postoperative months, normal discrimination recovered. In contrast to the effects of dorsal <b>column</b> (DC) lesions, <b>interruption</b> of the lateral and ventral columns ipsilaterally or contralaterally produced no deficit or a mild and transient deficit. Monkeys with isolation of either the ipsilateral dorsolateral column (ILC) or the contralateral ventral quadrant (CVQ) exhibited substantial and enduring deficits. Thresholds were elevated an average of 5 times the control values, and recovery was not observed or was incomplete after months of training. In contrast, isolation of the ipsilateral dorsal column produced little or no threshol...|$|R
