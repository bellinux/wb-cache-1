25|$|While it is {{possible}} to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact David Bohm invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables are not constrained, they <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the size of the observable universe puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a quantum computer would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially achievable task in quantum mechanics.|$|E

500|$|The letter serves {{one other}} purpose: to {{delight in the}} Drapier's lack of being {{captured}} and his victory over Whitshed. William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland, {{was the one who}} actually arrested Harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials. A letter written anonymously by Swift, [...] "Seasonable Advice to the Grand-Jury", motivated the Irish jury to stand up against Whitshed and release the printer. The Drapier hints at the letter and the freeing of Harding when he lists many other works written by Jonathan Swift, and, in the process, nearly reveals his own identity. However, his tone may not be mocking, as he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> flaunting his own position, and some have credited this idea to the incorporation of so many Biblical and Classical allusions beyond the three that begin the letter. Scholar Herbert Davis declared this letter is [...] "in some ways the best written of all the Letters".|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{returned}} to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into recidivism. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, {{but at the same}} time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as [...] "borderline" [...] or [...] "marginal". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the boy <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.|$|E
500|$|Amy Odell of New York {{magazine}} gave Heat's scent {{a negative}} review. She criticized the fragrance's packaging {{as being very}} similar to that of K-Y Jelly. She stated: [...] "Once on the skin, the scent transformed in a matter of just a few minutes from something floral-y and vaguely acceptable to an offensive mix of car fumes and that vanilla body spray Victoria's Secret used to sell to 12-year-olds", then adding that the perfume's logo and gold swirls [...] "sway too similar to that of KY Jelly's", before concluding that [...] "calling to mind sex is kind of Beyoncé's thing, which is why this fragrance <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> a smashing success." [...] Holly Siegel of The New York Times complimented the fragrance's scent of [...] "floral-fruity-woody blend and notes of neroli, almond and tonka bean." [...] On October 25, 2010, the perfume won a gold status at the Design of the Times Awards by The Strive Group. At the 2011 CEW Beauty Awards, Heat won in the category for Best Fragrance of the Year: Mass. The same year, it also won in the category for Best Fragrance at the Dutch Drugstore Awards, and Best Fragrance in the Lifestyle at the Norwegian Cosmetic Awards. It also received a nomination in the category for Media Campaign of the Year at the 2011 FiFi Awards.|$|E

500|$|John Kricfalusi, {{the creator}} of The Ren & Stimpy Show, claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump", {{which was part of}} a cartoon book series {{viewable}} online. Kricfalusi said after the show aired, [...] "I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming, 'I can't believe this! They totally stole your story!'... This idea of [...] singing or dancing and being friends, well, that is my idea." [...] Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of South Park were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company Spümcø was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump" [...] and that the claim was [...] "ludicrous". Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of Ren & Stimpy, which {{he said he did not}} enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying. Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the South Park creators: [...] "He wrote a letter back saying, 'Oh, OK, I see how it <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> a coincidence, but you should just admit to the press that you're a big Ren and Stimpy fan.' — I'm not a Ren and Stimpy fan." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN criticized {{that the}} scope of the {{campaign}} hurt the continuity of the plot, with some missions taking place several years after others and disrupting the flow of the narrative. Official Xbox Magazine's main criticism was that Treyarch had not expanded upon the success of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but had instead created a [...] "play-it-safe sequel" [...] that used elements of Call of Duty 4 but added [...] "nothing noteworthy of its own." [...] Other flaws pointed out by the reviewer included the lack of excitement in the campaign storyline and the few differences between the Pacific theater missions and European theater missions, stating [...] "you <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> marching through another European town with a lot more trees." [...] GameSpot criticized the game's use of [...] "well-worn source material" [...] and [...] "déjà vu" [...] game mechanics, also implying its similarity to the Call of Duty series' other games. 1UP.com stated that the horror of the game is [...] "almost too much at times".|$|E

Of course, both Stanley and Goldberg <b>could</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> inventing these apparent [...] "reminiscences" [...] as they both appear to have invented other details about their lives earlier, and here Goldberg could conveniently be lifting details from Stanley's earlier own mention of them, which he has heard; as Merritt observes, the factual basis for such apparent correspondences in the dialogue uttered by Pinter's characters remains ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations.|$|E
