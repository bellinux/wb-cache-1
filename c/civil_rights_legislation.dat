5|$|The march did, however, make {{specific}} demands: an end {{to racial}} segregation in public schools; meaningful <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation,</b> including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 minimum wage for all workers; and self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation.</b> However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided {{it was important to}} work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E
5|$|The Commission on Constitutional Revision {{presented}} {{its report}} and recommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969, {{and continued to}} work with them to draft a final consensus version. The proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia (who by then included African-American men and women, following passage of federal <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation</b> in the mid-1960s) and took effect on July 1, 1971.|$|E
50|$|Although the act's {{passage through}} Congress seemed to {{indicate}} a growing federal commitment {{to the cause of}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights,</b> the <b>legislation</b> was limited. The alterations to the act rendered it difficult to enforce and by 1960, black voting had increased by only 3%. Passage of the bill showed the willingness of national leaders to support, to varying degrees, the cause of <b>civil</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

50|$|Nevertheless, {{legal status}} {{improved}} across the country, resulting in easier paths for transgender people {{to change the}} gender designations on state-issued identification documents and to find professional and affordable health care. In 1975, the city of Minneapolis became the first governmental entity in the United States to pass trans-inclusive <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> protection <b>legislation.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested {{power back}} in the state {{legislature}} from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes, followed by white primaries; these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans. In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote. As a result, the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation</b> enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} NPC, in August 1945, Alpha Kappa Alpha {{established}} the American Council on Human Rights (ACHR). The council made {{recommendations to the}} government concerning <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation.</b> The ACHR was proposed at the 1946 Boulé. In October 1946, Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first sorority to obtain observer status at the United Nations. On January 25, 1948, Delta Sigma Theta, Zeta Phi Beta, Sigma Gamma Rho sororities and Alpha Phi Alpha and Phi Beta Sigma fraternities were charter members of the ACHR. Kappa Alpha Psi later was included in March 1949.|$|E
5|$|Clements' {{face-off}} with Willis won him {{popularity and}} helped him win {{a seat in the}} U.S. House of Representatives, representing Kentucky's second district, in 1944. He was re-elected in 1946. A New Deal Democrat, Clements voted to increase funding to the Rural Electrification Administration and advocated for the 1945 National School Lunch Act. He supported expansion of agricultural research and reorganization of the Farm Security Administration. He endorsed conservation and wildlife programs and additional funding to federal parks. He supported <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation,</b> including bans on lynching and poll taxes. He opposed the Taft-Hartley Act and voted to disband the House Un-American Activities Committee. His service on the Select House Committee on Food Shortages gave him the chance to interact closely with President Harry S. Truman.|$|E

50|$|A {{few other}} {{scattered}} positive developments also occurred in this period. In 1975 Minneapolis {{became the first}} city in the United States to pass trans-inclusive <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> protection <b>legislation.</b> In 1977 Renee Richards, a transsexual woman, was granted entry to the U.S. Open (in tennis) after a ruling in her favor by the New York Supreme Court. This was considered a landmark decision in favor of transgender rights.|$|R
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the events in Selma, President Johnson, {{addressing}} a televised joint session of Congress on March 15, called on legislators to enact expansive voting <b>rights</b> <b>legislation.</b> He concluded his speech with the words [...] "we shall overcome", a major theme of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement. The <b>legislation</b> that Johnson referred to was the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was introduced in Congress two days later while <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> leaders, now under the protection of federal troops, led a march of 25,000 people from Selma to Montgomery.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation</b> since Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E
5|$|The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a {{landmark}} piece of federal {{legislation in the}} United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It {{was signed into law}} by President Lyndon B. Johnson {{during the height of the}} Civil Rights Movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation</b> ever enacted in the country.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Democrats' {{advantage}} in the Senate, conservative Democrats united with the Republican minority to oppose much of Truman's agenda, most notably, <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation.</b> In March 1949, Democratic floor leader Scott W. Lucas introduced an amendment to Senate Rule XXII to make cloture easier to achieve; hoping to end a ten-day filibuster against a civil rights bill. Conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats opposed the rule change and tried to obstruct it. Lucas asked for a cloture vote on the rule change, but opponents contended that the motion was out of order. Barkley studied the original debate on Rule XXII, which governed both cloture motions, before ruling in Lucas' favor. Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. appealed Barkley's decision, and the chamber voted 46–41 to overrule. Sixteen Republicans, mostly from Northeast and West Coast states, voted to sustain the ruling; most Southern Democrats voted with the remaining Republicans to overrule it.|$|E
50|$|His {{nomination}} was adamantly opposed by Democrats from the beginning. Democratic Senator John Edwards claimed Boyle was {{an opponent of}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> and disabilities <b>legislation.</b> Boyle's supporters viewed Boyle as the victim of political payback and obstruction because of his ties to Jesse Helms, who had derailed several judicial nominations by President Bill Clinton because of Boyle.|$|R
50|$|After the {{subsequent}} intensive acts of 1964 and 1965, {{the act of}} 1957 and the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1960 were deemed ineffective for the firm establishment of <b>civil</b> <b>rights.</b> The later <b>legislation</b> had firmer ground for the enforcement and protection {{of a variety of}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights,</b> where the acts of 1957 and 1960 were largely limited to voting <b>rights.</b> The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1960 dealt with race and color but omitted coverage of those discriminated against for national origin, although Eisenhower had called for it in his message to Congress.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{nearly a year}} since President Obama signed into law the most {{important}} piece of <b>civil</b> and social <b>rights</b> <b>legislation</b> since the 1960 s.

But just as some obstructionists challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act in the 1960 s, there are those today who hope they can get the courts to revisit an argument that they lost in the political branches...|$|R

50|$|Boyle's {{nomination}} was adamantly opposed by Democrats from the beginning. Former North Carolina Democrat and Vice Presidential candidate John Edwards claimed Boyle was {{an opponent of}} <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> and disabilities <b>legislation.</b> Boyle's supporters viewed Boyle as the victim of political payback and obstruction because of his ties to former North Carolina Republican Senator Jesse Helms, who derailed several judicial nominations by President Bill Clinton (Boyle was a staffer for Helms in 1973), and the perceived determination of liberal politicians not to let conservatives serve {{at the highest levels}} of the federal judiciary.|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} {{southern}} states, {{in the late}} 20th century, white conservatives began to shift from the Democratic Party to the Republican one, especially after national Democratic leaders supported the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. White conservatives first voted for Republican presidential candidates. From 1968 through 2004, the majority of North Carolina voters supported Republicans in every presidential election, except 1976, when favorite son Democrat Jimmy Carter was elected from Georgia. When they re-entered the political system, African Americans shifted their alliance from the Republican to the Democratic Party, which had national leaders who had supported the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> effort and <b>legislation</b> enforcing their constitutional rights as citizens.|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, Fayetteville whites adopted Jim Crow and state laws to impose racial segregation. Despite their {{constitutional}} rights, blacks were disenfranchised under a new state constitution, a condition that persisted for more than sixty years, until federal <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation</b> of the mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 {{state legislators}} amended the state constitution, {{removing}} the poll tax.

50|$|In the 1964 United States presidential election, Alabama was {{the only}} state in which the Democratic Party nominee, President Lyndon B. Johnson did not appear on the ballot, as then-Governor George Wallace did not accept his <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> and {{desegregation}} <b>legislation.</b> Wallace allowed the state Democratic Party to place a set of unpledged Democratic electors on the ballot, but after planning to run for President himself (as he would do in 1968) decided against this in July and supported Republican nominee Barry Goldwater. This was the third time a winning President-elect did not appear {{on the ballot in}} Alabama, following on from Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and Harry S. Truman in 1948.|$|R
50|$|The 1868 Florida Constitution, {{developed}} by the Republican-dominated Reconstruction legislature, gave the Seminole one {{seat in the house}} and one seat in the senate of the state legislature. The Seminole never filled the positions. In 1885, after southern white Democrats had regained political power in the state, they passed a new constitution in 1885. It removed the seats for Seminole and established barriers to voter registration and electoral practices that essentially disfranchised most blacks and minorities, including native Americans. This situation lasted until the passage of federal <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> and voting <b>legislation</b> in the mid-1960s, which provided for the enforcement of citizens' constitutional rights, and the adoption of Florida's current state constitution in 1968.|$|R
25|$|The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) is a {{progressive}} non-profit legal advocacy {{organization based in}} New York City, New York, in the United States.

25|$|By the mid-1960s, the NAACP had regained {{some of its}} preeminence in the Civil Rights Movement by {{pressing}} for <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation.</b> The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom took place on August 28, 1963. That fall President John F. Kennedy sent a civil rights bill to Congress before he was assassinated.|$|E
25|$|The March on Washington put {{pressure}} on the Kennedy administration to advance its <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>legislation</b> in Congress. The diaries of Arthur M.

50|$|The {{maternal}} grandparents of Pauli Murray, Robert and Cornelia Fitzgerald, {{purchased the}} once-larger, one-acre {{parcel of land}} in 1898 for $200. The present house was built soon afterward. It is here that Murray was raised, by her grandparents and aunts, {{from the age of}} three after her mother died. Education was emphasized in this environment, and Murray went on to a long and varied career as a <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> activist, legal theorist, writer, and Episcopalian priest. She was on the forefront of attempts to gain admission to racially segregated institutions of higher learning in the 1930s, and experimented with acts of civil disobedience against racial segregation in the American South that would become important elements of the successful <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movements of the 1950s and 1960s. She wrote legal treatises and court briefs that have shaped a generation of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> jurisprudence and <b>legislation,</b> and wrote a seminal work describing in detail the segregationist laws of each state. United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explicitly credited Murray as a contributor to some of her legal briefs advancing the rights of women.|$|R
2500|$|Barbour proved {{instrumental}} in winning state legislative {{support for the}} Mississippi <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Museum. <b>Legislation</b> to fund a state museum had been introduced every year since 2000, but died for various reasons. In November 2006, Barbour proposed creating a state commission to develop plans for the Mississippi <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Museum. In his [...] "State of the State" [...] address on January 16, 2007, Barbour said the museum was [...] "overdue, and it needs doing", The proposal won legislative approval, and a site for the museum was selected in March 2008. The project then stalled for three years, however, with museum backers listing lack of direction from the governor's office and Barbour's refusal to spend $500,000 in museum planning funds {{as part of the}} reason why. Barbour also declined to name a museum commission to oversee the final push for funding and construction. Barbour announced in late 2010 that he would run for president of the United States. Then in an interview with The Weekly Standard neoconservative newsmagazine, Barbour appeared to minimize the oppressiveness of racial intolerance in Mississippi when he characterized the White Citizens' Council in his hometown of Yazoo City as merely [...] "an organization of town leaders" [...] that kept more radical anti-integrationist elements (like the Ku Klux Klan) at bay. In what many political observers felt was an attempt to disassociate himself from Mississippi's racially intolerant past as well as to dampen the criticism over his remarks, Barbour again declared his complete support for construction of the Mississippi <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Museum. The museum secured $20 million in funding from the Mississippi Legislature in April 2011 after Barbour personally testified in favor of its funding.|$|R
