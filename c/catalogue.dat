5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his <b>catalogue</b> of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger <b>catalogue</b> than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 <b>catalogue</b> contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cataloguing</b> {{has been}} {{undoubtedly}} a core activity {{of all kinds}} of libraries. As an activity it existed even before Iibrarianship as a profession took a shape.

The <b>cataloguing</b> involved the recording details such as titles, donors of books,size,colour etc. Sometimes <b>catalogues</b> of those days were just a jumbled list of the holdings.

5|$|Richard Janko, who {{believes}} that the <b>Catalogue</b> was composed c. 690, argues that {{the extent to which}} Pindar relied upon the Hesiodic text is unknown and that, even if Apollo did carry Cyrene to Libya, this does not presuppose an aetiology of the city. Others have argued that the citation is also vague regarding just which Hesiodic poem included the Cyrene-Ehoie, the <b>Catalogue</b> or the Megalai Ehoiai: the latter might have included a narrative similar to Pindar's, with the former presenting a different version of the myth, if indeed the <b>Catalogue</b> treated Cyrene at all. The complete removal of Cyrene would not, however, be easily accommodated by related evidence—it would presumably also involve transferring two fragments concerning Aristaeus which have traditionally been attributed to the <b>Catalogue,</b> and his son Actaeon certainly appeared in the poem.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} {{globular}} cluster, now called M22, {{was discovered in}} 1665 by Abraham Ihle, a German amateur astronomer. However, given the small aperture of early telescopes, individual stars within a globular cluster were not resolved until Charles Messier observed M4 in 1764. The first eight globular clusters discovered are shown in the table. Subsequently, Abbé Lacaille would list NGC 104, NGC 4833, M55, M69, and NGC 6397 in his 1751–52 <b>catalogue.</b> The M before a number refers to Charles Messier's <b>catalogue,</b> while NGC is from the New General <b>Catalogue</b> by John Dreyer.|$|E
