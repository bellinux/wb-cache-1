The Fish Market, built by John Mowlem & Co., was completed in 1888, one year after Sir Horace Jones' death. The Red House, with its imposing red brick and Portland stone façade, was built between 1898 and 1899 for the London Central Markets Cold Storage Co. Ltd..

40|$|Abstract. The {{unreasonable}} airflow distribution often {{occurs in}} the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> Some specific parameters of airflow in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> are difficult to obtain in the practical experiments. The unreasonable airflow causes quality decline and large energy consumption. In this paper, the airflow distributions in an empty commercial <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products were studied by CFD and investigated using the 3 D modeling method which combined SIMPLE calculation method and finite-volume method. Meshes of the fan were refined locally with the airflow near the walls was modified by applying the non-wall function. Through comparing the airflow distributions in the empty <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products, differences such as the lower margin velocity, the smaller width and the deviation of the main steam in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products were found...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Air {{curtains}} {{are commonly}} used to cut off air flow between the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and hot environment, and reduce heat and mass transfer {{in order to maintain}} the low temperature in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> CFD can be used to predict operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> intuitively and modelling is the most important part of numerical simulation of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> In this study, different numerical models including standard εκ − model (with and without boussinesq approximation) and RSM (with and without boussinesq approximation) were used to simulate the temperature field and air flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> after air curtain opened for 60 s. Meanwhile, the actual operation of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> was tested and the simulation values were compared with the experimental values. The results showed that the velocity of the central mainstream decayed slowly, but the velocity of both sides of air curtain decayed fast. The optimal model used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> was standard εκ − model with boussinesq approximation, the relative error was within 20 %. The optimal model can be used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> during different times in the future research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{quantity}} of the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> {{in our country}} has been rapidly rising since the 1990 s, however, the flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> is difficult to obtain accurately by experiments. With reference to the experiences in previous numerical simulations in this paper, CFD is used for analyzing two forms of return air in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> with the Finite Volume Methods and the SIMPLE Revised. As a result, Combined with the non-equilibrium wall function, {{it is found that}} taking the way of return air {{on both sides of the}} fan is more reasonable and the cooling consumption of the empty <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> can be saved before the products enter the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> Furthermore, the numerical simulation results can provide reference for choosing fans in the small <b>cold</b> <b>store...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. On {{the basis}} of {{previous}} work, the simulation condition of <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> was improved to reduce calculation error. The SIMPLE algorithm and Boussineq assumption were used and the turbulent intensity was also set. The numerical simulation results reflected that the temperature distribution was closer to the previous experimental results after using new method. The error between simulation values and experimental values was decreased. The simulation result showed that temperature of corner was highest in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> The temperature change of the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> in the cooling process could be better predicted by using modified simulation method and the accuracy of numerical simulation of <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> in the cooling process could also be validated...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{controlled}} processes is a combined optimal control and design problem (OCDP). Literature on solving large OCDPs is rare. This paper presents an algorithm for solving large OCDPs. For this algorithm system dynamics, objective function and their first-order derivatives must be continuous in the state, control and design parameters. The algorithm is successfully {{applied to the}} combined control and design problem of a <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> with three possible refrigeration technologies: mechanical refrigeration, ventilation and evaporative cooling. As a result, insight into cost effectiveness of the refrigeration technologies is generated. It is concluded that for this <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> in the Netherlands evaporative cooling is too expensive. Ventilation is economically viable if the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> {{is to be used}} in January only. In case the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> is to be operated all year then it is most economical to rely on mechanical refrigeration only and use the overcapacity during most part of the year to shift refrigeration to low-tariff hours.
