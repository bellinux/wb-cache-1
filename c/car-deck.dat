25|$|Among ship types, a roll-on-roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ship is {{more prone}} to {{capsizing}} as it has large open car decks near the waterline. If the watertight <b>car-deck</b> doors fail through damage or mismanagement (as in the partial sinking of , where the doors were accidentally left open), water entering the <b>car-deck</b> {{is subject to the}} free surface effect and may cause a capsize. As a RORO ferry rolls, vehicles can break free and slide down if not firmly secured, adversely altering the ship's centre of gravity, accelerating the roll, and possibly turning an otherwise recoverable roll into a capsize.|$|E
50|$|On November 17, 2010, a fire {{broke out}} in the <b>car-deck</b> of the ferry while en route from Oslo to Copenhagen. So far, the fire has been {{attributed}} to an electric car with a faulty charging-cable.|$|E
50|$|DSB had {{the same}} year as LB started to compete put the new M/F Helsingør on the route and later {{followed}} her sistership M/F Hälsingborg. Both had dual railway tracks on board, located laterally along the center of the ships. To {{the left and the right}} were space for a few cars, lorries couldn't be shipped together with trains however. But a strange solution for the cafeteria and toilets, below <b>car-deck,</b> made these ferries notably unpopular. However M/F Hälsingborg and M/F Helsingør became the first ferries on the route which didn't need to turn.|$|E
25|$|When the Belorussiya class ships entered service, it soon {{turned out}} their car-carrying {{capacity}} {{was too small}} in comparison with their passenger-carrying capacity. Due to their high standards of passenger accommodation, {{it was decided that}} instead of rebuildings the ships with larger <b>car-decks,</b> they would be converted into cruise ships with minimal car-carrying facilities. Between 1981 and 1988 all ships in the class were rebuilt at West German or British shipyards, with the car decks built in with cabins and additional public spaces, and the forward superstructure slightly expanded.|$|R
2500|$|SF Line begun {{planning}} for a new larger ferry for the Viking Line traffic between South-West Finland and Sweden in the mid-1970s. The main person {{in charge of the}} design of the new ship was SF Line's founder and CEO Gunnar Eklund, with her son Nils-Erik Eklund and the company's technical inspector Kaj Jansson participating in the design process. Experiences from SF Line's previous new buildings — particularly [...] of 1973 — heavily influenced the design of the new vessel, which was drawn with large <b>car-decks.</b> However, the new vessel was planned to be twice as large in terms of gross register tonnage as Aurella, and she was to have twice as many cabins.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the new Finland SS Co vessel, {{eventually}} to be named Finlandia, was {{essentially the same as}} that of Ilmatar, built by the Wärtsilä shipyard for Finland SS Co in 1964. A notable exception was that the new Finlandia would be built with a full-length <b>car-deck</b> that could be accessed from gates both in the stern and bow, whereas the Ilmatar had a smaller, side-loadable car deck. The Finlandias large size meant she could replace all three steamers operated by Finland SS Co on the service to West Germany.|$|E
50|$|On March 24, 1989 the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound. The State of Alaska's on scene {{response}} was managed from the E.L. Bartlett, later relieved by the Aurora. Suction trucks {{were placed in}} the <b>car-deck,</b> temporarily converting the ferry into a spill response vessel. The State of Alaska determined that a new vessel was necessary, and that the new vessel should be designed from the beginning {{to be able to take}} on a command and control role in the case of another disaster. Funded in part by settlement money from Exxon, the MV Kennicott joined the system in 1998.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} and exterior of the Birka Paradise were jointly designed by Birka Line, Aker Finnyards and Deltamarin. Unlike most of Birka's previous vessels, the ship was designed from the beginning as a genuine cruise ship, without a <b>car-deck.</b> Following a naming competition which drew 3500 proposals, the ship was named Birka Paradise to reflect her Caribbean cruise ship -like design. The ship was designed with various environmentally friendly innovations; in addition to exhaust and closed sewage treatment systems already used on the company's Birka Princess, the Birka Paradise was built to fulfill Det Norske Veritas' Clean Design rule relating to environmentally friendly structural solutions. Her hull form was optimised for smallest possible impact on the sensitive archipelago routes she sails on.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{her sisters}} built for ferry service, cabins were {{built on the}} planned <b>car-deck</b> on the B- and C-decks on the Bohème. The car decks had in fact been {{originally}} planned to accommodate temporary cabin modules during the winter when Lion Ferry, the company that had originally ordered the Bohème, planned to use her for cruising to the Canary Isles. Additionally a small gymnasium and cinema were added in place of cargo hold on D-deck. All stairways and public rooms were panelled in light Nordic woods, while the deluxe cabins received dark oak panelings. During the 1983 refit much of the original panelling was replaced either by colourful paintings or mirrors to give an increased sense of space. Similarly much of the upholstery and carpets were changed into cheerier colours.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately for the Kulshan, {{her open}} decks and flat, barge-like {{appearance}} made her infamous in Puget Sound, rather than beloved and appreciated. Unlike her numerous Washington passenger ferry sailing companions, the Kulshan was considered [...] "ugly" [...] {{as well as}} [...] "loathed" [...] and [...] "despised". [...] Experienced cross-sound travellers were accustomed to getting on board - either on foot or with their vehicle - and then going upstairs to either the lounge for resting or the on-board galley for refreshments. On the MV Kulshan, however, {{this was not an}} option. While there were public restrooms on board, the vessel was not equipped with, nor did it have room for, the usual Washington State Ferry accommodations. Passengers were able to walk the <b>car-deck,</b> but on anything other than a clear and/or sunny day this was not a very comfortable option. During any time of year other than summer, the waters of Possession Sound were frequently rough and filled with white-caps and waves known to breach over the vessels bulwark, consequently soaking the cars (and sometimes the passengers) on board.|$|E
40|$|A linear Finite Element(FE) {{procedure}} {{developed by}} DNV GL {{as an alternative}} to standard design procedures for redundant plated panels has been tested and evaluated. The method is based on modifying the so-called macro material input in an anisotropic FE-model, so as to cope with structural non-linearities by essentially using a linear approach. In the studies performed in this thesis, both the initial loss of stiffness at the presence of imperfections and the load-dependent behaviour of compressed plates are addressed. The evaluations are performed in light of a number of parametric studies on the elastic buckling behaviour and imperfection sensitivity of unstiffened plates and larger multi-bayed panels. The Non-liner Finite Element software Abaqus is used as main tool. As an introductory to the elastic buckling problem, a study of the compressive strength of biaxially loaded unstiffened plates was performed. The results showed that a significant stiffness reduction takes place {{in the vicinity of the}} elastic buckling limit, followed by a nearly constant post-buckling stiffness. This implies an extensive load-shedding to adjacent supporting elements that is not captured by standard linear procedures. Subsequent studies including an initial geometry equal to that of the transverse eigenmode documented the effects of initial imperfections on the initial stiffness. The transverse and the coupled stiffness were seen to be highly affected by the imperfection amplitude, the latter even taking on a negative value for major imperfections. The immediate deflection mode after onset of compression proved to have a considerable impact on the initial stiffness. Large imperfection amplitudes imposed an advanced deflection mode in the form of a flattened buckle along the mid-plate, which displayed a lower stiffness than the applied imperfection mode. Based on a number of parametric studies including variations of the plate aspect ratio, slenderness and imperfection level, the explicit formulations for initial stiffness developed by DNV GL were compared with numerical results. High agreement was found for small imperfections and moderate aspect and slenderness ratios. Considerable deviations were seen for larger imperfections, with the numerical results being on the lower side. The deviating trend was more pronounced for large aspect ratios and slender plates. The knock-down of numerical results was found to be due to the altered deflection mode imposed by large initial distortions. This behaviour is not captured by the analytical formulations, which presumes a constant deflection mode equal to the initial imperfection. A study on the effects of various imperfection geometries and lateral pressure was performed on a multi-bayed model similar to a typical stiffened panel. The imperfections were defined as weighed combinations of the unfavourable eigenmode and the more realistic "Hungry-Horse"(HH) geometry. The HH-mode was found to be stiffer than the geometries with eigenmode contributions, and even coincided with the linear elastic stiffness for small imperfection amplitudes. The emergence of buckling modes was not considerably affected by neither the initial imperfection nor lateral pressure, considering that the eigenmode grew quite rapidly for most conditions. The practical application of the macro material model was evaluated for a card-deck configuration. A coarsely meshed linear anisotropic model with modified initial stiffness properties was compared to a non-linear isotropic model with geometrical imperfections. The anisotropic approximation showed high agreement with the non-linear model, given moderate imperfection levels. The membrane stresses in the plating, stresses in supporting frames and so the overall stiffness of the panel were successfully mimicked for strain ranges in the proximity of the elastic buckling limit of individual plates. A study on embedding load-dependent effects in the macro material input was found to give accurate estimates of the plate membrane stresses and the stress redistribution to transverse frames at target load-states. Thickness iterations with the macro material model documented a theoretical potential for steel savings for the considered <b>car-deck.</b> The latter however requires an evaluation of all relevant load-conditions and safety limits to be confirmed as a conservative approach. The main conclusion include two convenient applications of the macro material model in design. Firstly, the imitation of initial stiffness may enable steel savings, depending on the configuration and operation of the considered panel. Secondly, the load-dependent macro material input may serve as a convenient alternative to non-linear procedures in the prediction of the stress redistribution accompanying elastic buckling. However, such a utilization requires more confident assumptions regarding modelling of initial imperfections and a generalization with respect to model configuration and load-conditions to be truly applicable and conservative as a design procedure...|$|E
