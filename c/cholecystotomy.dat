25|$|The first {{surgical}} {{removal of}} a gallstone (cholecystolithotomy) was in 1676 by physician Joenisius, who removed the stones from a spontaneously occurring biliary fistula. Stough Hobbs in 1867 performed the first recorded <b>cholecystotomy,</b> although such an operation was in fact described earlier by French surgeon Jean-Louis Petit in the mid eighteenth century. German surgeon Carl Langenbuch performed the first cholecystectomy in 1882 for a sufferer of cholelithiasis. Before this, surgery had focused on creating a fistula for drainage of gallstones. Langenbuch reasoned that given several other species of mammal has no gallbladder, humans could survive without one.|$|E
25|$|William Stewart Halsted, M.D. (September 23, 1852 – September 7, 1922) was an American {{surgeon who}} {{emphasized}} strict aseptic technique during surgical procedures, {{was an early}} champion of newly discovered anesthetics, and introduced several new operations, including the radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Halsted returned to New York in 1880 {{and for the next}} six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. He operated at multiple hospitals, including Roosevelt Hospital, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Charity Hospital, Emigrant Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and Chambers Street Hospital. He was an extremely popular, inspiring and charismatic teacher. In 1882 he performed one of the first gallbladder operations in the United States (a <b>cholecystotomy</b> performed on his mother on the kitchen table at 2am). Halsted also performed one of the first blood transfusions in the United States. He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth. He found her moribund from blood loss, and in a bold move withdrew his own blood, transfused his blood into his sister, and then operated on her to save her life.|$|E

5000|$|A cholecystostomy or <b>cholecystotomy</b> is a {{procedure}} where a stoma is {{created in the}} gallbladder, which can facilitate placement of a tube for drainage, first performed by American surgeon, Dr. John Stough Bobbs, in 1867. It is sometimes used in cases of cholecystitis where the person is ill, {{and there is a}} need to delay or defer cholecystectomy. The first endoscopic cholecystostomy was performed by Drs. Todd Baron and Mark Topazian in 2007 using ultrasound guidance to puncture the stomach wall and place a plastic biliary catheter for gallbladder drainage.|$|E

30|$|Cholecystitis is {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. There is growing evidence in the literature associating the use of targeted therapeutic agents with acute acalculous cholecystitis, particularly everolimus and sunitinib [45, 46]. Tirumani et al. examined the use of molecular-targeted therapies (sunitinib, bevacizumab, everolimus, and sorafenib) and associated gallbladder complications and found acute cholecystitis in 66  % of patients with variable onset between 2  weeks and 5  months [47]. These patients ultimately required dose reduction, temporary discontinuation of the therapy, or permanent discontinuation of the therapy with 50  % requiring either cholecystectomy or <b>cholecystotomy</b> [47].|$|E
40|$|Acute acalculous {{cholecystitis}} (AC) is {{an inflammatory}} {{process of the}} gallbladder, often caused by other severe diseases. The etiology is multifactorial, but the pathogenesis is in all cases {{a reduction in the}} gallbladder's emptying capacity. The mortality of AC reaches 85 % without treatment. This fact makes it important to consider AC as a possible complication to major surgery, multi-trauma, and artificial ventilation. Symptoms resemble "normal" cholecystitis, but may be masked by the underlying severe disease. Fever without known focus may be the only symptom. Ultrasound, CT-scanning or cholangiography are used to verify the diagnosis, supplemented by laboratory investigations. Treatment is cholecystectomy. Percutaneous ultrasonic guided <b>cholecystotomy</b> is a good alternative if the diagnosis made in an early stage. The mortality is considerably reduced by early intervention...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Extracorporeal {{shockwave}} lithotripsy (ECSWL) for gallstones {{is rarely}} used {{due to high}} recurrence rates, but {{has been reported to}} be effective in some circumstances. Presentation of case: We describe a case of a failed attempt at laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to gallbladder contraction and complete obliteration of Calot’s triangle. <b>Cholecystotomy</b> was performed to remove all visible stones, and completed by a subtotal cholecystectomy and closure of the gallbladder remnant. The patient remained symptomatic due to a residual stone in the Hartmann’s pouch. ECSWL was attempted to fragment the stone; however, follow-up imaging showed persistence of the calculus. Discussion: Literature review shows that ECSWL for multiple gallbladder stones has a low success rate. Even if a stone is successfully fragmented, a diseased gallbladder remnant seems incapable of expelling the fragments. Without completion endoscopic clearance, therefore, the treatment is considered incomplete. Conclusion: Our case suggests that ECSWL is ineffective in management of residual gallbladder stones after failed cholecystectomy...|$|E
