5|$|After Victory Road, Cage befriended the {{new number}} one {{contender}} Sting on the July 27, 2006 episode of Impact!, by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting's agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. He {{went on to}} say that he had asked Jim Cornette the week before if he could be in Sting's corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event, but had told him he needed Sting's approval. Sting accepted Cage's offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting's decision in a backstage segment on the August 3, 2006 episode of Impact!. On August 13, 2006, Cage was in Sting's <b>corner</b> <b>at</b> Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett, with Scott Steiner in his corner, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the contest, Cage interfered to help Sting win numerous times, as did Steiner for Jarrett, until Cage turned on Sting by taking Jarrett's signature guitar and bashing it over his head—changing his character from a face to a heel. He then allowed Jarrett to pin Sting and retain the title.|$|E

40|$|Across two studies, we {{investigated}} {{individual differences in}} the tendency to cut <b>corners</b> <b>at</b> work, and assessed whether a range of personality traits predict this behavior. In two independent samples of Australians (N= 533) and Americans (N= 589), we examined individual differences in cutting <b>corners</b> <b>at</b> work and tested sex differences and the surrounding nomological network of cutting corners. Collectively, we found that men {{were more likely than}} women were to cut <b>corners</b> <b>at</b> work, which was fully a function of individual differences in psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and conscientious. Various personality traits accounted for individual differences in the tendency to cut <b>corners</b> <b>at</b> work, indicating that individuals with this tendency may be morally compromised, selfish, impulsive, and not forward-thinking. Results were generally unaffected by contextual factors, such as the hypothetical risks and rewards associated with cutting corners. In our discussion,we focus on the deleterious consequences of cutting corners and the importance of selection and Human Resource practices that address the potential fallout from having such people in the workplace...|$|R

5|$|Albion's main club badge {{dates back}} to the late 1880s, when club {{secretary}} Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge. Since then, the club badge has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman <b>corner</b> <b>at</b> the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.|$|E

The state highway heads east as a six-lane divided highway which drops to four lanes at its intersection with a ramp from southbound MD 10 (Arundel Expressway) and ramps to and from westbound MD 100. MD 177 passes under MD 10, spawns a ramp onto northbound MD 10, and meets {{the southern end of}} MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard) at Lipin's <b>Corner.</b> <b>At</b> the next intersection, unsigned MD 915 (Long Hill Road) splits to the south.

The state highway intersects another section of MD 648 (Waterford Road), Catherine Avenue, and Edwin Raynor Boulevard on its way to Jacobsville. In the center of Jacobsville, MD 177 intersects MD 607, which heads south as Magothy Bridge Road and north as Hog Neck Road.|$|E
5|$|The Commissioners {{were given}} by the state {{additional}} powers to build and maintain approaches {{to the park and}} other parks as well, this allowed the commissioners to build a series of boulevards around the city. Western Avenue from the northwestern corner of Washington Park to the location of the toll gate of the Western Turnpike was under the purview of the commissioners. Work on the road began in late 1876 and was finished the next year. The total construction cost of the park, including purchasing the real estate and improving Western Avenue, was $1,073,020.91. In 1878 Northern Boulevard (today Manning Boulevard) was constructed by the commissioners, it extended from the western end of their jurisdiction on Western Avenue north and east to the intersection of Clinton and Central avenues. In 1896 the state legislature also gave the commissioners authority over Lake Avenue from the park <b>corner</b> <b>at</b> Madison Avenue south to New Scotland Avenue (then- Albany, Schoharie, and Rensselaerville Plank Road). In addition to boulevards the Commissioners of Washington Park also gained control of other existing parks, and built new ones throughout the city, including Academy Park, Bleeker Park, Hudson Avenue Park, Clinton Square, Rensselaer Park, St. Joseph's Park, Townsend Park, Beaver Park (later Lincoln Park), and the former grounds of the Dudley Observatory. In 1900 the board of commissioners was transformed into the Bureau of Parks in the Department of Public Works and later the bureau became a separate department.|$|E
