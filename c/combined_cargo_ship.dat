40|$|Background: Seafaring is an {{inherently}} stressful environment. Because working time and leisure {{time is spent}} in the same confined environment for a prolonged period of time, many stressors present in seafaring can also be conceived of as chronic. We explored the effects of duration at sea, seafaring experience, environmental stressors, and psychological capital (PsyCap) on the sleep quality and fatigue of seafarers. PsyCap is a construct that draws upon ideas from positive psychology and positive organizational behavior, and is intended to capture an individual's psychological capacities that can be developed and utilized for performance improvements. Methods: We collected survey data from a sample of seafarers working in the offshore re-supply industry (n= 402) and a sample of seafarers working on board <b>combined</b> passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> (n= 340). Results: PsyCap emerged as a robust predictor with statistically significant relations to fatigue and sleep quality in both samples. PsyCap also interacted with duration at sea in explaining fatigue in seafarers working on board the passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>ships.</b> Seafarers on passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> also reported {{significantly higher levels of}} fatigue than those working in the offshore re-supply industry. Conclusion: Coupled with emerging research showing that PsyCap is trainable, our results suggest that maritime organizations could have much to gain by being cognizant of and developing routines for continually developing the PsyCap of their employees...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, PLAN begun to convert Qiongsha-class <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> to {{ambulance}} transport {{to meet the}} urgent maritime/naval medical needs. A pair of Qiongsha-class converted {{was not enough to}} meet the need, so some other <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carry passengers were selected to be converted to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) to supplement the converted Qiongsha-class. The reason <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carrying passengers were specifically selected is because neither the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> nor the passenger ship could meet the requirement for conversion: the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> lacked the accommodation and comfort for crew and patient because it does not carry passengers, and passenger ship does not have the room needed to house the medical facilities and support equipment, so both types would require higher conversion cost because more work is needed for both types. In contrast, <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> that also carries passengers would cost less to convert to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) because it has what both <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> and passenger ship lack. As a result, Type Long March cargo-passenger ship was selected for conversion.|$|R
