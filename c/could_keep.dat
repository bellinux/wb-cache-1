5|$|In 1975, Wilder's agent {{sent him}} a script for a film called Super Chief. Wilder accepted, but told the film's {{producers}} that he thought {{the only person who}} <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed Silver Streak, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.|$|E
5|$|In the Grisons, the {{situation}} also reverted to pre-war conditions. The Habsburgs <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> their rights over {{eight of the}} communes of the Zehngerichtebund, but also had to accept that league's alliance with the two other leagues and with the Swiss Confederacy. Ultimately, this arrangement {{would lead to the}} Habsburgs losing the Prättigau to the Three Leagues, {{with the exception of a}} temporary re-occupation during the Thirty Years' War nearly 130 years later.|$|E
5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E

5|$|John and Sarah {{were both}} Protestants in a {{predominantly}} Catholic court, a circumstance that would influence their political allegiances. Although no date was recorded, the marriage was announced only to the Duchess of York, and a small circle of friends, so that Sarah <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> her court position as Maid of Honour.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{meetings}} had to end by nightfall, {{a senator}} could talk {{a proposal to}} death (a filibuster) if he <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the debate going until nightfall. Any proposed motion could be vetoed by a tribune, {{and if it was}} not vetoed, it was then turned into a final senatus consultum. Each senatus consultum was transcribed into a document by the presiding magistrate, and then deposited into the aerarium.|$|E
5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E

5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the German High Seas Fleet {{confined}} to the North Sea with relative ease, {{but was unable to}} break the German superiority in the Baltic Sea. Both sides were aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was, therefore, to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coast, where friendly minefields, torpedo boats, and submarines could even the odds.|$|E
5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen fishing in the Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign {{had been reduced to}} a 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army had returned {{to the other side of}} the border.|$|E

5|$|However, slaves did {{belong to}} their master's household. A newly-bought slave {{was welcomed with}} nuts and fruits, just like a newly-wed wife. Slaves took part {{in most of the}} civic and family cults; they were {{expressly}} invited to join the banquet of the Choes, second day of the Anthesteria, and were allowed initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries. A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, just like a free man. The slaves shared the gods of their masters and <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> their own religious customs if any.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{several months}} {{after the release of}} Net-2, William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz wrote {{replacements}} for those six missing files, ported BSD to the Intel 80386-based microprocessors, and called their new operating system 386BSD. They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that they <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the operating system up to date. The first version of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E
5|$|In early 1922, the world's major navies, {{including}} Italy, {{signed the}} Washington Naval Treaty. According {{to the terms}} of the treaty, Italy <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> Napoli and her three sisters, along with the newer dreadnought battleships. Due to the small size and age of the ships, particularly in comparison to the modern dreadnoughts, the Italians could have kept the ships in service indefinitely. They could not, however, be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system, which provided for replacements after a ship was 20 years old. Napoli was retained for a few years, but was stricken from the naval register on 3 August 1926 and sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} propaganda of the Goan priests and the alliance of the Christians with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara. The main political reason for this decision was Tipu's belief that if he banished the Christians, he <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the British at bay. However, Alan Machado Prabhu dismisses the idea of large-scale Christian support for the British during the Second Mangalore War as a myth which {{is not based on}} any concrete evidence.|$|E
5|$|Knox began forcing Kelly to {{accompany}} him to ringside so he <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> an eye on her, making her his de facto valet. As a result, she found herself involved in the feud developing between Mike Knox and partner Test with Tommy Dreamer and his partner The Sandman, including being inadvertently hit with a cane by Sandman when Knox used her as a shield. She made her in-ring debut for the brand on the August 22, 2006 episode of ECW on Sci-Fi in a losing effort, {{as part of a}} six-person mixed tag team match which saw herself, Knox, and Test lose to Dreamer, Sandman and Torrie Wilson, in what was the last match of the feud.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E

5|$|Usually, when {{a gunman}} {{was hired by}} a town as town marshal, they {{received}} {{the full support of}} the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate {{it was time for a}} change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the threat}} from {{invasion}} muted in 1941, the Command's attention turned to the Battle of the Atlantic. During this time, the Command used the Martin Maryland, which excelled in PR work. On 13 July 1941, the first PR Mosquito arrived, though it was some time before the aircraft was operational. By September 1941, the operational strength of the PRU's first flight was 37 Spitfires, two Marylands and two Mosquitoes. The long-range Spitfires and Mosquitoes could reach deep into German airspace, and photograph the Baltic Sea ports and monitor German surface ships. Flights of eight hours were not uncommon. One Spitfire reached Gdynia, searching for the German battleship Tirpitz. Tactics needed to vary to avoid Spitfires being intercepted by German patrols at heights of 30,000ft. Constant trips alerted the Germans to the British operations, but the Admiralty insisted in the volume of flights so they <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> tabs on German capital ships. With surprise lost, the only solution was to change the height and directions of approach.|$|E
