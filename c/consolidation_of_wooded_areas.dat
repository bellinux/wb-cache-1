It grows in spots where there is thin or no leaf litter as well.|$|R
40|$|The {{holistic}} role {{of forests}} {{going beyond the}} economic function, identified in timber production, substantiates the evaluation of forests’ social and environmental dimensions. Consequently, biodiversity, landscape, hydro-geological security, and maintenance of cultures and traditions are among the manifold issues {{to be addressed in}} dealing with forests. Touristic and recreational role of forests is also associated with the disproportionate development of human activities, sources of pollution often correlated to a reduced quality of life. This paper aims at applying the benefit transfer methodology to estimate (from a financial point of view) the recreational and touristic value <b>of</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas.</b> The proposed approach relies on an extensive literature review including earlier published books, project’ reports, scientific journals, and conference proceedings addressing the economic evaluation of forests. The reviewed methodologies are then rationally synthesized, adapted, and applied on two case studies in Tuscany, in an attempt to assign a value to forest’s systems; however, only the recreational and touristic dimensions are considered. The ultimate purpose of this work is to emphasize aspects that were not yet properly considered in the financial appraisal <b>of</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas,</b> for a balanced management of natural resources avoiding deterioration and neglect...|$|R

40|$|Comprehensive {{information}} on crop damage by wildlife species is critical if effective strategies for controlling wildlife damage {{are to be}} formulated. Discriminating how landscape composition and configuration attributes influence crop damage is important for implementing landscape management techniques to resolve human–wildlife conflicts. We analyzed crop damage data from 100 corn fields and 60 soybean fields located in the Upper Wabash River Basin of northern Indiana during 2003 and 2004. We used negative binomial regression to model the rate of damage to corn and soybean crops in response to local and landscape variables. Rate of crop damage was best predicted {{by a combination of}} local and landscape variables for both corn and soybeans. Models with landscape configuration variables were better able to explain patterns of corn damage, and models with landscape composition variables (specifically, amount <b>of</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas)</b> were better able to explain patterns of soybean damage. In general, rate of crop damage was negatively related to size of the crop field and positively related to proportion of a field’s perimeter that was adjacent to <b>wooded</b> <b>areas,</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas,</b> amount <b>of</b> forest edge, and mean size of forest patches. Specific associations between local and landscape variables and rates of crop damage may serve as a guide to planting strategies and landscape management to minimize wildlife damage to crops...|$|R
50|$|Forests in {{the park}} are mainly made of pines. These trees cover 80% <b>of</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>areas,</b> there are also peat bogs of several types.

The increased proportion of medium-aged stands of trees created by modern forestry techniques have benefited Accipiter nisus, according to a Norwegian study.
