These properties are incompatible according to the formalism.|$|E

5000|$|This {{state is}} called [...] "factored" [...] because it is, technically, {{the product of}} the two photons. Its {{properties}} are rather obvious and are illustrated in Figure G. For example, if, given the state , we <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> of vertical polarization on the photon on the right and a test of horizontal polarization on the photon to the left, we know that both of them will pass with certainty. Similarly, if we carry out (center of figure) a test of horizontal polarization on both of the photons, the one on the right will certainly fail, while {{the one on the left}} will certainly pass. Lastly, consider the more general case in which the photon to the right is passed through a filter polarized at 45°. In this case, the photon 2 will pass through 1/2 of the time and end up polarized at 45°, and it will fail to pass the other 1/2. The photon on the left has not been tested and therefore remains horizontally polarized.|$|E
50|$|Following the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, several Congressmen voiced {{their concern}} about the {{reliability}} of the ICBM arsenal and whether it would actually work if called upon. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara thus decided to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> launch of an Atlas missile to verify its operability. The serial numbers of all currently deployed Atlas missiles were written down on pieces of paper, placed inside a hat, and one would be pulled at random. The winner turned out to be Missile 65E, then located at Walker Air Force Base in Kansas. This would be the first launch of an active duty ICBM from an operational silo facility, the Mk IV nuclear warhead would be replaced with a dummy unit and the guidance program changed to fire the Atlas into the Pacific Ocean instead of over the North Pole into the Soviet Union. However, the project quickly met with opposition from Kansas governor John Anderson as well as politicians from neighboring states who protested the idea of a missile flying over populated areas, especially since on-duty ICBMs lacked any Range Safety destruct system {{in the event of a}} malfunction. Even if the Atlas flew perfectly, the booster section would still have a high chance of landing in a populated area. Secretary McNamara eventually agreed to transport Atlas 65E to Vandenberg and have the Walker AFB crew launch it there.|$|E

30|$|Given the China {{market is}} {{dominated}} by retail investors who are noise traders, we argue that more (frequent) information processed by retail investors could add noise to share price. A recent working paper by Chan et al. (2015) shows that price informativeness improves after day trading was banned in the A share market in 2002. Presumably, reducing frequent trading of retail investors improves information quality. To the extent that more frequent reporting enhances more trading, our result is consistent with theirs.
