40|$|Water {{requirements}} for different crop types according to soil type and climate conditions play {{not only an}} important role in agricultural efficiency production, though also for water resources management and control of pollutants in drainage water. The key issue to attain these objectives is the irrigation efficiency. Application of computer codes for irrigation simulation constitutes a fast and inexpensive approach to study optimal agricultural management practices. To simulate daily water balance in the soil, vadose zone and aquifer the VisualBALAN V. 2. 0 code was applied to an experimental area under irrigation characterized by its aridity. The test was carried out in three experimental plots for annual row crops (lettuce and melon), perennial vegetables (artichoke), and fruit trees (citrus) under common agricultural practices in open air for October 1999 -September 2008. Drip irrigation was applied to crops production due to the scarcity of water resources and the need for water <b>conservation.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>level</b> change was monitored in the top unconfined aquifer for each experimental plot. Results of water balance modelling show a good agreement between observed and estimated water level values. For the study period, mean drainage obtained values were 343 mm, 261 mm and 205 mm for lettuce and melon, artichoke and citrus respectively. Assessment of water use efficiency was based on the IE indicator proposed by the ASCE Task Committee. For the modelled period, water use efficiency was estimated as 73, 71 and 78 % of the applied dose (irrigation + precipitation) for lettuce and melon, artichoke and citrus, respectively.

40|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) techniques can successfully detect phase variations related to the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes in wetlands and produce spatially detailed high-resolution maps of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes. Despite the vast details, {{the usefulness of the}} wetland InSAR observations is rather limited, because hydrologists and water resources managers need information on absolute <b>water</b> <b>level</b> values and not on relative <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes. We present an InSAR technique called Small Temporal Baseline Subset (STBAS) for monitoring absolute <b>water</b> <b>level</b> time series using radar interferograms acquired successively over wetlands. The method uses stage (<b>water</b> <b>level)</b> observation for calibrating the relative InSAR observations and tying them to the stage 2 ̆ 7 s vertical datum. We tested the STBAS technique with two-year long Radarsat- 1 data acquired during 2006 – 2008 over the <b>Water</b> <b>Conservation</b> Area 1 (WCA 1) in the Everglades wetlands, south Florida (USA). The InSAR-derived <b>water</b> <b>level</b> data were calibrated using 13 stage stations located in the study area to generate 28 successive high spatial resolution maps (50 m pixel resolution) of absolute <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> We evaluate the quality of the STBAS technique using a root mean square error (RMSE) criterion of the difference between InSAR observations and stage measurements. The average RMSE is 6. 6 cm, which provides an uncertainty estimation of the STBAS technique to monitor absolute <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> About half of the uncertainties are attributed to the accuracy of the InSAR technique to detect relative <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> The other half reflects uncertainties derived from tying the relative levels to the stage stations 2 ̆ 7 datum...|$|R

We modeled the timing and magnitude of the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rise {{using a combination of}} a linear trend and a step function. We calculated the misfit between the observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises and our model by systematically shifting the timing of occurrence of step in <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> The minimum value of cumulative misfit suggested the timing of occurrence of steps. A previous study showed persistent <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises in all these wells from the 2002 Denali fault earthquake and it’s major aftershocks. From those observations, we developed an empirical relationship between <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes, epicentral distances and earthquake magnitude.

The estimated average <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes due to the Sumatra earthquake using that relationship was in agreement with the observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes.
