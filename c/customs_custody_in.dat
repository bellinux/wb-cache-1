50|$|The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths <b>in</b> <b>Custody</b> (RCIADIC) {{was set up}} in 1987 to {{investigate}} concerns over the number of Aboriginal deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody.</b> The 1991 report of the same name found that the death rate <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> was <b>in</b> fact similar for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people—a discovery that surprised many—and that the high number of Indigenous deaths <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> was explained by the disproportionate number of Indigenous people <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> relative to non-Indigenous people—a factor of 29 according to a 1988 report by the commission. The issue resurfaced in 2004 when an Indigenous man, Mulrunji Doomadgee, died <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> <b>in</b> Palm Island, Queensland, an incident that caused riots on the island.
