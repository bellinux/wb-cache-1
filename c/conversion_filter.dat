40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that a scalable video codec based on adaptive format conversion (AFC) information may be ideally suited {{to meet the demands}} of the migration path for high-definition television. Most scalable coding schemes use a single format conversion technique and encode residual information in the enhancement layer. Adaptive format conversion is different in that it employs more than one conversion technique. AFC partitions a video sequence into small blocks and selects the format <b>conversion</b> <b>filter</b> with the best performance in each block. Research shows that the bandwidth required for this type of enhancement information is small, yet the improvement in video quality is significant. This thesis focuses on the migration from 10801 to 1080 P using adaptive deinterlacing. Two main questions are answered. First, how does adaptive format conversion perform when the base layer video is compressed in a manner typical to high-definition television? It was found that when the interlaced base layer was compressed to 0. 3 bpp, the mean base layer PSNR was 32 dB and the PSNR improvement due to the enhancement layer was as high as 4 dB.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{spectral}} sensitivity of five film types was measured over {{a region of}} 3380 to 6000 Angstroms. Curves of sensitivity vs wave length were produced for each film. The method of producing these curves was to expose the film to the continuous spectrum in the spectrograph, develope and make a microdensitometer trace {{in order to secure}} a density vs wave length curve. From this curve densities at various specified wave lengths were obtained. Using the Eastman IB sensitometer H and D curves were obtained throughout the wave length interval of interest. From these curves a difference in exposure, Δlog Hλ, is obtained: Δlog Hλ= log HD - log Hλ where log HD is the irradiance required to give a density of 1. 00 and Hλ the irradiance of the same wave length in the spectrograph. The spectral radiancy ratio Rλ/Rλmax obtained from the black body radiation curve for the source is corrected by the Δlog Hλ value log H = Δlog Hλ + log Rλ/Rλmax The {{spectral sensitivity}} S, is the reciprocal of H. A special spectrograph was designed and built for this work. It was designed to use a concave grating so that glass elements would not interfere with wave lengths below the 4000 Angstrom point. The film was scanned in a recording densitometer to give a trace of density vs wave length. The H and D curves for the various wave lengths of interest were obtained on an Eastman IB sensitometer.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Conventional pulse-code and differential pulse-code modulators for encoding video signals are difficult to realise economically. To alleviate this problem, a technique which divides the modulators into two stages is proposed. The first stage is a two-bit instantaneously adaptive delta modulator operating at a high clock rate and using low-precision components. Two-bit signals conveying polarity and magnitude information are produced by this delta modulator and used as the input to the second stage, a code converter. The code converter transforms, digitally, delta modulated signals into Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) or Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) signals. The resolution of the final PCM or DPCM encoder depends {{on the performance of}} the delta modulator used as the input stage. For that reason, the performance of the two-bit Instantaneously Adaptive Delta Modulation (2 BIADM) encoder is evaluated. This evaluation is made in two steps. First, a semi-empirical anaysis of the High Information Delta Modulation (HIDM) is made, because the 2 BIADM system is derived from the HIDM. Then the performance of the 2 BIADM is derived considering the HIDM as a reference. For the HIDM and 2 BIADM modulators operating at the same sampling frequency, the 2 BIADM presents an improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Of 6 to 8 dB. Expressions are established to enable SNR to be calculated for the HIDM {{as a function of the}} encoding parameters. The expressions also apply to Constant Factor Delta Modulation, and represent the only known method of estimating numerically the SNR for instantaneously adaptive delta modulators. The 2 BIADM was tested, built and operated at a low sampling rate. This gave an insight into the operation of the proposed system, and complemented the computer simuLation analyses. The principles for the code conversion from the 2 BIADM to PCM or DPCM are fully discussed. The 2 BIADM does not impose restrictions on the values that the coefficients of the digital low-pass filter required in the code converter can assume. For low bandwidth expansion rates, it was verified that a 2 BIADM-to-PCM <b>conversion</b> <b>filter</b> with 5 stages performs better than a HIDM-to-PCM conversion with a filter having 256 stages (both encoders operating at the same word-rate). A generalization of the 2 -bit encoder to a N-bit adaptive DPCM system is outlined...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the recent}} {{explosion}} of multimedia formats {{and the need to}} convert between them, more attention is drawn to picture rate conversion. Moreover, growing demands on video motion portrayal without judder or blur requires improved format conversion. The simplest conversion repeats the latest picture until a more recent one becomes available. Advanced methods estimate the motion of moving objects to interpolate their correct position in additional images. Although motion blur and judder have been reduced using motion compensation, artifacts, especially around the moving objects in sequences with fast motion, may be disturbing. Previous work has reduced this so-called „halo ‟ artifact, but the overall result is still perceived as sub-optimal due to the complexity of the heuristics involved.
