5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Sotomayor to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice David Souter.

Sotomayor has supported, while on the court, the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor has been identified with <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rights of defendants, calls for reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the space}} of only a generation, public {{education}} had left behind a highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had {{replaced it with a}} largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society. In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a doubling of the period of schooling, and a broader <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> welfare of urban youth.|$|E

5|$|On 30 September 2014, the Inkatha Freedom Party {{expressed}} its <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{residents of}} Khuma as repairs {{to their homes}} were delayed and had not yet commenced. Provincial government spokesperson, Bonolo Mohlakoana said that construction was delayed partly {{due to a lack}} of structural engineers, which were needed to assess the structural damage caused to the houses. Several families affected by the earthquake moved to a community centre while waiting for their houses to be repaired after affected families were instructed to move to safer locations.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors of}} <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> painted turtles include over-collection from the wild, {{released}} pets introducing diseases or reducing genetic variability, pollution, boating traffic, angler's hooks (the turtles are noteworthy bait-thieves), wanton shooting, and crushing by agricultural machines or golf course lawnmowers or all-terrain vehicles. Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work {{has not been}} published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists' traps. Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat.|$|E

5|$|Sociologist Joel Best {{wrote in}} 1993 {{that during the}} late 19th century, adults {{developed}} an increased <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> welfare of children. Best noted that societies experienced decreasing birth rates after industrialization, with parents focusing their attention on fewer children. According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as invaluable, adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults, saw children as potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats.|$|E
5|$|Terry Pratchett {{was pleased}} with the 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing.

Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and their failure to obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation of}} Simon the Sorcerer, which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E
