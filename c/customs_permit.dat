40|$|Consumer {{laws are}} created and {{enforced}} by private understandings and by public institutions and agencies. They are both {{formal and informal}} in nature, and they range in geographical scope from the local to the global. Private rules and informal trade customs, including voluntary industry standards, establish {{the context in which}} everyday consumer transactions take place. In many places, for example, local <b>customs</b> <b>permit</b> us to take a bit out of an apple in the vegetable market before we decide to buy. Standards-setting bodies (for example, the Society of Automotive Engineers or the National Association of Broadcasters) develop widely adhered-to standards for manufacturing, distributing, and retailing...|$|E

50|$|During {{the years}} 1665-1667, the marquis of Chamilly {{spent much of}} his time in and about Beja, and {{probably}} became acquainted with the Alcoforado family through Sóror Mariana's brother, who was a soldier. <b>Custom</b> <b>permitted</b> those in religious orders to receive and entertain visitors, and Chamilly found it easy to get round the trustful nun. Before long their affair became known and caused a scandal, and to avoid the consequences Chamilly deserted Soror Mariana and returned to France. This resulted in Soror Mariana writing the letters.|$|R

50|$|Collection {{managers}} {{are responsible for}} the long-term preservation of collections. They oversee the physical care of objects and form the hands-on problem-solving component of a collections team. Collection managers work collaboratively with registrars, who are document-oriented and responsible for risk management of the collection. Registrars maintain facility reports, contracts, and legal records associated with acquisitions, inventory, incoming and outgoing loans, shipping, and insurance. They must keep current with national and international regulations and procedures as they work with custom agents and brokers to acquire security, <b>custom</b> <b>permits,</b> insurance coverage, government indemnity, and requests for immunity from judicial seizure.|$|R
50|$|Increasingly, as land {{privatization}} {{leads to}} the end of communal lands, women find themselves unable to use any land not bestowed upon them by their families, rendering unmarried women and widows vulnerable. Many women still face legal hurdles when attempting to acquire land through inheritance or the marketplace. In order to reorganize post-colonial societies, SADC states have engaged in land redistribution and resettlement programs, ranging from temporary lease-holding to permanent property rights. Even in cases where no gender bias is officially present in land redistribution policy, social <b>custom</b> <b>permits</b> officials to favor male-headed households and individual men over female-headed households and individual women.|$|R

50|$|British {{defenders}} at Fort William Henry (at {{the southern}} end of Lake George) were surrounded by an overwhelming French force and their Indian allies from many tribes in August 1757. The British surrendered to the French after being offered terms that included protection from the Indians. Nonetheless, the Indian warriors' <b>customs</b> <b>permitted</b> the enslavement of some captured enemy soldiers and the scalping of others, and they ignored French efforts to prevent the massacre. They killed or captured hundreds of the surrendered British force, including women, children, servants, and slaves. Some of those scalped had smallpox, and the scalps were brought to numerous Indian villages as trophies, where they caused an epidemic that killed thousands of Indians.|$|R
50|$|Drinking {{alcohol and}} smoking in public are serious faux pas {{and should be}} avoided. Public {{intoxication}} to any degree is generally viewed with extreme disapproval. Such activities are perfectly acceptable in a local bar though. When drinking alcohol, {{it is a common}} custom to pour the last few drops on the ground as a libation for the gods. People who decline from drinking alcohol may accept an alcoholic drink with gratitude, raise it to their lips without drinking, and then pour it on the ground. Raising the glass to the lips signifies gratitude and pouring the drink away is thus a socially acceptable alternative {{for those who do not}} drink. This <b>custom</b> <b>permits</b> non-drinking Ghanaians to join social events without offending those present by refusing a drink.|$|R
50|$|He had satirized Oxford morals in Strepkon's Revenge; a Satire on the Oxford Toasts (1718), and he {{attacked}} {{from time to}} time the administration of the university and its principal members. An old Oxford <b>custom</b> <b>permitted,</b> on public occasions, some person to deliver from the rostrum a humorous, satirical speech, full of university scandal. This orator was known as Terræ filius. In 1721 Amhurst produced a series of bi-weekly satirical papers under this name, which ran for seven months and incidentally provides much curious information. These publications were reprinted in 1726 in two volumes as Terræ Filius; or, the Secret History of the University of Oxford. He collected his poems in 1720, and wrote another university satire, Oculus Britanniæ, in 1724.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 May 2000, the San Diego Public Library {{announced}} {{that it did not}} consider States of Grace (as well as David Hamilton's Twenty Five Years of an Artist) to contain child pornography and stated that both Ovenden and Hamilton are [...] "contemporary and historically important photographers" [...] whose work is [...] "culturally and artistically significant" [...] and [...] "within the library's collection-development guidelines". The determination was made in response to a ruling by a San Diego Superior Court judge that a man had photocopied images from those books [...] "not for art's sake but for sexual purposes." [...] In late October 2009, British <b>customs</b> <b>permitted</b> entry of Ovenden's book, States of Grace, sent to a customer who purchased it at auction in the United States on eBay. The auction price was $350.00.|$|R

6000|$|Perhaps {{the civilized}} <b>custom</b> which <b>permits</b> women to dine in the {{presence}} of the greedier sex is the proudest conquest of Culture. Were it not for the excuse of [...] "joining the ladies," [...] dinner-parties (Like the congregations in Heaven, as described in the hymn) would [...] "ne'er break up," [...] and suppers (like Sabbaths, on the same authority) would never end.|$|R
50|$|In {{places where}} law or social <b>custom</b> <b>permitted</b> it, some free {{people of color}} managed to acquire good {{agricultural}} land and slaves, and become planters themselves. Free blacks owned plantations in almost all the slave societies of the Americas. In the United States, free people of color may have owned the most property in Louisiana, which had developed a distinct creole or mixed-race class. A man who {{had a relationship with}} a woman of color sometimes also arranged for a transfer of wealth to her and their children, whether through deed of land and property to the mother and/or children under the system of plaçage, by arranging for an apprenticeship to a trade for their mixed-race children, which provided them a better opportunity to make a skilled living, or by educating sons in France and easing their way into the military. In St. Domingue/Haiti by the late colonial period, gens de couleur owned about one-third of the land and about one-quarter of the slaves.|$|R

Writing out an ad, he reviewed it carefully, compared it with others {{that he saw}} upon the printed page, made a few changes, rewrote it, and then descended to the lobby, where he called a cab and was driven {{to the office of}} one of the area's metropolitan morning newspapers.|$|R
6000|$|The Duke, {{who was a}} blue ribbon, {{felt this}} a home thrust. 'I must say,' said his Grace, 'that I for one deeply regret that our popular <b>customs</b> have been <b>permitted</b> to fall so into desuetude.' ...|$|R

Now, in an investigation, is it not our <b>custom</b> to <b>permit</b> the villagers to talk loosely and give us abuse for a little time? Then do we not grow hot, and walk them to the thana two by two - as these clerks will be walked? Thus do I read the new talk." ...|$|R
50|$|For some restrictions, Jewish law makes a {{distinction}} between the beginning of the Nine Days and the week in which Tisha B'Av falls. (The new week begins on Saturday night). For example, the Ashkenazic <b>custom</b> is to <b>permit</b> nail trimming up until the week in which Tisha B'Av falls.|$|R
2500|$|The Agency {{has been}} criticized for {{isolating}} members of the Imperial Family from the Japanese public, and for insisting on hidebound <b>customs</b> rather than <b>permitting</b> a more approachable, populist monarchy. [...] These criticisms have become more muted in recent years; Emperor Akihito has himself done much to make the Japanese monarchy less aloof.|$|R
50|$|In many countries, customs {{procedures}} for arriving passengers at many international airports and some road crossings are separated into {{red and green}} channels. Passengers with goods to declare (carrying goods above the <b>permitted</b> <b>customs</b> limits and/or carrying prohibited items) go through the red channel. Passengers with nothing to declare (carrying goods within the <b>permitted</b> <b>customs</b> limits and not carrying prohibited items) go through the green channel. However, entry into a particular channel constitutes a legal declaration, if a passenger going through the green channel {{is found to be}} carrying goods above the customs limits or prohibited items, he or she may be prosecuted for making a false declaration to customs, by virtue of having gone through the green channel. Each channel is a point of no return, once a passenger has entered a particular channel, they cannot go back.|$|R
25|$|No legal {{restrictions}} {{regarding the}} enlistment of blacks {{were placed on}} the Navy because of its chronic shortage of manpower. The law of 1792, which generally prohibited enlistment of blacks in the Army became the United States Army's official policy until 1862. The only exception to this Army policy was Louisiana, which gained an exemption {{at the time of its}} purchase through a treaty provision, which allowed it to opt out of the operation of any law, which ran counter to its traditions and <b>customs.</b> Louisiana <b>permitted</b> the existence of separate black militia units which drew its enlistees from freed blacks.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>custom</b> of <b>permitting</b> {{a witness}} to wander at will over the entire field of knowledge, hearsay, surmise and opinion has several {{distinct}} advantages over our practice. In giving hearsay evidence, for example, he may suggest a new and important witness of whom the counsel {{for the other side}} would not otherwise have heard, and who can then be brought into court. On some unguarded and apparently irrelevant statement he may open an entirely new line of inquiry, or throw upon the case a flood of light. Everyone knows what revelations are sometimes evoked by apparently the most insignificant remarks. Why should justice be denied a chance to profit that way? ...|$|R

You know I couldn't have helped myself if I had wished--that is, if I had any kindness at all. I've {{called to say}} that I am ready, as soon as <b>custom</b> will <b>permit,</b> to give you my name in return for your devotion and what you lost by it in thinking too little of yourself and too much of me; to say that you can fix the day or month, with my full consent, whenever in your opinion it would be seemly: you know more of these things than I." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1992 {{the airport}} was {{equipped}} with on-call customs and immigrations facilities provided through the Port of Panama City and was designated as an international airport and renamed Panama City-Bay County International Airport. The airport was declared a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ), allowing special <b>customs</b> procedures. These <b>permit</b> domestic activity involving foreign items to take place {{as though they were}} outside of U.S. Customs territory.|$|R
6000|$|Sotillo, too, {{had time}} to cool down. [...] "Muy bien, Mitchell," [...] {{he said in a}} cold and {{threatening}} manner. [...] "But can you produce the Government receipt for the royalty and the <b>Custom</b> House <b>permit</b> of embarkation, hey? Can you? No. Then the silver has been removed illegally, and the guilty shall be made to suffer, unless it is produced within five days from this." [...] He gave orders for the prisoner to be unbound and locked up in one of the smaller rooms downstairs. He walked about the room, moody and silent, till Captain Mitchell, with each of his arms held by a couple of men, stood up, shook himself, and stamped his feet.|$|R
50|$|Another {{ice hockey}} player, goaltender Bill Durnan, {{had the ability}} to catch the puck with either hand. He won the Vezina Trophy, then for the National Hockey League's goalie with the fewest goals allowed six times out of only seven seasons. He had {{developed}} this ability playing for church-league teams in Toronto and Montreal to make up for his poor lateral movement. He wore <b>custom</b> gloves that <b>permitted</b> him to hold his stick with either hand. Most goaltenders nowadays choose to catch with their non-dominant hand.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{it occurs}} in only one patristic text and in no {{classical}} Roman sources or inscriptions, the phrase has spawned abundant scholarly conjecture on its possible significance. Some scholars have {{gone so far as}} to imagine that all religions under the Empire had a legal status as either licita or illicita, despite the absence of any ancient texts referring to these categories. The most extreme view has held that Tertullian's phrase means all foreign religions required a license from the Roman government. But it was Roman <b>custom</b> to <b>permit</b> or even encourage the subject peoples of the provinces and foreign communities in Rome to maintain their ancestral religion, unless specific practices were regarded as disruptive or subversive: [...] "A religio was licita for a particular group on the basis of tribe or nationality and traditional practices, coupled with the proviso that its rites were not offensive to the Roman people or its gods." ...|$|R
50|$|Heavenly-related customs also shed {{more light}} on this issue. In this regard, Dirir, Ayaan and Xiddig, have become strong icons in the general culture. Some {{economic}} or life events, such as one’s fortune or birth, are marked by the movement of certain stars. The extended, common personal and place names by these terms across the nation20 reflect the deep rootedness of these customs. Although some of these <b>customs</b> are not <b>permitted</b> in the Islamic faith, their persistence within the Islamic culture shows their importance in the daily life of pre-Islamic society, which in turn indicates {{the age of the}} calendar.|$|R
60|$|By this procedure, {{the apostle}} gained {{the hearts of}} all and became in some manner, lord of the city. At the very first, he rooted out an {{established}} <b>custom,</b> which <b>permitted</b> the young maids {{to go in the}} habit of boys whenever they pleased, which occasioned a world of scandal. He drove out of doors the concubines, or turned them into lawful wives, according to his former method. As for the children, who had no knowledge of God, and who learnt songs of ribaldry and obsceneness as soon as they began to speak, he formed them so well in a little time, that they publicly recited the Christian doctrine, and set up little altars in the streets, about which they sung together the hymns of the Catholic church. But that in which he was most successful, was to restore the practice of confession, which was almost entirely lost. But now men and women crowded the tribunal of holy penitence, and the Father was not able to supply the necessities of so many.|$|R
50|$|The Catholic Church {{attempted}} to forbid this old Slavic custom. In 1420, the Synod of Poznań instructed the Polish clergy: Do {{not allow the}} superstitious Sunday <b>custom,</b> do not <b>permit</b> them to carry around the effigy they call Death and drown in puddles. However, both the custom and tradition prevailed. At {{the turn of the}} 18th century there has been an attempt to replace it (on the Wednesday preceding Easter) with a newly introduced custom of throwing an effigy symbolizing Judas down from a church tower. This attempt also failed. Today, the custom is celebrated at spring equinox on 21 March, which coincides with the traditional date of Jare Święto.|$|R
