50|$|A {{subsequent}} {{owner of}} Joyita, author Robin Maugham, {{spent many years}} investigating the vessel's past, and published his findings as The Joyita Mystery in 1962. Maugham agreed that events were started by the flooding from the broken <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> {{and the failure of}} the pumps. The mattresses found covering the starboard engine were used either in an attempt to stem the leak or to protect the electrical switchboard from spray kicked up by the engine's flywheel as the water level rose.

50|$|Columbia Lake is a lake near Portage in Columbia County, Wisconsin, United States.

This temperature prevents many types of lake weeds from growing. The lake is stocked with various types of fish and contains an uncommon hybrid bass. Four pacus, a South American fish similar to the piranha, which were thrown into the lake survived until they were caught and removed from the lake.|$|E
50|$|The inquiry {{was only}} able to {{establish}} {{the reasons for the}} vessel becoming flooded. It found that the vessel would have begun to flood due to the fractured <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe.</b> The bilge pumps were unserviceable due to becoming blocked. Joyita lacked watertight bulkheads or subdivisions in the bilges. The water would have gradually flooded the lower decks. As the boat began to sink lower into the water, the one remaining engine {{would not have been able}} to maintain enough speed to steer. Joyita then fell beam-on to a heavy swell and took on the heavy list it was found with. While flooded to an extent which would sink a conventional vessel, Joyita stayed afloat due to her cork-lined hull and cargo of fuel drums.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Silicon {{trackers}} at the SLHC {{will suffer}} high radiation damage from particles produced during the collisions, {{which leads to}} high leakage currents. Reducing these currents in the sensors requires efficient cooling to- 30 0 C. The large heat of evaporation of CO 2 and the low viscosity allows for a two-phase cooling system with thin and long <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes,</b> because the small flow of liquid needed leads to negligible temperature drops. In {{order to reduce the}} material budget a system is proposed in which a large scale tracker requiring ca. 50 kW of power is powered via 1 - 2 mm diameter aluminum <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> with a length of several m.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} laboratory tests and numerical analyses of stress states in concrete structures arising from volume changes due to temperature and shrinkage during hydration. The laboratory tests presented here deal with: {{the determination of}} heat transfer coefficients for <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> measurements of self-desiccation and shrinkage under sealed conditions deformation measurements under temperature and moisture changes and measurements of stress development during hardening for a fully restrained structural member. The thesis comprises three papers dealing with the following topics:Paper A - Air cooling of concrete by means of embedded <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes.</b> Laboratory tests of heat transfer coefficientsThis paper presents a laboratory method for determining heat transfer coefficients for <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes.</b> The embedded <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> are used {{in order to reduce}} the temperature rise in massive structures as a measure against thermal cracking. When air is used as cooling medium, relative large diameters with surface profiles (roughness) causing friction losses along the pipe are preferable. Heat transfer coefficients for two different types of <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> have been determined for varying pipe flows in combination with different temperature levels. Paper (A) constitutes the first part of the thesis dealing with the laboratory tests on heat transfer coefficients. Paper B - Air cooling of concrete by means of embedded <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes.</b> Application in designPaper B constitutes the second report on the subject air cooling of concrete. Embedded <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes</b> are used {{in order to reduce the}} risk of thermal cracking in early age concrete. Traditionally, water has been used as the cooling medium, but air cooling has shown to be advantageous in many applications. The experimentally determined heat transfer coefficients of <b>cooling</b> <b>pipes,</b> investigated in Paper A, have been used and verified in comparisons with in situ measurements at the Igelsta Bridge in Södertälje, Sweden. The close agreement between measured and calculated temperatures of air-cooled sections seems to justify the use of average heat transfer coefficients. A few exemplifying calculations are also given, and the general behaviour of cooled structures is discussed. The principles of designing cooling systems for the general case are proposed. It is concluded that it is possible to design prismatic structures, such as a columns, by the use of existing models and the measured heat transfer coefficients evaluated according to the method presented in Paper A. Paper C - Deformation and Stresses in Hardening Concrete due to Simultaneous Changes in Humidity and Temperature. Laboratory tests and evaluation This paper describes test methods and equipments for determination of strength and maturity growth, heat of reaction, and free thermal deformation. Measurements of shrinkage, relative humidity and stress development are carried out under sealed conditions during hardening of the young concrete. Results for both high performance and normal strength concretes are presented and discussed here. Also, methods for describing shrinkage at sealed conditions as a function of maturity and as a decrease in relative humidity are presented. An evaluation is performed of the free thermal deformation during the hardening of concrete where the deformation is separated into pure thermal deformation and shrinkage. In this context some pilot calculations of non-linear modelling of stress development have been performed taking stress-induced deformations and simultaneous changes in humidity and temperature into account. Calculations are made for a structural member which is fully restrained, i. e. to a degree of 100 %. A sensibility analysis of the non-linear stress model is performed and presented.

This situation may lead to a drastic deterioration in material strength where a cooling system is important for a smooth system plant operation to prevent catastrophic failure to its equipments, parts or processes. In this study, a part of a failed closed recirculation system water <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> in a steel manufacturing plant in Malaysia has been investigated for detailed failure analysis. A steam leakage of a water <b>cooling</b> <b>pipe</b> with a closed recirculation system operation made of ASTM A 106 /A (Carbon Steel Pipes for high temp service) was detected.

Detailed investigation was carried out by visual inspection, optical microscopy and hardness testing. With the evidence obtained, due to presence of water scale and prolonged overheating, decarburization had occurred.

The accumulation of carbon elements on the outer tube surface appears to show significantly higher brittle zone in the outer tube and with the presence of tensile stress developed from operating thermal cycle which subsequently resulted in crack.
