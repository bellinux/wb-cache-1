5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of strut channel in construction {{is that there}} are many options available for rapidly and easily connecting lengths together and other items to the strut channel, using various specialized strut-specific fasteners and bolts. It can be assembled very rapidly with minimal tools and only moderately trained labor, which reduces costs significantly in many applications. A strut <b>channel</b> <b>installation</b> also can often be modified or added-to relatively easily if needed. The only alternative to strut channel for most applications is custom fabrication using steel bar stock and other commodity components, requiring welding or extensive drilling and bolting, which has none of the above advantages.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses {{the factors that}} affect the fire resistance performance of lightweight wood truss floor assemblies protected with two layers of Type X gypsum board ceiling finishes. Fifteen full-scale fire resistance floor experiments were conducted using the CAN/ULC S- 101 fire resistance standard {{which is similar to}} the ASTM E 119. Parameters investigated in this study include the effects of insulation installation in floor cavity, insulation type, wood truss spacing, resilient <b>channel</b> <b>installation,</b> resilient channel spacing, wood truss width, wood truss chord orientation, wood truss web type, wood truss connection type and adding concrete topping above the sub-floor. The impact of these parameters on the fire resistance performance of the wood truss floor assemblies is discussed. The fire resistance of wood truss floors appears to be essentially governed by the wood trusses 2 ̆ 019 spacing for direct application of gypsum board to wood truss framing, insulation type and resilient <b>channel</b> <b>installation</b> and spacing. Other parameters are of secondary importance. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the fire resistance of lightweight steel-framed (LSF) assemblies, conducted at the National Research Council of Canada in collaboration with industry partners. A total of 14 full-scale fire resistance tests were conducted on loadbearing gypsum board-protected, steel stud wall assemblies. The wall assemblies had either diagonal cross-bracing or shear membrane to enhance shear resistance to lateral loads. Both single row and double row steel stud configurations with installation of gypsum board on each of the fire exposed and unexposed sides were considered in the experimental program. The insulation used, within the wall assemblies, were glass, rock and dry-blown cellulose fibers. Some of the wall assemblies were provided with resilient channels, often used in wall designs to improve their sound transmission classification (STC) ratings, to study their effect on the fire resistance of steel stud walls. These tests were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} stud arrangement, crossbracing or shear membrane, load intensity, resilient <b>channel</b> <b>installation,</b> insulation type and thickness of studs on the fire resistance of gypsum board-protected, steel stud wall assemblies. Details of the results, including the temperatures and deflections measured during the fire resistance tests, are presented. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

The journey was undertaken on a railway connecting Eastern and Western Europe that was built during the reign of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The project attempts to captures the unique sonic identities of the 12 cities travelled through, searching for similarities and differences. It acts as a personal and subjective audio travel guide and a clock for the journey, mapping the movement through geographical locations over the passage of time. The artist captures the city with binaural microphones; two microphones are worn in her ears as she moves through the city giving a personal time space perspective of the city soundscape. The unobtrusive microphones also bring the artist passing snippets of unguarded conversations interwoven with the unique sonic footprint of the city. The language recorded on the streets, stations, town squares and cafes is an important element of the piece; marking the transition from one country to another, it serves as a spatial and temporal reference for the traveler in a borderless Schengen Europe. The structure of a 12 -hour clock forms the basis of the immersive multichannel sound installation. In this 12 hour-long composition, the times of the recordings are synchronous with the real time of the installation’s location. “ 50. 06465, 19. 94498 to 45. 441058, 12. 320845 ” (set of 6 prints) is a visual record of the artist’s movement through 12 urban locations where the field recordings took place for the “Kraków to Venice in 12 hours” project. The artist as an outsider is looking for key points within the urban space, but the city imposes its structure and creates a unique pattern for each of the drawings denoting the walks. The coloured dots on the map point to locations where the recordings took place on the hour. The printed record of latitude and longitude allows the viewer to discover exact locations where audio material was recorded.

40|$|Multichannel audio {{installation}} {{presented as}} part of 'Wavelength', Liquid Architecture 9, Carriageworks, Sydney, July 2008. Curator: Rene Christen [...] 'Wavelength' was a group installation project consisting {{of a number of}} discrete works from following artists: Peter Blamey, Monica Brooks, Nicholas Economos, Jon Hunter, Jenny Hyde, Julian Knowles, Emily Morandini, Kusum Normoyle, Jasper Streit. [...] Author's Note: Guitar Environment # 1 is a 5 <b>channel</b> <b>installation</b> work featuring damaged and degraded electric guitar sounds. Compositionally, the work is conceived within a combinatorial or musical 'mobile' framework, where any mix of channels can be listened to in any balance at any time. The playback platform for the installation is designed to create a condition of instability through interference. FM transmitter signals, sharing the same broadcast frequency, compete for pickup by portable FM receivers and headphones worn by listeners. The work thus creates a sense of instability which is articulated through the sound material and platform, aestheticising interference, noise and audio damage. [...] Curator's Note: Sound artists were invited to compose works in a way different from the cinematic baggage associated with surround sound. Each of 5 audio channels for each piece is broadcasted from a different FM transmitter hidden within the space, all transmitting on the same frequency. Audience members are invited to put on headphones tuned into this frequency and explore the soundscape of radio signals which exist within the space by moving through it. Pieces of the artists works emerge and disappear into the cacophony of the cities crowded radio waves and into each other, sometimes ambiguous as to what is the artist's contribution and what is the artifacting inherent in the system or alien signals permeating the boundaries of the installation...|$|E
