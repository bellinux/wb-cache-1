30|$|Another window {{function}} {{based on}} the basic HP model was proposed by Benderli and Wey [96] in 2009. The end result {{they set out to}} get was similar to the Biolek function [95]. The developers wanted to develop a SPICE compatible macro model {{based on the}} HP memristor which would be suitable for applications in circuit simulations. They proposed a <b>clipping</b> <b>circuit</b> which will bind it within the constraints of the length of the device (D).|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} <b>clipping</b> <b>circuit</b> {{was comprised}} of four comparators whose job was {{to ensure that the}} state variable function w(t) did not go beyond its limits. The comparators clipped w(t) at its top and bottom boundaries. It basically acts as a switch in which if the comparators detect a certain value in the device they activate a switch and set the device at a particular voltage. So, when w(t) reached the upper boundary of the device, the device is connected to a voltage source of value D, which effectively clips w(t) at D. This operation occurs when the voltage bias is positive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{receiving}} {{signal strength}} indicator (RSSI) built with transconductance amplifiers is presented. The RSSI achieves high tolerance to process variations by utilizing the unique nature of branch currents in a transconductance amplifier. These branch currents {{are used to}} implement a current-mode rectifier and amplitude <b>clipping</b> <b>circuit</b> that are tolerant of process variations. An on-chip offset control loop permits the entire RSSI to be realized with only one external component. In 0. 18 μm CMOS with a 1. 8 V supply, the RSSI draws 2. 5 mA and provides 80 dB of offset suppression and more than 70 dB of log-linear range with less than +/- 2 dB error due to process variation.

50|$|The video (VF) input is a {{composite}} video signal (video information with sync) of maximum 1 volt on 75 Ω impedance. (1 V limit is for luminance signal. Some operators may accept superimposed color signals slightly over 1 V.) After buffer and 1 V <b>clipping</b> <b>circuits</b> the signal {{is applied to the}} modulator where it modulates an intermediate frequency signal (which is different from the one used for aural signal.) The modulator is an amplitude modulator which modulates the IF signal in a manner where 1 V VF corresponds to low level IF and 0 volt VF corresponds to high level IF. AM modulator produces two symmetrical side bands in the modulated signals. Thus IF band width is two times the video band width. (i.e. if the VF bandwidth is 4.2 MHz, the IF bandwidth is 8.4 MHz.) However, the modulator is followed by a special filter known as Vestigal sideband (VSB) filter. This filter is used to suppress a portion of one side band, thus bandwidth is reduced. (Since both side bands contain identical information, this suppression doesn't cause a loss in information.) Although the suppression causes phase delay problems the VSB stage also includes correction circuits to equalise the phase.|$|R

5000|$|As a result, many {{amplifier}} {{designers have}} incorporated <b>circuits</b> to prevent <b>clipping.</b> Such <b>circuits</b> compare the input {{signal to the}} output signal to detect the presence of extra power caused by distortion. The simplest circuits act like a fast limiter, which engages after about one decibel of clipping is detected. A more complex circuit, called [...] "soft-clip", was used from the 1980s onward to limit the signal at the input stage. The soft-clip feature begins to engage prior to clipping, for instance starting at 10 dB below maximum output power. The output waveform retains a rounded characteristic even {{in the presence of}} an overload input signal as much as 10 dB higher than maximum specified.|$|R
30|$|Above {{equations}} disregard {{any excess}} input current or voltage {{in the model}} space. The boundary state of the device is held until the polarity of the input source is reversed. When the polarity is reversed, it indicates {{the start of a}} new transition; the function will force the memristor to move back into memristive region. The operation is similar to the <b>clipping</b> <b>circuit</b> proposed in the Benderli-Way function [96] discussed previously, but here, there is no requirement of a complicated comparator circuit. The major purpose of using this approach to model the devices was to remove the usage of a special window function as done previously but still be able to adhere to the boundary conditions implicitly.|$|E

The position resolution was about 50 µm at a beam intensity of 0. 5 × 1010 electrons. However, higher resolution became increasingly necessary for our beam studies.

25|$|Rated Power– Nominal (or even continuous) power, and peak (or maximum short-term) power a {{loudspeaker}} can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; {{it is never}} the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier <b>clipping</b> (amplifier <b>circuits</b> produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.|$|R

50|$|<b>Clipping</b> in a <b>circuit</b> can be {{detected}} by comparing the original input signal with an output signal that has been adjusted for changes in applied gain. For instance, if a circuit has 10 dB of applied gain, it can be tested for clipping by attenuating the output signal's gain by 10 dB and comparing it to the input signal. If the circuit is driven into clipping, the attenuated output signal will show less voltage in the comparison. The electrical offset between the two signals {{can be used to}} illuminate clipping detection indicators, such as a red LED, and can be used to decrease the gain of a preceding circuit so that the level of clipping distortion can be limited.|$|R

In music the different forms of linear distortion have specific names describing them. The simplest of these is a distortion process known as [...] "volume adjustment", which involves distorting the amplitude of a sound wave in a proportional (or ‘linear’) way in order to increase or decrease the volume of the sound without affecting the tone quality. In the context of music, the most common source of (nonlinear) distortion is <b>clipping</b> in amplifier <b>circuits</b> and is most commonly known as overdrive.|$|R

This paper discusses some of the important factors for concept hierarchy formation. Introduction of approximation is very important to step up to a more abstract level concept. This can also be processed as a reduction of digraph. Another important factor for the concept hierarchy formation is the characteristics of the inference system. This must be reflected on the matching cost. The different weight for the matching cost generates a hierarchy of different levels/depths. Environment of the inference system is also important. It must be reflected on the choice of color. Choice of a different color forms a hierarchy of different kinds. Presence of noise effects the performance, but the analysis indicates that CLIP can cope with a certain type of noise...|$|R

He would also check that the tail and side lamps were carried, filled, trimmed, and lit at night, during fog or falling snow, or if the train is to run through any tunnel in which lamps are required. These checks were part of the guard's train preparation duties, and his responsibility. The guard would, also at this time, ensure that the van carried coal and kindling to light the stove fire, even in summer if the train was to be relieved by another crew who might have to work into the cool of evening or night. It was common for guards to carry old newspapers with which to stop up any draughts that made their presence felt at speed; partly fitted freight trains might run up to 60 mph.|$|R
