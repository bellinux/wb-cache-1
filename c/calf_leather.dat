40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{pointing}} out and mark the various kind of defects (mainly scars, wrinkles and fire brandings) of tanned <b>calf</b> <b>leathers</b> used in many industrial areas (e. g. household couches and car seats lining ones). In the first experiments here presented the authors try to use the same inspection method previously successfully applied to quality control of hands-made satin glasses, that is a two-dimensional wavelet-based de-noising technique of high resolution images of the leather under inspection; according to multiresolution analysis, this method produces a suitable number of decomposition levels of the image, then it carries out a thresholding operation on details and finally, using the threshold levels estimated considering the actual noise level, it assesses and mark the various kind of defects. The final aim of the work is the realization of an automatic and in-line computer vision system for leather analysis capable to accurately inspect and mark the defective areas of the analyzed leather specimens before they enter the production chain...|$|R

50|$|By {{the close}} of the 19th century, when Davenport wrote, the book had been rebound in leather. The back {{embroidery}} had been quite done away with and the embroidered sides had been damaged both by time and by efforts at repair.

No other embroidered English book survives from this early period; the next oldest dates from approximately 1536.|$|E

The spectator is typically an all leather shoe, {{but can be}} constructed using a canvas, mesh or suede body. The spectator was originally constructed of willow <b>calf</b> <b>leather</b> and white buck or reverse calf suede. The white portion was sometimes made from a mesh material, for better ventilation in hot weather.|$|E
5000|$|Calfskin or <b>calf</b> <b>leather</b> is {{a leather}} or {{membrane}} produced from the hide of a calf, or juvenile domestic cattle. Calfskin is particularly valuable {{because of its}} softness, and fine grain, as well as durability. It is commonly used for high-quality clothing, shoes, wallets and similar products, as well as traditional leather bookbindings. In these contexts, just [...] "calf" [...] is commonly used. Fine calfskin {{is one of the}} skins used for vellum and parchment manuscripts.|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{protective}} gloves {{are essential for}} industry workers to avoid hands and wrists injuries. Leather is a common material used by professionals for technical gloves. Mechanical resistance, protection against water and high temperature has to be fulfilled by leather that is intended for using in {{protective gloves}}. In this study recipes using various fatliquoring agents with different properties such as lesitin based, lanolin based, polymeric based and water proofing fat liquor were applied to produce technical glove leather and effect of each fatliquoring product on protective performance of leathers were analyzed in terms of physical and mechanical properties including tensile (ISO 3376), stitch tear (ISO 23910), tear resistance (ISO 3377 - 2), static (ISO 2417) and dynamicwater absorption (ISO 5403 - 1) and thermal stability such as dry heat (ISO 17227) and heat stability (ISO 11645). For this purpose, chromium tanned split <b>calf</b> <b>leathers</b> were used and retanning of protective leather gloves were performed by using tara and phosphonium combination. Performance testing results obtained from four different retanning processes was compared according {{to the type of}} fatliquoring material used in the production. Post-tanning with different types of fatliquoring products have significant effect on the protective performance properties of leather gloves, in terms of mechanical and thermal properties...|$|R

5000|$|Calf {{meat for}} human {{consumption}} is called veal, and is usually produced from the male calves of Dairy cattle. Also eaten are calf's brains and calf liver. The hide is used to make calfskin, or tanned into leather and called <b>calf</b> <b>leather,</b> or sometimes in the US [...] "novillo", the Spanish term. The fourth compartment of the stomach of slaughtered milk-fed calves is the source of rennet.

The AT&T version, announced at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Nevada and later made available on February 20th, 2015 has a rounded frame requested by the carrier rather than the hard-edged shape of the international version. The limited edition Black & Gold version was a limited run of only 50 devices that featured a gold coloured rim {{in place of the}} stainless steal and came with a Valextra soft <b>calf</b> <b>leather</b> case and was engraved with the production number.

[...] The Silver Edition retains the rounded corners similar to the AT&T version at the bottom edge and has a metallic colour scheme with a reinforced steel frame to provide extra strength and durability. [...] The keyboard in this version was improved to make typing easier while the corners and a diamond weave pattern on the back were intended to improve grip. Finally, bevelled edges around the front facing camera and a raised border around the rear facing camera were added to protect the lenses from wear and tear.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : A patch with <b>calf</b> <b>leather</b> pattern. From left {{to right}} {{different}} frequency bands of the underling displacement map has been enhanced on different subdivision resolutions. Last two patches {{on the right-hand side}} use low frequencies from a different sample. Subdivision surfaces are methods for creating smooth surfaces out of coarse polyhedral meshes. Due to their recursive nature they are ideally suited for adding geometric detail on different resolutions. When modeling real-world surfaces it is possible to extract the fine surface details from a material and apply these on dense meshes in the form of vertex displacements. Material characteristics are a mixture of features at different scales, which can be recovered by a frequency decomposition of an input height map. Applying these sub-bands as displacement in a recursive multiresolution fashion allows the ability to influence or mix details obtained from one or more sources. This paper presents a method for computing multiresolution displaced subdivision surfaces on the GPU that performs in real-time and provides an interactive control over the obtained results...|$|E
40|$|Red vinyl <b>calf</b> <b>leather,</b> handles, zipper, thread. 722 ̆ 2 X 242 ̆ 2 Artist’s Statement: Any {{attempt to}} fully {{verbalize}} my motives behind my artistic practice will be inherently flawed. When {{the author is}} divorced from his work, it can communicate only that which is readily accessible to its audience. Written supplements can enhance the work, but can also deny the viewer the ability to dissect the levels of interpretation themselves. Instead, I wish to simply share {{the story of my}} project 2 ̆ 7 s genesis. Last year, while studying in London, I overheard something peculiar that caught my attention. While on the tube, I overheard a woman telling her friend about her new designer, “body bag. ” My mind assumed the worst as I contemplated this new bizarre fashion trend. I immediately searched Google for, “designer body bag,” which resulted in 200, 000 images of purses. I was confused for a moment, and then realized the peculiarity of this linguistic difference. Semantically, the term “body bag” in Britain refers to a long-strapped purse that is worn across the body, shortened from “cross-body bag. ” This term conjures in my mind, as well as many other Americans, images of corpses inside plastic sacks. Conversely, the British refer to these as, “cadaver pouches. ” I repeated this revelation in my mind and enjoyed exploring the unique and macabre juxtaposition of fashion and death. I envisioned body bags made from fine materials, emblazoned with name-brand labels. I was also inspired by the rich history of the memento mori and decided to embark on my deadliest mission yet, creating a line of designer cadaver pouches. I intend to open a series of one-month pop-ups, displaying the body bags and other supplementary artwork that completes the Transmedia Gesamtkunstwerk. Overall, I seek to create a viral internet sensation, befuddling and capturing the interest of the globalized web population while also displaying the public manifestations of these ideas in reality.
