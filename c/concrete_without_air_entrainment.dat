40|$|The use of {{superabsorbent}} polymers (SAPs) {{to produce}} internally cured concrete {{has been shown}} to be effective in reducing the potential for restrained shrinkage cracking of high performance concrete mixtures. However, not much is known regarding the freeze–thaw durability of concrete mixtures that incorporate SAPs for internal curing (IC). When SAP particles desorb (or partially desorb) the “water” (pore fluid) they contain for the purposes of IC, some believe that the void space created by these particles can provide enough empty voids to accommodate the additional volume caused by water expansion upon freezing. This paper investigates the freeze–thaw durability of internally cured concrete by the use of SAPs. It has been shown that internally cured concretes made using SAP demonstrate good freeze–thaw performance when the concrete is air entrained. When the SAP was used in <b>concrete</b> <b>without</b> <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> it did not provide sufficient freeze–thaw durability...|$|E
40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} pavements have given excellent service history for Iowa. Many of these pavements placed during the 1920 ’s and 1930 ’s {{are still in}} service today. Many factors go in to achieve a long term durable concrete pavement. Probably {{the most important is}} the durability of the aggregate. Until the 1930 ’s, pit run gravel was the most predominant aggregate used. Many of these gravels provided long term performance and their durability is dependent upon the carbonate fraction of the gravel. Later, limestone (calcium carbonate) and dolomite (calcium, magnesium carbonate) sources were mined across Iowa. The durability of these carbonate aggregates is largely dependent upon the pore system which can cause freeze thaw problems known as D-cracking, which was a problem with some sources during the 1960 ’s. Also, some of these carbonate aggregates are also susceptible to deterioration from deicing salts. Geologists have identified the major components that affect the durability of these carbonate aggregates and sources are tested to ensure long term performance in Portland {{cement concrete}}. <b>Air</b> <b>entrainment</b> was originally put in concrete to improve scaling resistance.

The rate of deterioration {{tends to be}} accelerated in concretes containing higher levels of supplementary cementitious materials including slag and limestone. A fundamental insight into the relationship between cement composition and freeze–thaw resistance is therefore imperative for developing durable composite cement concretes.

Before freeze–thaw testing, compressive strengths were similar but the composite cements were slightly more susceptible to carbonation. However, the scaling and internal damage resistance decreased in the order of CEM I, binary and limestone ternary blended cements. The composition of the scaled material differed from the bulk, revealing an absence of portlandite and a marked reduction in AFm and ettringite contents. A probable explanation for the reduced freeze–thaw resistance includes the porosity differences and the lower portlandite content compared to CEM I concrete...|$|R

40|$|Breaking <b>without</b> <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> of {{very short}} wind-forced waves, or {{microscale}} wave breaking, is undoubtedly widespread over the oceans and {{may prove to}} be a significant mechanism for enhancing the transfer of heat and gas across the air-sea interface. However, quantifying the effects of microscale wave breaking has been difficult because the phenomenon lacks the visible manifestation of whitecapping. In this brief report we present limited but promising laboratory measurements which show that microscale wave breaking associated with evolving wind waves disturbs the thermal boundary layer at the air-water interface, producing signatures that can be detected with infrared imagery. Simultaneous video and infrared observations show that the infrared signature itself may serve as a practical means of defining and characterizing the microscale breaking process. The infrared imagery is used to quantify microscale breaking waves in terms of the frequency of occurrence and the areal coverage, which is substantial under the moderate wind speed conditions investigated. The results imply that ”bursting“ phenomena observed beneath laboratory wind waves are likely produced by microscale breaking waves but that not all microscale breaking waves produce bursts. Oceanic measurements show the ability to quantify microscale wave breaking in the field. Our results demonstrate that infrared techniques can provide the information necessary to quantify the breaking process for inclusion in models of air-sea heat and gas fluxes, as well as unprecedented details on the origin and evolution of microscale wave breaking...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{fields in}} the open ocean evolve {{according}} to the radiative transfer equation of wave energy or action, which has three source terms, wind input, non-linear wave- wave interactions, and dissipation. Of these, dissipation {{is thought to be}} the least well understood, but is expected to be dominated by wave breaking. This dissertation is an investigation of the physical processes associated with the wave breaking and dissipation. Data were taken during three field experiments on R/P FLIP. These experiments took place in September 2009 south of Hawaii (Radiance in a Dynamic Ocean experiment), off the coast of Northern California in June of 2010 (High Resolution Air-Sea Interaction experiment, HIRES), and in the Southern California bight in December 2010 (an extension of HIRES). Between the three campaigns, winds of 0 to 18 m/s and significant wave heights of 0. 5 to 5 m were experienced. Stereo Long Wave Infra Red (LWIR) video cameras mounted on one of FLIP's booms were used to reconstruct the 3 D structure of an approximately 3 x 4 m patch of sea surface. Using surface temperature structure as a passive tracer, pattern imaging velocimetry (PIV) was applied to consecutive video frames to extract the velocity field of this patch. An important statistic of breakers is [Lambda](c), the distribution of crest length per unit area of sea surface as a function of breaker velocity c. A new technique, based on image texture, was developed to track breaking waves on the stereo IR reconstructed surface. These waves ranged from large air- entraining breakers to micro breakers that would be undetectable in visible imagery. This allowed measurements of [Lambda](c) that also cover the high-wavenumber gravity wave spectrum. Stress (or wave momentum flux) and dissipation can be related to the fourth and fifth moments of [Lambda](c), and comparisons of these moments with wind stress and wave field dissipation showed that micro- breaking <b>without</b> <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> is dynamically significant. A new technique was developed, whereby irrotational surface waves can be separated from rotational turbulence using a Helmholtz decomposition. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation at the sea surface was then estimated using this rotational velocity field. Synchronized subsurface velocity measurements from an array of profiling pulse-coherent acoustic Doppler profilers allowed the calculation of the dissipation profile to depths O(10) significant wave heights. Tying surface and subsurface measurements together allows estimation of total TKE dissipation in the surface wave zone of the marine boundary layer. Turbulence measurements were supported by wind and wave data, allowing us to measure the wave coherence of TKE dissipation and relate it to wind and wave conditions, especially wave breakin...|$|R

For various combinations of venting velocity and smoke layer temperature, critical smoke layer thickness for onset of entrainment was identified by eye-observation. <b>Air</b> <b>entrainment</b> ratio {{was measured by}} the change of carbon dioxide concentration in smoke layer (before entrainment) and in exhaust duct (after entrainment). By summarizing the measured results, the followings were clarified. 1) The critical thickness for onset of entrainment depends on smoke layer temperature and largely on smoke layer thickness. When the smoke layer is thick, large venting velocity is needed to cause <b>air</b> <b>entrainment.</b> In this condition, flow into vent opening can be approximated by potential flow to point sink.

Free aircore vortex occurring at a water-intake pipe is an important problem encountered in hydraulic engineering.

Experiments, conducted in order to select best positions of the suction pipe of a water intake sump, show qualitative results concerning flow disturbances in the pump-intake related to sump geometries and position of the pump intake. The purpose of the paper is to reproduce the flow pattern and confirm the geometrical parameter influences of the flow behavior in such a pump. The numerical model used solves the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and VOF multiphase model for two cases. In the validation of this numerical model, emphasis was placed on the prediction of the number, location, size and strength of the various types of vortices.

40|$|The most {{classic example}} of a {{hydraulic}} structure where gas transfer occurs is a weir. Transfer of gases between the atmosphere and river water can occur in a free overfall jet from a weir.

This paper investigates the free overfall jets from Venturi and rectangular notch weirs and their effect on <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> rate.

In the process of bulk material transfer, fugitive dust may be generated and the surrounding air is entrained into the particle stream during free fall conditions. Understanding of how <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> by particles in free fall can assist {{in the design of}} effective dust control. However, at the commencement of this project, research in the field of <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> in a free falling particle stream was limited due to the shortage of theoretical analysis and experimental data reported in the literature. For this reason, the purpose of this thesis was to undertake detailed experimental work and to formulate a theoretical model to predict the volume of <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> by free falling particles as a function of material properties and process parameters. A series of experiments were performed to demonstrate the measurement methodology for <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> by free falling particles. To obtain detailed information on the characteristics of <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> and falling particle systems, a systematic experimental investigation was undertaken into the dynamics of a stream of particles and the associated entrained air flow. These experiments, were carried out to investigate the effects of material properties and material process parameters, such as mass flow rate of bulk material, particle size distribution, particle density, outlet size of the discharging hopper and particle drop height. A significant finding in the experimental work was that the core of free falling particles contracted immediately after exit from the outlet of a hopper, and thereafter maintained an approximately constant radius for a considerable height. However, the dilation of the bulk material was not homogeneous, and the core of the particle stream appeared to break up into different sizes and shapes of individual clouds. Eventually, these particle clouds tended to dissipate and the falling particles spread out with drop height. A mathematical model to predict the quantity of <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> in free falling particles was developed and numerical solutions obtained. Experiments were also conducted to determine the velocity profile of the entrained air flow. In the experimental investigation, the <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> constant was found to be varied with different bulk materials. The comparison {{of the results of the}} present study on the <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> in the particle plume and previous research indicated that the entrainment capability of the particle plume is less than that of miscible plumes, bubble plumes and droplet-driven spray flows...|$|R
