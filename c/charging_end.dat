40|$|Analog {{to digital}} {{switchover}} of TV transmission has freed {{up a large}} amount of licensed spectrum. This spectrum {{is in the form of}} chunks, referred as TV White Spaces (TVWS). It is made compulsory by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for unlicensed users to access TVWS through Access Points (APs), who have to query a FCC approved database e. g., WhiteNet, periodically to avail the free spectrum. It is important that for efficient utilization of available spectrum, APs must assign spectrum to end users based on their Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Moreover, care must be taken in <b>charging</b> <b>end</b> users while meeting their QoS requirements, as different end users demand different pricing schemes i. e., fixed pricing and variable pricing. Considering these challenges, a pre-existing database architecture (WhiteNet) has been modified in this paper by adding new features in it. It is proposed to characterize end users’ QoS requirements in the form of demand indices and provide admission control on the basis of pricing schemes. It is proved with our experimental results that our proposed scheme is a useful addition in FCC’s TVWS database framework...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of surface film on aspect of chemical composition and thickness is monitored on a nickel-doped manganese spinel positive electrode (LNMO, LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4) for lithium-ion batteries. In the first charging from 4. 2 to 4. 9 V (vs. Li/Li+), {{large amount of}} lithium fluoride (LiF) deposits at lower potentials (4. 2 V) but it is removed when the electrode potential moves to the <b>charging</b> <b>end</b> (4. 9 V). The phenomenon of LiF deposition at lower potentials and removal at higher potentials is repeated in the continuing cycles, but the overall LiF concentration becomes progressively lower for the surface films to be enriched by the carbon-containing organic species in the later cycles. Due to the highly resistive nature of LiF, the film resistance shows a strong correlation with the LiF concentration in the films. From the finding that LiF formation {{is the most significant}} at 4. 2 V in every cycle, under which circumstances LNMO itself is fully lithiated to provide lithium source for LiF formation, hydrogen fluoride (HF) attack on the LNMO surface has been proposed to be the major route for LiF formation...|$|E
40|$|Electrolyte plays {{a crucial}} role for dual-ion {{batteries}} by supplying the ions to be intercalated into electrodes. Yet, high operation potentials of such batteries limit the number of suitable electrolytes to be used since they have to be stable upon cycling. Here, sodium-based electrolytes were investigated by applying stability and cycling tests in order to observe their influences on anion intercalation behavior using graphitic cathodes. Intercalation of PF 6 − anions with organic carbonate solvents revealed relatively better discharge capacities compared to its anionic counterparts and 0. 5 M NaPF 6 /EC:EMC electrolyte was found to be the most promising mixture among them. PC solvent proved detrimental for anion intercalation, but FEC as an electrolyte additive in PC precluded undesired effects of PC and gave rise to reversible cycling. However, the ionic liquids based on TFSI− and FSI− anions, mostly, yielded capacity fading under a <b>charging</b> <b>end</b> potential of 5. 0 V vs. Na/Na+, except the 0. 7 M NaTFSI/Pip 14 TFSI electrolyte, showing 98 % coulombic efficiency over 200 cycles. During this work, electrochemical tests were conducted and evaluated to comprehend the impacts of electrolytes on the anion intercalation process. EC:EMC-based electrolyte was then used in our further research, where the compositional cathodic investigation was executed and the anion intercalation phenomenon was characterized...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent decades}} the Public Private Partnership (PPP) {{has been widely}} {{regarded}} as an innovative way to construct transport infrastructures and {{to improve the quality}} of service. As the number of PPP cases has increased, many countries have tried to standardise PPP models to minimise the costs of trial and error. South Korea, where 426 PPP projects have been undertaken since 1994, usually preferred the BTO (Build-Transfer-Operate) model for transport. In the BTO model, the private sector recoups its investment by <b>charging</b> <b>end</b> users directly and hence should bear the traffic demand risk. However, the Korean Government shared the demand risk through a minimum revenue guarantee to induce private sector involvement, and this led to many criticisms of the BTO model. Tariffs in the BTO case were much higher than those of public operators, but the Government still had to pay large amounts of guaranteed revenue. Thus, BTL (Build-Transfer-Lease), where the demand risk is on the public sector, has become an alternative model. The BTL is the “service sold to the public sector” model which is similar to the DBFO (Design-Build-Finance-Operate) in the UK. This thesis examines which of the BTO and the BTL PPP models is optimal to save governmental expenditure for transport infrastructures such as road and rail. Appropriate traffic demand risk sharing, which a particularly controversial issue in South Korea, is explored. These research objectives are examined through five case studies: the Incheon Airport Expressway and the Oksan-Ochang Expressway cases for road PPP; the Incheon Airport Railway, the Daegok-Sosa Railway and the Seoul Metro 9 cases for rail PPP. Through a detailed literature review and five case studies, the thesis shows that the optimal PPP model, which is measured by the VFM (Value for Money) assessment, needs to satisfy the interests of public sector, private sector, and end users. Based on these assessments and including these three viewpoints, it is concluded that the optimal PPP model for road can be the BTL where the public sector can save expenditure or reduce the level of tariff. Traffic demand risk for roads is relatively low, so the public sector does not have to transfer it to the private sector with high profit rate. In the case of rail, the limited revenue and high cost make a project difficult to be financially free standing by the BTO model. However, the BTO can be a better option in urban rail if traffic demand risk is shared appropriately...|$|E

40|$|Accounting of {{telecommunication}} services {{is closely related}} to the functions of authentication and authorization. These functions are usually considered together and implemented within the same server using a common protocol. The most renowned protocols for authentication, authorization and accounting are the RADIUS and Diameter protocols.   AAA functions and related protocols   In this chapter, the accounting management architecture developed by IETF is presented. It includes the interaction between network elements, accounting servers and billing and charging servers. Accounting data can be used for management, planning and charging users as well as other (specific) purposes. Authentication is the process of confirming a user's digital identity, usually through some type of identifiers and related data. Authorization determines whether a particular entity is authorized to perform an activity.   Basic Functions of the RADIUS Protocol   The RADIUS architecture is based on a client-server model. It uses UDP on the transport layer. Transactions between the client and the server are authenticated, which is achieved by using a common secret key that is never sent through the network. Given the limited resources available to network devices, RADIUS facilitates and centralizes <b>charging</b> <b>end</b> users, provides some protection against active attacks by unauthorized users and it has great support from different network equipment vendors. Although RADIUS is a widely accepted protocol for the mechanisms of authentication, authorization and accounting, it has certain shortcomings that may be caused by the protocol itself or by its poor implementation.   Architecture and Operation of the Diameter Protocol   Diameter is a scalable protocol designed by the IETF working group in order to eliminate shortcomings and functional limitations of the RADIUS protocol and eventually to replace it in the near future. Most of the basic Diameter mechanisms and its functionality are based on the fundamental functionality of the RADIUS protocol and the rest is a result of new solutions and improvements to the existing ideas. The Diameter protocol focuses on the expansion of flexible, advanced routing algorithms, dynamic troubleshooting and safety characteristics of the transport layer. This paper defines the basic packet formats, data transfer mechanisms and error management, methods of communication between individual elements of the architecture and basic security functions. The Diameter protocol architecture is based on the peer-to-peer model. Besides clients and servers, network agents can be the elements of this architecture. The Diameter agent is an element that does not allow authentication / authorization locally, but the server performs this operation, while one node can be both the client and the server simultaneously. The role of agents can be forwarding (Relay Agent), redirection (Redirect Agent), mediation (Proxy Agent) and translation (Translation Agent). Since the peer-to-peer model is applied, each Diameter element can establish more connections at the same time. Diameter enables the delivery of attribute value pairs, the possibility of negotiation, error notification, extensibility by adding new commands and attribute value pairs, the basic services necessary for applications such as managing user sessions or accounting.   Comparison of the RADIUS and Diameter protocols   Although at the protocol market for authentication, authorization and accounting, the RADIUS protocol remains the most popular, its popularity and dominance has a decreasing tendency. The main reasons for this are more prominent limitations which are particularly perceived due to new and increasingly popular technology. Therefore, the main issue is about a protocol that will replace RADIUS. The peer-to-peer architecture used by Diameter is much more flexible than the client-server model because in the peer-to-peer architecture every element can be both the client and the server, depending on the current needs of the network. At the transport layer, Diameter uses the TCP or SCTP protocols. When compared to UDP, these protocols provide reliable transmission which is very important for applications exchanging data related to accounting. In addition, the Diameter protocol allows the transmission of accounting information in real time and it incorporates several methods for troubleshooting in order to minimize the loss of accounting data when a failure occurs, which is not the case with RADIUS. Given the present benefits, introduced improvements, flexibility, expandability, IETF and 3 GPP's support and the support of big companies, there is a great chance that Diameter will replace RADIUS.   Conclusion   This paper presents a general overview of the RADIUS and Diameter protocols, including some of their basic operations with a special emphasis on accounting applications. The similarities of these protocols are reflected in the support of the same functions in a similar format of the packages. The differences are related to the protocol architectures and the methods of determining authentication, authorization and accounting mechanisms. Regarding accounting aspects, the most important advantages of the Diameter protocol are its possibility to transmit accounting information in real time and implemented mechanisms for troubleshooting in order to minimize the loss of accounting data in case of failure. Owing to to these characteristics, the Diameter protocol achieves a significant advantage over RADIUS in next generation networks. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{simulate}} the electromechanical behavior of freestanding and clamped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) subjected to an electric potential and displaying <b>charge</b> <b>end</b> enhancements. In this case, CNT deformation {{is a consequence}} of the electrostatic pressure associated with the charge density. Whereas experiments investigate several micron long CNTs, computational models consider nanometer-sized CNTs. Hence, experimental and computational results, often, cannot be compared. Analytical solutions appear thus useful as reference solutions for finite element analysis, alternative to atomistic simulations, and complementary to experimental tests. In this work, the electromechanical behavior of CNTs is computed by using the nonlocal Poisson equation obtained extending the charge transport equations for spatially variable currents. Based on a certain equivalence between gradient and integral formulations, we solve the problem governing the electromechanical problem of CNTs regarded as cylinders subjected to electrostatic forces. The present procedure automatically captures <b>charge</b> <b>end</b> enhancements, thus overcoming the necessity of introducing suitable <b>charge</b> <b>end</b> correction factors. The analytical expressions of the radial displacement of freestanding CNTs, and the deflection of bent CNTs are obtained. For armchair single wall CNTs, the results obtained are consistent with experiments, and molecular mechanics and atomistic simulations.
