50|$|DSAP was {{fiercely}} {{opposed to}} the pro-National Socialist Young German Party (JdP), which had its base in Bielsko. The rise in popularity of National Socialism amongst the Germans in Poland would prove disastrous for the DSAP. In Upper Silesia, support for the party rapidly eroded after the 1933 Machtübernahme. In September-October 1933 DSAP joined the <b>call</b> <b>initiated</b> by the Bund for boycott of goods from Germany, in protest of the Hitler regime. The boycott call became controversial within DSAP, and some members (such as Arthur Kronig, Otto Heike, Ludwig Kuk and Gustav Ewald) left the party as a result.In 1932 the DSAP had 5,429 members in Upper Silesia. By 1937 the number had declined to 560. As of early 1936, the party had only three functioning branches in Upper Silesia, Katowice, Chorzów and Bielszowice. The Bielszowice branch went defunct {{before the end of}} the year, though. By March 1937, the remainder of the DSAP branch in Chorzów joined the PPS.|$|E
30|$|This {{article focuses}} on VoLTE {{end-to-end}} delay in a heterogeneous wireless communication scenario when a VoLTE <b>call</b> <b>initiated</b> in the E-UTRAN and then handed over to a legacy GERAN/UTRAN radio area. A VoLTE inter-RAT handover mechanism is presented that enables voice and data sessions continuity between these different radio access technologies based on the 3 GPP standardization.|$|E
40|$|The next {{generation}} of mobile networks is expected to utilise multiple radio access technologies, seamlessly integrated to form a heterogeneous wireless network. On the arrival of call request, the network operator must assign an access network to the user. A call request can {{be due to a}} new <b>call</b> <b>initiated</b> within a cell, an intra-system or inter-system handover attempt. Selecting the most optimal network from those available and controlling network access is an important consideration for ove rall network stability and QoS provisioning. This work proposes a policy based management system to control network access in a heterogeneous wireless network. A call admission control policy admits a new user based on the current load and service mix in each available network. We also present an adaptive handover capacity reservation scheme to maximise resource usage while limiting the drop call rate and number of unnecessary inter-system handover attempts as users move between cells within the same network...|$|E

40|$|Background and objective: Adherence to {{medication}} is often low. Goal {{of this study}} is to assess the effects of Telephone Counselling Intervention by Pharmacist (TelCIP) at the start of therapy on patient beliefs, satisfaction with information about medicines and refill adherence. Setting and method: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial with 26 Dutch pharmacies that were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 intervention groups. Each group consisted of an intervention (TelCIP) arm and an usual care arm. The TelCIP arm in the first group was the usual care arm in the second group and vice versa. One group focuses on patients starting with antidepressants or bisphosponates and the other on antilipaemic drugs or renin angiotensin system (RAS) -inhibiters. TelCIP is a telephone <b>call</b> <b>initiated</b> by a pharmacist 2 or 3 weeks after the first prescription. A selection of pharmacies sent questionnaires 3 months after the first prescription which contained sociodemographic questions, a measure of beliefs about medicines (BMQ), satisfaction with information received (SIMS) and frequency of pharmacy counselling (Consumer Quality Index, CQI). Main outcome measures: Beliefs about medicines is expressed as the necessity-concerns differential. The SIMS and CQI result in a dichotomous outcome. Results: In this interim analysis, 69 patients in the TelCIP arm responded (Intention to treat, ITT) of which 52 actual received the telephone call (Per protocol, PP). In the usual care arm 306 patients responded. There were no differences at baseline in gender, age or firstrefill medication. In the ITT-analysis the necessity-concerns differential was 1. 1 [95 %CI- 0. 2 to 2. 4] higher in the TelCIP arm, compared to usual care in the PP analysis the differential was 1. 5 [95 %CI 0. 0 to 2. 9] points higher. Of the patients in the TelCIP arm 50 % (ITT) and 51 % (PP) were satisfied about the information given about side-effects compared to 39 % in the usual care arm but this difference was not significant (p = 0. 13 respectively 0. 13). The difference on the other SIMS items was less than 10 %. In the TelCIP arm, patients were more frequently asked about their experiences and about the occurrence of side-effects and whether they manage to use medicine as prescribed (...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} two-way access charges on the incentives to invest in networks with different levels of quality. When quality {{has an impact on}} all <b>calls</b> <b>initiated</b> by customers (destined both on-net and off-net), we obtain a result of "tacit collusion" even in a symmetric model with two-part pricing. Firms tend to under-invest in quality, and this is exacerbated if they can negotiate reciprocal termination charges above cost. When the quality of off-net calls depends on the interaction between the quality of the two networks, no network has an incentive to jump ahead of its rival by investing more...|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} the Muromachi period, {{the first}} Europeans had arrived. The Portuguese landed in Tanegashima south of Kyūshū in 1543 and within two years were making regular port <b>calls,</b> <b>initiating</b> the century-long Nanban trade period. The Spanish arrived in 1587, {{followed}} by the Dutch in 1609. The Japanese began to attempt studies of European civilization in depth, and new opportunities were presented for the economy, along with serious political challenges. European firearms, fabrics, glassware, clocks, tobacco, and other Western innovations were traded for Japanese gold and silver. Significant wealth was accumulated through trade, and lesser daimyō, especially in Kyūshū, greatly increased their power. Provincial wars became more deadly with the introduction of firearms, such as muskets and cannons, and greater use of infantry.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 2, the JRRM module {{contains}} the JCAC algorithm. An MT {{wanting to make}} a <b>call</b> (<b>initiate</b> a session) sends a service request to the JRRM module. The JCAC algorithm in JRRM module then selects for the incoming call, a set of T RATs (0 [*]≤[*]T[*]≤[*]J) from the available RATs in the heterogeneous network, where T {{is the number of}} RATs selected. T[*]=[*] 0 implies that the incoming call cannot be admitted into the heterogeneous network. Therefore, the call is blocked or dropped. T[*]=[*] 1 implies that the incoming call can be admitted into just one of the available RATs. Hence, there is no layer splitting. T[*]>[*] 1 implies that the incoming call is scalable and it will be admitted into more than one RAT.|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after his}} accession, Innocent X (as {{he chose to}} be <b>called)</b> <b>initiated</b> legal action against the Barberini for {{misappropriation}} of public funds. The brothers Francesco Barberini, Antonio Barberini and Taddeo Barberini fled to Paris, where they found a powerful protector in Cardinal Mazarin. Innocent X confiscated their property, and on 19 February 1646, issued a bull ordaining that all cardinals who might leave the Papal States for six months without express papal permission would be deprived of their benefices and eventually of their cardinalate itself. The French parliament declared the papal ordinance void in France, but Innocent X did not yield until Mazarin prepared to send troops to Italy. Henceforth the papal policy towards France became more friendly, and somewhat later the Barberini were rehabilitated when the son of Taddeo Barberini, Maffeo Barberini, married Olimpia Giustiniani, a niece of Innocent X.|$|R

40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{concerned}} with questions in telephone interaction between customers and service personnel (“agents”) in call centers. The call center industry distinguishes between “inbound” centers, where <b>calls</b> are <b>initiated</b> by customers, and “outbound” centers, where <b>calls</b> are <b>initiated</b> by agents. Agents in inbound centers generally deal with service requests, while agents in outbound centers more often make sales calls. here we examine only the inbound case (for a discussion of outbound telemarketing see Freed, chapter 14, this volume). Our data were collected at a Scottish call center belonging to a large insurance company (“Thistle Insurance”), where agents handle calls from both individual policyholders and independent financial advisers (IFAs) {{acting on behalf of}} policyholders. The corpus includes notes of observations made on site, interviews with Thistle personnel, written texts (documents that codify the center's operating procedures and standards, training materials, performance assessment criteria), and recordings of actual calls...|$|R
