50|$|However, {{additional}} ingredients {{may include}} offal, varieties of mushroom, <b>choy</b> <b>sum,</b> {{and pieces of}} dried tofu or fried tofu puffs. Additional Chinese herbs may include yu zhu (玉竹, rhizome of Solomon's Seal) and ju zhi (buckthorn fruit), which give the soup a sweeter, slightly stronger flavor. Light and dark soy sauce are also added to the soup during cooking, with varying amounts depending on the variant - the Teochews version is lighter than the Hokkiens'. The dish can be garnished with chopped coriander or green onions and a sprinkling of fried shallots.|$|E
50|$|Bakmi is {{normally}} boiled for serving. When bakmi {{is intended for}} use in soup, it is usually boiled separately from the broth. The noodles are usually mixed with either pork fat, chicken fat or beef fat. They are then served with toppings that vary from the most common, diced seasoned chicken with <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> and fried wonton skin, to more expensive type using fried or boiled wonton and bakso (meatballs). The soup is served in a different bowl, and {{is added to the}} noodles by the individual diner according to taste.|$|E

50|$|Almost no {{fresh food}} is grown {{on the island}} due to {{nematodes}} in the soil. However, there are three local gardens on the island that grow small amounts of Asian greens. There is a community garden at Drumsite, another small community vegetable patch in Poon Saan and a temple garden also in Poon Saan. These community gardens are distinctive for their garden beds built {{up out of the}} soil, as the worms tend not to come up towards the heat and risk drying out, preserving the roots of the vegetables. Some of the Asian greens and vegetables grown include bok choy, <b>choy</b> <b>sum,</b> kangkong, Chinese mustard, eggplant and okra among others.|$|E

50|$|<b>Choy</b> <b>sum</b> is a green leafy {{vegetable}} similar to kai-lan, {{and can be}} characterized by the distinct yellow flowers which it bears. Each flower has four yellow, oval to round petals with six stamens on fleshy, erect stems which are 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter and 15 to 20 cm tall with light to dark green, and are oval (becomes acuminate shaped, or basal-shaped near the flowering stage) with slightly serrated margins leaves, which never forms compact heads like the cabbage. Fruits can develop out of cross-pollination or self-pollination, and are silique structured, that opens at maturity through dehiscence or drying to bare open to brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape. A single pod can bear up to 4 to 46 seeds.|$|E
50|$|The genus Brassica {{is known}} for its {{important}} agricultural and horticultural crops and includes a number of weeds, both of wild taxa and escapees from cultivation. Brassica species and varieties commonly used for food include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, <b>choy</b> <b>sum,</b> rutabaga, turnip and some seeds used in the production of canola oil and the condiment mustard. Over 30 wild species and hybrids are in cultivation, plus numerous cultivars and hybrids of cultivated origin. Most are seasonal plants (annuals or biennials), but some are small shrubs. Brassica plants {{have been the subject of}} much scientific interest for their agricultural importance. Six particular species (B. carinata, B. juncea, B. oleracea, B. napus, B. nigra and B. rapa) evolved by the combining of chromosomes from three earlier species, as described by the Triangle of U theory.|$|E
50|$|Other typical {{ingredients}} are the {{several types of}} eggplant (makhuea) used in Thai cuisine, such as the pea-sized makhuea phuang and the egg-sized makhuea suai, often also eaten raw. Although broccoli is often used in Asian restaurants in the west in phat phak ruam (stir fried mixed vegetables) and rat na (rice noodles served in gravy), it was never used in any traditional Thai food in Thailand and is still rarely seen in Thailand. Usually in Thailand, khana is used, for which broccoli is a substitute. Other vegetables which are often eaten in Thailand are thua fak yao (yardlong beans), thua ngok (bean sprouts), no mai (bamboo shoots), tomatoes, cucumbers, phak tam lueng (Coccinia grandis), phak kha na (Chinese kale), phak kwangtung (<b>choy</b> <b>sum),</b> sweet potatoes (both the tuber and leaves), a few types of squash, phak krathin (Leucaena leucocephala), sato (Parkia speciosa), tua phū (winged beans) and khaophot (corn).|$|E
50|$|Traditional chow mein is {{made with}} egg noodles which are boiled then {{strained}} and left to dry. They are then stir fried and finally left {{to sit at the}} bottom of the wok and pressed down, this crisps the noodles at the edges and underside. Chow mein {{is made with}} either seafood, often just prawns, chicken, beef or barbecued pork. Restaurants will serve a combination chow mein or a single type. Chicken and beef are often softened with a little bicarb of soda. The sauce is made from garlic, rice wine, light stock, MSG, salt and corn flour. Vegetables are usually one green such as bok choy or <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> plus a little chopped carrot, but also other green vegetables are acceptable. This stir fry is poured onto the noodles. Chow mein is unique as its noodles are both soft in part but also crispy.|$|E
50|$|Chinese {{engineering}} {{companies who}} have been contracted for projects in Sri Lanka have also brought in migrant workers from China. The earliest such workers came in 1970 {{to work on the}} Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. More recently they are working on infrastructure projects at Hambantota, such as the Hambantota International Airport and the Port of Hambantota. The port project, run by China Harbour Engineering Co Ltd, was reported to employ 328 Sri Lankan and 235 Chinese workers in 2008. Due to the influx of Chinese workers, Hambantota locals have even begun doing business growing and selling Chinese vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, <b>choy</b> <b>sum,</b> and kale for their kitchens. The Norocholai Power Station, a fossil fuel power station construction project near Puttalam, reportedly employs 900 Chinese engineers, helpers, welders, and fitters, with the assistance of only a few Sri Lankans. Other construction projects known to employ Chinese workers include the Colombo National Performing Arts Theatre (reported to employ 1,000 Chinese workers) and a water-supply upgrade project in Colombo run by China Geo Engineering Corporation. At Trincomalee, the Singapore-based Prima Group, itself owned by a Chinese Singaporean, has set up a flour processing plant and sent a Chinese manager to oversee operations.|$|E
40|$|<b>Choy</b> <b>sum</b> (Brassica rapa subsp. parachinensis) is a {{dark green}} leafy {{vegetable}} that contains high folate (vitamin B 9) levels comparable to spinach. Folate {{is essential for the}} maintenance of human health and is obtained solely through dietary means. Analysis of the edible portion of <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> by both microbiological assay and LC-MS/MS indicated that total folate activity remained significantly unchanged over 3 weeks storage at 4 degrees C. Inedible fractions consisted primarily of outer leaves, which showed signs of rotting after 14 d, and a combination of rotting and yellowing after 21 d, contributing to 20 % and 40 % of product removal, respectively. Following deconjugation of the folate present in <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> to monoglutamate and diglutamate derivatives, the principal forms (vitamers) of folate detected in <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> were 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate and 5 -formyl tetrahydrofolate, followed by tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5, 10 -methenyl-THF, and 10 -formyl folic acid. During storage, a significant decline in 5 -formyl-THF was observed, with a slight but not significant increase in the combined 5 -methyl-THF derivatives. The decline in 5 -formyl-THF in relation to the other folate vitamers present may indicate that 5 -formyl-THF is being utilised as a folate storage reserve, being interconverted to more metabolically active forms of folate, such as 5 -methyl-THF. Although folate vitamer profile changed over the storage period, total folate activity did not significantly change. From a human nutritional perspective this is important, as while particular folate vitamers (e. g. 5 -methyl-THF) are necessary for maintaining vital aspects of plant metabolism, it is less important to the human diet, as humans can absorb and interconvert multiple forms of folate. The current trial indicates {{that it is possible to}} store <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> for up to 3 weeks at 4 degrees C without significantly affecting total folate concentration of the edible portion.

40|$|AbstractCarotenoid-rich green leafy {{vegetables}} including cilantro, Thai basil leaves, sweet potato leaves, and <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> {{were selected to}} evaluate the effects of water cooking or boiling on their total carotenoid content (TCC), total phenolic content (TPC), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The percentage inhibition of peroxidation (%IP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and metal-chelating effect were used to evaluate TAC. The results indicated that TCC reached the maximum after boiling cilantro, Thai basil leaves, and sweet potato leaves for 10 minutes, 5 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively, and <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> remained almost unchanged after 30 minutes of boiling. Boiling cilantro and <b>choy</b> <b>sum</b> had {{a negative effect on}} their TPC, whereas there was a significant increase in TPC of Thai basil leaf and sweet potato leaf at 1 minute and 5 minutes of boiling, respectively. During water cooking, TAC of the vegetables did not demonstrate a consistent trend. However, TCC was a vital contributor to %IP, whereas TPC showed a strong association with TEAC. Our findings suggest that a boiling time of ≤ 5 minutes would be better for preserving or enhancing TCC and TPC as well as revealing a higher %IP, TEAC, or metal-chelating effect for the four vegetables investigated in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) on shelf {{life and the}} {{ethylene}} sensitivity of detached leaves from six leafy asian vegetables (Chinese mustard, <b>choy</b> <b>sum,</b> garland chrysanthemum, mibuna, mizuna and tatsoi) commonly used in minimal processing was examined. All vegetables studied were significantly affected {{by the presence of}} 1 l/l ethylene. This reduction was primarily due to yellowing except in mizuna and mibuna. In the absence of ethylene, 1 -MCP treatment only increased shelf life for mizuna and tatsoi (21 and 67 % increase, respectively). In contrast, 1 -MCP treatment in the presence of ethylene significantly protected Chinese mustard, <b>choy</b> <b>sum,</b> garland chrysanthemum and tatsoi. 1 -MCP may, therefore, be ideal for use on minimally processed leafy asian vegetables in situations of co-storage or co-retail with ethylene-producing commodities...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for the regeneration of transgenic <b>Choy</b> <b>Sum</b> (Brassica campestris ssp. parachinensis) {{is presented in}} this thesis. The protocol is based on infection of hypocotyl explants of 5 -days old seedlings with Agrobacterium strain MOG 301 carrying a disarmed binary vector pMOG 410. The T-DNA region of this binary vector contains β-glucuronidase (gus) and neomycin phosphotransferase II (npt-II) as a reporter gene and a selectable marker gene. After co-cultivation for 48 hours, the hypocotyl explants were cultured on recovery medium containing 25 mg/L kanamycin for 1 to 2 weeks. The explants were subcultured in shooting medium containing 50 mg/L kanamycin, then subcultured every two weeks until shoot regenerated. Among nine cultivars tested, transformed shoots have been regenerated from 4 cultivars. These transformed shoots showed positive results in GUS histochemical assay. PCR and Southern blotting revealed that integration of the T-DNA region within the plant genome. The regeneration frequencies of transformants ranged from 0. 83 % to 5. 26 %.
