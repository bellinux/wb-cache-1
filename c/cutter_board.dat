After the flight takes off, several men in Rane's employ, posing as flight attendants and passengers, kill the FBI agents, release Rane, and secure the plane by also shooting the captain. Cutter, in the lavatory at the time, manages to use the plane's on-board phone to warn Delvecchio of the situation, but Cutter is soon discovered by one of Rane's agents.|$|R

One {{of the most}} dangerous migrant interdiction operations occurred in September 1998 after [...] interdicted the motor vessel Chih Yung with 172 Chinese migrants aboard. The cutter requested support in handling the migrants and two teams from PACTACLET were deployed to assist.

As the cutter approached, the lugger fired on the cutter, as did some small shore batteries. The lugger was within small-arms {{range of the}} shore and as {{the crew of the}} <b>cutter</b> <b>boarded</b> the lugger, the lugger's crew abandoned her. The British suffered no casualties. Captain A.J. Griffiths made no mention of signs of French casualties and described the lugger as being in the [...] "Service of the Republic".

50|$|In August 1839, a Spanish slave ship, La Amistad, {{appeared}} in waters {{off the coast}} of Long Island, New York. The ship was carrying two white, Spanish-speaking men and about 50 men, women and children from Africa. The Africans, who had been kidnapped in Sierra Leone and illegally sold into slavery and shipped to Cuba, had escaped their shackles and commandeered the ship. They killed the captain and the cook; two other crew members escaped in a lifeboat. They directed the survivors to return them to Africa. The crew tricked them, sailing north at night. Upon being sighted, the United States Revenue <b>Cutter</b> Service <b>boarded</b> Amistad and took it into custody.|$|R
60|$|The {{schooner}} {{continued to}} gain slowly, occasionally firing her bow-chasers. When {{she had come}} up to {{within a mile of}} L’Agile the cutter was yawed and two broadside guns fired; they were purposely aimed somewhat wide, as Will was anxious that the pirates should not suspect the weight of his metal, and did not wish, by inflicting some small injury, to deter her from continuing the chase. The schooner evidently depended upon the vastly superior strength of her crew to carry the <b>cutter</b> by <b>boarding,</b> and so abstained from attempting to injure her, as the less damage she suffered the better value she would be as a prize.|$|R

50|$|Links courses {{tend to be}} on, or {{at least}} very near to, a coast, and the term is {{typically}} associated with coastal courses, often amid dunes, with few water hazards and few, if any, trees. This reflects both {{the nature of the}} scenery where the sport happened to originate and the fact that only limited resources were available to golf course architects at the time and any moving of soil had to be done by hand, so it was kept to a minimum. Even today, some links courses do not employ a greens staff, use only basic machinery such as hole <b>cutters</b> without <b>boards</b> to ensure that the hole is cut unevenly, and use grazing animals to keep the grass cropped.|$|R

On the 4 May 1805, Boyle sighted a convoy of Spanish ships loaded with gunpowder at San Pedro, an anchorage east of Cape de Gata. Though under the protection of a fort, two armed schooners, and three gun and mortar launches, Downie was sent in a <b>cutter</b> to <b>board</b> the vessels while covered by the guns of Seahorse. Downie boarded and brought out a Spanish brig, laden with 1,170 quintals of powder while the Spanish gun-boats continued to fire on the Seahorse, damaging the main topgallant mast, shooting away several braces and bowlines, and killing a crewman. Seahorse then discontinued the engagement, wishing to leave the coast while the breeze and daylight lasted.|$|R

5000|$|On October 27, 1997, off {{the coast}} of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico four men were {{captured}} by a United States Coast Guard <b>Cutter.</b> On <b>board</b> the yacht, [...] "La Esperanza" [...] (The Hope), were a cache of hidden weapons and military grade intelligence gear, including: (2) [...]50 caliber sniper rifles, GPS equipment, light weight radios and night-vision goggles and 12 rounds for a [...]357 pistol. The weapons were hidden under a compartment built into the stairs leading to the cabins, and the hatch was hidden by a throw rug. The yacht was registered to a Florida company, Nautical Sports, Inc, whose chief executive officer, director, secretary and treasurer was José Antonio Llama. On August 25, 1998, the United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) announced it had indicted Llama with conspiring to murder Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. Particularly in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1117, 1116, and 1111. The USDOJ believed the men were attempting to assassinate Castro while he would be in Isla Margarita, Venezuela for the Ibero-American Summit.|$|R

On 4 May 1805, while cruising off the southern Spanish coast, Boyle received intelligence that a Spanish convoy, chiefly laden on government account with gunpowder for the gun-boats at Málaga, Ceuta and Algeciras, was upon the coast. He then kept close along the Spanish coast, and at 2 p.m. the convoy was sighted from the mast-head of the Seahorse. At 5 pm. Boyle observed that the Spanish vessels hauled into San Pedro, an anchorage to the eastward of Cape de Gata, under the protection of a fort and several schooners and mortar launches. He then sent his first lieutenant, George Downie, and other men of his crew in a <b>cutter</b> to <b>board</b> the vessels. Covered by the fire of the Seahorse, Downie boarded a Spanish brig, laden with 1170 quintals of powder. Finding that the Spanish gun-boats continued to fire on the Seahorse, which had already suffered damage to her main topgallantmast and had had several braces and bowlines shot away, the Seahorse discontinued the engagement and stood out to the offing.|$|R

Renewing the chase in {{the direction in which}} the stranger had disappeared, sight was caught of him the following morning. Upon being descried he hoisted American colors and stood away from the Essex. A calm ensued; when, still confident that the stranger was an Englishman, Porter dispatched a <b>cutter,</b> not to <b>board</b> the enemy, but drive back his boats engaged in towing him. The cutter succeeded. Cutters were subsequently sent to capture him; the stranger now showing English colors in place of American. But, when the frigate's boats were within a short distance of their hoped-for prize, another sudden breeze sprang up; the stranger, under all sail, bore off to the westward, and, ere night, was hull down ahead of the Essex, which, all this time, lay perfectly becalmed.|$|R
50|$|The {{increase}} in coastal trade along the Atlantic seaboard {{after the civil}} war and the purchase of Alaska in 1867 {{had a significant impact on}} the development of the Revenue Cutter Service. Demands by the public to do something about losses in lives and property at sea prompted Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell, under President Ulysses S. Grant, to reorganize the service. He appointed N. Broughton Devereux on 1 July 1869 as chief of an interim Revenue Marine Bureau that included the Revenue Cutter Service, the Steamboat Inspection Service, the Marine Hospital Service and the Life-Saving Service. Devereaux appointed two boards to study the problems facing the service; one investigated personnel requirements, the other analyzed the requirements for the <b>cutter</b> fleet.The fleet <b>board</b> produced a study that was presented to Congress on 26 May 1870, the result of which was that of the twenty-four steaming cutters in the service, four were harbor tugs, six were stationed on the Great Lakes and the remaining steaming cutters were stationed in the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The harbor tugs were left where they were stationed and all of the lake cutters were recommended for repair and stayed located where they were except for one which was home-ported in a different city. All of the steaming coastal cutters except for two were a successful side-wheel design which were retained. The board recommended keeping only one of the propeller driven steam cutters, the USRC Mahoning. Of the twelve sail cutters in the fleet, only five of the most seaworthy were recommended by the board to be retained. Devereaux's report to Congress included a request for four new steam cutters: a large propeller-driven ship, a large side-wheeler and two smaller side-wheelers. Recommendations were made as to the types of engines to be used on various cutters and all were to be equipped with sails to save on coal consumption. Additionally, Devereaux requested $125,000 to cover the unexpected costs of operating cutters Lincoln, Wayanda and Reliance in Alaskan waters during 1869.|$|R
