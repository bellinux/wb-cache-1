50|$|Fully forged {{means that}} three of the four knife parts (blade, bolster, tang and handle) are forged from a single piece of steel. In this process, a single {{cylinder}} shaped steel billet is heated where the bolster will be, and squeezed from the ends to create a bulge. The entire piece is heated again and forged to the shape of the blade, bolster, and tang using forging dies in one operation. Afterward, a <b>clipping</b> <b>tool</b> is used to cut the forged piece to the rough shape of the knife. Finally, the handles are riveted on, and the final shaping and sharpening is done by hand. The alternative way to manufacture knives is stamping; forging has traditionally been considered superior, but from the late 20th century some knives of excellent quality have been produced by stamping.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- It is now {{commonly}} {{accepted that}} high quality knowledge management programmes lead to competitive advantages for the organizations. Several knowledge management maturity {{models have been}} proposed {{with the aim of}} evaluating the quality of knowledge management programmes in organizations. These models are classified into two large groups: CMM-based models and models that are not CMM-related. One of the best known CMM-based models is the Knowledge Management Capability Assessment (KMCA) model. Even so, the acquisition of a knowledge management level may imply a considerable amount of audits. It is therefore very interesting to minimise the costs by paying only for the truly indispensable audits. This article proposes a Knowledge-Based System that makes it possible to evaluate an organization at a KMCA maturity level. It limits the services of an auditor to those cases in which the system’s response complies with the requested knowledge management maturity level. This clearly implies an important cost reduction for audits with negative results. The design of this system is based on the CommonKADS methodology, and its implementation was carried out with the <b>Clips</b> <b>tool...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Loading a STANAG magazine, {{particularly}} {{one with}} a large capacity and a corresponding high spring pressure pushing the rounds {{to the top of}} the magazine, can be quite difficult. A number of devices are available to make this task simpler. These are sometimes called speedloaders but are more commonly known as magazine loaders, stripper clips, spoons, or stripper clip guides. There are a wide range of both commercial and military type loading tools available for STANAG magazines. For example; draft STANAG 4181 is a type of stripper <b>clip</b> and guide <b>tool</b> proposed for standardization based on the USGI M16 rifle stripper <b>clips</b> and guide <b>tools.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this study, various basic {{thematic}} layers {{were created}} from different source including map, field study, satellite image and secondary data based on multi-criteria analysis method. Using ArcGIS, Mapinfo and eCognition software tools, several maps were prepared including slope, soil, rainfall distribution, drainage density, demography, drainage system and urban structure type (land use). The drainage density and administration map {{were derived from}} the national center of cartography and remote sensing (CCT) and we extracted them using <b>clip</b> <b>tools.</b> Soil map was digitized based on national soil map done by ORSTOM and validated with field sample using map info software and GIS. The slope map was extracted from Aster DEM with resolution 30 m using spatial analyst tools. The rainfall distribution map was prepared from the national meteorological agency (SODEXAM) using Inverse distance weighted method (IDW). The urban structure types (land use) map was extracted from Spot 5 satellite imagery using eCognition software tools by applying oriented based image analysis. Population data obtained from the National Institute of Statistic (INS) was used to generate the population density map. Sewer system density map was also elaborated based on data collected from field and overlaid with the Water Company sewer system map.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{investigation}} and implementation of novel techniques for the design of X band (8 - 12 GHz) power amplifiers. One of the main topics is the expansion and novel implementation of continuous mode theory, with the intention of improving the bandwidth and efficiency of X band power amplifiers. This work builds upon the Class B/J continuous mode theory to incorporate cases where <[ZF 0] 6 = RL, not described by the original Class B/J theory, with a tool called the “clipping contour”. The <b>clipping</b> contour <b>tool</b> shows a graphical representation on the Smith chart of the boundary between impedances generating a voltage waveform which will modulate or “clip” the current waveform, and a voltage waveform which will leave the current waveform unaltered. This non-clipping space is shown, with measured load pull and amplifier data, to represent the maximum efficiency case for a given ZF 0, thus the <b>clipping</b> contour <b>tool</b> thus gives designers the ability to predict the areas of highest efficiency and power given any ZF 0, without the need to use costly, time consuming multi harmonic load pull techniques. Push pull amplifiers using quarter wave coupled line baluns are proposed as an ideal matching topology to exploit this new tool. Various balun topologies are studied using a novel extended transmission line model. This model is shown to predict accurately and explain the “trace separation” effect seen in planar baluns and not their 3 D coaxial cable equivalents. It also forms the basis of analysis which results in a powerful new equation capable of guaranteeing the elimination of trace separation completely, without compromising performance. This equation is used to design an optimal balun which possesses the largest fractional bandwidth (130...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{work on a}} real-time temporal <b>clipping</b> monitoring <b>tool</b> for VoIP. Temporal clipping {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} voice activity detection (VAD) or echo cancellation where comfort noise in used in place of clipped speech segments. The algorithm presented will form part of a no-reference objective model for quantifying perceived speech quality in VoIP. The overall approach uses a modular design that will help pinpoint the reason for degradations in addition to quantifying their impact on speech quality. The new algorithm was tested for VAD compared over a range of thresholds and varied speech frame sizes. The results are compared to objective Mean Opinion Scores (MOS-LQO) from POLQA. The results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently predict temporal clipping in speech and correlates well with the full reference quality predictions from POLQA. The model shows good potential for use in a real-time monitoring tool. Index Terms: temporal clipping, VAD, VoIP, POLQA 1...|$|R

40|$|Until around 1995 it was {{challenging}} {{to make the}} scientific results of research projects publicly available except through presentations at meetings or conferences, or as papers in academic journals. Then it began to be clear that the Internet could become the main medium to publish and share new information with a much wider audience. The DESIRE Project (desertification mitigation and remediation of land—a global approach for local solutions) has built on expertise gained in previous projects to develop an innovative online ‘Harmonized Information System’ (HIS). This documents the context, delivery and evaluation of all tasks in the DESIRE Project using non-scientific terminology, with much of it also available in the local languages of the study sites. The DESIRE-HIS makes use of new possibilities for communication, including video <b>clips,</b> interactive <b>tools,</b> and links to social media networks such as Twitter. Dissemination of research results using this approach has required careful planning and design. This paper sets out the steps that have culminated in a complete online Information System about local solutions to global land management problems in desertification-affected areas, including many practical guidelines for responsible land management.

The main goal of Smart Education is to increase the learner’s learning abilities and the instructor’s teaching abilities. In order for this goal to be achieved, instructor should have a basic understand about Smart Education, and how to utilize ICT(Information and Communication Technology) and Teaching-Learning Methods. However, most research about Smart Education is focused on the learners, which becomes bias towards future research.
