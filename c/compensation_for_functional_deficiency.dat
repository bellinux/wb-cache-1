40|$|Freshwater teleost fish often {{experience}} {{natural and}} anthropogenic conditions {{that result in}} fluctuating energy availability, therefore the ability to acquire, transform and use energy {{is essential for the}} survival of these fish. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) are recognized as physiological sources of stress to fish as they incite defense mechanisms that are generally costly in terms of metabolic resources. Over time, such responses may decrease individual performance and possibly fitness by changes in foraging, migration and escape behaviors, and the population in terms of reproductive capacity due to the alterations in energy allocation following an exposure. The main goal {{of this study was to}} determine if a sublethal exposure to PCB- 126 affects the energy budget of the fish and can therefore be responsible <b>for</b> <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> associated with their locomotion. Fish were injected low (100 mug/kg) and high (400 mug/kg) concentrations of PCB- 126 and swimming performance parameters including critical swimming speed, metabolic rate and recovery ratios were evaluated.

A significant decrease was observed in the swimming performance of rainbow trout for the low and high PCB- 126 treatments as well as an impaired recovery with increasing level of PCB exposure following exhaustive exercise. This study also showed the occurrence of physiological disturbance by a reduction in the hepatosomatic and spleen somatic indices and elevation of plasma cortisol and glucose levels, as well as white muscle reductions in glucose and glycogen indicating higher metabolic costs during recovery and muscle restoration for PCB-exposed fish.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells (DC) and {{regulatory}} cells (Treg) play pivotal roles in controlling both normal and autoimmune adaptive immune responses. DC {{are the main}} antigen-presenting cells to T cells, and they also control Treg functions. In this study, we examined the frequency and phenotype of DC subsets, and the frequency and function of Treg from patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood samples from 19 untreated patients with AAV during flares and before any immunosuppressive treatment were analyzed, along with 15 AAV patients in remission and 18 age-matched healthy controls. DC and Treg numbers, and phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry, and in vitro suppressive function of Treg was determined by co-culture assay. When compared to healthy volunteers, absolute numbers of conventional and plasmacytoid DC were decreased in AAV patients. During the acute phase this decrease was significantly more pronounced and was {{associated with an increased}} DC expression of CD 62 L. Absolute numbers of Treg (CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) CD 127 (low/-) Tcells) were moderately decreased in patients. FOXP 3 and CD 39 were expressed at similar levels on Treg from patients as compared to controls. The suppressive function of Treg from AAV patients was dramatically decreased as compared to controls, and this defect was more pronounced during flares than remission. This Treg <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> occurred in the absence of obvious Th 17 deviation.

40|$|SummaryCerebrovascular {{dysfunction}} {{is strongly}} associated with neonatal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and stroke in adults. Cerebrovascular endothelial cells (ECs) play important roles in maintaining a stable cerebral circulation in {{the central nervous system}} by interacting with pericytes. However, the genetic mechanisms controlling the functions of cerebral ECs are still largely unknown. Here, we report that disruption of Smad 4, the central intracellular mediator of transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling, specifically in the cerebral ECs, results in perinatal ICH and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Furthermore, the mutant vessels exhibit defective mural cell coverage. Smad 4 stabilizes cerebrovascular EC-pericyte interactions by regulating the transcription of N-cadherin through associating with the Notch intracellular complex at the RBP-J binding site of the N-cadherin promoter. These findings uncover a distinct role of endothelial Smad 4 in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity and suggest important implications <b>for</b> genetic or <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in TGF-Î²/Smad signaling in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies we reported that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) infiltrating {{head and neck}} cancer tissue are functionally impaired, but the molecular basis <b>for</b> the <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that tumour-derived prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) increase interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) but synergistically inhibit interferon-Î± (IFN-Î±) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR 7) - and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9) -stimulated PDC. The inhibitory effect of PGE 2 could be mimicked by the induction of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and by inhibitors of cyclooxygenase. The contribution of tumour-derived TGF-Î² was confirmed by the TGF-Î² antagonist SB- 431542. Suppression of tumour-derived PGE 2 and TGF-Î² restored TLR-induced IFN-Î± production of PDC. Additionally, PGE 2 - and TGF-Î²-treated PDC display a â€˜tolerogenicâ€™ phenotype because of a downregulation of CD 40 accompanied by an upregulation of CD 86. Finally, in TLR-stimulated PDC, PGE 2 and TGF-Î² reduce the CCR 7 : CXCR 4 ratio, suggesting that PDC are impaired {{in their ability to}} migrate to tumour-draining lymph nodes but are retained in stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF- 1) -expressing tissues. Based on these data, cyclooxygenase inhibitors and TGF-Î² antagonists may improve TLR 7 - and TLR 9 -based tumour immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Routine {{administration}} of erythropoietin (EPO) -stimulating agents (ESAs) {{for the control}} of anemia has improved {{the quality of life}} of subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, a wide variation in individual response to ESA is often observed. The reasons for EPO resistance include demographic variables such as age and gender distribution, morbidity pattern, and modality of dialysis. Despite suggestions by observational data, there is no biological characteristic that puts children at a disadvantage for adequate response to ESA. On the contrary, children possess a superior capacity for red cell production, including extramedullary erythropoiesis. The reasons for larger requirement of ESA in children (than in adults) are greater inflammatory burden, disproportionate blood loss, and greater EPO dosing by pediatric physicians. To minimize the harmful (including fatal) consequences of EPO resistance, surveillance programs must replenish nutrient (for example, iron and folate) stores, minimize oxidative hemolysis, control hyperparathyroidism, avoid catheter infection, and optimize uremic clearance. This clinical approach is justified by the inadequacy of laboratory diagnosis of pertinent etiological factors. Indeed, the best proof <b>for</b> <b>functional</b> nutrient <b>deficiency</b> is often a therapeutic trial. Finally, there are upcoming therapeutic agents that exploit the capacity for an endogenous EPO synthesis in CKD subjects, and may therefore minimize the off-target effect of excess dosages...|$|R

Here, we analyzed telomere length and telomerase activity in HIV- 1 â€“specific CD 8 + T cells from progressors or controllers to determine underlying molecular pathways of T-cell exhaustion and senescence. Telomere lengths of HIV- 1 â€“specific CD 8 + T cells from progressors were significantly shorter compared with autologous cytomegalovirus (CMV) /Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) â€“specific CD 8 + T cells or bulk CD 8 + T cells, while telomere lengths from controllers significantly exceeded those of autologous bulk CD 8 + T cells and reached a similar level as HIV- 1 â€“specific CD 8 + T cells collected during primary HIV- 1 infection. Telomere length stabilization in controllers corresponded to high levels of constitutive telomerase activity, which was associated with preservation of cytotoxic and proliferative properties. Conversely, limited constitutive telomerase activity was observed in HIV- 1 â€“specific CD 8 + T cells from progressors, although an increase in both telomere length and telomerase activity was achieved in antigenic-peptideâ€“stimulated cells from progressors after blocking the PD- 1 /PD ligand 1 (PD-L 1) pathway. Collectively, these data suggest a causal role of telomere shortening <b>for</b> the <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of HIV- 1 â€“specific CD 8 + T cells in chronic progressive infection, while high constitutive telomerase activities appears to contribute to maintenance of polyfunctional HIV- 1 â€“specific CD 8 + T cells from HIV- 1 controllers...|$|R
40|$|In photosynthesis, {{light energy}} is {{converted}} to chemical energy, which is consumed for carbon assimilation in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Intensive research has significantly advanced the understanding of how photosynthesis can survive in the ever-changing light conditions. However, precise details concerning the dynamic regulation of photosynthetic processes have remained elusive. The aim of my thesis was to specify some molecular mechanisms and interactions behind the regulation of photosynthetic reactions under environmental fluctuations. A genetic approach was employed, whereby Arabidopsis thaliana mutants deficient in specific photosynthetic protein components were subjected to adverse light conditions and assessed <b>for</b> <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in the photosynthetic machinery. I examined three interconnected mechanisms: (i) auxiliary functions of PsbO 1 and PsbO 2 isoforms in the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII), (ii) the regulatory function of PGR 5 in photosynthetic electron transfer and (iii) {{the involvement of the}} Calcium Sensing Receptor CaS in photosynthetic performance. Analysis of photosynthetic properties in psbo 1 and psbo 2 mutants demonstrated that PSII is sensitive to light induced damage when PsbO 2, rather than PsbO 1, is present in the oxygen evolving complex. PsbO 1 stabilizes PSII more efficiently compared to PsbO 2 under light stress. However, PsbO 2 shows a higher GTPase activity compared to PsbO 1, and plants may partially compensate the lack of PsbO 1 by increasing the rate of the PSII repair cycle. PGR 5 proved vital in the protection of photosystem I (PSI) under fluctuating light conditions. Biophysical characterization of photosynthetic electron transfer reactions revealed that PGR 5 regulates linear electron transfer by controlling proton motive force, which is crucial for the induction of the photoprotective non-photochemical quenching and the control of electron flow from PSII to PSI. I conclude that PGR 5 controls linear electron transfer to protect PSI against light induced oxidative damage. I also found that PGR 5 physically interacts with CaS, which is not needed for photoprotection of PSII or PSI in higher plants. Rather, transcript profiling and quantitative proteomic analysis suggested that CaS is functionally connected with the CBB cycle. This conclusion was supported by lowered amounts of specific calciumregulated CBB enzymes in cas mutant chloroplasts and by slow electron flow to PSI electron acceptors when leaves were reilluminated after an extended dark period. I propose that CaS is required for calcium regulation of the CBB cycle during periods of darkness. Moreover, CaS may also have a regulatory role in the activation of chloroplast ATPase. Through their diverse interactions, components of the photosynthetic machinery ensure optimization of light-driven electron transport and efficient basic production, while minimizing the harm caused by light induced photodamage...|$|R

Vitamin B 12 deficiency should be excluded in all cases of unspecific developmental delay during infancy. 2.) 	As Vitamin B 12 level itself is no sufficient parameter <b>for</b> a <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency,</b> early measurement of sensitive metabolic markers, namely urinary methylmalonic acid excretion and serum homocysteine, should be determined.

Infants at risk are breast-fed; their mothers are on vegan or vegetarian diets or suffer from - probably undiagnosed â€“ pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia has thus to been ruled out in infants with symptomatic vitamin B 12 deficiency and unrestricted maternal diet, especially in order to initiate prophylaxis in future pregnancies. 5.) 	Pregnant women belonging to risk groups should be screened for signs of vitamin B 12 deficiency and they should be substituted if necessary. 6.)

PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 4 -year period, 31 patients underwent cheilorhinoplasty, including complete reopening of the cleft borders and differentiated mimic muscle reorientation. In 21 patients, remarkable residual clefts of the anterior palate were also closed. Simultaneous alveolar bone grafting was performed in 15 patients. The minimum follow-up was 1 year. Cosmetic features evaluated were spontaneous facial appearance and changes in position of the nasal floor and the philtrum. The width of the alar base was measured. <b>For</b> <b>functional</b> outcomes, <b>deficiency</b> during mimic movements was evaluated, using standardized photographs taken preoperatively and postoperatively. The final results, judged according to defined criteria with several clinical factors, were compared. RESULTS: Cosmetic and functional improvement was achieved in all patients. In young patients (aged 4 to 9 years), the improvements were noteworthy. There were no differences in outcomes between the groups with and without simultaneous grafting, except for unilateral cases with minor muscular deficiency, in whom bone grafting before cheilorhinoplasty led to better results. CONCLUSION: In cases of major muscular deficiency, early cheilorhinoplasty should be performed at age 7 years, without waiting for the usual timing of bone grafting.

40|$|Mutations of the insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL 3) hormone or its receptor, RXFP 2, cause intraabdominal {{cryptorchidism}} in male mice. Specific RXFP 2 {{expression in}} mouse gubernacula was detected at embryonic day 14. 5 and markedly increased after birth {{in the developing}} cremaster muscle, {{as well as in}} the epididymis and testicular Leydig and germ cells. INSL 3 treatment stimulated cell proliferation of embryonic gubernacular and Leydig cells, implicating active INSL 3 -mediated signaling. The transcription factor SOX 9, a known male sex determination factor, upregulated the activity of the RXFP 2 promoter. INSL 3 is sufficient to direct the first transabdominal phase of testicular descent in the absence of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis signaling or Hoxa 10, although these factors are important for inguinoscrotal testicular descent. Similarly, conditional ablation of the androgen receptor gene in gubernacular cells resulted in disruption of inguinoscrotal descent. We performed mutation screening of INSL 3 and RXFP 2 in human patients with cryptorchidism and control subjects from different populations in Europe and the USA. Several missense mutations were described in both the INSL 3 and RXFP 2 genes. A novel V 39 G INSL 3 mutation in a patient with cryptorchidism was identified; however, the functional analysis of the mutant peptide did not reveal compromised function.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To analyse plasma MMA concentrations in Dutch children and to evaluate possible factors influencing its concentration. METHODS: A number of 186 Dutch children aged 0 - 19 years were analysed cross-sectionally. Blood was collected to measure MMA, total homocysteine (tHcy), cobalamin (Cbl) and serum creatinine concentrations. In addition, information about medical history, age and sex was recorded. RESULTS: The geometric mean (GM) plasma MMA concentration was 0. 17 micromol/l (95 % CI 0. 07 - 0. 42) and the GM tHcy was 6. 6 micromol/l (95 % CI 3. 1 - 13. 9). There is a slight positive correlation between plasma MMA and age in children > 1 year (r = 0. 211, P < 0. 05). Plasma MMA concentrations were significantly higher in children with low Cbl concentrations. No significant difference in MMA, Cbl, tHcy or creatinine concentrations between sexes could be observed. Regression analysis showed that Cbl was the strongest determinant of plasma MMA (regression coefficient - 0. 414, P < 0. 05). The association between MMA and Cbl is stronger at increasing age (P for trend 0. 045). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma Cbl is the main determinant of MMA in this group of Dutch children.

Two of the variant antithrombins, Rosny and Torino, were purified by heparin-Sepharose and immunoaffinity chromatography, and shown to have greatly reduced heparin cofactor and progressive inhibitor activities in vitro. The defective interactions of these mutants with thrombin may result from proximity of s 1 C to the reactive site, while reduced circulating levels {{may be related to}} s 1 C proximity to highly conserved internal beta strands, which contain elements proposed to influence serpin turnover and intracellular degradation. In contrast, s 1 C is spatially distant to the positively charged surface which forms the heparin binding site of antithrombin; altered heparin binding properties of s 1 C variants may therefore reflect conformational linkage between the reactive site and heparin binding regions of the molecule.

We measured the physiological changes occurring after several procedures for producing SC injury, with particular emphasis on sensorimotor functions. Segmental and suprasegmental reflexes were tested in 39 male Wistar rats weighing 250 - 300 g divided into three control groups that were subjected to a) anesthesia, b) dissection of soft prevertebral tissue, and c) laminectomy of the vertebral segments between T 10 and L 1. In the lesion group the SC was completely transected, hemisected or subjected to vertebral compression. All animals were evaluated 2 and 24 h after the experimental procedure by the hind limb motility index, Bohlman motor score, open-field, hot-plate, tail flick, and paw compression tests. The locomotion scale proved to be less sensitive than the sensorimotor tests. A reduction in exploratory movements was detected in the animals 24 h after the procedures. The hot-plate was the most sensitive test for detecting sensorimotor deficiencies following light, moderate or severe SC injury. The most sensitive and simplest test of reflex function was the hot-plate. The hemisection model promoted reproducible moderate SC injury which allowed us to quantify the resulting behavior and analyze {{the evolution of the}} lesion and its consequences during the first 24 h after injury. We conclude that hemisection permitted the quantitation of behavioral responses for evaluation of the development of deficits after lesions. Hind limb evaluation scores and spontaneous exploration events provided a sensitive index of immediate injury effects after SC lesion at 2 and 24 h.

40|$|Intercellular {{transport}} of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA involves {{the accumulation of}} virus-encoded movement protein (MP) in plasmodesmata (Pd), in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -derived inclusion bodies, and on microtubules. The functional significance of these interactions in viral RNA (vRNA) movement was tested in planta and in protoplasts with TMV derivatives expressing N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of MP fused to the green fluorescent protein. Deletion of 55 amino acids from the C terminus of MP did {{not interfere with the}} vRNA transport function of MP:GFP but abolished its accumulation in inclusion bodies, indicating that accumulation of MP at these ER-derived sites is not a requirement for function in vRNA intercellular movement. Deletion of 66 amino acids from the C terminus of MP inactivated the protein, and viral infection occurred only upon complementation in plants transgenic <b>for</b> MP. The <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> of the mutant protein correlated with its inability to associate with microtubules and, independently, with its absence from Pd at the leading edge of infection. Inactivation of MP by N-terminal deletions was correlated with the inability of the protein to target Pd throughout the infection site, whereas its associations with microtubules and inclusion bodies were unaffected. The observations support a role of MP-interacting microtubules in TMV RNA movement and indicate that MP targets microtubules and Pd by independent mechanisms. Moreover, accumulation of MP in Pd late in infection is insufficient to support viral movement, confirming that intercellular {{transport of}} vRNA relies on the presence of MP in Pd at the leading edge of infection...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{monitoring}} and supervising systems track {{several of the}} potential system discrete and continuous (hybrid) states in parallel. This results in a difficulty to act when a system is diagnosed to be faulty while its state is not uniquely determined. Another consequence is that the functionalities that have been lost by the system are undetermined and cannot be efficiently restored. We propose to extract the <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> from a nominal prediction of the system expected states and the belief state that results from the diagnosis operation. We give a characterization of the deficiencies whose size is minimal, while deficient over {{the largest number of}} state estimates. Interestingly, <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> do not overlap. We then identify the reconfiguration goals by making use of a conditioned causal representation of the system equations...|$|R

40|$|Hereditary {{combined}} vitamin Kâ€“dependent (VKD) {{coagulation factor}} deficiency is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder associated with defects {{in either the}} Î³-carboxylase, which carboxylates VKD proteins to render them active, or the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC 1), which supplies the reduced vitamin K cofactor required for carboxylation. Such deficiencies are rare, and we report the fourth case resulting from mutations in the carboxylase gene, identified in a Tunisian girl who exhibited impaired function in hemostatic VKD factors that was not restored by vitamin K administration. Sequence analysis of the proposita did not identify any mutations in the VKORC 1 gene but, remarkably, revealed 3 heterozygous mutations in the carboxylase gene that caused the substitutions Asp 31 Asn, Trp 157 Arg, and Thr 591 Lys. None of these mutations have previously been reported. Family analysis showed that Asp 31 Asn and Thr 591 Lys were coallelic and maternally transmitted while Trp 157 Arg was transmitted by the father, and a genomic screen of 100 healthy individuals ruled out frequent polymorphisms. Mutational analysis indicated wild-type activity for the Asp 31 Asn carboxylase. In contrast, the respective Trp 157 Arg and Thr 591 Lys activities were 8 % and 0 % that of wild-type carboxylase, and their compound heterozygosity can therefore account <b>for</b> <b>functional</b> VKD factor <b>deficiency.</b> The implications for carboxylase mechanism are discussed...|$|R
