40|$|The base-induced {{cleavage}} of non-enolisable ketones {{leading to}} a carboxylic acid derivative and a neutral fragment in which the carbonyl group {{is replaced by a}} hydrogen, {{is referred to as the}} Haller–Bauer (HB) reaction (Eq. (1)) This C–C bond cleavage reaction was first discovered by Semmler 1 in 1906, during his classical studies on the degradation of the monoterpene fenchone, which on treatment with sodamide furnished a <b>cyclopentanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> amide (Eq. (2)). Haller and Bauer followed up on this novel observation and explored its generality employing a variety of relatively simple aliphatic and aromatic ketones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cunninghamia lanceolata {{has been}} the {{dominated}} species of plantation forest in South China. However, the most products made from Cunninghamia lanceolata biomass are lower value added. In order to obtain top value-added products, health function of Cunninghamia lanceolata biomass were studied by TD-GC-MS. Relative content of each component was determined by area normalization. The main 40 °С volatiles were 1 -propanone, 2 -amino- 1 -phenyl-(14. 22 %), benzene(11. 17 %), acetic acid(10. 16 %), <b>cyclopentanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid,</b> 1 -(2 - butenyl) - 2 -oxo-, ethyl ester, (e) - (7. 56 %), 1 h-cyclopenta[1, 3]cyclopropa[1, 2]b enzene, octahydro- 7 -methyl- 3 - methylene- 4 -(1 -methylethyl) -(6. 24 %), etc. And the main 60 °С volatiles were cedrol(29. 65 %), aceti...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of 1 -allyl- 8 -cyclopentyl- 3 -(3 -fluoropropyl) xanthine, 7, with tritium gas catalyzed by 10 % Pd-C gave 8 -cyclopentyl- 3 -(3 -fluoropropyl) - 1 [2, 3 -H- 3]propylxanthine ([H- 3]CPFPX), 8 *, a potent and selective antagonist for the A, adenosine receptor (AIAR). The synthesis of 7 proceeded from 6 -aminouracil, 1, which underwent silylation and alkylation with allyl bromide to form 6 -amino- 3 -allyluracil, 2. Nitrosation {{led to the}} 5 -nitroso compound, 3, which underwent reduction to the 4, 5 -diaminouracil, 4, and carbodiimide-mediated acylation with <b>cyclopentanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> produced 3 -allyl- 6 amino- 5 -cyclopentylcarboxamidouracil, 6. Alkylation at N- 1 with 3 -fluoro- 1 -bromopropane and cyclization with alkali completed the synthesis of 7. [H- 3]CPFPX had a radiochemical purity of > 98 % and a specific activity of > 2. 1 TBq/mmol (57 Ci/mmol). [H- 3]CPFPX bound to the rat, pig and human A(1) AR with a K-D of 0. 63, 1. 37 and 0. 71 nM, respectively. The K-D at the rat and human A(2 A) AR was 812 and 940 nM, respectively, thus giving selectivities of > 1200 - and > 700 -fold. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|E
