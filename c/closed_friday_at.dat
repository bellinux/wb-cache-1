5000|$|On April 17, 1999, {{just nine}} days after Compaq {{reported}} first-quarter profit being at {{half of what}} analysts had expected, {{the latest in a}} string of earnings disappointments, Pfeiffer was forced to resign as CEO in a coup led by board chairman Ben Rosen. Reportedly, at the special board meeting held on April 15, the directors were unanimous in dismissing Pfeiffer. The company's stock had fallen 50 percent since its all-time high in January 1999. Compaq shares, which traded as high as $51.25 early in 1999, dropped 23 percent on April 12, the first day of trading after the first-quarter announcement and <b>closed</b> the following <b>Friday</b> <b>at</b> $23.62. During three out of the last six quarters of Pfeiffer's tenure, the company's revenues or earnings had missed expectations. While rival Dell Computer had 55% growth in U.S. PC sales {{in the first quarter of}} 1999, Compaq could only manage 10%. Rosen suggested that the accelerating change brought about by the Internet had overtaken Compaq's management team, saying [...] "As a company engaged in transforming its industry for the Internet era, we must have the organizational flexibility necessary to move at Internet speed." [...] In a statement, Pfeiffer said [...] "Compaq has come a long way since I joined the company in 1983" [...] and [...] "under Ben's guidance, I know this company will realize its potential." [...] Rosen's priority was to have Compaq catchup as an E-commerce competitor, and he also moved to streamline operations and reduce the indecision that plagued the company.|$|R
