5|$|On April 25, 1979, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} who worked at the Argonne National Laboratory wrote to Senator John Glenn, the Chairman of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services. They were concerned about information being leaked, in particular by the government's tacit acknowledgement that Morland's bomb design was substantially correct, something that could not otherwise have been deduced from unclassified information. These included the affidavits by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a <b>cover</b> <b>note</b> explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to the DOE, which classified it.|$|E

2500|$|Annabella did {{not have}} a close {{relationship}} with the young Ada and often left her in the care of her own mother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke who doted on her grandchild. However, because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation—Annabella had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about Ada's welfare, with a <b>cover</b> <b>note</b> saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern. In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to Ada as [...] "it": [...] "I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own." [...] In her teenage years, several of her mother's close friends watched Ada for any sign of moral deviation. Ada dubbed these observers the [...] "Furies" [...] and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.|$|E

A demand for the premium by the insurer, and, in exceptional circumstances, receipt of the premium, may also operate as an acceptance. A firm acceptance of a proposal may even be contained in an interim <b>cover</b> <b>note,</b> although such a note is generally an acceptance of a proposal for temporary cover only.|$|E
