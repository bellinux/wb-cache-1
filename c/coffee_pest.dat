40|$|Research on crop {{systems and}} {{biodiversity}} conservation {{in the tropics}} has mainly been concerned with how low to mid intensity agricultural systems can benefit from adjacent natural habitats by receiving ecosystem services from natural biodiversity. One intensively studied crop in this framework is coffee. Positive effects are relatively easy to quantify by comparing coffee yield and by recording native species diversity. However, a largely overlooked issue is how agricultural areas affect native organisms in adjacent habitats, for example through movement of pest species that could impose a risk of degrading these habitats. We give an example from Mauritius, where an introduced <b>coffee</b> <b>pest</b> severely reduces the reproductive success of a threatened endemic plant species. We argue that such effects may be more common than suggested by the literature, especially when crop and native plants are congeneric. In the long term, such negative effects may degrade natural habitats, thereby causing ecosystem services derived from these habitats to decline...|$|E

Samples from natural #H. hampei$ populations (from Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa and Central America), from reference susceptible (S) and resistant (R) laboratory strains, and from their hybrid progenies, were analysed at the Rdl locus using single-stranded DNA conformation polymorphism on polymerase chain reaction products. The susceptible allele was the only allele present in all samples from natural populations except in the only resistant population known to date (Ponerihouen, New Caledonia).

40|$|Wolbachia {{are widely}} {{distributed}} endosymbiotic bacteria {{that influence the}} reproduction and fitness of their hosts. In recent years the manipulation of Wolbachia infection has been considered as a potential tool for biological control. The coffee berry borer (CBB), Hypothenemus hampei, is the most devastating <b>coffee</b> <b>pest</b> worldwide. Wolbachia infection in the CBB has been reported, but until now the role of Wolbachia in CBB reproduction and fitness has not been tested. To address this issue we reared the CBB in artificial diets with and without tetracycline (0. 1 % w/v) for ten generations. Tetracycline reduced significantly the relative proportion of Wolbachia in the CBB microbiota from 0. 49 % to 0. 04 %. This reduction affected CBB reproduction: females fed with tetracycline had significantly fewer progeny, lower fecundity, and fewer eggs per female. Tetracycline also reduced the population growth rate (λ), net reproductive rate (R 0), and mean generation time (T) in CBB; the reduction in population growth was mostly due to variation in fertility, according to life time response experiments (LTREs) analysis. Our results suggest that Wolbachia contribute to the reproductive success of the CBB and their manipulation represents a possible approach to CBB biocontrol mediated by microbiome management...|$|E

Here, we investigated whether extrafloral nectaries of an associated tree (Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana) can enhance natural <b>pest</b> control in <b>coffee</b> agroforestry systems. We assessed the effect of nectar availability from Inga trees on parasitism of coffee leaf miners (Leucoptera coffeella) and on damage caused by coffee leaf miners and coffee berry borers (Hypothenemus hampei). Most of the nectary visitors were either parasitoids or predators, with most predators being natural enemies of <b>coffee</b> <b>pests.</b> <b>Coffee</b> plants were sampled every metre along a transect of 10 - 15 m extending from each Inga tree. The distance of the coffee plants from the Inga trees did not significantly correlate with coffee leaf miner parasitism, proportion of mined leaves or with the proportion of bored coffee berries. We subsequently used abundance and species richness of those nectary visitors without known association with leaf miners and borers as indirect measures of nectar availability. Whereas species richness had no significant effect on natural pest control, leaf miner parasitism increased significantly with the abundance of nectary visitors (excluding natural enemies of the <b>coffee</b> <b>pests),</b> and the proportion of mined leaves decreased significantly with this abundance. The proportion of bored fruits decreased with increasing abundance of visitors, but this trend was not significant. Together, these results suggest that Inga trees provide alternative food to natural enemies of <b>coffee</b> <b>pests,</b> resulting in increased natural control. Thus, extrafloral nectaries of associated trees can enhance natural pest control in agroforestry systems...|$|R

40|$|Coffee {{production}} in Africa has largely stagnated {{over the past}} two decades. While the continent had attained a production level of 19. 5 million 60 kg bags of coffee in 1997, {{production in}} 2008 was only 17. 5 million 60 kg. This stagnation has been attributed to a number of factors including poor management practices and losses due to damage by insect pests and diseases (Musoli et. al, 2001). The coffee berry borer (CBB) (Hypothenemus hampei Ferr), considered endemic to the African continent, is undoubtedly the most important insect pest of coffee in Africa causing significant damage to yield and quality of the crop in many producer countries. In Africa CBB is regarded as the most prevalent and important <b>coffee</b> <b>pest</b> and a problem for the coffee industry. In Kenya, infestation levels of 80 % during the peak season with significant losses in yield and quality has been reported (Masaba et. al., 1985). Severe infestation may result in up to 80 % of berries being attacked in Uganda and Ivory Coast, and 96 % in Congo and Tanzania (Waterhouse and Norris, 1989). In Uganda, damage has been found to vary mainly due to the uneven distribution of bio-control agents, and differences in cropping systems and farmer practices (Kucel and Orozco-Hoyos, 1998).

40|$|The {{coexistence}} {{between members}} of a multi-exploiter system, whereby one victim (the host or prey) is attacked by two or more exploiters (predators, pathogens or parasites), was examined {{in the case of}} Coccus viridis; a sessile scale insect <b>coffee</b> <b>pest</b> that is attacked by a predatory Coccinellid, Azya orbigera, and an entomopathogenic fungus, Lecanicillium lecanii. Experimental inclusion of A. orbigera resulted in lower proportions of scales infected with L. lecanii; the trend further supported by field survey data from the previous year. Selective consumption by A. orbigera of late stage C. viridis instars that are more often infected by L. lecanii may act to remove the most susceptible individuals from the population thus lowering levels of infection in the presence of beetles. Lefkovitch stage-based matrix models provide evidence that L. lecanii is an important natural enemy of C. viridis, and that exploitation of C. viridis life stages 1 - 3 currently limits population growth. Thus, for systems where C. viridis is a major problem, promoting a variety of natural enemies that attack different instars can effectively control the pest if combined with infection from L. lecanii. In addition, theoretical analysis of a model describing a generalist pathogen and a specialist predator that share a common victim resource, hints to the importance of non-linear indirect ecological interactions such as intraguild predation in promoting coexistence between all components of the multi-exploiter system. Such self-limiting processes may be integral to how biological control through biocomplexity can maintain pests at below threshold levels, while also limiting the spread of the control agents themselves...|$|E

40|$|Agro-{{ecosystem}}s {{are major}} sources of ecosystem services (ESs). Coffee, originally a shade crop, is an important export cash crop for Costa Rica and other Latin America countries. Coffee grown under shades of diverse natural shade tree species ("rustic" systems) has potential to provide numerous ESs. However, coffee systems in Costa Rica have gone through transformation that involved sparse or absence of shade and intensive production systems with higher external input, favouring short term financial benefits over long-term generation of ESs. The objective {{of the study was}} to understand how coffee producing households´ characteristics, related to decisions on resources endowments and management, interact with field characteristics to generate key ESs: yield and regulation of important <b>coffee</b> <b>pests</b> and diseases. We carried-out household and management surveys, measurements of coffee field characteristics and monitoring of ESs in Llano Bonito watershed, Costa Rica for the coffee production year 2013 - 2014. To understand household characteristics, resource endowments and key ESs management within coffee production systems, a structured questionnaire survey was employed to 40 sample households. 97 plots were sampled in coffee fields of surveyed households and measurements were carried out to characterise site, coffee, and shade tree, and to quantify coffee yield. These plots were further re-sampled and 69 plots were selected to monitor variations of locally important <b>coffee</b> <b>pests</b> and diseases along 4 time series. After the final coffee harvest, a second household level survey was carried-out to record coffee management practices for the sampled plot for the production year. Households and fields were categorised into 4 and 3 categories respectively with the aid of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC). Households were categorised based on their functional characteristics, which included their orientation to produce coffee and state of coffee management whereas fields were categorised based on their biophysical characteristics, which included their suitability for generating ESs. Features of each category and interactions between household and field categories are summarised. The method shows how diversities of decision and biophysical contexts can be taken into account while assessing and promoting ESs from agro-ecosystems. The results demonstrate feasibility to evaluate variations in decision and biophysical contexts of agro-ecosystems for understanding ESs, and have potential to contribute to understanding and thus promotion of ESs...|$|R

The biology of A. thunbergii was studied at four constant temperatures of 20, 25, 30 and 35 °C with 80 ± 5 % RH and a photoperiod of L:D 12 : 12. Complete development of A. thunbergii from egg to adult occurred between 20 and 30 °C, while eggs did not hatch at 35 °C. Immature stage development time decreased significantly {{with an increase in}} temperature, with the exception of fifth nymphal stage, duration of which was similar for all temperatures. The fecundity was maximal at 20 °C with an average of 132. 8 eggs per female and 1. 7 egg per female per day. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) was the highest at 20 °C with 75. 79 daughters per female compared to 19. 56 and 2. 69 daughters per female at 25 and 30 °C, respectively.

It feeds on coffee plant vegetative parts and berries leading to a direct reduction in coffee yield and quality. This study aimed to determine A. thunbergii thermal requirements, and to obtain new information on the pest demography as influenced by temperature. Temperature-dependent models were developed using the Insect Life Cycle Modelling software (ILCYM) through a complete life table study at seven constant temperatures in the range 18 – 32 °C. Non-linear functions were fitted to A. thunbergii development, mortality, fecundity and senescence. Model parameters and demographic variables obtained from the models were given for each temperature and development stage. Life table parameters were estimated for nine constant temperatures, from 18 °C to 26 °C, using stochastic simulations. The minimum temperature threshold (Tmin) and the thermal constant (k) for the development from egg to adult were estimated from a linear function at 12. 1 °C and 666. 67 ° days, respectively. The maximum temperature threshold (Tmax) was estimated at 33. 9 °C from a Logan model. The optimum temperature for immature stages' survival {{was estimated to be}} between 22. 4 and 24. 7 °C. The maximum fecundity was 147. 7 eggs female− 1 at 21. 2 °C.

40|$|As an {{implicit}} {{justification for the}} importance of conserving biological diversity it is postulated that biodiversity confers benefits to ecosystems. However, how does it promote ecosystem function and stability is not fully understood. Natural pest control is an example of an ecosystem service thought to be enhanced by the high biodiversity and embedded biocomplexity of diverse agroecosystems. My PhD. research addresses how the biocomplexity of an agroecosystem allows the population persistence of important natural enemies, which in turn, help to maintain the populations of potentially harmful pests below damaging levels. I focused on a subsystem of a complex ecological insect web in an organic coffee farm in Chiapas, Mexico, where I studied the interactions between a tree-nesting aggressive ant (Azteca instabilis), a potential <b>coffee</b> <b>pest</b> (the green coffee scale, Coccus viridis), and a predatory ladybeetle (Azya orbigera). This voracious predator of green scales is very abundant in the farm and, therefore, a potential natural controller of green scale populations. I used a combination of laboratory and field experiments to understand the local interactions between all the organisms involved; large scale field surveys to determine the spatial distribution and persistence of the organisms; and computer simulations to experiment with different hypothetical scenarios. I show that, contrary to previous reports, the mutualism between A. instabilis and green scales can be beneficial to the ladybeetle populations. I showed how the complex interactions associated with the this mutualism influence the persistence, spatial distribution, and dispersal of the voracious A. orbigera, which in turn, is imposing the control that is likely preventing green scale population outbreaks. The result is a healthy agroecosystem with little necessity for external inputs for green scale management. Since green scales are persistent pests in many coffee producing areas in the world, its maintenance below damaging levels in this particular farm may be an example of an important ecosystem service provided by complex local and spatial dynamics characteristic of diverse agroecosystems...|$|E

The Coffee Berry-borer, Hypothenemus hampei, is the world???s primary <b>coffee</b> <b>pest.</b> Studies indicate that birds can reduce insect abundance on coffee farms, although no research has examined avian control of berry-borer or quantified avian benefits to crop yield or farm income. I conducted a bird exclosure experiment on four coffee farms in the Blue Mountains, Jamaica to document avian pest control of berry-borer, identify potential avian predator species, associate predator abundance and berry-borer reductions with habitat complexity, and economically quantify resulting yield increases. Coffee plants excluded from foraging birds had significantly greater infestation, more broods, and greater berry damage than paired control plants. We identified 17 predator species; 67 % of detections were wintering Neotropical migrants, and three primary species comprised 50 % of these. Migrant predators overall did not respond to vegetation complexity while primary predators increased with proximity to habitat patches. Resident predator species increased with shade-tree cover and coffee shrub density. Berry-borer reductions were not correlated with predator abundance or vegetation complexity. The market value of increased berries from pest reductions was U. S. $ 44 -$ 105 per hectare for 2005 / 2006. High regional landscape heterogeneity may allow primary predators to provide pest control broadly, despite localized farming intensities, but further agricultural intensification could disrupt current services.

The {{potential}} {{damage caused by}} the invasion of exotic ambrosia beetles to Hawaiʻi {{is one of the}} biggest concerns for the coffee, forestry and ornamental plant industries.

The black twig borer, Xylosandrus compactus (Eichhoff), is an important <b>coffee</b> <b>pest</b> and native forests in Hawaiʻi. This ambrosia beetle is highly polyphagous, reported from > 200 hosts, including native plants such as the valuable timber species Acacia koa. This dissertation addressed the response of X. compactus to semiochemicals which were used to determine the beetle flight seasonality, phenology of the black twig borer in coffee plantations, and development of a sequential sampling plan for management decision making. It was demonstrated that Japanese beetle traps baited with ethanol can serve as monitoring tool for the black twig borer, and ethyl alcohol baits yielded higher capture rates than eugenol and α-pinene. It was also demonstrated that the repellents verbenone and limonene, significantly reduced trap catches of black twig borer. Ethanol baited Japanese beetle tras were used to assess the seasonal fluctuation of black twig borer throughout the year. Data obtained from trapping demonstrated the peak beetle flight periods, which were used as an predictor of damage levels for accurate timing of control measures. Elevation and season were significantly related with the number of beetles captured and level of infestation. Taylor's Power Law analysis showed an aggregated infestation of X. compactus in coffee fields. The density of infested branches per sampled unit can be estimated using the sampling plan and compared with the action threshold level to make a management decision. Enumerative sampling allows estimation of the black twig borer abundance with specified precision, providing researchers with a valid tool for the study of this pest in coffee.

40|$|Crop pest {{and disease}} incidences at plot scale vary {{as a result}} of {{landscape}} effects. Two main effects can be distinguished. First, landscape context provides habitats of variable quality for pests, pathogens, and beneficial and vector organisms. Second, the movements of these organisms are dependent on the connectivity status of the landscape. Most of the studies focus on indirect effects of landscape context on pest abundance through their predators and parasitoids, and only a few on direct effects on pests and pathogens. Here we studied three coffee pests and pathogens, with limited or no pressure from host-specific natural enemies, and with widely varying life histories, to test their relationships with landscape context: a fungus, Hemileia vastatrix, causal agent of coffee leaf rust; an insect, the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Curculionidae); and root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp. Their incidence was assessed in 29 coffee plots from Turrialba, Costa Rica. In addition, we characterized the landscape context around these coffee plots in 12 nested circular sectors ranging from 50 to 1500 m in radius. We then performed correlation analysis between proportions of different land uses at different scales and <b>coffee</b> <b>pest</b> and disease incidences. We obtained significant positive correlations, peaking at the 150 m radius, between coffee berry borer abundance and proportion of coffee in the landscape. We also found significant positive correlations between coffee leaf rust incidence and proportion of pasture, peaking at the 200 m radius. Even after accounting for plot level predictors of coffee leaf rust and coffee berry borer through covariance analysis, the significance of landscape structure was maintained. We hypothesized that connected coffee plots favored coffee berry borer movements and improved its survival. We also hypothesized that wind turbulence, produced by low-wind-resistance land uses such as pasture, favored removal of coffee leaf rust spore clusters from host surfaces, resulting in increased epidemics. In contrast, root-knot nematode population density was not correlated to landscape context, possibly because nematodes are almost immobile in the soil. We propose fragmenting coffee plots with forest corridors to control coffee berry borer movements between coffee plots without favoring coffee leaf rust dispersal (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

The goal was to produce and test proteins that inhibit both the coffee berry borer insect Hypothenemus hampei and the coffee rust fungus Hemileia vastatrix. Both recombinant proteins MBP/exochitinase and MBP/endochitinase showed chitinolytic activity. When recombinant purified proteins were added to an artificial coffee-based diet for the coffee berry borer, MBP/exochitinase at a concentration of 0. 5 % W/W caused delayed growth of larvae and 100 % mortality between days 8 and 15, while MBP/endochitinase caused 100 % mortality at day 35.

40|$|In recent decades, ecologists {{have come}} to {{appreciate}} what many farmers have long known—that biodiversity and ecological complexity play essential roles {{in many of the}} processes occurring in agroecosystems. These include many ecosystem services and functions, such as biological control, pollination, and soil fertility and preservation. At the same time, ecologically complex agroecosystems are extremely important for the maintenance of biodiversity at local and at regional scales. In short, diverse agroecosystems help to maintain biodiversity, and biodiversity helps to maintain critical functions and services in these agroecosystems. As such, it is critical to understand the role of ecological complexity in and around agroecosystems so as to maximize the benefits to the conservation of biodiversity and of ecosystem services. I focused my questions on the service of biological control and the biodiversity of natural enemies, and I performed my research on coffee farms in Mexico and Puerto Rico. First, I addressed the importance of natural enemy diversity on biological control, where I studied two ladybeetle predators of a <b>coffee</b> <b>pest.</b> I concluded that through niche partitioning, these beetles coexist and enhance overall biocontrol through species complementarity. Then, using a quantitative review, I addressed how natural enemies are influenced by ecological complexity at various scales. I found that landscape complexity may play a more important role than local heterogeneity in determining enemy abundance and diversity. Next, I focused on one natural enemy guild, parasitoid wasps, and assessed how they respond to ecological complexity at local and landscape scales. Then, through meta-analysis, I addressed the challenge of attaining farms that are both productive and that retain high levels of biocontrol. I found that win-win relationships between biocontrol and yield are probable under certain planting conditions. Finally, I take a multifunctional approach and assess how multiple taxa and multiple ecosystem services respond to ecological complexity. I found that farms can be most profitable and conserve high biodiversity if incentive structures exist to support vegetationally complex farms. In summary, my dissertation research demonstrates the importance of ecological complexity in coffee farms for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, such as biocontrol...|$|E
40|$|Social insects {{rank among}} the most {{ubiquitous}} and ecologically dominant terrestrial animals on Earth. Complex communication and social organization are two defining features of social insect societies and ants, in particular, have evolved extensive systems of chemical communication. In both natural and agricultural systems, including coffee agroecosystems, ants are important predators and often have strong and complex effects on pest species. In this dissertation, I explore how chemical communication {{plays a role in}} dynamics between ants and their natural enemies within these coffee agroecosystems, {{to gain a better understanding}} of both how ants utilize their own chemical communication systems and how natural enemies of ants take advantage of these systems to exploit ants. In the first dissertation chapter, I review the literature on chemical and visual cues that one natural enemy of the ant, the phorid fly, uses to successfully parasitized its host ants. Phorid fly parasitoids that use ants as hosts often require the use of multiple cues, ranging from general to highly specific, to home in on an ideal host. Here I outline the five common steps in which phorid flies use cues: (a) host habitat location, (b) host location, (c) host acceptance, (d) host discrimination and (e) host regulation. I then discuss our current understanding of how phorid flies use each of these steps to successfully parasitize ant hosts. Finally, I examine the wide variety of strategies and cues used by a multiple species of phorid flies within three separate genera (Apocephalus, Pseudacteon, and Neodohrniphora) and discuss future directions within this field of study. In the second dissertation chapter, I investigate the role of Azteca ant cuticular hydrocarbon cues as a short-range cue for a suite of Pseudacteon spp. phorid fly parasitoids commonly found within coffee agroecosystems. Here I describe the hierarchy of cues Pseudacteon spp. phorid flies use to successfully identify Azteca host ants. I use behavioral observations in the field to show phorid flies are attracted to two cryptic Azteca taxa, but will only attack Azteca sericeasur (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae). To test whether the phorid flies are able to distinguish between the two Azteca taxa using their cuticular hydrocarbons, I first document and compare the cuticular hydrocarbons of two cryptic Azteca taxa using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Using cuticular hydrocarbon transfer experiments with live ants from both Azteca taxa, I identify the cuticular hydrocarbons of Azteca sericeasur as a short-range host location cue used by Pseudacteon lasciniosus (Diptera: Phoridae) to locate the ants. In the third chapter, I describe two new species of Myrmedonota (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) that are also natural enemies of Azteca sericeasur ants. Here I record this genus of beetle in Mexico for the first time, and describe M. xipe and M. shimmerale for the first time. This chapter also documents that both Myrmedonota species will aggregate towards agitated ants, to prey on Azteca sericeasur and these species will form mating swarms, either with no apparent landmark or in the vicinity of ants. My fourth chapter examines the role of the beetle, Myrmedonota xipe, in Azteca ant-phorid fly interactions. Here I use pheromone bioassays to show that M. xipe is attracted to a component of A. sericeasur alarm pheromone. In the field experiments, I determine that the beetles are able to locate parasitized ants as prey items but not healthy ants. In choice tests in the lab, I also show that beetles will preferentially attack parasitized ants over healthy ants. Analysis of the choice tests also indicates that the aggression in parasitized ants is so reduced that beetles are essentially able to eat these ants alive without interruption. These results suggest that, although beetles are predators of the ants, by preying primarily on ants harboring phorid fly eggs, the beetles may also provide indirect positive effects for the ant colonies as a whole. In my final dissertation chapter I examine the variation in cuticular hydrocarbon blends of three species of arboreal twig nesting ants, Pseudomyrmex simplex, Pseudomyrmex ejectus and another Pseudomyrmex sp. (referred to as PSW- 53) commonly found within the coffee agroecosystems of Southern Mexico. In this study, I examined whether variation in the ecology and social structure of these species is reflected in the variation in their cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. I tested the hypothesis that the more abundant species with higher nest densities exhibit lower cuticular hydrocarbon variation. The results showed that worker ants of abundant P. ejectus and P. simplex from the study site exhibit significantly lower variation in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles than workers of the rare ant species P. PSW- 53. Our study reinforces the idea that examining cuticular hydrocarbon profiles can provide insight into the colony structure of social insects. 	Overall, the results from my dissertation provide insight into the complex interactions between ants and their natural enemies, particularly shedding light on how these interactions are facilitated through the use of ant pheromones as cues and signals. The ants and their natural enemies that I focus on in my dissertation are also important players within the greater coffee agroecosystems in which they inhabit, and this body of work is thus critical for understanding how their network of interactions involving ants and their natural enemies may impact <b>coffee</b> <b>pest</b> control...|$|E

40|$|International {{trade has}} brought {{tremendous}} choice to consumers and expanded markets for producers. Cross-border exchange also brings import risks {{such as food}} contaminants and invasive species. Balancing legitimate concerns to protect {{health and the environment}} with avoiding protectionist use of risk-based measures is highly important to the integrity of the multilateral trading system. This research studies three aspects of the relation between domestic regulations and international trade. Firstly, this thesis provides evidence addressing an ongoing international policy debate. This thesis is the first to show that the 8, 487 new risk-based regulations under the Sanitary Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement and 4, 745 regulations under Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement notified from 1996 - 2010 are driven in part by loss of tariff protection and country-level environmental governance factors. Declining tariffs, however, do not make the implementation of “suspect” SPS (i. e. measures later subject to a trade concern) more likely. This suggests policymakers may be systematically choosing to work on products that have lost tariff protection, but not systemically putting in illegitimate, non-tariff barriers to compensate. Secondly, this thesis investigates the patterns of Specific Trade Concerns (STCs) raised against 292 suspect SPS policies and 282 suspect TBT policies by members of the WTO from 1996 - 2010. It was found that developing countries struggle to resolve concerns they raise against developed economies. From work on 79 plant health concerns, it was clear that countries raise STCs using science-based and economics-based arguments of illegitimacy. Lastly, SPS measures are implemented to reduce risks transmitted via trade, but the effectiveness of risk reduction depends as well on actions of supply chain actors before export.

40|$|The {{scientific}} community has {{recognized the importance}} of integrating farmer’s perceptions and knowledge (FPK) for the development of sustainable pest and disease management strategies. However, the knowledge gap between indigenous and scientific knowledge still contributes to misidentification of plant health constraints and poor adoption of management solutions. This is particularly the case in the context of smallholder farming in developing countries. In this paper, we present a case study on coffee production in Uganda, a sector depending mostly on smallholder farming facing a simultaneous and increasing number of socio-ecological pressures. The objectives of this study were (i) to examine and relate FPK on Arabica <b>Coffee</b> <b>Pests</b> and Diseases (CPaD) to altitude and the vegetation structure of the production systems; (ii) to contrast results with perceptions from experts and (iii) to compare results with field observations, in order to identify constraints for improving the information flow between scientists and farmers. Data were acquired by means of interviews and workshops. One hundred and fifty farmer households managing coffee either at sun exposure, under shade trees or inter-cropped with bananas and spread across an altitudinal gradient were selected. Field sampling of the two most important CPaD was conducted on a subset of 34 plots. The study revealed the following findings: (i) Perceptions on CPaD with respect to their distribution across altitudes and perceived impact are partially concordant among farmers, experts and field observations (ii) There are discrepancies among farmers and experts regarding management practices and the development of CPaD issues of the previous years. (iii) Field observations comparing CPaD in different altitudes and production systems indicate ambiguity of the role of shade trees. According to the locality-specific variability in CPaD pressure as well as in FPK, the importance of developing spatially variable and relevant CPaD control practices is proposed.

Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are based on seven years of bird capture data produce d by long-term mist-netting stations operating in eight different land uses, seven agricultural and a forest fragment. Chapter 1 comprises lessons learned during seven years of mist-netting efforts in eight land uses following a management intensity gradient. Chapter 2 focuses on bird community stability, stability understood as no changes from year to year in mean species richness and abundance of either the total population, or of resident and migratory species over a seven year period. Chapter 3 is based on an experimental study focusing on the effect of bird species in the suppression of the Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei), one of the most detrimental <b>coffee</b> <b>pests</b> worldwide. Results from our research highlights the importance of including agricultural land uses in biodiversity conservation planning. Agroforestry systems particularly showed potential for bird conservation in agricultural landscapes while fostering stable bird communities that are closer in composition to our reference forest fragment. Additionally, our results also showed that our landscape is capable of supporting bird species providing important pest control services. Finally, despite the value of agricultural land uses our results also highlight that our forest fragment fosters unique bird communities when compared to agricultural lands. Conservation planning at the landscape level should considered the uniqueness of these habitats and integrate efforts to conserve forests and managed agricultural lands for biodiversity conservation, particularly in these human-dominated landscapes.

40|$|Coffee {{production}} worldwide {{is threatened}} by a range of <b>coffee</b> <b>pests</b> and diseases (CPaD). Integrated management options require {{an understanding of the}} bioecology of CPaD and the prevalent interdependencies within the agroecological context. The comparison of different shading systems (e. g. shade-grown vs. sun-grown coffee) and the identification of trade-offs for ecosystem services is still a matter of ongoing debates. There is little quantitative knowledge of field-level investigation on shade effects and its ecological mechanisms across environmental and shading system gradients. Considering the increasingly evident effects of progressive climate change on CPaD, the need to examine the balance of shade effects under different environmental conditions becomes apparent. With the example of the coffee growing region of Mt Elgon, Uganda, this project aimed at addressing the complexity of shading effects on economically relevant CPaD using environmental and production system gradients. The approach was designed in an interdisciplinary manner, to involve the broader context of coffee agroforestry systems. The first two chapters of this thesis dealt with general aspects of coffee smallholder farming. The diversity of existing coffee production systems was characterized along an altitudinal gradient. A typology of production systems based on indicators related to the vegetation structure was generated and classified as coffee open canopy, coffee-banana inter-cropping, and densely shaded coffee systems. The typology served as the basis for comparison across the environmental and production system gradients. In the second chapter, farmers' knowledge on CPaD and the role of shade trees was contrasted with expert knowledge and field observations. Discrepancies regarding CPaD symptomatology, management and response to shade were revealed. Tackling institutional obstacles and disentangling shading effects are therefore a priority for the improvement of plant health management. The last two chapters focused more specifically on biophysical aspects of Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR, Hemileia vastatrix) and White Coffee Stem Borer (WCSB, Monochamus leuconotus). The effects of environment and production system on CLR abundance were spatio-temporally variable and either directly, interactive or indirectly mediated by microclimate. The development of white coffee stem borer was controlled by the bimodal rainfall, and by altitude and shade through their effect on minimum temperature. The findings emphasize the enormous importance of micro-environments for the ecology of CPaD, not least because of its implications in the context of climate change. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{mechanisms}} promoting {{assembly and}} maintenance of diversity have been identified, from disturbance to habitat heterogeneity to structure of species interaction networks. Understanding which mechanisms are operating {{and how they are}} interacting in the field is crucial for conserving functional diversity and important ecosystem services. This is particularly true in managed ecosystems, such as agroecosystems, where effective biocontrol often relies on associated biodiversity such as insect predators and parasitoids. Here we examined the impact of habitat complexity on the response of an arboreal foraging ant community to disturbance in a coffee agroecosystem in Chiapas, Mexico. The primary disturbance in this system is driven by an entomopathogenic fungus (Lecanicillium lecanii) infecting the green coffee scale (Coccus viridis), an important food resource for its mutualist partner, Azteca instabilis, a dominant ant species. We hypothesize the disruption of this mutualism forces a shift in foraging of the dominant competitor and thus has cascading effects on the arboreal foraging ant community. Furthermore, we hypothesize that increasing habitat complexity, in this case shade tree density, provides refugia and alternative foraging resources for the keystone dominant thereby encouraging a resource shift, which in turn facilitates transmission of the disturbance to the arboreal ant community. To test these hypotheses, we induced an artificial fungal epizootic in four experimental sites by spraying a suspended L. lecanii spore mixture on coffee bushes surrounding A. instabilis nest-sites in which the ant/scale mutualism was strong. Surveys of activity of all arboreal foraging ant species present were undertaken before and after the epizootic. These surveys were undertaken in both coffee bushes and shade trees within the experimental plots and were compared to 4 identical analyses undertaken in a control site. We found a significant shift in foraging activity of A. instabilis in two of four experimental sites after the artificial epizootic. This response was correlated with shade tree density; at high tree density, we found a significant decrease in A. instabilis foraging activity in coffee bushes and corresponding increase in foraging activity in shade trees. Additionally, we found an increase in foraging activity of other species of ants correlated with the shift in A. instabilis foraging. These results suggest that increasing habitat complexity allowed A. instabilis to respond to disturbance and the resulting change in foraging location of the dominant competitor opened niche space for other arboreal foraging ants, promoting maintenance of functional ant diversity. These results provide insight into how complex interactions can drive spatial patterns of species distribution, and have implications for shade management as a means of promoting predatory ant diversity and thus biocontrol of <b>coffee</b> <b>pests...</b>|$|R
