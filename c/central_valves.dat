50|$|The Willans engine or <b>central</b> <b>valve</b> {{engine was}} a {{high-speed}} stationary steam engine used for electricity generation around {{the start of}} the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{developed}} by Peter W. Willans and Mark Robinson at Thames Ditton, primarily for the increasing market in electrical generation. In 1884 they were granted a patent for the <b>central</b> <b>valve</b> principle.|$|R
5000|$|In 1907 Paget became General Superintendent, with Henry Fowler {{becoming}} Works Manager. In 1908 Paget caused {{to be built}} {{a revolutionary}} new locomotive, the Paget locomotive based on the Willans high speed <b>central</b> <b>valve</b> engines, some {{of which had been}} installed at the works.|$|R
50|$|The {{rise of the}} Electricity {{industry}} {{created a}} new demand for their engines. Their engines were designed to operate at a constant speed and were ideal for electricity generation. At their peak their <b>central</b> <b>valve</b> engines provided 68% of Britain's installed capacity for generation of electricity.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundA {{competent}} {{aortic valve}} {{is essential to}} providing effective left ventricular assist device support. We have adopted a practice of <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure by placing a simple coaptation stitch at left ventricular assist device implantation in patients with significant aortic insufficiency. We conducted a follow-up study to evaluate the efficacy and durability of this procedure. MethodsThe study included patients who had undergone continuous flow left ventricular assist device implantation. The patients were divided into 2 groups, {{those who did not}} require any aortic procedure because the valve was competent and those who underwent <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure for mild or greater aortic regurgitation. The clinical endpoints were mortality, progression or recurrence of aortic insufficiency, and reoperation for aortic valve pathologic features. Aortic insufficiency was measured qualitatively from mild to severe on a scale of 0 to 5. ResultsA total of 123 patients received continuous flow left ventricular assist devices from February 2007 to August 2011. Of those, 18 (15 %) underwent <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure at left ventricular assist device implantation because of significant aortic insufficiency (1. 8 ± 1. 4) and 105 who did not (competent aortic valve, 0. 15 ± 0. 43; P < . 01). At follow-up (median, 312 days; range, 0 - 1429 days), the mean aortic insufficiency score remained low for the patients with <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure (0. 27 ± 0. 46) in contrast to those without <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure who experienced aortic insufficiency progression (0. 78 ± 0. 89; P = . 02). In addition, the proportion of patients with more than mild aortic insufficiency was significantly less in the <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure group (0 % vs 18 %; P = . 05). The patients in the <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure group were significantly older and had a greater incidence of renal failure at baseline. The 30 -day mortality was greater in the <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure group, but the late survival was similar between the 2 groups. No reoperations were required for recurrent aortic insufficiency. ConclusionsThe results of our study have shown that repair of aortic insufficiency with a simple central coaptation stitch is effective and durable in left ventricular assist device-supported patients, with follow-up extending into 2 years. Although aortic insufficiency progressed over time in those with minimal native valve regurgitation initially, no such progression was noted in those with <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure. Additional investigation is needed to evaluate whether prophylactic <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> closure should be performed at left ventricular assist device implantation to avoid problematic aortic regurgitation developing over time, in particular in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation for life-long (destination therapy) support...|$|R

40|$|As {{multiple}} new procedures now require better {{visualization of}} the aortic valve, {{we sought to}} better define the <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> coaptation area seen during diastole on multi-detector row cardiac computed tomography (MDCT). 64 -MDCT images of 384 symptomatic consecutive patients referred for coronary artery disease evaluation {{were included in the}} study. Planimetric measurements of this area were performed on cross-sectional views of the aortic valve at 75 % phase of the cardiac cycle. Planimetric measurement of central regurgitation orifice area (ROA) seen in patients with aortic regurgitation and Hounsfield units of the <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> coaptation area were performed. Mean area of the <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> coaptation area was 5. 34  ±  5. 19  mm 2 and Hounsfield units in this area were 123. 69  ±  31. 31  HU. The aortic valve coaptation area (mm 2) measurement in patients without AR was: 4. 90  ±  0. 17 and in patients with AR: 10. 53  ±  0. 26 (P = < 0. 05). On Bland–Altman analysis a very good correlation between <b>central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> coaptation area and central ROA was found (r =  0. 80, P = < 0. 001). <b>Central</b> aortic <b>valve</b> coaptation area is a central area present at the coaptation of nodules of arantius of aortic cusps during diastole; it is incompetent and increased in size in patients with aortic regurgitation...|$|R
50|$|The wing-flaperon gaps were {{originally}} sealed by internal Teflon S seals {{on the top}} side and by thin metal strip seals sliding over Teflon on the bottom side. PET film seals later became standard on both surfaces.

50|$|On an {{upstream}} manifold {{the left}} and right cylinder valves allow the corresponding first stage regulator to be shut off, leaving the entire gas supply to be used through the remaining regulator. On an isolation manifold, the <b>central</b> <b>valve,</b> called the isolating valve, separates the tanks into two independent systems, each with its own first-stage and second-stage regulators, which can prevent an upstream failure in one half of the system from losing the entire gas supply.|$|R
2500|$|Scorpions {{original}} [...] "full overhaul" [...] {{was reduced}} in scope. Long-overdue SUBSAFE work, {{such as a}} new <b>central</b> <b>valve</b> control system, was not performed. Crucially, her emergency system was not corrected for the same problems that destroyed Thresher. While Charleston Naval Ship Yard claimed the Emergency Main Ballast Tank Blow (EMBT) system worked as-is, SUBLANT claimed it did not, and their EMBT was [...] "tagged out" [...] or listed as unusable. Perceived problems with overhaul duration led to a delay on all SUBSAFE work in 1967.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} {{and the combination}} of advanced boundary conditions and subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations are presented. The goal is to perform reliable cold flow LES simulations in complex geometries, such as cylinder engines. In the paper, an inlet boundary condition for synthetic turbulence generation is combined with a fully non reflecting Navier Stokes Characteristic Boundary Condition (NSCBC) for the outlet and with the local Dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid scale model, that {{is not included in}} the official distribution of OpenFOAM®. Validation of the models has been performed separately on two steady state flow benches: a backward facing step geometry and a simple IC engine geometry with one axed <b>central</b> <b>valve.</b> The code developed has been included into LibICE®, a set of applications and libraries for multi-dimensional engine modeling based on the OpenFOAM® technology...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the best-known}} {{examples}} of the steeple engine was the Willans engine. These were double- or triple-expansion compound engines, with the unusual features of single-acting cylinders and a <b>central</b> spindle <b>valve</b> shared between all cylinders. By around 1900, more of the Willans type were in service for electrical generation than any other type.|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} engine was its <b>central</b> spindle <b>valve.</b> This acted as a multi-stage piston valve, controlling admission of steam into each of the compound cylinders. Unusually the valve worked within the hollow piston rod or trunk, {{rather than in the}} cylinder block or valvechest. This hollow piston rod linked all of the cylinders and was machined with ports.|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} {{and the combination}} of advanced boundary conditions and subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations are presented. The goal is to perform reliable cold flow LES simulations in complex geometries, {{such as in the}} cylinders of internal combustion engines. The implementation of an inlet boundary condition for synthetic turbulence generation and of two subgrid scale models, the local Dynamic Smagorinsky and the Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-viscosity SGS model (WALE) is described. The WALE model is based on the square of the velocity gradient tensor and it accounts for the effects of both the strain and the rotation rate of the smallest resolved turbulent fluctuations and it recovers the proper y 3 near-wall scaling for the eddy viscosity without requiring dynamic pressure; hence, {{it is supposed to be}} a very reliable model for ICE simulation. Model validation has been performed separately on two steady state flow benches: a backward facing step geometry and a simple IC engine geometry with one axed <b>central</b> <b>valve.</b> A discussion on the completeness of the LES simulation (i. e. LES simulation quality) is given...|$|R
50|$|The first multiple-cylinder {{locomotive}} {{to demonstrate}} {{some of the}} principles of the steam motor was the Midland Railway's Paget locomotive of 1907. This was one of many attempts to build a balanced locomotive, so avoiding the problems of hammer blow. It also followed contemporary advanced stationary engine practice in using single-acting cylinders. The locomotive has been variously described as either inspired by, or actually using, the design of the Willans engine that represented the peak of steam engine design at this time. In fact, the rotary valves used for the locomotive were entirely different from the Willans' characteristic <b>central</b> <b>valve</b> spindle, even though they did both use single-acting trunk pistons. Eight cylinders were used, two driving the front axle of the three driving axles, four the middle axle and two the rear axle. All three axles were coupled by external coupling rods. The central axle was a complicated forging as a four-throw internal crank axle, although following traditional Stephenson practice. To provide additional space for the cylinders, the locomotive was outside framed.|$|R
50|$|The New York Central had two L-1 {{locomotives}} rebuilt by Alco in 1922 {{with three}} cylinders {{to help determine}} if three-cylinder drive was worthwhile. They were substantially {{more powerful than the}} two cylinder locomotives but it was debatable if the additional maintenance headaches of that third, hard to reach <b>central</b> cylinder, <b>valve</b> gear, main rod and crank axle were worthwhile. The NYC must have come down on the negative side of that question, for no more were built.|$|R
50|$|Willans' {{engine was}} one of the best-known {{examples}} of the steeple compound engine. These were double- or triple-expansion compound engines, with the unusual features of single-acting cylinders and a <b>central</b> spindle <b>valve</b> shared between all the cylinders of that spindle. The cylinders are arranged as tandem compounds, with high- and low-pressure cylinders mounted on the same vertical shaft. This vertical arrangement of the steeple compound gives a compact floor layout for an engine of such power.|$|R
