It can postpone the dividend in case of <b>cumulative</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> also. No fixed burden is created on its finances.|$|R
50|$|Holders of the Ordinary {{shares in}} either Morris or Austin {{received}} {{the same number of}} new Ordinary shares in BMCHolders of Preferred shares, because of the four different classes in Austin's capital received various apportionments of new 5% <b>Cumulative</b> <b>Preference</b> <b>shares</b> related to their market valuations.|$|R

50|$|In May 1896 {{the firm}} became a public limited company, the Mazawattee Tea Company Ltd, which {{acquired}} the Mazawattee Ceylon Tea Company and Densham & Sons (the wholesale tea and coffee dealing {{part of the}} business). The capital was £550,000 (= £21.4 million in 2009 terms) in 5% <b>cumulative</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> of £5 each and 350,000 ordinary shares of £1 each (= £13.6 million in 2009 terms). The four brothers received 13,333 <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> and 116,666 ordinary shares, a total of £183,333 (= £7.1 million in 2009 terms). The remainder of the 26,667 <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> and 233,334 ordinary shares were offered for sale. As part of this arrangement and so that the two oldest brothers, Edward and Alfred could retire early, £30,000 each (= £1.2 million in current terms) was paid to John Lane and Benjamin, and John Lane Densham soon became chairman.|$|R

50|$|Barely {{twelve months}} after listing <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> the Rootes {{brothers}} recognised the effect death duties {{would have on}} their holdings and their businesses and the two brothers offered one quarter of Rootes Motors' ordinary shares to current holders of Rootes <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> Further issues of <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> and debenture stock followed in November 1954 and November 1959. Rootes Acceptances Limited, the export financing arm, was sold.|$|R
25|$|The {{cosmetic}} {{benefits in}} (1) reported pro-forma diluted earnings per share, (2) debt gearing (for a while) and (3) pro-forma consolidated pre-tax profits (for convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares)</b> led to UK convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> being the largest European class of convertibles {{in the early}} 1980s, until the tighter terms achievable on Euroconvertible bonds resulted in Euroconvertible new issues eclipsing domestic convertibles (including convertible <b>preference</b> <b>shares)</b> from the mid 1980s.|$|R
50|$|There had, of necessity, been capital reconstructions in 1882 and 1902. In {{the twentieth}} century {{interest}} was paid on <b>preference</b> <b>shares,</b> and in 1918 - 1921 this was as high as 4%, but on <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> only.|$|R

5000|$|The {{rights of}} holders of <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> in Germany are usually rather {{similar to those}} of {{ordinary}} shares, except for some dividend preference and no voting right in many topics of shareholders' meetings. <b>Preference</b> <b>shares</b> in German stock exchanges are usually indicated with V, VA or Vz (short for [...] )—for example, [...] "BMW Vz"—in contrast to St, StA (short for [...] ) or NA (short for [...] ) for standard <b>shares.</b> <b>Preference</b> <b>shares</b> with multiple voting rights, e.g. at RWE or Siemens, have been abolished.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{consequences}} of {{international accounting standards}} are likely to reach beyond the impact on financial statements. This paper demonstrates one of the economic implications of international standards. We focus {{on the impact of}} the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) regulation on <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> (IAS 32) in the Netherlands. IAS 32 causes most <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> to lose their classification as equity and these shares will hence be classified as liabilities. We document that for Dutch firms with preferred stock outstanding, the reclassification will on average increase the reported debt ratio by 35 %. We find that 71 % of the firms that are affected by IAS 32 buy back their <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> or alter the specifications of the <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> {{in such a way that}} the classification as equity can be maintained. The main determinant of the decision whether to give these consequences to IAS 32 is the magnitude of the impact of IAS 32 on a firm's debt ratio. We conclude that IFRS does not only lead to a decrease in the use of financial instruments that otherwise would have added to the capital structure diversity, but also changes firms' real capital structure. ...|$|R
