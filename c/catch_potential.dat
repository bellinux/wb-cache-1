40|$|Marine {{ecosystems}} are complex, and many marine species are ecologically interdependent. As a result, losing a species {{could produce a}} cascading effect on other species. Fishery scientists advocate an ecosystem-based approach to fishery management to meet long-term sustainable goals. This paper models the complex interrelationships among species {{and the relationship between}} biomass growth and phenotypic diversity. We found that the equilibrium stock and catch/yield levels are overestimated when the diversity is not accounted for. Consequently, if species are diverse, fishery policy based on a single fishery management could overestimate <b>catch</b> <b>potentials</b> and potentially results in biological overfishing and stock collapse.

40|$|Abstract onlyFish {{stocks are}} facing {{increasing}} threat of extinct ion {{partly due to}} the use of illegal fishing methods. In developing coastal countries where fishing activities are the mainstay of the population along the coast, livelihoods are being directly threatened. Although a number of studies unearthing factors determining supply of violation of fishing regulations exist, literature on the relationship between intrinsic <b>catch</b> <b>potentials</b> or fishing skills and illegal fishing behavior is scarce. Using data on violation of light attraction regulation among small-scale fishers in Ghana, our results show that the risk of punishment, fishing experience, skipper’s age and religious norms influence the decision to violate. Most importantly, we found that violators and non-violators have different fishing kills. Specifically, violators would have higher catches than non-violators if non-violators violate too. On the other hand, if the violators had not violated, they would have obtained lower catches than their counterparts who are not in violation. Consequently policies targeting illegal fishing must, in addition to traditional variables that influence violation decision, concentrate on improving the skills of the less efficient fishers...|$|R
40|$|Single-species {{management}} {{is a cause}} of discarding in mixed fisheries, because individual management objectives may not be consist-ent {{with each other and}} the species are caught simultaneously in relatively unselective fishing operations. As such, the total allowable catch (TAC) of one species may be exhausted before the TAC of another, leading to catches of valuable fish that cannot be landed legally. This important issue is, however, usually not quantified and not accounted for in traditional management advice. A simple approach using traditional catch and effort information was developed, estimating <b>catch</b> <b>potentials</b> for distinct fleets (groups of vessels) and métiers (type of activity), and hence quantifying the risks of over- and underquota utilization for the various stocks. This method, named Fcube (Fleet and Fisheries Forecast), was applied successfully to international demersal fisheries in the North Sea and shaped into the advice framework. The substantial overquota catches of North Sea cod likely under the current fisheries regimes are quantified, and it is estimated that the single-species management targets for North Sea cod cannot be achieve...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{projection}} {{of climate change}} impacts on global food supply focuses solely on production from terrestrial biomes, ignoring the large contribution of animal protein from marine capture fisheries. Here, we project changes in global <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> for 1066 species of exploited marine fish and invertebrates from 2005 to 2055 under climate change scenarios. We show that climate change may lead to large-scale redistribution of global <b>catch</b> <b>potential,</b> {{with an average of}} 30 - 70 % increase in high-latitude regions and a drop of up to 40 % in the tropics. Moreover, maximum <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> declines considerably in the southward margins of semienclosed seas while it increases in poleward tips of continental shelf margins. Such changes are most apparent in the Pacific Ocean. Among the 20 most important fishing Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regions in terms of their total landings, EEZ regions with the highest increase in <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> by 2055 include Norway, Greenland, the United States (Alaska) and Russia (Asia). On the contrary, EEZ regions with the biggest loss in maximum <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> include Indonesia, the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), Chile and China. Many highly impacted regions, particularly those in the tropics, are socioeconomically vulnerable to these changes. Thus, our results indicate the need to develop adaptation policy that could minimize climate change impacts through fisheries. The study also provides information that may be useful to evaluate fisheries management options under climate change...|$|E

40|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} {{ways in which}} climate-related shifts in the distributions and relative abundances of marine species are expected to alter the dynamics and <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> of global fisheries. While these studies assess impacts on large-scale commercial fisheries, few efforts {{have been made to}} quantitatively project impacts on small-scale subsistence and commercial fisheries that are economically, socially and culturally important to many coastal communities. This study uses a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to project scenarios of climate-related changes in the relative abundance, distribution and richness of 98 exploited marine fishes and invertebrates of commercial and cultural importance to First Nations in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Declines in abundance are projected for most of the sampled species under both the lower (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 2. 6) and higher (RCP 8. 5) emission scenarios (- 15. 0 % to - 20. 8 %, respectively), with poleward range shifts occurring at a median rate of 10. 3 to 18. 0 km decade(- 1) by 2050 relative to 2000. While a cumulative decline in <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> is projected coastwide (- 4. 5 to - 10. 7 %), estimates suggest a strong positive correlation between the change in relative <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> and latitude, with First Nations' territories along the northern and central coasts of British Columbia likely to experience less severe declines than those to the south. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation is projected between latitude and the number of species exhibiting declining abundance. These trends are shown to be robust to alternative species distribution models. This study concludes by discussing corresponding management challenges that are likely to be encountered under climate change, and by highlighting the value of joint-management frameworks and traditional fisheries management approaches that could aid in offsetting impacts and developing site-specific mitigation and adaptation strategies derived from local fishers' knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Global {{changes are}} shaping the ecology and {{biogeography}} of marine species and their fisheries. Macroecology theory, {{which deals with}} large scale relationships between ecology and biogeography, {{can be used to}} develop models to predict the effects of global changes on marine species that in turn affect their fisheries. First, based on theories linking trophic energetics and allometric scaling of metabolism, we developed a theoretical model that relates maximum <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> from a species to its trophic level, geographic range, and mean primary production within the species’ exploited range. Then, using this theoretical model and data from 1000 species of exploited marine fishes and invertebrates, we analyzed the empirical relationship between species’ approximated maximum <b>catch</b> <b>potential,</b> their ecology, and biogeography variables. Additional variables are included in the empirical model to correct for biases resulting from the uncertainty inherent in the original catch data. The empirical model has high explanatory power and agrees with theoretical expectations. In the future, this empirical model can be combined with a bioclimate envelope model to predict the socio-economic impacts of climate change on global marine fisheries. Such potential application is illustrated here with an example pertaining to the small yellow croaker Larimichthys polyactis (Sciaenidae) from the East China Sea...|$|E
40|$|Previous global {{analyses}} projected {{shifts in}} species distributions and maximum fisheries <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> across ocean basins by 2050 under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A 1 B. However, these studies did {{not account for}} the effects of changes in ocean biogeochemistry and phytoplankton community structure that affect fish and invertebrate distribution and productivity. This paper uses a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model that incorporates these factors to project distribution and maximum <b>catch</b> <b>potential</b> of 120 species of exploited demersal fish and invertebrates in the Northeast Atlantic. Using projections from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model (ESM 2. 1) under the SRES A 1 B, we project an average rate of distribution-centroid shift of 52 km decade - 1 northwards and 5. 1 m decade- 1 deeper from 2005 to 2050. Ocean acidification and reduction in oxygen content reduce growth performance, increase the rate of range shift, and lower the estimated catch potentials (10 -year average of 2050 relative to 2005) by 2030 relative to simulations without considering these factors. Consideration of phytoplankton community structure may further reduce projected catch potentials by ~ 10. These results highlight the sensitivity of marine ecosystems to biogeochemical changes and the need to incorporate likely hypotheses of their biological and ecological effects in assessing climate change impacts...|$|E

It utilizes a subsample of cases from the National Juvenile Online Victimization Survey, which concerned persons arrested for Internet sex crimes against minors in the year beginning July 1, 2000. Results suggest proactive investigations represented a significant proportion (25 %) of all arrests for Internet sex crimes against minors. Such investigations were being conducted {{at all levels of}} law enforcement. The online personas assumed by investigators paralleled the ages and genders of real youth victimized in sex crimes that started as online encounters. These proactive investigations accessed an offender group that appeared somewhat less deviant in terms of adult sexual behavior and arrest history but equally deviant as other online offenders in terms of possession of child pornography. Prosecution of these cases produced high rates of guilty pleas and low rates of dismissed or dropped cases. The entrapment, fantasy or role-playing, and factual impossibility defenses were used but not successfully. Findings suggest that the Internet sometimes allows law enforcement to interdict before a youth is victimized, gather solid evidence of offenses, and find and track some offenders...|$|E
