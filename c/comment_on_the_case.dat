500|$|On 26 September 2001, Sarfraz Ali, Ahmed Ali Awan and Shaied Nazir {{appeared}} in court charged with Parker's murder. Zairaff Mahrad was charged the following day. However, by March 2002 all four defendants had been controversially released on police bail. Parker's sister, Leanne, stated [...] "we can't begin to comprehend why they've been allowed {{out of prison}} at this stage". Parker's family were so concerned about the decision that they wrote a letter of complaint to the Home Secretary, David Blunkett. The Home Office refused to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and the men remained free on bail.|$|E
500|$|In August 2007 The Washington Post {{reported}} Katherine Wone's {{frustration with}} the FBI crime lab, [...] "It has been trying at times {{as we continue to}} wait for the FBI to complete their analysis of all the samples that were taken." [...] Over one year the case had been transferred to three separate prosecutors, earning it [...] "vagabond status" [...] in the U.S. Attorneys' office. On the one-year anniversary of Wone's death, Katherine Wone held a press conference to appeal for public assistance in finding the killer, her first public <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> During the press conference, Holder publicly pleaded with the three residents to provide additional information, saying [...] "You need to ask yourself, 'Have I provided police with all the information I know?'" [...] Interested parties, such as the OCA, used the first anniversary of Wone's death to criticize what they deemed police inaction in the investigation. In contrast to the first anniversary of Wone's murder, there was no press conference on the second anniversary, and neither the Wone family nor police made any statements to the press.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor {{has refused}} to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> Congressional staff {{routinely}} say the fraud is bank business and refer questions to Blue Ridge President Dwayne Wiseman. Following the sentencing, Taylor press secretary Deborah Potter said Taylor still had no comment, and reviewed a statement by Wiseman: [...] "For {{a number of years}} there has been an {{effort on the part of}} certain political opponents of Congressman Charles Taylor to slander him and Blue Ridge Savings Bank by indicating that neither he nor the bank or any present officers of the bank had any prior knowledge," [...] Wiseman said in the statement. [...] "This went on for some nine years with the encouragement of the press. We would hope that the settlement of this case would put an end to such speculation." [...] Taylor was never targeted by authorities as having any involvement in helping Martin defraud Blue Ridge Savings Bank, which Taylor owned.|$|E

30|$|Another {{barrier to}} the {{provision}} of feedback in our study {{may have been the}} lack of an explicitly-titled free-text ‘feedback’ section; <b>on</b> these assessments <b>the</b> free text section was titled ‘comments’ and therefore was interpreted by some trainers as <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trainee performance.|$|R

50|$|In March 2010, when Li Hongzhong, then Governor of Hubei, was {{attending}} the 11th National People's Congress in Beijing, Beijing Times journalist Liu Jie {{asked him to}} <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Deng Yujiao, a Hubei pedicurist who killed a government official who tried to rape her.

The incident was widely reported in Chinese media, but Li refused to apologize to Liu Jie, stating that she stuttered when he asked her which newspaper she represented, and that he was unsure about her identity. A week later, at least 210 intellectuals and journalists, including dramatist Sha Yexin, scholars Cui Weiping and Hu Yong, and the prominent former People's Daily editor Zhou Ruijin, signed an open letter demanding Li to resign.|$|E
