None of the past methods of marking call numbers on the spines or covers of books—direct hand {{lettering}} by pen, brush, or stylus; affixing <b>cold</b> <b>release</b> characters; embossing by hot type; or gluing labels which are handlettered, typed, or printed—nor even present automatic data processing systems have offered all the advantages of the relatively new Se-Lin labeling system: legibility, reasonable speed of application, automatic protective covering, permanent bonding, and no need for a skilled letterer. Labels seem unaesthetic to some librarians, but their advantages outweigh this consideration. When only one or a few copies of the same call number are required, Se-Lin is the best system now available for libraries marking over 1, 000 books a year...|$|E

The hydropower facility withdraws water from the lower levels of the dam's reservoir, where the water is typically cold 0 - 55 °P) and with low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the summer and fall seasons of the year. The <b>cold</b> <b>release</b> supports an active trout fishery in the tailwater reach of the dam, and a hatchery has been built downstream of the dam to stock this fishery. Unfortunately, the low DO concentrations (1 - 6 mg/L) likely inhibit the productivity of trout. The Mobile District of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers is considering hydroturbine runner replacement as part of the rehabilitation of the 40 + year old plant. They would also like to provide for a minimum daily average DO concentration of 6 mg/L and a instantaneous minimum of 5 mg/L, if economically possible. This study is an investigation of aeration alternatives for the Buford Dam designed to meet these criteria. Stanley Consultants, Inc...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUpon imbibition, {{dry seeds}} rapidly gain {{metabolic}} {{activity and the}} switching on of a germination-specific transcriptional programme in the nucleus goes ahead, with the induction of many nucleus-encoded transcripts coding for plastid-localized proteins. Dedifferentiated plastids present in dry seeds differentiate into chloroplasts in cotyledons and into amyloplasts in the root and in the hypocotyl, raising {{the question of whether}} the beginning of a new plant's life cycle is also characterized by specific changes in the plastid transcriptional programme. Here the plastid transcriptome is characterized during imbibition/stratification, germination, and early seedling outgrowth. It is shown that each of these three developmental steps is characterized by specific changes in the transcriptome profile, due to differential activities of the three plastid RNA polymerases and showing the integration of plastids into a germination-specific transcriptional programme. All three RNA polymerases are active during imbibition; that is, at 4 °C in darkness. However, activity of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is restricted to the rrn operon. After <b>cold</b> <b>release,</b> PEP changes specificity by also transcribing photosynthesis-related genes. The period of germination and radicle outgrowth is further characterized by remarkable antisense RNA production that diminishes during greening when photosynthesis-related mRNAs accumulate to their highest but to very different steady-state levels. During stratification and germination mRNA accumulation is not paralleled by protein accumulation, indicating that plastid transcription is more important for efficient germination than translation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{the growing}} problem of mine heat hazard {{in the deep}} mining, {{according}} to the actual condition of the power source, this paper mainly analyzed the heat source of the Fourth Mine in Zhong ping Energy Chemical Group, and unprecedentedly adopted the waste heat from the gas power generation in the cooling of underground environment. The low temperature refrigerant of 5. 2 °C is generat ed through a lithium bromide absorption chiller refrigeration system as the first-stage refrigerant, and {{the temperature of the}} refrigerant is further reduced to - 3. 4 °C by compressed chillers as the second-stage refrigerant. Through the main shaft, the refrigerant is transported to the high- pressure side of the high-low pressure heat exchangers inside the chamber which is located in the − 320 m level underground, finally, ethylene glycol solution is sent back to the ground for recycling after <b>cold</b> <b>release.</b> After the heat exchange, the 3 °C low temperature circulating water is transported to the air cooler installed in the machine.

The implementation of this cooling system, which has achieved significant economic, social and environmental benefit, have showed bright prospect for extended application...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{experimental}} and numerical analyses {{to investigate the}} thermal control of an innovative vortex tube based polymerase chain reaction (VT-PCR) thermocycler are described. VT-PCR is capable of rapid DNA amplification and real-time optical detection. The device rapidly cycles six 20 μl 96 bp λ-DNA samples between the PCR stages (denaturation, annealing, and elongation) for 30 cycles in approximately 6 min. Two-dimensional numerical simulations {{have been carried out}} using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT v. 6. 2. 16. Experiments and CFD simulations have been carried out to measure/predict the temperature variation between the samples and within each sample. Heat transfer rate (primarily dictated by the temperature differences between the samples and the external air heating or cooling them) governs the temperature distribution between and within the samples. Temperature variation between and within the samples during the denaturation stage has been quite uniform (maximum variation around ± 0. 5 and 1. 6 °C, respectively). During cooling, by adjusting the <b>cold</b> <b>release</b> valves in the VT-PCR during some stage of cooling, the heat transfer rate has been controlled. Improved thermal control, which increases the efficiency of the PCR process, has been obtained both experimentally and numerically by slightly decreasing the rate of cooling. Thus, almost uniform temperature distribution between and within the samples (within 1 °C) has been attained for the annealing stage as well. It is shown that the VT-PCR is a fully functional PCR machine capable of amplifying specific DNA target sequences in less time than conventional PCR devices...|$|E
