50|$|Samuel Mansfield Bay (June 1, 1810 - May 29, 1849) was an American {{lawyer who}} {{represented}} Dred Scott in the 1847 Scott v. Emerson <b>case.</b> <b>Bay</b> {{served in the}} Missouri Legislature and was appointed as Missouri attorney-general from 1839 to 1845.|$|E
50|$|In Grand <b>Case</b> <b>bay,</b> 90% of {{the houses}} were damaged or {{destroyed}} {{as a result of}} rough sea conditions and very strong winds. Damage was also common in other towns, such as Marigot, French Quarter and Philipsburg, where at least 70% of the city was decimated by the storm. It also caused the Great Salt Pond to deluge several streets, leaving them partially submerged by 1 feet. Of the 1,500 boats sheltered in Simpson Bay Lagoon, nearly 1,300 or 85% were sunken or run aground. Furthermore, the hurricane impacted 32,000 on which 7,000 were left people homeless (5,000 Haitians on their district in Marigot). At least 60% of the residences of the island's 50,000 people were damaged as nearly 15% of them were completely destroyed as some of them made uninhabitable, this is including businesses, churches, hotels (4 of them been destroyed), and some schools. Some towns in the island spent nearly 3 months without water and power. Luis killed nine people (two in the French side and seven drowned in the Dutch side).|$|E
50|$|To argue his <b>case,</b> <b>Bay</b> {{needed to}} prove that Scott had been taken into a free state {{and that he was}} {{presently}} a slave owned by Irene Emerson. Bay established that Scott had been a slave taken into free territory, brought back to Missouri, and was being held there as a slave. Testimony attested to this fact, establishing that Scott was Irene Emerson's slave in Missouri and had accompanied her to Forts Armstrong and Snelling. It was also established in testimony that Mrs. Emerson still claimed Scott as her slave in Missouri. Bay thought at this point he had all the evidence to secure Scott's freedom. However, the defense argued that Scott had not legally proven that Mrs. Emerson was claiming him as a slave. During cross examination of Samuel Russell, who had testified that he hired Scott from Mrs. Emerson, thus establishing her ownership of Scott, Russell admitted that it was in fact his wife who had hired Scott. Russell's testimony was dismissed as hearsay. The Scotts lost their case. Irene Emerson was allowed to keep Dred and Harriet as slaves because no one could prove that they were her slaves. After waiting on the case for a year, the Scotts were ultimately denied their freedom.|$|E

5000|$|Hog-dog rodeo or Hog-dogging, is {{a spectator}} event that simulates wild or feral boar hunting with dogs. It {{requires}} specially trained and bred [...] "hog dogs" [...] {{that are used}} to bay and sometimes catch a hog or boar. In most <b>cases,</b> <b>bay</b> dogs psychologically control the pig and there is no physical contact. In some cases, however, such as Uncle Earl's Hog Dog Trials, along with bay dog events, catch dog events have been included in the past. In these, specially bred and equipped dogs caught and held the hog by the ears before the animals were quickly separated by a person who hog-tied the pig.|$|R

5000|$|The {{neighborhoods of}} Victorian Flatbush were {{developed}} {{in the early twentieth}} century from farmland in the former village of Flatbush, in response to the construction of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit line to Coney Island, and were some of the earliest suburbs. Developers including Dean Alvord, Lewis Pounds and particularly Thomas Benton Ackerson sold the new developments as country living, under the name [...] "The Village in the City". Utilities and the subway were buried underground, and the area was carefully laid out with tree-lined avenues and country clubs. The detached houses, many of them large and no two alike, were designed in fashionable styles including [...] "Victorian, Queen Anne, shingle style, colonial revival, neo-Tudor, Spanish Mission and Georgian", with porches and columns, and in many <b>cases</b> <b>bay</b> windows, turrets, and stained glass, and the area resembles other parts of the US more than it does the rest of New York. It is one of the largest collections of Victorian houses in the country. There has been rezoning to guard against oversize buildings near Coney Island Avenue.|$|R

5|$|Government in the San Francisco Bay Area {{consists}} of multiple actors, including 101 city and nine county governments, a dozen regional agencies, {{and a large}} number of single-purpose special districts such as municipal utility districts and transit districts. Incorporated cities are responsible for providing police service, zoning, issuing building permits, and maintaining public streets among other duties. County governments are responsible for elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, agricultural regulations, and building inspections, among other duties. Public education is provided by independent school districts, which may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts, and are managed by an elected school board. A variety of special districts also exist and provide a single purpose, such as delivering public transit in the <b>case</b> of the <b>Bay</b> Area Rapid Transit District, or monitoring air quality levels in the <b>case</b> of the <b>Bay</b> Area Air Quality Management District.|$|R

2500|$|Some depositional {{formation}} is quite recent, {{such as in}} the <b>case</b> of Florida <b>Bay,</b> where much of the bay mud has accumulated since 2000 BC, and consists of primarily decayed organic material. [...] In the <b>case</b> of Florida <b>Bay</b> these bay muds can accrete as much as 0.5 to 2.0 centimeters per annum, although the dynamic equilibrium of erosion, wave action redistribution and deposition complicate the net rate of layer growth. In the case of the Bristol Channel in the United Kingdom bay, mud formation has been occurring at least since the Eemian Stage (known as the Sangamonian Stage in North America), or about 130,000 years ago. [...] In other cases such as with San Francisco Bay, deposition has been interrupted by sea-level changes, and strata of vastly different vintages are found. In the San Francisco Bay Area, these are [...] called Young bay mud and Older bay mud by geologists. Human activities can also affect deposition; close to half of the Young Bay Mud in San Francisco Bay was placed in the period 1855–1865, as a result of placer mining in the Sierra Nevada foothills.|$|R
