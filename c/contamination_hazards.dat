50|$|Barrier {{isolator}} is {{a general}} term that includes two types of devices: isolators and restricted access barriers (RABS). Both are devices that provide a physical and aerodynamic (air overpressure) barrier between the external clean room environment and a work process. The isolator design is the more dependable of the two barrier design choices, as it prevents <b>contamination</b> <b>hazards</b> by achieving a more comprehensive separation of the processing environment from the surrounding facility. Nonetheless, both Isolator and RABS designs are contemporary approaches developed over the last 35 years and a great advancement over designs of the 1950s-70s that were far more prone to microbial contamination problems.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to Isolators, {{there are also}} extensive barriers that provide sub-isolation protection, but {{have a very good}} track record of reducing hazards to sterile drugs during processing when they are designed and operated properly. This extensive barrier is known as a restricted access barrier system, or RABS. A barrier cabinet using RABS design and control, is below the isolator in its ability to assure sterility assurance and containment, but far better than the traditional laminar air flow hood or [...] "open process" [...] designs that are progressively being phased-out by the industries. In particular, a RABS that operates only in closed-door mode after the equipment setup and sporadic disinfection is performed, is commonly used now and provides substantial risk mitigation. These [...] "closed RABS" [...] require all processing interventions to be done using gauntlet gloves attached to the RABS walls. In contrast, RABS designs that require door openings during processing would lead to more microbial <b>contamination</b> <b>hazards</b> than a RABS that is kept closed.|$|E

40|$|Summary. In {{the industrialized}} world, {{a range of}} {{medicinal}} products are manufactured {{on a large scale}} from pools made of thousands of human blood and plasma donations. Policy makers as well as the general public are aware of the <b>contamination</b> <b>hazards</b> following accumu-lated risks of individual donations. Today, the manufacturing process must therefore consider a complex sequence of risk reducing interventions, including screening tests and quarantine periods on pools and individual donations. In this paper, we estimate the residual risk of Hepatitis C infection following such sequence of events. This is the most common bloodborne infection in the Western World, which a®ects an estimated 170 million persons worldwide. We investigate the costs and bene¯ts of each intervention and study at several stages the dependence of the screening process on operational parameters that can be optimized, such as the pool size and the length of the quarantine period. This leads to alternative pooling strategies that may be more (cost-) e®ective or optimal under speci¯c criteria...|$|E

Optical systems can be degraded in terms of decreased throughput, i. e., transmissivity or reflectivity, or increases in the total integrated scatter (TIS).

Formulas are also developed for cases where induced surface defects are larger than the desired viewing wavelengths, or smaller or of the same order of the observed wavelengths. The techniques are used to quantify the degradation of a VUV solar coronagraph, a VUV stellar telescope, and a solar cell due to TIS.

The decomposition of buried bodies in traditional cemeteries releases high amounts of heavy metals into the ground, which compromises population settlements near the cemeterial areas.

Four sample sites outside the cemeteries (for the same depths), 100 m away from each other were also defined in order to obtain a triangulation of up to 400 m away from each analyzed cemetery. The results indicated that all cemeteries in question had significantly higher heavy metal values when compared to Brazilian tolerated limits, especially regarding to copper (Cu).

A numerical model was developed with the help of FEMLAB to study the transport of the leached contaminants from the waste disposal site through the subsurface soil. The model shows that the contamination plume needs around 40 hours to infiltrate through the saturated groundwater after being released from the source. Further, it needs at least 183 hours to reach close to the nearby lake water. Although, the deep groundwater currently seems to be protected, but it needs adequate attention while installing deep wells through the clay layers to make it remained safe for the future. It can however be mentioned that to protect and preserve the groundwater resources, the waste disposal site should immediately be relocated elsewhere...|$|E

A total of 200 clinical blood samples obtained from 110 patients at risk for developing a systemic fungal infection, hospitalized in the University Hospital of Sfax (Tunisia), were submitted to testing by culture, nested PCR and real-time PCR.

We further illustrate them in a collection of soil surface horizons which largely differ in their organic matter contents. In soils, specific retention of radiocesium occurs in {{a very small number of}} sorbing sites, which are the frayed edge sites (FES) born out of weathered micaceous minerals. The FES abundance directly governs the mobility of trace Cs in the rhizosphere and thus its transfer from soil to plant.

Consequently, such accumulation significantly contributes to increasing 137 Cs soil-to-plant transfer. Potassium depletion and extensive exploration of the organic horizons by plant roots can further enhance the <b>contamination</b> <b>hazard.</b> As humus thickness depends on both ecological conditions and forest management. our observations support the following ideas: (1) forest ecosystems can be classified according to their sensitivity to radiocesium bio-recycling, (2) specific forest management could be searched to decrease such bio-recycling...|$|R
