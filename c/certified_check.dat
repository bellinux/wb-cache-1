60|$|At this {{there was}} another long discussion. But the Rovers {{remained}} firm, {{and in the end}} the clause concerning the wreckage was altered to show that the Dartaway must remain the boys' property. Then the three brothers signed the paper and it was duly witnessed by two teachers, and the <b>certified</b> <b>check</b> was handed to Dick.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, e.g. Germany, it {{is illegal}} for a regular bank to <b>certify</b> <b>checks.</b> This {{regulation}} is supposed to prevent certified cheques from becoming a universal substitute for cash, which is considered the only legal tender. The Deutsche Bundesbank (Federal Bank) is the only financial institution authorized to issue <b>certified</b> <b>checks.</b>|$|R

50|$|For each {{of these}} items, the item must be {{presented}} for deposit into the payees account for it to receive expedited fund availability; when one of these checks is presented for deposit into a third party account, it loses its preferential treatment. Also, the bank may require use of a special deposit slip or envelope for next-day availability of cashiers <b>checks,</b> <b>certified</b> <b>checks,</b> tellers checks, or state & local government checks; if it does so, it must notify customers and tell them how to obtain the special slip or envelope.|$|R

5000|$|Typical {{papers at}} a {{conveyancing}} include: deed(s), <b>certified</b> <b>checks,</b> promissory note, mortgage, certificate of liens, pro rata property taxes, title insurance binder, and fire insurance binder. There {{may also be}} side agreements (e.g., holdover tenants, delivery contracts, payment holdback for unacceptable repairs), seller's {{right of first refusal}} for resale, declaration of trust, or other entity formation or consolidation (incorporation, limited partnership investors, etc.). Where [...] "time is of the essence," [...] there have been cases where the entire deposit is forfeited (as liquidated damages) if the conveyancing is delayed beyond the time limits of the buyer's contingencies, even if the purchase is completed.|$|R
50|$|Because {{individuals}} act as certifiers {{in a web}} of trust, individual CPS {{documents are}} sometimes used. For example, in a PGP WoT, the CPS might state that the <b>certifying</b> entity <b>checked</b> two forms of legal government ID before signing the person's public key.|$|R

50|$|He {{had been}} {{director}} of the Commercial National Bank of Chicago for 29 years when President and fellow Bonesman William Howard Taft tapped him to be Secretary of the Treasury in 1909. He did not tackle the pressing problem of currency reform, leaving it to the National Monetary Commission, which had been established by the Aldrich-Vreeland Act of 1908; he did, however, stress the urgency of reform in his annual report. He is remembered for increasing the efficiency and general progressiveness of the Treasury Department: He abolished 450 unnecessary positions, rehabilitated the U.S. Customs Service {{with the introduction of}} electric automatic weighing devices and accepted <b>certified</b> <b>checks</b> instead of currency for customs and internal revenue payments. He was also involved {{in the creation of the}} buffalo nickel.|$|R

But, I tell you I am grateful for even this little venture of ours into the borders of the haphazard. There may be at least one breathless moment when the bill for the dinner is presented. Perhaps, after all, the pilgrims who traveled without scrip or purse found a keener taste to life than did the knights of the Round Table who rode abroad with a retinue and King Arthur's <b>certified</b> <b>checks</b> in the lining of their helmets.

50|$|During the season, Michaels {{appeared}} on-camera twice, on April 24 and May 22, to make {{an offer}} to The Beatles to reunite on the show.

John Lennon and Paul McCartney later both admitted that they were watching SNL from Lennon's apartment on May 8, the episode after Michaels' first offer, and briefly toyed with actually {{going down to the}} studio, but decided to stay in the apartment because they were too tired.|$|E
60|$|And now at this moment, when {{hope was}} dead, Tom Sawyer {{came forward with}} nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible. This was a {{thunderbolt}} out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source {{for the next ten}} years. But there was no getting around it--here were the <b>certified</b> <b>checks,</b> and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of <b>certified</b> static <b>checking</b> of module-like constructs of programming languages.

5000|$|A <b>{{certified}}</b> <b>check</b> or {{certified cheque}} {{is a form}} of cheque for which the bank verifies that sufficient funds exist in the account to cover the cheque, and so certifies, at the time the cheque is written. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified cheque cannot be stopped (can't [...] "bounce"), and, in this manner, its liquidity is similar to cash, barring bank failure or illegal act (such as the funds being based on a fraudulent loan, at which point the cheque will be disavowed).|$|E
5000|$|Montgomery Schuyler, in {{a column}} titled [...] "Architectural Aberrations" [...] in Architectural Record, stated {{that the house was}} “an {{appropriate}} residence for the late P. T.

Schuyler wrote that “a <b>certified</b> <b>check</b> to the amount of all this stone carving hung on the outer wall would serve every artistic purpose attained by the carving itself.” ...|$|E

Those flights and their returns were Eastern's whole scheduled operation; it fit on one page in the Airways Guide.
