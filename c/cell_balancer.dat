40|$|The {{use of a}} {{three-phase}} multilevel converter (MLC) as {{an integrated}} <b>cell</b> <b>balancer</b> and motor driver is investigated for three-phase AC applications in EVs/HEVs/PHEVs. The paper analyzed an issue of additional battery losses caused by the flow of reactive and/or harmonic power from each power cell of the three-phase MLC battery system. The paper also investigates the size of shunt capacitor required for compensation of the losses to acceptable level. This study concludes {{that the size of}} the required capacitor is too big for the vehicle application unless some other active compensation is used as well. Another practical way to employ the MLC as a <b>cell</b> <b>balancer</b> is to use it in a cascaded connection with the conventional three-phase two-level voltage source inverter however {{it may not be a}} cost-effective solution either due to high component count...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{simultaneous}} {{use of a}} multi-level converter (MLC) as a DC-motor drive and as an active battery <b>cell</b> <b>balancer</b> is investigated. MLCs allow each battery cell in a battery pack to be independently switched on and off, thereby enabling the potential non-uniform use of battery cells. By exploiting this property and the brake regeneration phases in the drive cycle, MLCs can balance both the state of charge (SoC) and temperature differences between cells, which are two known causes of battery wear, even without reciprocating the coolant flow inside the pack. The optimal control policy (OP) that considers both battery pack temperature and SoC dynamics is studied in detail {{based on the assumption}} that information on the state of each cell, the schedule of reciprocating air flow and the future driving profile are perfectly known. Results show that OP provides significant reductions in temperature and in SoC deviations compared with the uniform use of all cells even with uni-directional coolant flow. Thus, reciprocating coolant flow is a redundant function for a MLC-based <b>cell</b> <b>balancer.</b> A specific contribution of this paper is the derivation of a state-space electro-thermal model of a battery submodule for both uni-directional and reciprocating coolant flows under the switching action of MLC, resulting in OP being derived by the solution of a convex optimization problem...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to design and develop a {{measurement}} system that would allow accurate measurement of individual cell voltages in a series cell stack. The system was initially proposed {{to be used in}} conjunction with an active <b>cell</b> <b>balancer.</b> This would allow for the efficient equalising of cells as well as provide detailed information on the cell stack and how the stack operates over time. Having a system that measures voltages accurately, with which the active <b>cell</b> <b>balancer</b> can be controlled would allow for peak cell lifetime and performance. Current battery management systems are large, complex and inefficient and a new way of battery management had to be investigated. To accurately measure individual cells in a series stack, the high common mode voltage must be negated. Different techniques that are currently used to create galvanic isolation were reviewed; circuits were designed and were simulated to find the most suitable design. The traditional methods used to create galvanic isolation did not provide adequate results. The methods were too inefficient and not accurate enough to be used. The methods that had the required accuracy were too complicated to connect in a useable system. This led to the investigation of integrated circuits created to measure voltages in large cell stacks. An integrated circuit from Linear Technology was chosen and a system was built. A system was thus designed that fulfilled the most desirable design specifications while delivering excellent results. The system allowed accurate, individual voltages to be measured in the presence of high common mode voltages. Accuracies and measurement time were well below the required system specification. Power consumption was high, but different component choice will lower power consumption to within specification. Excellent results were obtained overall with most, although not all results well below the design specifications. By including current measurements, as well as other technologies such as wireless communication, USB connectivity and a better data processor, this system will be at the forefront of current battery management technology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{steady-state}} {{analytical model}} of the recently proposed “Time shared li-ion cell balancing circuit ” is presented in this paper. This paper provides the necessary analytical proof of the <b>cell</b> <b>balancer</b> circuit {{to be used in}} future Plug-in Hybrid vehicles (PHEV) or utility energy storage applications. The model presented here bridges the simulation and experimental results obtained previously. In addition, the prototype of a four-cell lithium-ion battery balancer circuit with reduced component count has been constructed, and the test results have been verified with the analytical model. Although the “proof of concept ” circuit was built to balance only four cells, the analytical model suggests that any number of series connected cells could be used in a string and balanced. Moreover, the analytical model can be extended to characterize the circuit parameters for any number of cells without any apparent issues. This model was also being verified using the simulation and experimental results with only 2 % error margin. I...|$|E

In this thesis, the use of a multi-level converter (MLC) as an integrated <b>cell</b> <b>balancer</b> and motor driver is investigated for application in xEVs. The MLC has a special modular structure which distributes a large battery pack into smaller units, enabling an independent cell-level control of a battery system. This extra degree-of-freedom enables the potential non-uniform use of cells, which along with brake regeneration phases in the drive cycle is exploited by MLC to achieve simultaneous thermal and SOC balancing. An MLC-based optimal control policy (OP) has been formulated, assuming dc machine as a load, which uses each cell in a battery submodule according to its SOC and temperature to achieve thermal and SOC balancing by optimally redistributing the power losses among the cells. Results show that OP reduces temperature and SOC deviations significantly compared with the uniform use of all cells. However, in applications involving three-phase ac machine, the MLC, in addition to its great balancing potential, also poses serious issues of extra battery heating and of extra ampere-hour throughput due to dc-link current ripple. These extra effects may accelerate the battery ageing if not compensated. A simple passive compensation method based on dc-link capacitor has been investigated, but it turns out that the size of the required capacitor is too big for automotive applications. Thus, it is concluded that, from battery's health viewpoint, it is unpromising to promote three-phase MLC as an integrated <b>cell</b> <b>balancer</b> and a motor driver in xEVs, unless some other more advanced active compensation technique is used...|$|E
