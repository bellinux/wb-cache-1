5|$|The Hampden Roar {{was first}} noticed {{in a game}} against England in 1929. Scotland, who had played the second half with ten players due to an injury to Alex Jackson, {{equalised}} in the final minute with a goal from Alec Cheyne direct from a corner kick. The roar that followed the goal was so loud that Jackson, who was a mile away in the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that Scotland had scored.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} buried his {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E
5|$|Tham sees Yah {{as being}} a good match for Tono in personality, as she shows a {{willingness}} {{to serve as the}} traditional wife. The American scholar of Indonesian literature Harry Aveling writes that Yah's employment as a prostitute was likely a capitulation by Pane to cultural constraints; Indonesian readers at the time would not have accepted Tono having an affair with someone of the same socio-economic status. Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the same story; he found her touching without being melodramatic, and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work.|$|E

60|$|There was a stillness with {{a little}} joy. He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> her any more. Why <b>could</b> he not <b>tell</b> her any more? She felt a pang of disconsolate sadness. But it was nothing. She went to him.|$|R
25|$|The {{magazine}} {{sought out}} reporters who <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a story using photographs, notably the pioneer sports photographer Martin Munkácsi, the first staff photographer, and Erich Salomon, {{one of the}} founders of photojournalism.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in the production, nearly halfway through {{principal}} photography, Cimino was already over budget, and producer Spikings <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> from the script that shooting the extended scene could sink the project.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{newspapers}} reported that Mayo had pneumonia and was resting at his mansion. Mayo didn't stay resting for long. A week later, Mayo conducted business as usual, but citizens of Paintsville <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> he was seriously ill.|$|E

60|$|He {{lapsed into}} a pensive torpor. The {{immediate}} dangers and stresses {{of his position}} he saw {{with a sort of}} static clearness. What would they do to-morrow? He <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> What would Elizabeth think of his brutalisation? He <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> He was exhausted. He was aroused presently by a hand upon his arm.|$|R
25|$|The fourth {{incident}} {{involved a}} woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{neighboring}} city of Dahlonega {{was known as}} the first site of gold in the United States, the Blairsville area was known to have the purest gold in the mountains. Assayers in Washington, D.C. <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by looking that gold ore was from the Coosa Mines because it was “the yellowest gold” submitted and its brilliant color set it apart.|$|E
25|$|Makart's {{painting}} The Entry of Charles V into Antwerp {{caused some}} controversy, because Charles V was depicted arriving in a procession surrounded by nude virgins; the offense was the mistaken {{idea that the}} nudes had {{no place in the}} modern scene. In the United States, the painting fell under the proscription of Anthony Comstock, which secured Makart's fame there. The American public desired at once to see what Comstock was persecuting, so they <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> whether he was acting correctly or in error.|$|E

25|$|When Tefolaha {{arrived on}} Nanumea he found two women named Pai and Vau. Tefolaha {{ordered them to}} leave as he claimed the island. Pai and Vau replied that he should leave unless he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them their names. This is a defence that appears in other mythologies of the Pacific that {{possibly}} reflects the belief that to know a person’s name is to have some power over that person. Tefolaha knew their names so they departed. As they left, sand spilled out of their baskets creating the smaller islets of Nanumea.|$|E
25|$|During the 1830s, Sunderland {{became the}} most {{important}} shipbuilding centre in the country, and by 1840 there were 65 shipyards on the river. It was at this time, that Pile walked {{the banks of the}} River Wear, visiting the shipyards and never growing tired of seeing ships in the various stages of construction. As he grew older he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the name of every ship belonging to Sunderland, and who built them. It was said of him after his death, that being born in a shipyard he was hardly ever out of one.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus also {{compiled}} a star catalogue. According to Pliny the Elder, he observed a nova (new star). So that later generations <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> whether other stars came to be, perished, moved, or changed in brightness, he recorded {{the position and}} brightness of the stars. Ptolemy mentioned the catalogue in connection with Hipparchus' discovery of precession. (Precession of the equinoxes is a slow motion of {{the place of the}} equinoxes through the zodiac, caused by the shifting of the Earth's axis). Hipparchus thought it was caused by the motion of the sphere of fixed stars.|$|E

"There was {{a saying}} in my {{childhood}} that you <b>could</b> always <b>tell</b> when it was six o'clock in the evening, because {{at that moment the}} entire city would begin to vibrate with the force of everybody's chopping.

25|$|In 1996, McDonald's lost a {{legal battle}} at the Danish Supreme Court to force Allan Pedersen, a hotdog vendor, to drop his shop name McAllan. Pedersen had {{previously}} visited Scotland on whisky tasting tours. He named his business after his favorite brand of whisky, MacAllan's, after contacting the distillery {{to see if they}} would object. They did not, but McDonald's did. However, the court ruled customers <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the difference between a one-man vendor and a multi-national chain and ordered McDonald's to pay 40,000 kroner ($6,900) in court costs. The verdict cannot be appealed.|$|E
25|$|Praed {{never lost}} her {{interest}} in her native country and though {{most of her life}} was passed in England, a large proportion of her novels were based on her Australian experiences. Others dealt with the occult, with spiritualism, or with abnormal states of mind. She was much interested in psychological problems, her character-drawing is good although her women are better than her men, she had some sense of humour, and she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a story. She is entitled to a leading place among the Australian novelists who developed in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, the Tar Heel {{noted that}} the Hedgepeth case {{remained}} open, along {{with the death of}} David Shannon, a UNCCH freshman whose body had been found on the grounds of a Carrboro cement plant the previous October 27 (while he had died from a fall, the autopsy found he was severely intoxicated, and the Carrboro police suspected hazing and believed there might be other students who <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them more about the circumstances of Shannon's death). In Hedgepeth's case, there had been no new information about a possible suspect since January. Yet the case records remained under court-ordered seal.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the release}} of Melvin Van Peebles' film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, he premiered two musicals on Broadway, Don't Play Us Cheap and Ain't Supposed To Die A Natural Death, {{deriving}} from earlier plays he had written in French. To express the ghetto's turmoil and pathos, Van Peebles used sprechgesang as a form he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> stories in; he recorded three albums using this style, Brer Soul, Ain't Supposed To Die a Natural Death and As Serious as a Heart-Attack. The albums were categorized as spoken word at the time, but was later called a precursor to rapping and hip hop music.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 {{publisher}} Henry Luce paid $92,000 to {{the owners}} of Life magazine because he sought the name for his company, Time Inc. Time Inc. sold Life subscription list, features, and goodwill to Judge. Convinced that pictures <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a story instead of just illustrating text, Luce launched Life on November 23, 1936. The third magazine published by Luce, after Time in 1923 and Fortune in 1930, Life developed as the photo magazine in the U.S., giving as much space and importance to images as to words. The first issue of Life, which sold for ten cents (worth $ today), featured five pages of Alfred Eisenstaedt's photographs.|$|E
25|$|Several Australian composers {{have written}} sacred music to {{celebrate}} Mary MacKillop. In 2009 Nicholas Buc {{was commissioned by}} the Shire of Glenelg to write an hour-long cantata mass for the centenary {{of the death of}} Mary MacKillop. It was premiered by the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic in Portland, Victoria. The Mass of Mary McKillop is a setting for congregational singing, composed by Joshua Cowie. Hymns specifically used in St Mary of the Cross celebrations including A Saint for Today and Mary MacKillop, Woman of Australia by Josephite Sister Margaret Cusack, and If I <b>Could</b> <b>Tell</b> The Love of God, In Love God Leads Us and Psalm 103 by Jesuit Priest Christopher Willcock.|$|E
