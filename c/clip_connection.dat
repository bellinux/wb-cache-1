40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry many parts are connected with different types of clips. One of them is studied in this Master Thesis. The studied clip is of metal and used to connect plastic parts {{to each other in}} the interior of the cars. The aim is to find the mechanical properties of this clip joint at room temperature and 80 C and to implement in a simple connector element representing the clip joint. The properties in the <b>clip</b> <b>connection</b> are determined by use of a combination of component tests and simulations. The tests are performed by fastening one part in the <b>clip</b> <b>connection</b> and applying a displacement at the other part and measuring the force to get a force vs displacement relation. In the finite element simulations are the same loading case used. In the numerical simulations is also a sensitivity analysis performed to investigate what parameters affects the properties of the clip joint the most. The study gives linear stiffnesses perpendicular to the hole and around all axes. The frictional force when sliding along the hole occurs is determined. The forces needed to assemble and dis-assemble the clip joint are also determined. All these properties are determined both for room temperature and for 80 C. The determined properties are only valid until a specific displacement when the plastic parts come in contact. From the sensitivity study is concluded that the most important parameters are the hole size and thickness of the clip. The determined properties make it possible to include a more realistic behavior of the clip joint in simulations with clips. It is possible because the representation in the connector element still is simple but more realistic and prevents the number of degrees of freedom to increase drastically.

40|$|Innovative {{mechanism}} {{designs were}} explored for the actuation of critical components {{in a novel}} rapid skin closure device used to close long surgical incisions. The rapid skin closure device is designed {{to speed up the}} wound closure process and achieve the aesthetic results of a plastic surgeon by automatically placing bio-absorbable adjustable clips in the dermal layer of skin along a surgical incision. Precise alignment of the wound edges, deployment of needles preloaded with clips, and the successful connection of the two clip ends inside the wound are critical for the proper function of the device. The iterative design of the actuating mechanisms for the skin alignment, needle deployment, and successful <b>clip</b> <b>connection</b> were accomplished in four prototypes. The first two prototypes demonstrated the proof of concept that needles could follow a pre-determined path and two ends of a clip could be reliably connected. The second pneumatically actuated prototype connected over a hundred clips in a row and measured a repeatability of 98 %. The third and fourth prototypes focused on refining the design into a production product by reducing the size, complexity, and cost. Many types of actuators and power transmission components were used, combined, and compared. It was found that the skin alignment could be reduced to a passive rail system that did not require an actuator. Furthermore, the needle and ejector pin motions critical for the success of placing a clip were combined into a single actuating motion. The combination was made possible by a series of nested cylinders separated by a stiff compression spring, and actuated by a slotted angled bar that optimized efficiency. All electronics were eliminated from the device with the inclusion of a manually actuated handle to drive the main slotted bar. The results from testing in human skin revealed that the needle deployment and clipping were successful, but the passive rail alignment failed due to the elastic nature of the tissue. Further refinement will be required to make the device production ready. However, the innovative designs from this research will {{have a significant impact on}} the success of the device as a product. by Andrew T. Erickson. Thesis (S. B.)

Parametric study was conducted based on the validated finite element model. The parameters included the web block aspect ratio and the connection rotational stiffness. Based on the mechanical model of double angle connection, the pitch and the beam element length-to-angle thickness (L/t) ratio of the outstanding leg were selected as two importance parameters to consider {{the effect of the}} connection rotational stiffness. The results of parametric study show that the connection rotational stiffness has a great influence {{on the block}} shear capacity of coped beams with double welded <b>clip</b> angle <b>connection.</b> This is contributed to the fact that for the connections with a smaller connection rotational stiffness, the shear stresses of the shear area were much less than those of the connections with a larger connection rotational stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural EngineeringKimberly W. KramerIn {{structural}} steel connection design, simple shear connections {{are one of}} the most common connection types utilized. The industry, especially from the side of the engineer, tends to lean toward using Double <b>Clip</b> Angle <b>Connections</b> as the default standard for simple shear <b>connections.</b> A double <b>clip</b> angle <b>connection</b> is a connection consisting of two angles transferring the shear forces from one member to the next either through bolts or welds. The design of Double <b>Clip</b> Angle <b>Connections</b> is efficient and the connections themselves are easy to fabricate. However, benefits to utilizing other types of shear connections exist. Many of these benefits are seen in the fabrication shop or during erection and construction. This is especially true of single shear plate or shear tab connections when applied to open structure design. Shear tab connections consist of a single plate that transfers the shear forces from one member to the next with bolts or with welds. The design of shear tab connections can be a more involved process than the design of double clip angles. Sometimes the shear plate or shear tab has to be longer than is typical. This is called an extended shear plate connection. These extended shear plates can bring other variables into the design that typically don’t occur with Double <b>Clip</b> Angle <b>Connections</b> such as bending of the plate or the need for multiple bolt columns. However, with proper planning and detailing, the benefits and savings experienced in the fabrication or construction phase may outweigh what can be seen as a more laborious design task. The purpose of this report is to identify the possible benefits achieved in using each of these connections, highlight the differences in the design approach for each, and use a study model to compare the outcome of using one connection over another in the design of a typical open structure. Double clip angles are typically the most efficient approach when speed of design and simplicity of fabrication are the desired outcomes. However, shear plate or shear tab connections have the potential to provide safer erection alternatives and materials savings if used in appropriate ways and with the right applications...|$|R

The connector falls far short of ideal, being physically large and awkward to use, while being less reliable than alternatives such as the Anderson Powerpole connector (which is often used by amateur radio enthusiasts in mobile operations).

40|$|Synapse {{crossbar}} is {{an elementary}} structure in Neuromorphic Computing Systems (NCS). However, the limited size of crossbars and heavy routing congestion impedes the NCS implementations of big neural networks. In this paper, we propose a two-step framework (namely, group scissor) to scale NCS designs to big neural networks. The {{first step is}} rank clipping, which integrates low-rank approximation into the training to reduce total crossbar area. The second step is group connection deletion, which structurally prunes connections to reduce routing congestion between crossbars. Tested on convolutional neural networks of LeNet on MNIST database and ConvNet on CIFAR- 10 database, our experiments show significant reduction of crossbar area and routing area in NCS designs. Without accuracy loss, rank clipping reduces total crossbar area to 13. 62 % and 51. 81 % in the NCS designs of LeNet and ConvNet, respectively. Following rank <b>clipping,</b> group <b>connection</b> deletion further reduces the routing area of LeNet and ConvNet to 8. 1 % and 52. 06 %, respectively. Comment: Accepted in DAC 201...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the block shear capacity of ten full-scale coped beams with a welded <b>clip</b> angle <b>connection</b> was presented in Part I. The test results were compared with predictions using block shear design equations in several current design standards. In general, {{the results showed that}} the existing design standards did not provide consistent predictions of the block shear capacity of coped beams with welded clip angles. In addition, the equations provided by the standards cannot accurately reflect the failure mode of the specimens observed in the tests. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the connection behavior, such as the stress distribution in the web near the periphery of the clip angles and the failure mechanism of the connection, an analytical study of the block shear capacity of coped beams with welded clip angles was carried out using the finite element method. Based on the limited test data and the results of the finite element analysis (FEA), a strength model was established and a design equation was proposed to evaluate the block shear strength of coped beams with welded clip angles. It was shown that the proposed design equation gave better predictions of the block shear capacity of the specimens. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of block shear of coped beams with a welded <b>clip</b> angle <b>connection</b> is presented in this paper. Twelve full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the web block aspect ratio (height to width ratio of the web block connected to the clip angle) and the connection rotational stiffness. Out of the 12 test specimens, eight test specimens failed in block shear of the connection, namely, tensile fracture of the block width (the web underneath the clip angle) and shear yielding of the block height (the web along the vertical side of the clip angle). Two test specimens failed by local web buckling at the cope, one test specimen failed in the welds and the remaining one did not fail due to the limited capacity of the loading jack. The test results showed that in general the block shear capacity of the test specimens increased with increasing web block aspect ratio and increasing connection rotational stiffness. The current design specifications (AISC-LRFD, CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, CAN/CSA-S 16 - 01, BS EN 1993 - 1 - 8 - 2005, BS 5950 - 1 : 2000, and AIJ- 1990) provide conservative estimates of the block shear capacity of the test specimens except for the specimen that had the smallest connection rotational stiffness.

40|$|Background and objective: Diaphragmatic {{breathing}} patterns under resistive loading remain poorly documented. To our knowledge, this is {{the first}} study assessing diaphragmatic motion under conditions of inspiratory resistive loading with the use of sonography. Methods: We assessed diaphragmatic motion during inspiratory resistive loading in 40 healthy volunteers using M-mode sonography. In phase I of the study, sonography was performed during normal quiet breathing without respiratory loading. In phase II, sonography was performed after application of a nose <b>clip</b> and <b>connection</b> of the subjects to a pneumotachograph through a mouth piece. In phase III, the participants were assessed while subjected to inspiratory resistive loading of 50 cm H 2 O/L/s. Results: Compared with baseline, the application of a mouth piece and nose clip induced a significant increase in diaphragmatic excursion (from 1. 7 to 2. 3 cm, P < 0. 001) and a decrease in respiratory rate (from 13. 4 to 12. 2, P < 0. 01). Inspiratory resistive loading induced a further decrease in respiratory rate (from 12. 2 to 8. 0, P < 0. 01) and a decrease in diaphragmatic velocity contraction (from 1. 2 to 0. 8 cm/s, P < 0. 01), and also an increase in tidal volume (from 795 to 904 mL, P < 0. 01); diaphragmatic excursion, however, did not change significantly. Conclusions: Inspiratory resistive loading induced significant changes in diaphragmatic contraction pattern, which mainly consisted of decreased velocity of diaphragmatic displacement with no change in diaphragmatic excursion. Tidal volume, increased significantly; the increase in tidal volume, along with the unchanged diaphragmatic excursion, provides sonographic evidence of increased recruitment of extradiaphragmatic muscles under inspiratory resistive loading...|$|R
40|$|The {{ends of a}} coped beam are {{commonly}} connected to the web of a girder by double clip angles. The clip angles may either be bolted or welded to the web of the beam. One of the potential modes {{for the failure of}} the <b>clip</b> angle <b>connection</b> is the block shear of the beam web material. To investigate the strength and the behavior of the block shear of coped beams with welded end connections, ten full-scale coped beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the aspect ratio of the clip angles, the web shear and tension area around the clip angles, the web thickness, beam section depth, cope length, and connection position. The test results indicated that the specimens failed, developing either tension fractures of the web {{near the bottom of the}} clip angles or local web buckling near the end of the cope. Although the final failure mode of the six specimens was local web buckling, it was observed during the tests that these specimens exhibited a significant deformation of the block shear type prior to reaching their final failure mode. No shear fracture was observed in all of the tests. A comparison between the ultimate loads in the test and the predictions using the current design equations indicates that the current design standards such as the AISC-LRFD, CSA-S 16 - 01, Eurocode 3, BS 5950 - 1 : 2000, AIJ and GB 50017, are inconsistent in predicting the block shear strength of coped beams with welded end connections. The analytical study of the strength of the test specimens using the finite element method, a parametric study, and a proposed design model for designing block shears for coped beams with welded clip angles are included in a companion paper.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} block shear strength and behavior of coped beams with welded end connections. The finite-element (FE) method was employed to predict the structural behavior and block shear capacity of specimens tested during a previous experimental {{study conducted by the}} writers. In general, the finite-element analysis results compared well with the test results, and the validated finite-element models were used subsequently to further investigate the structural behavior of the connections through a parametric study. The results show that the block shear capacity of coped beams with welded end connections, in general, increases with increasing connection rotational stiffness and increasing web block aspect ratio (depth/width). It was found that, for design purposes, connections with a large web block aspect ratio (large depth and narrow width) should be used to reduce the effects of loading eccentricity between the centroid of the weld group of the connection and the support. The finite-element analysis results also show that, for the coped beams with small connection rotational stiffness, shear yielding only occurs over {{a small portion of the}} shear area. Based on the test and the finite-element analysis results, a design equation previously proposed by the first writer for evaluating the block shear capacity of a coped beam with a welded <b>clip</b> angle <b>connection</b> was modified to account for the effects of the connection rotational stiffness. The predictions based on the modified design equation compare well with the test and the finite-element analysis results. The ratio of the test and the FE capacities to the predicted capacities has a mean of 1. 01 and a coefficient of variation of 0. 05.

The AASHTO models were conservative with respect to external lateral earth pressures and lateral earth pres-sures on the facing panels. On average, the AASHTO 1996 and 1999 models overesti-mated lateral pressure at the facing by 94 and 142 %, respectively. Measured values of foundation bearing stress were generally in good agreement with values calculated using soil unit weight and depth, except that the average force from the facing panels on the lev-eling pad was twice that {{of the weight of}} the panels themselves.

It is distributed {{under the terms of the}} Creative Commons Attribution 3. 0 licence. Small plastic clips are used in large numbers in automotive vehicles to connect interior trims to vehicle structures. The variability in their properties can contribute to the overall variability in noise and vibration response of the vehicle. The variability arises due to their material and manufacturing tolerances and more importantly due to the boundary condition. To measure their stiffness and damping, a simple experimental rig is used where a mass is supported by the clip which is modelled as a single degree of freedom system. The rig is designed in a way that it simulates the boundary condition as those of the real vehicle. The variability in clip and also due to the boundary condition at the structure side is first examined which is 7 % for stiffness and 8 % for damping. To simulate the connection of the trim side, a mount is built using a 3 D printer. Rattling occurs in the response of the <b>clips</b> with loose <b>connections,</b> however by preloading the mount the effective stiffness increases and the rattling is eliminated.

40|$|Block shear {{is one of}} {{the major}} failure modes for coped steel I-beams. While focus of {{previous}} studies on the block shear capacity of coped steel I-beam was mainly given to the <b>connections</b> with double <b>clip</b> angles, single-sided <b>connections,</b> which induce out-of-plane loading eccentricity, have not been adequately considered. Ten full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted to examine the effects of two main test parameters, namely, out-of-plane loading eccentricity and web block aspect ratio (ratio of shear area to tension area). It was found that nine test specimens failed with tension fracture along the bottom bolt row of the web, and the remaining one failed in a whole block tear-out manner. Twisting of the web near the cope was observed for specimens with single-sided connection. More importantly, the test results showed that the out-of-plane loading eccentricity due to the single-sided connection did not have a detrimental effect on the block shear capacity of the specimens. Moreover, increasing the connection rotational stiffness could increase the block shear capacity. These effects are further discussed via a finite element analysis and a preliminary parametric study. Finally, the test results are compared with four major design standards. It is found that the Canadian Standards CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, which gives a test-to-predicted ratio ranged from 0. 93 to 1. 17, provided relatively good predictions for the specimens with single bolt line layout, while the predictions by other codes are too conservative. For those specimens with double bolt line layout, the capacities are underestimated by all the considered standards. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
40|$|Floor system {{cracking}} problems, {{the focus}} of the present study, occur in both structures of recent construction and in older bridges which have been in service for many years. The present study has risen out of specific cases of floor system cracks which are not immediately detrimental to the structural integrity of the floor system and which do not at the outset seem related to a usual design basis load effects. The cases forming the central focus of this report are: (1) The 1 - 474 Shade-Lohmann Bridge over the Illinois River south of Peoria, (2) The 1 - 74 Bridge over the Vermilion River at Danville, and (3) The 1 - 74 Bridge over the Sangamon near Mahomet in Champaign County. The following is seen: Case 1 : Cracking due to forces not associated with vertical vehicle loading. That is, evidence is strong that cracking arises from longitudinal load transmitted through the out of plane flexure of the floor beam web in the segment between the <b>connection</b> <b>clip</b> angles and the flange at either end. Calculations show that a very modest induced longitudinal deformation is associated with substantialloca 1 stresses at the web to flange junction which is the site of the cracking. Case 2 : Fatigue failure of a detail with adverse geometry but with forces induced by vehicle loads which clearly account for the damage. A repair detail to reduce member forces has been suggested and is evaluated. Case 3 : The development of a fatigue crack at a cope detail associate with a reasonable stress state for the damage observed, but with poor correlation with a limited controlled vehicle test and predictions of bridge behavior using a grid model. Additional field studies with more extensive instrumentation and a more comprehensive analytical model is needed to resolve uncertainties in this case. Department of Transportation.
