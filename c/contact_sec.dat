40|$|Timing control, such as {{producing}} movements {{at a given}} rate or synchronizing {{movements to}} an external event, has been studied through a finger-tapping task where timing is measured at the initial contact between finger and tapping surface or the point when a key is pressed. However, the point of peak force is after the time registered at the tapping surface and thus is a less obvious but still important event during finger tapping. Here, we compared the time at initial contact with the time at peak force as participants tapped their finger on a force sensor at a given rate after the metronome was turned off (continuation task) or in synchrony with the metronome (sensorimotor synchronization task). We found that, in the continuation task, timing was comparably accurate between initial contact and peak force. These two timing events also exhibited similar trial-by-trial statistical dependence (i. e., lag-one autocorrelation). However, the central clock variability was lower at the peak force than the initial contact. In the synchronization task, timing control at peak force appeared to be less variable and more accurate than that at initial contact. In addition to lower central clock variability, the mean SE magnitude at peak force (SEP) was around zero while SE at initial <b>contact</b> (<b>SEC)</b> was negative. Although SEC and SEP demonstrated the same trial-by-trial statistical dependence, we found that participants adjusted the time of tapping to correct SEP, but not SEC, toward zero. These results suggest that timing at peak force is a meaningful target of timing control, particularly in synchronization tapping. This result may explain the fact that SE at initial contact is typically negative as widely observed in the preexisting literature...|$|E
40|$|We have {{extended}} a previously developed photo-crosslinking approach to systematically probe the protein {{environment of the}} secretory protein preprolactin, trapped during its transfer through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Single photoreactive groups were placed at various positions of nascent polypeptide chains of various length, corresponding to different stages of the transport process, and photo-crosslinks to membrane proteins were analyzed. In all cases, the polypeptide segment extending from the ribosome {{was found to be}} located in a membrane environment that is formed almost exclusively from Sec 61 alpha, the multi-spanning subunit of the Sec 61 p complex that is essential for translocation. At early stages of the translocation process, before cleavage of the signal sequence, almost the entire nascent chain emerged from the ribosome <b>contacts</b> <b>Sec</b> 61 alpha. The 'translocating chain-associating membrane' protein interacts mainly with the region of the signal sequence preceding its hydrophobic core. Our results suggest that the nascent chain is transferred directly from the ribosome into a protein-conducting channel, the major constituent of which is Sec 61 alpha...|$|R
40|$|During polytopic protein biogenesis, {{multiple}} transmembrane segments (TMs) {{must pass}} through the ribosome exit tunnel and into the Sec 61 translocon prior to insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To investigate how movement of a newly synthesized TM along this integration pathway might be influenced by synthesis of a second TM, we used photocross-linking probes to detect the proximity of ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides to Sec 61 α. Probes were inserted at sequential sites within TM 2 of the aquaporin- 1 water channel by in vitro translation of truncated mRNAs. TM 2 first <b>contacted</b> <b>Sec</b> 61 α when the probe was positioned ∼ 38 residues from the ribosome peptidyltransferase center, and TM 2 -Sec 61 α photoadducts decreased markedly when the probe was > 80 residues from the peptidyltransferase center. Unexpectedly, as nascent chain length was gradually extended, photocross-linking at multiple sites within TM 2 abruptly and transiently decreased, indicating that TM 2 initially entered, withdrew, and then re-entered Sec 61 α. This brief reduction in TM 2 photocross-linking coincided with TM 3 synthesis. Replacement of TM 3 with a secretory reporter domain or introduction of proline residues into TM 3 changed the TM 2 cross-linking profile and this biphasic behavior. These findings demonstrate that the primary and likely secondary structure of the nascent polypeptide within the ribosome exit tunnel can influence the timing with which topogenic determinants contact, enter, and {{pass through the}} translocon...|$|R
40|$|During cotranslational protein {{integration}} into the ER membrane, each transmembrane (TM) segment moves laterally through the translocon to reach the lipid bilayer. Photocrosslinking studies reveal that a particular surface of each nascent chain TM α helix and signal-anchor sequence always faces Sec 61 α in the translocon. This nonrandom and TM sequence-dependent positioning reveals that each TM segment makes specific <b>contacts</b> with <b>Sec</b> 61 α and is retained at a fixed location within the translocon, observations that are best explained by the binding of each TM sequence to a translocon protein(s). Since TM sequence hydrophobicity does not correlate with its rate of release from the translocon, nascent chain movement through the translocon appears to be mediated primarily by protein-protein interactions rather than hydrophobic nascent chain-phospholipid interactions...|$|R
40|$|Posttranslational {{translocation}} of prepro [...] factor (ppF) {{across the}} yeast endoplasmic reticulum membrane {{begins with the}} binding of the signal sequence to the Sec complex, a membrane component consisting of the trimeric Sec 61 p complex and the tetrameric Sec 62 p/ 63 p complex. We show by photo-cross-linking that the signal sequence is bound directly to a site where it <b>contacts</b> simultaneously <b>Sec</b> 61 p and Sec 62 p, suggesting {{that there is a}} single signal sequence recognition step. We found no evidence for the simultaneous contact of the signal sequence with two Sec 61 p molecules. To identify transmembrane segments of Sec 61 p that line the actual translocation pore, a late translocation intermediate of ppF was generated with photoreactive probes incorporated into the mature portion of the polypeptide. Cross-linking to multiple regions of Sec 61 p was observed. In contrast to the signal sequence, neighboring positions of the mature portion of ppF had similar interactions with Sec 61 p. These data suggest that the channel pore is lined by several transmembrane segments, which have no significant affinity for the translocating polypeptide chain...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the efficacy, {{in terms}} of burned wound healing, of a mixture of Ethyl Linoleate (ethyl 9 - 12 (cis, cis) octadecadienoate) with alpha- 1 -histidine, alpha-tocopherol, and TBHQ (hELate) was {{undertaken}} in 12 swine. The species was selected so as to study an animal with skin anatomy similar to the human. Statistically significantly greater healing occurred in 730 C/ 7 <b>sec</b> <b>contact</b> burns (20 % BSA) treated with hELate than in untreated burns in pigs. Further, there was no contracture noted in the hELate treated lesions, while marked contracture occurred in the untreated burns. Additionally, we noted {{that there was a}} proportional increase in weight gain amongst swine studied as their burn lesions epithelialized. In order to evaluate the compatibility of hELate with selected, currently-used topical antibacterial agents, 154 rabbits with 20 % 730 C/ 7 <b>sec</b> <b>contact</b> burns were studied. The lipid was applied (0. 01 ml/cm 2 burn) at 1 hour postburning; the topical agent was applied at 2 hours post-burn and every 24 -hours. All animals were washed once daily. hELate was applied only once. We found no statistical difference in the number of subjects healed or in the mortality between animals treated with hELate alone and those treated with the agent plus Gentamycin cream, Neosporin cream, and silver sulfadiazine 1 % in Unibase USP (compounded at Medical College of Georgia specifically and only for this study.) We suggest that Ethyl Linoleate agent (hELate) may be used safely in combination with selected antibacterial substances. Further, these selected combinations seem to be non-toxic and appear to allow the calorie-saving and healing effects of the lipid to proceed unimpeded...|$|R
40|$|Sec 7 domains (Sec 7 d) {{catalyze}} {{the exchange}} of guanine nucleotide on ARFs. Recent studies indicated that brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits Sec 7 d-catalyzed nucleotide exchange on ARF 1 in an uncompetitive manner by trapping an early intermediate of the reaction: a complex between GDP-bound ARF 1 and Sec 7 d. Using 3 H-labeled BFA, we show that BFA binds to neither isolated Sec 7 d nor isolated ARF 1 –GDP, but binds to the transitory Sec 7 d–ARF 1 –GDP complex and stabilizes it. Two pairs of residues at positions 190 – 191 and 198 – 208 (Arno numbering) in Sec 7 d contribute equally to the stability of BFA binding, which is also sensitive to mutation of H 80 in ARF 1. The catalytic glutamic (E 156) residue of Sec 7 d is not necessary for BFA binding. In contrast, BFA does not bind to the intermediate catalytic complex between nucleotide-free ARF 1 and Sec 7 d. These results suggest that, on initial docking steps between ARF 1 –GDP and Sec 7 d, BFA inserts like a wedge between the switch II region of ARF 1 –GDP and a surface encompassing residues 190 – 208, at {{the border of the}} characteristic hydrophobic groove of Sec 7 d. Bound BFA would prevent the switch regions of ARF 1 –GDP from reorganizing and forming tighter <b>contacts</b> with <b>Sec</b> 7 d and thereby would maintain the bound GDP of ARF 1 at a distance from the catalytic glutamic finger of Sec 7 d...|$|R
40|$|Bearing {{materials}} {{for use in}} the Metallurgy Division Sector of the EBR- 11 Fuel Cycle Plant must operate without lubrication in an argon atmosphere of low humidity (dew-point of [...] 50 deg C or less) and high gamma activity. To select suitable materials, a test program, in which samples of materials known to be radiation resistant were tested for wear resistance in an argon atmosphere containing less than 30 ppm water by volume, was initiated. The criterion by which wear resistance was judged is loss in sample weight over a 24 -hour abrasion period during which the samples rub along the periphery of a 2 1 / 2 -in. OD wear ring made of SAE 1045 steel. The majority of the samples were tested using a load of 2755 gm and a rubbing vclocity of 109 ft per <b>sec.</b> <b>Contact</b> between the rectangular samples and the wear ring was initially linear. Of the materials tested, Reactor Grade Graphite and some graphite derivatives showed the best bearing qualities.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a method for {{illustrating}} the continuity of behavior during schedules of reinforcement. Students experienced either a fixed-interval 15 -sec schedule in which the first <b>contact</b> af-ter 15 <b>sec</b> of a cursor {{on a computer screen}} with a 0. 7 -cm diameter virtual (invisible) target resulted in reinforcement (a beep) or a fixed-ratio 5 schedule in which every 5 th contact with the target produced the reinforcer. In addition to illustrating the continuity of behavior, this method provides a means of exposing students to con-cepts and methods such as the acquisition of operant behavior, the assignment-of-credit problem, the organization of behavior across time, and the analysis of single-subject data. In this article, {{we present a}} method for illustrating the continuity of behavior during schedules of reinforcement (i. e., a rule that specifies the circumstances for the delivery of a reward) and discuss how this method can be used to il-lustrate and stimulate discussion about the acquisition of operant behavior (Pear & Legris, 1987; Skinner, 1981), the assignment-of-credit problem (Staddon & Zhang, 1991), the organization of behavior across time (Dews, 1969; Ferster & Skinner, 1957), and the analysis of single-subject data (Kazdin, 1982; Sidman, 1960). We begin by describing the demonstration, focusing on the behavior of a student exposed to a fixed-interval (FI) 15 -sec schedule in which a target response produces reinforcement if this response oc-curs at least 15 sec since the delivery of the previous rein-forcer and on the behavior of another student exposed to a fixed-ratio (FR) 5 schedule in which every fifth target re-sponse produces reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. 					 This thesis concerns the attempted synthesis of two strained nonbenzenoid, conjugated bicyclic systems, 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene (butalene or para-benzyne, 28) and the 1, 4 -dehydrotropylium ion (30 c). Both 28 a and 30 c contain a fused cyclobutadiene ring with [ [...] . ] its accompanying antiaromaticity but overall possess 4 n+ 2 [pi] electrons. The concept of nonbenzenoid aromaticity {{as it applies}} to compounds such as these is reviewed. The synthetic approach to 28 and 30 systems is based on the pyrolytic cyclization of a 1, 5 -hexadiyne moiety to form a dimethylenecyclobutene, thereby introducing the strain and unsaturation of the fused four-membered ring in one step. In Part I, the synthesis and pyrolysis of cis- 1, 6 -dideutero- 1, 5 -hexadiyn- 3 -ene (cis- 60 a) is described. By a combination of nmr and ms techniques, it is demonstrated that cis- 60 a undergoes a degenerate rearrangement at 200 ?C in the gas phase at atmospheric pressure, interconverting cis- 60 a with its 3, 4 -dideuteroisomer cis- 60 b with an equilibration half-life of 30 sec. None of the single exchange isomer cis- 60 c or any trans- 60 was formed in this pyrolysis. These data require a transition state or intermediate between cis- 60 a and cis- 60 b with [ [...] . ] symmetry, i. e., [ [...] . ] 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene. Similarly prepared trans- 60 a did not undergo isomerization or rearrangement at these temperatures. Pyrolysis of cis- and trans- 60 in solution provided a high yield of benzene in the presence of hydrogen donors at the expense of cis- 60. In carbon tetrachloride, para-dichlorobenzene was the major product. In methanol, a 10 % yield of benzyl alcohol but no anisole was formed. Since these are typical products of radical abstraction, it is suggested that the symmetrical species implicated in the deuterium scrambling is a true intermediate and of 1, 4 -benzenediyl structure 28 d or e (instead of 28 a). [ [...] . ]. While traces of benzene were seen in the atmospheric and vacuum pyrolysis of cis- and trans- 60, no satisfactory gas phase trapping experiment has been performed. Neither have substantial levels of deuterium scrambling been demonstrated in liquid phase pyrolysis. These points together with some indication of the stereospecificity of the benzene forming reaction in solution remain to be answered. The added complication of a possible triplet ground state for the 1, 4 -benzenediyl (28 d) must also be resolved before a truly consistent story can be told. A possible direct route to a triplet 28 d, photosensitized irradiation of cis- 60 a, failed to produce scrambling in competition with a demonstrated approach to the photostationary state. No transfer of acetylenic label was observed also under direct (254 nm) irradiation of cis- 60 a. In Part II, toward formation of the 1, 4 -dehydrotropylium ion (30 c) as well as the 1, 4 -dehydrotropyl anion (30 a) and the bicyclo [3. 2. 0]heptatrien- 3 -one (52), the synthesis of [ [...] . ] bicyclo[3. 2. 0]hepta- 1, 4, 6 -trienes substituted in the 3 -position is discussed. The required 3 -substituted 1, 2 -diethynylcyclopropanes were approached via carbene addition to hexadiynenes, eneynes, and via y-elimination routes. Of these, only the addition of propargyl carbene to methoxybuten- 3 -yne (150) provided any cyclopropane product. The 3 -methoxy- 1, 2 -diethynylcyclopropane (61 d) [ [...] . ] prepared in < 1 % isolated yield by this method readily isomerized to the air sensitive 3 -methoxybicyclo[3. 2. 0]hepta- 1, 4, 6 -triene (62 d) upon pyrolysis under atmospheric pressure flow conditions at 305 ?C (<b>contact</b> time 10 <b>sec).</b> Attempted formation of 30 a by ether cleavage reduction of 62 d with potassium led only to polymer without any evidence for formation of an anion. However, treatment of 62 d with SbF 5 containing a catalytic amount of HOSO 2 F in a soft matrix at - 180 ?C gave evidence in the nmr of formation of 30 c although at such low concentrations that a clear spectrum was not obtained.
