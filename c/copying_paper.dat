"MY DEAR WOLFENDEN,--We {{have been}} rather {{looking for you}} to come [...] down for a day or two, and I do hope that {{you will be able to}} [...] manage it {{directly}} you receive this. I am sorry to say that your [...] father is very far from well, and we have all been much upset [...] lately. He still works for eight or nine hours a day, and his [...] hallucinations as to the value of his papers increases with every [...] page he writes. His latest peculiarity is a rooted conviction that [...] there is some plot on hand to rob him of his manuscripts. You [...] remember, perhaps, Miss Merton, the young person whom we engaged as [...] typewriter. He sent her away the other day, without a moment's [...] notice, simply because he saw her with a sheet of <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> in [...] her hand. I did not like the girl, but it is perfectly ridiculous [...] to suspect her of anything of the sort. He insisted, however, that [...] she should leave the house within an hour, and we were obliged to [...] give in to him. Since then he has seemed to become even more [...] fidgety. He has had cast-iron shutters fitted to the study windows, [...] and two of the keepers are supposed to be on duty outside night and [...] day, with loaded revolvers. People around here are all beginning to [...] talk, and I am afraid that it is only natural that they should. He [...] will see no one, and the library door is shut and bolted [...] immediately he has entered it. Altogether it is a deplorable state [...] of things, and what will be the end of it I cannot imagine. [...] Sometimes it occurs to me that you might have more influence over [...] him than I have. I hope that you will be able to come down, if only [...] for a day or two, and see what effect your presence has. The [...] shooting is not good this year, but Captain Willis was telling me [...] yesterday that the golf links were in excellent condition, and [...] there is the yacht, of course, if you care to use it. Your father [...] seems to have quite forgotten that she is still in the [...] neighbourhood, I am glad to say. Those inspection cruises were very [...] bad things for him. He used to get so excited, and he was [...] dreadfully angry if the photographs which I took were at all [...] imperfectly developed. How is everybody? Have you seen Lady Susan [...] lately? and is it true that Eleanor is engaged? I feel literally [...] buried here, but I dare not suggest a move. London, for him at [...] present, would be madness. I shall hope to get a wire from you [...] to-morrow, and will send to Cromer to meet any train.--From your [...] affectionate mother, ...|$|E

50|$|Ilyinites {{took the}} {{revolution}} of 1917 indifferently. Their teaching prohibits {{them to take}} action in military clashes and killing, however Ilyinites expected to get more religious freedom after the revolution. In 1939 a secret center of Ilyinites was discovered and closed by NKVD in Nizhny Tagil city in Ural. During the Soviet period Ilyinites had to hide their activity; {{some of them were}} persecuted, arrested; their religious literature was confiscated. Quite often young men refused to serve in the army, which resulted in criminal prosecution and in some cases in capital punishment. Nevertheless, Yehowists kept on distributing Ilyin's booklets both printed secretly and hand-written or copied with a <b>copying</b> <b>paper.</b> Yehowists are not a registered organization believing that there is no need in getting registered with the authorities that belong to Satan. Religious publications about Yehowists made during the Soviet period are scarce and contain wrong data about Yehowists. They stated that Ilyinites ceased to exist as a religious movement and also tried to represent Yehowists as part or a branch of Jehovah's Witnesses, which is totally incorrect.|$|E
50|$|Using letter copying presses, copies {{could be}} made up to twenty-four hours after a letter was written, though copies made within a few hours were best. A copying clerk would begin by {{counting}} the number of master letters to be written during the next few hours and by preparing the copying book. Suppose the clerk wanted to copy 20 one-page letters. In that case, he would insert a sheet of oiled paper into the copying book in front of the first tissue on which he wanted to make a copy of a letter. He would then turn 20 sheets of tissue paper and insert a second oiled paper. To dampen the tissue paper, the clerk used a brush or <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> damper. The damper had a reservoir for water that wet a cloth, and the clerk wiped the cloth over the tissues on which copies were to be made. As an alternative method of dampening the tissue paper, in 1860 Cutter, Tower & Co., Boston, advertised Lynch's patent paper moistener.|$|E

30|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that the integrated LCA and MCDA approach provided a structured and comprehensive methodology for impact analysis and environmental decision making. In the background of growing concerns over global warming, carbon emission became an important factor. Carbon footprint, however, should not be merely one element in decision-making. The developed method could thus improve previous studies in comprehensive assessment on carbon footprints of products and service on multiple issues. The developed method was then applied to <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> and printing services of China. The application indicated that the hybrid MCDA-LCA method can provide a structured and comprehensive methodology for accounting CFP as well as assessing environmental impacts of products and services. The {{results indicated that the}} most emergent environmental impacts caused by paper production and printing services were resource consumption and hazardous waste. At the same time, {{due to a lack of}} life-cycle inventory data of planting trees, carbon storage was not included in system boundary of <b>copying</b> <b>paper.</b> The next study would be furthered in detailed carbon emission of paper-making industry. Moreover, when purchasing <b>copying</b> <b>paper,</b> consumers should pay attention on coal consumption of the product. In printing industry, VOC of printing services should be taken serious consideration in China.|$|E

50|$|Carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> {{was first}} {{produced}} by the NCR Corporation. Formerly, the options were to write documents more than once or use carbon paper, which was inserted between the sheet being written upon and the <b>copy.</b> Carbonless <b>paper</b> was used as business stationery requiring one or more copies of the original, such as invoices and receipts. The <b>copies</b> were often <b>paper</b> of different colors (e.g. white original for customer, yellow copy for supplier's records, and other colors for subsequent copies). Stationery with carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> can be supplied collated either in pads or books bound into sets, or as loose sets, or as continuous stationery for printers designed to use it.|$|R
30|$|Thus, in this research, {{a hybrid}} life cycle {{analysis}} (LCA) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method was proposed for helping evaluate CFP {{of products and}} services under multiple environmental indicators. The results indicated: (a) Air pollution caused by coal consumption was the primary environmental impact in China’s paper-production industry, and (b) in printing industry, air pollution caused by VOC was the primary environmental impact in China. At the same time, CFP of 1, 000  kg <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> was 1, 415.39  kg CO 2 e based on LCI data of a paper factory in China.

40|$|Abstract. Microencapsulation {{has great}} {{potential}} extensive applications in fields of cosmetics, pesticides, pharmaceutical and medical applications, foods, biology, catalysis, carbonless <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> {{and many other}} areas. Gypenosides (GPS) are extracted from Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino, widely used in Southeast Asian folk medicine or food. In the current study, Gypenosides-loaded microcapsules (GPMC) were prepared by gelatin/gum. Characteristics and bioactivity of the GPMC were evaluated. An up to 80 % encapsulation of GPS at pH 4. 0 was achieved, with 1 : 2 drug to wall materials ratio and a 3 % gelatin/gum arabic while stirring at 500 r/min. Microscopy revealed an average microcapsule size of 52. 4 µm. Pharmacological studies showed that GPMC exhibited excellent therapeutic effects, such as expectorant activity, cough relieving and anti-inflammatory effect. The results indicate that microcapsulation is a safe and efficient delivery for GPS...|$|E

Activated aluminas are shown to outperform acid activated clays as developers for CVL, with the effectiveness increasing with activation temperature up to 500 °C. In addition, unlike the acid activated clays, no shift in the X., is observed during the fading process. Pyridine was used as a probe of the acid characteristics of an intact and an acid activated clay exchanged with Al 3, Cu 21, Ni 2 and Cr 3 ions., with FTIR, NvR and thermal analysis being used to investigate the adsorbed state.

40|$|Eco-labelling {{is one of}} the key tools used by {{policy-makers}} in {{many parts}} of the world to encourage more sustainable production and consumption. By providing environmental information on products and services, eco-labels address both business users and consumers and range from mandatory approaches, such as required product declarations, to voluntary approaches, such as national eco-labels. The book analyses the conditions under which eco-labelling schemes - both mandatory and voluntary - are or can become an efficient and effective tool to achieve given objectives; assesses previous experiences with eco-labels in different European countries and relationship of these schemes with business strategies, IPP and market conditions; defines strategies aimed at linking eco-labels with other IPP measures; explores how eco-labels can be used to encourage sustainable consumption patterns, create green markets, foster innovation and development of green products and services, and implement multi-stakeholder initiatives; and sets out detailed recommendations for the future of eco-labelling. The book will be required reading for policy-makers, businesses involved with eco-labelling schemes and researchers interested in the development of sustainable production and consumption and integrated product policy worldwide.

40|$|The colour formers used in {{carbonless}} <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> {{consist of}} admixtures of {{primary and secondary}} dyes. Work {{was carried out in}} this programme both on retarding the photofading of the primary dyes and on improving the reactivity of the clay minerals towards the development of the secondary dye. The photolytic fading behaviour of S primary dyes were examined both in solution and on solid clay surfaces, and the intermediacy of singlet oxygen in the fading processes of the dyes examined by the DPBF trapping method. The retardation of dye fading was accomplished using bis(dithiocarbamato) nickel(II) complexes and it was found that some hydroxy-possessing species conferred improved photo-stability upon the developed dyes, especially towards fluorans, and to a lesser degree towards phthalides. The dark development of carbazolyl blue was examined on a series of cation exchanged and acid activated clays. There appeared to be two main mechanisms governing S-RB development in the dark; the first was catalysis by co-ordination to the Lewis acid sites on the clay edges, whilst the second was a redox process probably associated with the Fe 3 cations present in the clays. Several treatments were applied to modify common commercial days. It was found that introducing Fe 3 and Cu 2 into the clay profoundly improved the reactivity of the day to the secondary leuco dye. Cation exchange of clay with some transition metal ions such as CO 2 and Ni 2 also showed a beneficial effect on the colour formation. The Langmuir isotherm type plots were used to examine cation adsorption behaviour for 9 types of montmorillonite clays. It was found that cation exchange of clay occurs at at least two different sites; the tetrahedral silica layer sites and the intact montmorillonite interlayer cation exchange sites. It was also found that the silica layer sites are the predominant ones responsible for S-RB development, with interlayer sites providing a much lesser contribution. Adsorption of aquated metal salts makes virtually no further contributions to the leuco dye reaction...|$|E
40|$|Essential {{oils and}} {{extracts}} of various species of edible and medicinal plants, herbs, and spices constitute very potent biological active agents. They have a complex composition, containing {{from a few}} to several hundred constituents, mainly hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. Both, hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds are responsible for odors and flavors, generated by aromatic plants as secondary metabolites (Ebrahimi et al., 2008). Clove oil (CO) is an essential oil contained in the dried flower buds, leaves and stem of the tree Syzygiu aromaticum (Eastern Hemisphere) or Eugenia caryophyllata and Eugenia aromaticum (Western hemisphere) (Schmid, 1972). It {{has been used for}} centuries as an anesthetic for toothaches, headaches and joint pain (Shelef, 1983; Soto et al., 1995). Clove has received attention as an ideal fish anesthetic (Ackerman et al., 2002; Wagner et al., 2003; Hoskonen and Pirhonen, 2004; Roubach et al, 2005) and it {{has been used as a}} fragrant and flavoring agent in a variety of food and cosmetic products (Atsumi et al., 2001; Fujisawa et al., 2002., Ito et al., 2005). Eugenol (EG) (4 -allyl- 2 -methoxyphenol) is the principal constituent of the essential CO, accounting for 90 - 95 % of the total oil amount (Briozzo et al., 1989; Gulcin et al., 2010). It has a strong phenolic smell and sharp acrid taste (Mouchreck, 2000; Ozturz et al., 2005). This phenolic compound has shown several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory activity, analgesic activity, anti-oxidative activity and anti-bacterial activity. In the food industry, clove is often used in the form of ground, extracted essential oil or oleoresin, but always in a small amount due to its intense flavour. However, the use of CO could be a problem in industrial applications due to its high volatility and low stability. Hence, irritation the mucosa and skin, pungent taste, volatility, light sensitivity and poor water solubility make it unsuitable to use as such. Considering the effectiveness and convenience of the application of essential CO and its main compound EG, the introduction of these compounds into food and cosmetic products has many challenges. These food ingredients are susceptible of degradation due to environmental stress conditions such as temperature, humidity, light, oxygen, interaction with other food ingredients and volatility of the aromatic compounds. Encapsulation is the technique by which one material or a mixture of materials is coated with or entrapped within another material or system. The coated material is called active or core material, and the coating material is called shell, wall material, carrier or encapsulant. The development of microencapsulation products started in the 1950 s with the research on pressure-sensitive coatings for the manufacture of carbonless <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> (Green and Scheicher, 1955). Encapsulation technology is now well developed and accepted within the pharmaceutical, chemical, cosmetic, foods and printing industries (Augustin et al., 2001; Heinzen, 2002). In food products, fats and oils, aromatic compounds and oleoresins, vitamins, minerals, colorants and enzymes have been encapsulated (Dziezak, 1988; Jackson and Lee, 1991; Shahidi and Han, 1993). The simplest form of microcapsules may consist of a core surrounded by a wall of uniform or non-uniform thickness. The core material may be composed of just one or several distinct types of ingredients whereas the carrier could be single or multilayered. The microcapsules are generally additives to a larger system and must be adapted to that system. Consequently, there are a number of performance requirements placed on microcapsules. A limited number of encapsulating methods exist (Versic, 1988) (Figure VI. 1. 1), but an enormous range of di¿erent materials can be used including proteins, carbohydrates (CDs, MDs, gums) and lipids (Brazel, 1999). The choice of wall materials depends upon a number of factors including: expected product objectives and requirements; nature of the core material; process of encapsulation; economics and whether the coating material is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (US) or European Food Safety Authority (Europe) (Amrita et al., 1991) Being aware of the problems associated with the use of essential CO and its main compound EG, the aim of this study was using encapsulation as a tool in order to protect these sensitive bioactive compounds from degradation, eliminating unwanted effects and improving the effectiveness of their use in the industry.
