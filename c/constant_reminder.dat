Within days, dozens of local volunteers assisted in the search effort, which involved nearly every resource within the community. Within weeks, {{tens of thousands of}} fliers and posters were mailed to businesses throughout the United States. Since her favorite color was pink, the town was blanketed in pink ribbons as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of her disappearance, and as a demonstration of support for her family by the community.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{his former}} seat of power, Osborn regains control of his {{business}} and also buys out the Daily Bugle, humiliating former friend and societal peer J. Jonah Jameson as he no longer has control over the newspaper. He also torments Ben Urich and demands a retraction over Urich's exposé of his time as the Green Goblin, providing faked evidence that he never was the supervillain, despite Urich's extensive research. However, he saves his most sadistic treatment for Peter, acting {{not only as a}} <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of all the pain he's inflicted on his nemesis over the years, but a looming threat that could strike at any time.|$|E

5|$|The “Copper-Coloured Mountain Paradise of Padmasambahva” (Zangdopari) is vividly {{displayed}} in a heart shape on every thangkha and also painted {{on the walls of}} the monastery as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of the legend. The paintings are set on a pedestal that represents the realm of the King of Nagas amidst Dakinis (mKha-hgro-ma), and the pinnacle in the painting denotes the domain of Brahma. The paintings also depict Klu (Naga) demigods with a human head and the body of a serpent, which are said to reside in lakes (said to denote that they are guarding the hidden treasures). Allegorically, they mean to represent the spiritual holy writings. The paintings also show what is termed as “Walkers in the Sky” (mKha-hgro-ma).|$|E
5|$|The Praetorian Guard was {{an elite}} {{unit of the}} Roman army formed by Augustus in 27 BC, with the {{specific}} function {{to serve as a}} bodyguard to the emperor and members of the imperial family. Much more than a guard however, the Praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city, such as general security and civil administration. Furthermore, their presence served as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> to the people and the Senate of the substantial armed force which served {{as the basis for the}} imperial power. Augustus was careful however to uphold the republican veneer of this regime, and only allowed nine cohorts to be formed (one fewer than in a normal Roman legion), which were inconspicuously scattered across various lodging houses in the city, and commanded by two prefects.|$|E

25|$|In 1720 it was {{proposed}} that Durham {{could become a}} sea port by digging a canal north to join the River Team, {{a tributary of the}} River Tyne near Gateshead.

25|$|The convict past haunted {{the city}} for decades, and Hobart's {{prominent}} Georgian architecture of the era served as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of the 'social stain' some of its citizens feared they could never erase.

However, many of the former convicts proved to be hard-working and enterprising, establishing businesses and families that still play a prominent role in Tasmanian society.|$|E
25|$|In {{a special}} queer issue of The Stranger in 1999, openly gay author, pundit, and {{journalist}} Dan Savage questioned {{the relevance of}} pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, {{as well as being}} a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of shame. However, he also states that pride in some simpler forms are still useful to individuals struggling with shame. Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realises the reality that sexual orientation doesn't say much about a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people.|$|E

25|$|Some manga are {{completely}} drawn in the bishonen style, such as Saint Seiya. Bishōnen manga are generally shōjo manga (girls' comics) or yaoi (girls' comics focused on homosexual relationships between beautiful boys), however shōnen manga (boy's comics) may use casts of bishōnen characters for crossover appeal to female readers. Mainstream shounen and seinen fare also often uses such characters as rivals for a traditional masculine protagonist, {{with some degree}} of comic relief, or for the blander everyman, whether as the embodiment of his insecurities in a grittier realism, or as a more lighthearted <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of his less than advantageous social status and the constraints thereof. Comics for younger boys tend to use arrogant bishounen {{in the role of the}} recurring minor rivals readers love to hate, though their effeminate good looks there will often appear older, bigger, stronger, and thus in fact more masculine than the commonly shorter and less mature protagonists.|$|E
25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would spend their time to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They {{said there is no}} money in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to make art as a hobby. But despite his parents' <b>constant</b> <b>reminder,</b> Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled to a lot of art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has touched him and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene and he has not garnered any recognition yet.|$|E
25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He then looks at a withering daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E

5000|$|As {{opposed to}} other combat based {{role-playing}} video games, King's Field focuses more on exploration {{and a dark}} brooding ambience.

[...] He went on to declare his approval of the decision to depict Anthony on the coins:I am particularly pleased that the new dollar coin will—for the first time in history—bear the image of a great American woman. The life of Susan B. Anthony exemplifies the ideals for which our country stands. The 'Anthony dollar' will symbolize for all American women the achievement of their unalienable right to vote. It will be a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of the continuing struggle for the equality of all Americans.|$|E
500|$|As of 2009, the {{congregation}} had approximately five thousand {{two hundred and}} nine parishioners. Mount Saint Peter Church serves {{as a symbol of}} faith and what can be accomplished when people work together for a common belief, hope, and dream. The church's new motto, adopted in 2004, reflected this balance: [...] "to restore all things in Christ...with the fire of love." [...] This motto serves as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> {{of the history of the}} parish. The beauty of the Mellon Mansion was restored by {{the congregation}} and turned into a House of God. This was done through a strong love of Christ, faith, and neighbor. The names of the volunteers who helped build the church are carved in the marble inside the main entrance of the church and serve as a token of the congregation's appreciation. Many of today's parishioners are descendants of those volunteers and are proud to tell the story of their forefathers who gave them this church in which to practice their faith.|$|E
500|$|Rapunzel was {{the first}} blonde-haired Disney {{animated}} heroine since Aurora in Sleeping Beauty (1959). Animating Rapunzel's hair using computer-generated imagery has been regarded as the most challenging aspect in the development process of Tangled. [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, supervising animator Glen Keane has become well known for animating some of Walt Disney Animation Studios' [...] "greatest hair hits" [...] since 1989, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, the Beast from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Pocahontas from Pocahontas (1995). Both Keane and Howard have expressed similar opinions on Rapunzel's hair, with Keane describing it as [...] "this <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> that she has this gift", and Howard describing it as its own character. As directors, Howard and Greno provided the animators with much live-action material and reference to use as inspiration for the appearance of Rapunzel's hair, such as attaching long strands of string to a baseball cap that they would take turns wearing {{in the studio and}} moving around it. Additionally, they recruited women who had not cut their hair in several years to serve as live models.|$|E

50|$|Most importantly, the {{boundaries}} of the powers of the ministers and church officers are set by clear and <b>constant</b> <b>reminders</b> of the freedoms guaranteed by the Gospel to the laity, collectively and individually. With that freedom comes the responsibility upon each member to govern himself or herself under Christ. This requires lay people to exercise great charity and patience in debating issues with one another and to seek the glory and service of God as the foremost consideration in all of their decisions.|$|R
50|$|Following an {{air raid}} on the labor camp, Andrew deserted and found his way to Budapest. After a short stay in City Park (Hungarian: Varosliget) he and {{hundreds}} of others were herded onto boxcars {{and sent to the}} Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. This was the winter of 1944. Here, he survived for months in an atmosphere of cold, starvation, beatings, outright murder, lice infestation and <b>constant</b> <b>reminders</b> of death. Near his 19th birthday, he spotted his Aunt Alice in the camp. She perished there not much later.|$|R
500|$|The {{presentation}} of Empire City was also {{considered to be}} a significant factor {{of the success of the}} game. The climbing and grabbing aspect was considered well done and avoided a [...] "frustration-fest" [...] that other games with precision jumping generally bring about, according to Miller. However, some reviewers noted that Cole's climbing ability was too touchy, with the character grabbing onto ledges too greedily, making it difficult to fine-tune jumps. In combination with Cole's other powers, Miller cited the game as having the [...] "most original city-traversal mechanics" [...] for an open-world game. The behavior of the city's population and how that was affected by the player's choice in Karma was also seen as a positive, and as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of the game's setting. The game's story, particularly in the second half of the game, was considered to be strong, enhanced by {{presentation of}} the cut-scenes. However, the quality of these scenes was seen to negatively highlight the poor animation used for in-game generated cut-scenes and the quality of the voice work; Miller considered Cole's voice to be too gravelly for the character.|$|E
500|$|In A Game of Thrones, Jon Snow is {{introduced}} as the 14-year-old bastard son of Eddard [...] "Ned" [...] Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Jon {{is described as}} having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes. Jon has the surname [...] "Snow" [...] (customarily used for illegitimate children in the North) and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of Ned's infidelity. Jon is {{the same age as}} Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times he can [...] "inhabit" [...] the wolf and share its experiences.|$|E
500|$|The Bridge on the Drina remains Andrić's {{most famous}} novel and has {{received}} the most scholarly analysis of all his works. Most scholars interpret the eponymous bridge as a metonym for Yugoslavia, which was itself a bridge between East and West during the Cold War, [...] "partaking of both but being neither". However, {{at the time of}} writing, the country did not enjoy the reputation of an inter-civilizational mediator, which was fostered by Tito only after his split with Stalin in 1948. Thus, the novel can be seen as having contributed to the formation of this national self-image. Andrić suggests that the building of roads and bridges by Great Powers is rarely done as a gesture of friendship towards local populations, but rather as a means of facilitating imperialist conquest. Thus, the bridge is both a symbol of unification and division. It is a symbol of unification in that it allows the inhabitants of Višegrad to cross from one bank to the other and in that the kapija serves as a popular meeting place. On the other hand, it divides the town's inhabitants by acting as a <b>constant</b> <b>reminder</b> of the Ottoman conquest.|$|E
