5|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>artist</b> Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew.

By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
