Combining NS- 1 and rRT-PCR or the combination of all three tests resulted in the highest sensitivity (93 %) but specificities dropped to 96 % and 83 % respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Adequate {{treatment}} and follow-up of patients {{is essential to}} the success of a screening programme for Chlamydia trachomatis. There has been a lack of data on follow-up, <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections,</b> and reinfection rates among asymptomatic patients in general practice. AIM: 7 b study the rates <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> C trachomatis <b>infection,</b> successful treatment, and reinfection one year after cases were detected in a screening programme for asymptomatic <b>infections.</b> DESIGN <b>OF</b> STUDY: Prospective cohort study SETTING: Fifteen general practices in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. METHOD: One hundred and twenty-four patients with asymptomatic C trachomatis infections were requested to provide a cervical or urethral swab and a urine specimen, for the purpose <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>confirmation</b> before being treated. One year after the first screening, all of the patients were invited for a second screening. All samples were tested using the ligase chain reaction (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA). RESULTS: Out of 124 patients, 110 (89 %) attended the scheduled appointment for diagnostic confirmation and treatment; 92 (84 %) of them were confirmed to be positive and received treatment. At the second screening a year later, none of the 56 patients who had received {{treatment and}} who had been screened a second time were reinfected. CONCLUSION: No asymptomatic patients werefound to have reinfections with C trachomatis one year after diagnostic confirmation and treatment.

Clinically, {{it is not possible}} to recognize the diarrhea caused by rotavirus and other infections. To know a causative agent of rotavirus gastroenteritis, availability of an accurate diagnosis assay is necessary. Therefore, we developed real time RT-PCR assay (rRT-PCR) assay for <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> Group A or C rotaviruses simultaneously. A total of 54 stool samples obtained from pediatric patients (< 5 years old) was used in this study. All samples were tested for Group A rotavirus by Serological rapid test. Result of serological rapid test was compared with rRT-PCR assay to obtain the test accuracies of both assays. Result of this study showed that rates of positive testing for Group A rotavirus by serological rapid test and the rRT-PCR assay were 22. 22 % and 18. 50 %, respectively. Forty-two serology-negative specimens for Group A rotavirus were also PCR negative (100 % specificity). Two serology-positive specimens for Group A rotavirus was rRT-PCR negative (confirmed by electrophoresis gel); therefore, rRT-PCR assay represents the decrease of 3. 70 % in the number of specimens that are positive for Group A rotavirus.

In 2002, the laboratory tested 96, 000 specimens for anti-HCV antibodies, of which 4, 800 (5 %) were seroreactive and required <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> active <b>infection.</b> Although HCV RNA assays with a sensitivity of 50 IU/ml or less are recommended for the <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> active HCV <b>infection,</b> given {{the large number}} of seroreactive specimens tested annually, we evaluated the Ortho trak-C assay (OTCA) as a second-line confirmatory test and determined its limit of detection (LoD). Of 502 specimens from treatment-naïve anti-HCV-positive individuals, 478 had sufficient volumes for evaluation by the OTCA and HCV RNA tests. Core antigen was not detected in 147 of 478 (30. 8 %) of these specimens, of which 37 of 147 (25. 2 %) were shown to be viremic by the VERSANT HCV (version 3. 0) (branched-DNA) assay and/or the VERSANT HCV qualitative assay. Testing of 144 replicates of a World Health Organization standard dilution series indicated that the LoD of OTCA was ∼ 27, 000 IU/ml. This LoD is consistent with the inability of OTCA to detect core antigen in clinical specimens with low viral loads. We conclude that OTCA has limited value as a confirmatory test for the diagnosis <b>of</b> active HCV <b>infection</b> because 37 <b>of</b> 367 (10 %) of viremic specimens had undetectable core antigen.
