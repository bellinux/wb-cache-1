40|$|Three {{competing}} models {{based on}} same six constructs {{have been examined}} {{to find out which}} model explains mobile subscribers ’ loyalty most meaningfully. Data were collected from 195 subscribers of the state-owned (or public) mobile operator in Bangladesh. In all three models, the constructs were measured with same indicators and most of the causal paths were common too in all three models. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was employed to assess the validity and reliability of each construct and the results were satisfactory. Structural Equation Modeling was used to assess the data-model fit. All three models displayed satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices. Path analysis was used to assess the hypotheses. In first two models all hypotheses were empirically supported. However, eight out of nine hypotheses were supported in the third model. To evaluate the competing models, chi-square (χ 2) difference statistics and change in degrees of freedom (df) have been used. Later on, PNFI, ratio of explained paths, and explained variance (R) in endogenous variables were considered to identify the best <b>customer</b> (<b>subscriber)</b> loyalty model. By far the second model showed superior results. This study might encourage the mobile operators to take necessary measures to create a loyal customer base...|$|E

A vector channel equalizer has been proposed for the SDSL upstream receiver to enhance spectral compatibility for the SDSL services. This approach outperforms a conventional scalar equalizer, which used in the current SDSL systems, is about a 15 dB gain in mean squared error (MSE). It significantly suppresses the crosstalk degradation and ensures the quality of service (QoS) on the SDSL transmission throughput. Moreover, the enhancement of the SDSL receiver can benefit on the extension of the SDSL deployment coverage range and also guarantees its promising data rates on increasing numbers of <b>customer</b> <b>subscribers.</b> 1...|$|R

It connects multiple <b>customer</b> digital <b>subscriber</b> line (DSL) interfaces to a high-speed digital communications channel using multiplexing techniques. The DSLAM equipment collects the data from its many modem ports and aggregates their voice and data traffic into one complex composite "signal" via multiplexing. Depending on its device architecture and setup, a DSLAM aggregates the DSL lines over its Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), frame relay, and/or Internet Protocol network (i. e., an IP-DSLAM using PTM-TC [Packet Transfer Mode - Transmission Convergence]) protocol(s) stack. A DSLAM {{may or may not}} be located in the telephone exchange, and may also serve multiple data and voice customers within a neighborhood serving area interface, sometimes in conjunction with a digital loop carrier.

Each modem on the aggregation card communicates with a single subscriber's DSL modem. This modem functionality is integrated into the DSLAM itself instead of being done via an external device like a traditional computer modem.

These future telecommunication services are envisaged to be tailored services that are customizable {{in order to satisfy}} specific requirements of a variety of <b>customers.</b> Service <b>subscribers</b> and users should be offered some direct control in managing their services. Customization in a multi-service environment introduces the requirement for multiple service profiles for each user. Having user service profiles enable universal service access. The current telecommunication service subscription model is no longer viable for the {{next generation}} or TINA-based services. This work proposes a subscription and service information management system that is integrated into the existing TINA-structured platform in the South African TINA (SATINA) Trial. The system developed here realizes the object-oriented TINA subscription information management model. The information model defines all the information and relationships required to handle users, subscribers and the subscription life cycle. The project employs the emerging Object Database Management System (ODBMS) to manage the object oriented telecommunication subscription data. ODBMS provides a powerful and efficient way to managed these object oriented information as information and the relationships are stored as they are used in the application. The proposed subscription and service information management system is a distributed application based on the widely used three-tier architecture model. The three-tier model enables distributed access to the centrally managed subscription and service information regardless of the implementation adopted. Visual modeling technique is used to develop the application and convey the design principles. Application of the subscription and service information management system in the service provider domain is demonstrated by the domain administrator’s usage of the system’s graphical management console. The integration of the information management system and the SATINA Trial’s service platform is indicated through the usage of the TINA compliant Online Subscription service...|$|R

[...] A 2011 Stanford University study cited by Barro simulated a 49-channel subscription bundle being switched to an la carte scheme.

Part {{of the reason is}} efficiency: some distribution costs are fixed whether a distributor provides a few channels or many. If fewer people subscribe, the base subscription rate is likely to go up. In addition, programmers would receive less revenue in carriage fees and advertising revenues, and would look to its remaining viewers to make up the difference. However, some subscribers would benefit from a la carte, including those who have opted out of bundled channels, but might subscribe to just a few, as well as subscribers with no interest in sports.

On site the 706 would have its case removed, the front two feet knocked out, the instrument cord removed and the dial turned round through 180 degrees.

The two metal bezels by which the case was fastened to the chassis were removed and replaced by the new switchhook assembly. This had a bridging piece, like the carrying handle, but with two large hooks to stop the handset falling to the floor. If the instrument had an early dial bezel, carrying the letters and numbers, then this too had to be rotated 180 degrees. When reassembled, the result was an untidy compromise.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} our paper {{is to examine the}} {{mediating}} role of service quality in customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty using a case study of mobile phone subscribers in Uganda. The major aim {{of the study was to}} determine the role played by service quality as it relates to customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses a quantitative, cross-sectional design, employing MedGraph (Version 3. 0), Sobel tests and the Baron and Kenny method to test for a mediating effect of service quality on the relationship between customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty. Findings – Our findings reveal that service quality is a significant mediator in the relationship between the customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty of Ugandan mobile phone <b>subscribers.</b> <b>Customer</b> complaint behaviour had a direct effect on customer loyalty, but the mediating effect of service quality increased this effect. Adding good service quality to the relationship boosts the relationship between customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty by 45 percent among the mobile phone subscribers studied. The findings therefore suggest that when service quality is low, a high level of customer loyalty cannot be attained among mobile phone subscribers in Uganda. Research limitations/implications – The study used only a quantitative approach. However, future research could combine both a quantitative and a qualitative approach (triangulation). The study was moreover limited by the fact that it was cross-sectional. In future, a longitudinal study would therefore be useful to investigate the mediating impact of service quality over a longer period of time. Practical implications – Managers, policy-makers, and mobile telephone companies should advocate and strive for improvements across all dimensions of service quality to boost the loyalty of cell phone customers in Uganda. Originality/value – While a substantial body of research has been carried out on customer complaint behaviour, our paper is the first to test the mediating role of service quality in the relationship between customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty among mobile phone subscribers in Uganda. The study generates quantifiable evidence and contributes to our knowledge on the positive significant influence of service quality in enhancing the level of customer loyalty based on customer complaint behaviour.
