5000|$|Drainage tile {{sometimes}} decreases {{soil erosion}} and runoff of some nutrients, including phosphorus. Phosphorus {{is an important}} nutrient to control {{because it is the}} limiting nutrient in most aquatic ecosystems. Thus phosphorus is the main culprit in eutrophication of surface water; however, the other limiting nutrient, nitrogen, causes substantial damage to waters. For example, nitrogen has been implicated in the gulf hypoxia. Drainage tile sometimes increases water quality because the water flows into the ground then the tile, instead of running off the field into a ditch, carrying soil and nutrients with it. The soil has a chance to filter the water before it enters the streams and rivers. However, by bypassing surface improvements like conservation tillage or riparian buffers, tile drainage can also create problems with water quality [...] and outflow from tile drainage tends to be extremely high in nitrogen. Furthermore, some tile drainage sometime contains very high levels of other chemicals. Since surface forms of conservation agriculture are less effective in tile-drained systems, other practices such as <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> or constructed wetlands may be more effective. In very flat areas, where the natural topography does not provide the gradient necessary for water flow, [...] "agricultural wells" [...] can be dug to provide tile lines sufficient outlet. In these cases, it is the groundwater that stands to be polluted by unfiltered tile output.|$|E

The application {{focuses on the}} estimation {{of the effect of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> water management equipment on corn yields. Using field-level precision agriculture data and spatial panel techniques, the yield response equation is estimated using the spatial autoregressive error random effects model with temporal heterogeneity, incorporating spatial dependence in the error term, while controlling for the topography, weather and the <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> treatment. Controlling for random effects allows for the disentanglement of the effects of spatial dependence from spatial heterogeneity and omitted variables, and thus, to properly investigate the yield response. The results show that <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> has a statistically significant effect on corn yields. The effect is generally positive but varies widely from year to year and field-to-field. For the two years of data <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> was linked to a 2. 2 % increase in field average yield, but that varied from a - 2. 6 % to a + 6. 5 %.

Time and magnitude of soil moisture deficit and excess stress were determined using metrics based on thresholds, depths in the soil profile, and corn growth stages. Seventeen metrics were found to show statistically significant correlation with yields as well as a difference in the quantity of stress between controlled and free-draining fields. Based on one metric of soil moisture deficit stress, free-draining plots experienced 77 additional cm-days of moisture deficit stress from the R 3 stage until maturity compared to controlled plots and an additional 118 cm-days over the entire season. Meanwhile, <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> plots were found to experience between 0. 5 and 3. 19 additional cm-days of excess stress during the period from seedling emergence to V 6 compared to free-draining plots.

40|$|In {{a global}} perspective, the {{efficiency}} of nitrogen fertiliser use in agriculture is low. In Sweden the crop uptake of applied nitrogen fertiliser is about 70 %. The largest losses of nitrogen from arable land are due to leaching, soil erosion and gaseous emissions. <b>Controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> is a method that aims to improve water and nutrient use efficiency. The technique is simple and {{involves the use of}} weirs in the collector drains and thus damming the outlet of the drainage system, {{in order to reduce the}} outflow. <b>Controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> has been shown to have large effects on the quantity and quality of drain outflow by reducing the transport of nitrogen and phosphorus. A stated disadvantage with the system is that the emission of laughing gas (N 2 O) from arable land might increase. The aims of this literature review are to synthesise results from previous studies on N 2 O emission from arable land, illuminate the effects of different management options on levels of N 2 O emission, elucidate lack of knowledge and need of additional research and, finally, estimate expected N 2 O emission and reduced nitrogen leaching if <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> are to be introduced in Sweden. Production and emission of N 2 O depend on the water content in soil, available nitrogen and carbon, pH, temperature, diffusion rate and gas exchange with the atmosphere. Different management options affect N 2 O emission, directly and indirectly, by affecting the nitrogen content in soil and the gas exchange with the atmosphere. The N 2 O emission rates varies depending on cultivated crop, fertilisation management, such as timing, rate, type and combinations of different types as well as with different soil tillage, drainage and irrigation techniques. Management options that aim at reducing N 2 O emission should first of all be to create optimal growing conditions for the crop. The only way to reduce nitrogen losses from arable land is by an efficient use of applied nitrogen. It is possible to decrease N 2 O emission by adjusting management options, such as fertilisation and irrigation, to actual crop and soil type, timing of soil tillage and, when using <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> adjusting the groundwater level to for the season optimal levels. In general, there is a lack of knowledge of how different cropping systems affect N 2 O emission and more research is needed on the relation between N 2 O emission and harvest. It is as yet not possible to estimate the effects of <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> on direct and indirect N 2 O emission, due to lack of knowledge of the capacity of the soil to store, transport and reduce produced N 2 O. Results from previous research show that <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> can reduce nutrient leaching. The reduction of nitrogen loads can be large if <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> is introduced on suitable land of the coastal areas of Southern Sweden. With less nitrogen leaching it is possible to reduce nitrogen fertilisation rates and thereby reduce direct and indirect N 2 O emission. In this study, the effects of <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> have been calculated only on indirect N 2 O emissions due to lack of measured data. The background emissions are assumed to redouble. Estimated increase in indirect N 2 O emission, if <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> is to be introduced, represents a value of 1 % of total N 2 O emission in Sweden per year...|$|E
