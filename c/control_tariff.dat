40|$|Although theory {{suggests}} that the real exchange rate should depreciate after a credible trade liberalization but could appreciate temporarily with a noncredible one, little empirical evidence exists. Unlike existing studies that use either indirect tests or unreliable openness measures, this paper uses an event study based on carefully documented trade liberalization in 45 countries. The result shows that real exchange rates depreciate after countries open their economies to trade. In countries with multiple liberalization episodes, however, real exchange rates appreciate during early episodes, suggesting that partial or noncredible trade liberalizations are associated with real appreciation.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the policy reform on {{economic}} performance {{has been one of}} the stifling issues in development economics in the recent years. Since the middle 1970 s, there has been considerable progress in the trade reform in the most developing countries, turning from an import substitution strategy to export-oriented approach. Pakistan also follows export-oriented policies. Pakistan’s trade pattern and trade policy have been moving towards fewer and fewer <b>controls,</b> <b>tariffs</b> rates have come tumbling down. Export-led-growth hypothesis (ELG) suggests that due to positive correlation between export and growth, therefore, export-oriented policies contribute to economic growth. Thus, international trade and development theory suggests that export growth contributes positively to economic growth. On the basis of this framework, most empirical work on the effects of export promoting strategy followed in developing countries evaluated openness with trade. Empirical research about the effect of this liberalisation process has treated export as principal channel for growth. The relationship with exports and growth, grounded in endogenous growth theory, has been tested for Pakistan. ...|$|R

According to our results, a 10 percent increase from the average residential price in Latin America is likely to reduce unmet demand by approximately 4. 1 percent. Finally, we find that privatization is negatively related to unmet demand. In particular, privatization reduces unmet demand by approximately 28 percent.

40|$|Roughly 16, 000 buses {{serve the}} 16 million {{inhabitants}} of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region; 12, 000 of them serve the Sao Paulo municipality itself, where 8. 5 million people live. Congestion is heavy at peak travel times, and traffic signal timing logic favors the flow of automobiles. Bus operations are also hampered by obsolete ticket collection systems and by poor access for bus passengers, which lengthens boarding and aligthing times. Average bus speed is about 13 kilometers per hour, headways vary greatly, and service is unreliable. But conditions are expected to improve soon as the private sector becomes involved in trunk-line bus corridors. Tender documents for ten bus corridors (one state andnine municipal) have recently been issued, defining rules for private concerns to bid for implementing and operating trunk line services. All costs to implement each service, including improvements in street systems and facilities such as transfer terminals, are to be born by the winning firm. Ten bids have now been awarded and contracts signed. This pioneer project demonstrates that private companies {{are ready to go}} deeper into public transport than they have gone before. Where the investment in busway infrastructure is to be repaid in installments to the private company which is awarded the concession, the use of multilateral agency guarantees (such as the recently approved World Bank guarantees) will probably entice private entrepreneurs. Regulatory and controlling power remain in the government hands. The government will <b>control</b> <b>tariffs,</b> preventing undue increases harmful to low-income users, and monitoring the level of service offered against the pre-agreed targets. Supervision must be very objective, however, and users must be actively involved to gauge the quality of service offered by concessionaires.
