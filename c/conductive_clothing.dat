5000|$|Properly {{designed}} <b>conductive</b> <b>clothing</b> {{can also}} form a protective Faraday cage. Some electrical linemen wear Faraday suits, which {{allow them to}} work on live, high-voltage power lines without risk of electrocution. The suit prevents electric current from flowing through the body, and has no theoretical voltage limit. Linemen have successfully worked even the highest voltage (Kazakhstan's Ekibastuz-Kokshetau line 1150 kV) lines safely.|$|E
5000|$|The {{central unit}} of the scoring system is {{commonly}} known as [...] "the box". In the simplest version both fencers' weapons are connected to the box via long retractable cables. The box normally carries a set of lights to signal when a touch has been made. (Larger peripheral lights are also often used.) In foil and sabre, because of the need to distinguish on-target hits from off-target ones, special <b>conductive</b> <b>clothing</b> and wires must be worn. This includes a lam√©, (a jacket of conducting cloth) for both weapons, a body cord to connect the weapon to the system, a reel of retractable cable that connects to the scoring box {{and in the case of}} sabre, a conducting mask and cuff (manchette) as the head and arms are valid target areas.|$|E
5000|$|High voltage {{transmission}} lines {{can be worked}} live with proper setups. The lineman must be isolated from the ground. The lineman wears special <b>conductive</b> <b>clothing</b> that {{is connected to the}} live power line, at which point the line and the lineman are at the same potential, allowing the lineman to handle the wire. The lineman may still be electrocuted if he completes an electrical circuit, for example by handling both ends of a broken conductor. Such work is often done by helicopter by specially trained linemen. [...] Isolated line work is only used for transmission-level voltages and sometimes for the higher distribution voltages. Live wire work is common on low voltage distribution systems within the UK and Australia as all linesmen are trained to work 'live'. Live wire work on high voltage distribution systems within the UK and Australia is carried out by specialist teams.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} developed non-hazardous {{methods for}} coating wool with conductive polymers for thermal and anti-static <b>clothing.</b> <b>Conductive</b> polymers are black in colour, thus {{the synthesis of}} new conductive polymers was required to produce coloured or fluorescent conductive textile. Cross-linked conductive polymers were also synthesised to increase their durability...|$|R
