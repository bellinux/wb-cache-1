40|$|Abstract: Forestry in the Cerrado Biome {{have the}} {{potential}} to act as carbon sink and storage and can be used as climate change mitigation option through <b>compensatory</b> <b>planting.</b> The Cerrado occupies about 23 % of the national territory, presenting varied physiognomies. The Cerrado sensu stricto (herbaceous layer with different densities of tree and shrubs) is the predominant physiognomic type with total extent of about 41. 8 million hectares. The Cerrado biome may play a significant role on global carbon balance due to carbon storage and fixation. However, vast areas of Cerrado have been degraded as a result of extensive and frequent fire mainly related with cattle ranching. Planted forests in Cerrado are predominant comprised of eucalyptus, which are generally established on degraded pasture. Fast growing Eucalyptus boosts absorption of carbon dioxide from the air and therefore Eucalyptus forestry is considered as a greenhouse gas mitigation option. This study presents a preliminary evaluation of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from planted forests in the Cerrado of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. 201...|$|E

Electrical power is produced when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) connected to an electrical power generator. Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. Since solar fields feed their heat energy into a conventional generation unit with a steam turbine, they can be combined without any problem with fossil fuel hybrid power plants. This hybridization secures energy supply also in unfavourable weather and at night without the need of accelerating costly <b>compensatory</b> <b>plants.</b> A technical challenge is the cooling which is necessary for every heating power system. Dii is therefore reliant either on an adequate water supply, coastal facilities or improved cooling technology.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} grazing on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, {{particularly}} in the tropics, are still poorly understood. Plant compensation to grazing, whereby plants maintain leaf area (C input capacity) despite consumption (C removal) by grazers, has been demonstrated in tropical grasslands but its influence on SOC is largely unexplored. Here, the effect of grazing on plant leaf area index (LAI) was measured in a field experiment in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. LAI changed little for grazing intensities up to 70 %. The response curve of LAI versus grazing intensity was used in a mass balance model, called SNAP, of SOC dynamics based on previous data from the Serengeti. The model predicted SOC to increase at intermediate grazing intensity, but then to decline rapidly at the highest grazing intensities. The SNAP model predictions were compared with observed SOC stocks in the 24 grazed plots of a 10 -year grazing exclosure experiment at eight sites across the park that varied in mean annual rainfall, soil texture, grazing intensity and plant lignin and cellulose. The model predicted current SOC stocks very well (R 2 > 0. 75), and suggests that <b>compensatory</b> <b>plant</b> responses to grazing are an important means of how herbivores might maintain or increase SOC in tropical grasslands...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{vertebrate}} herbivores exploitatively compete for the same food plant may depend {{on the level of}} <b>compensatory</b> <b>plant</b> growth. Such compensation is higher when there is reduced density-dependent competition in plants after herbivore damage. Whether there is relief from competition may largely be determined by the life-history stage of plants under herbivory. Such stage-specific compensation may apply to seasonal herbivory on the clonal aquatic plant sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.). It winters in sediments of shallow lakes as tubers that are foraged upon by Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s Swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell), whereas aboveground biomass in summer is mostly consumed by ducks, coots, and Mute Swans. Here, tuber predation may be compensated due to diminished negative density dependence in the next growth season. However, we expected lower compensation to summer herbivory by waterfowl and fish as density of aboveground biomass in summer is closely related to photosynthetic carbon fixation. In a factorial exclosure study we simultaneously investigated (1) the effect of summer herbivory on aboveground biomass and autumn tuber biomass and (2) the effect of tuber predation in autumn on aboveground biomass and tuber biomass a year later. Summer herbivory strongly influenced belowground tuber biomass in autumn, limiting food availability to Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s Swans. In contrast, tuber predation in autumn by Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s Swans had a limited and variable effect on P. pectinatus biomass in the following growth season. Whereas relief from negative density dependence largely eliminates effects of belowground herbivory by swans, aboveground herbivory in summer limits both above- and belowground plant biomass. Hence, there was an asymmetry in exploitative competition, with herbivores in summer reducing food availability for belowground herbivores in autumn, but not the other way around. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{tolerance}} to insect pests has been indicated to be a unique category of resistance, however, very little {{information is available}} on the mechanism of tolerance against insect pests. Tolerance is distinctive in terms of the plant’s ability to withstand or recover from herbivore injury through growth and compensatory physiological processes. Because plant tolerance involves <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> characteristics, the <b>plant</b> is able to harbor large numbers of herbivores without interfering with the insect pest’s physiology or behavior. Some studies have observed that tolerant plants can compensate photosynthetically by avoiding feedback inhibition and impaired electron flow through photosystem II (PSII) that occurs as a result of insect feeding. Similarly, the up-regulation of peroxidases and other oxidative enzymes during insect feeding, in conjunction with elevated levels of phytohormones can {{play an important role in}} providing plant {{tolerance to}} insect pests. Hemipteran insects comprise some of the most economically important plant pests (e. g., aphids, whiteflies), due to their ability to achieve high population growth and its potential to transmit plant viruses.

While plant resistance mechanisms have received much attention, <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> growth as a type of plant tolerance mechanisms has been less studied. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to evaluate compensatory growth for trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings under varying intensities and frequencies of simulated defoliation, with or without nutrient enriched media. For the purpose of this study, changes in biomass production and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations (NSC) of roots and leaves were considered compensatory responses. All defoliated seedlings showed biomass accumulation under low defoliation intensity and frequency, regardless of resource availability; however, as defoliation intensity and frequency increased, compensatory growth of seedlings was altered depending on resource availability. Seedlings in a resource-rich environment showed complete compensation, in contrast responses ranged from undercompensation to complete compensation in a resource-limited environment. Furthermore, at the highest defoliation intensity and frequency, NSC concentrations in leaves and roots were similar between defoliated and non-defoliated seedlings in a resource-rich environment; in contrast, defoliated seedlings with limited resources sustained the most biomass loss, had lower amounts of stored NSC. Using these results, we developed a new predictive framework incorporating the interactions between frequency and intensity of defoliation and resource availability as modulators of <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> responses...|$|R

Plant behavior against herbivores differs between species and depends on resource availability, thus making general predictions related to <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> regrowth difficult. To understand how soil nutrients determine {{the degree of}} compensatory regrowth for different plant species, we selected saplings of three Ficus species and treated with herbivore insects and artificial injury in both glasshouse conditions and in the field at two soil nutrient levels. Compensatory regrowth was calculated by biomass, relative growth rate and photosynthetic characteristics. A similar pattern was found in both the glasshouse and {{in the field for}} species F. hispida, where overcompensatory regrowth was triggered only under fertile conditions, and full compensatory regrowth occurred under infertile conditions. For F. auriculata, overcompensatory regrowth was stimulated only under infertile conditions and full compensatory regrowth occurred under fertile conditions. Ficus racemosa displayed full compensatory regrowth in both soil nutrient levels, but without overcompensatory regrowth following any of the treatments. The three Ficus species differed in biomass allocation following herbivore damage and artificial injury. The root/ shoot ratio of F. hispida decreased largely following herbivore damage and artificial injury, while the root/shoot ratio for F. auriculata increased against damage treatments.

40|$|Agricultural food {{production}} in arid and semi-arid regions faces {{the challenge to}} ensure high yields with limited supply of water. This raises the question to which extent irrigation supply can be reduced without detriment to yield. Our study focuses on the yield-water uptake relationship for maize in the moderate water stress range {{in order to determine}} the onset of stress-induced dry-matter and yield losses. <b>Compensatory</b> <b>plant</b> responses under moderate stress levels are discussed in relation to seasonal climatic conditions. Summer-sown and spring-sown maize were irrigated with a decreasing amount of water in a field experiment in Pakistan. Water supply ranged from 100 % water required to maintain soil at field capacity (FC) to 40 % of FC. The average dry-matter and yield levels were slightly higher for summer-sown (15. 0 Mgha- 1) compared to spring-sown maize (13. 1 Mgha- 1). The onset of significant dry-matter and yield reduction started at the least irrigation treatment in both seasons. The amount of water required to avoid production losses was 272 mm in the summer-sown maize during the autumn growing season, and 407 mm for the spring-sown maize in the summer season, when the evaporative demand of the atmosphere was + 27 % higher. Water use efficiency (WUEET), normalized by vapour pressure deficit, of the summer-sown maize which was 10. 0 kgkPam- 3, was + 15 % higher compared to the spring-sown crop; while the irrigation water productivity (2. 9 kgm- 3) was + 11 % more. WUEET increased over the whole range of applied water deficits for summer-sown maize, while the spring-sown crop showed a decreasing WUEET in the less irrigated treatment. Due to the higher efficiency in summer-sown maize, the potential in irrigation reduction without production losses (129 mm) was higher compared to the spring-sown maize (57 mm). Our results showed that in Pakistan water saving irrigation practices can be applied without yield loss mainly during the cooler growing season when the crop can efficiently compensate a lower total water uptake by increased use efficiency. For spring-sown maize the increasing evaporative demand of the atmosphere towards summer implies a higher risk of yield losses and narrows the range to exploit higher irrigation water productivity under moderate water deficit conditions.

40|$|Pre-release {{evaluation}} of the efficacy of biological control agents is often not possible {{in the case of}} many invasive species targeted for biocontrol. In such circumstances simulating herbivory could yield significant insights into plant response to damage, thereby improving the efficiency of agent prioritisation, increasing the chances of regulating the performance of invasive plants through herbivory and minimising potential risks posed by release of multiple herbivores. We adopted this approach to understand the weaknesses herbivores could exploit, to manage the invasive liana, Macfadyena unguis-cati. We simulated herbivory by damaging the leaves, stem, root and tuber of the plant, in isolation and in combination. We also applied these treatments at multiple frequencies. Plant response in terms of biomass allocation showed that at least two severe defoliation treatments were required to diminish this liana's climbing habit and reduce its allocation to belowground tuber reserves. Belowground damage appears to have negligible effect on the plant's biomass production and tuber damage appears to trigger a <b>compensatory</b> response. <b>Plant</b> response to combinations of different types of damage did not differ significantly to that from leaf damage.

40|$|Background/Question/Methods Herbivory is {{expected}} to have important effects on grassland plant community structure and biomass. However, the effects of herbivores may be mitigated by plant resource availability, which can influence <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> response and <b>plant</b> defense, and may vary among herbivore taxonomic groups. Although a number of experiments have tested the relative importance and interactive effects of herbivory and plant resource availability in limiting plant biomass, little is known about how different herbivore taxonomic groups contribute to these patterns particularly in terrestrial systems. We tested for the additive or interactive effects of insect and non-bovine mammalian herbivores on plant community structure and biomass in a restored grassland in south-central Kansas. The experiment consisted of ninety-six, 3. 5 x 4 m plots. Mammal access was restricted by fencing while insect abundance was reduced by applying a pyrethroid-based insecticide every two weeks during the growing season. These treatments were crossed with either ambient soil fertility or fertilizer addition treatments. We quantified plant community structure in the central 3 x 3. 5 m area of each plot. Light penetration through the plant canopy was utilized as a non-destructive measure of plant biomass. Results/Conclusions After four growing seasons, we found herbivore access influenced light penetration through the plant canopy (a surrogate for total plant biomass) and these effects varied depending on herbivore taxonomic group and plant resource availability. Under ambient soil nutrients, the combination of insect and mammal herbivory decreased plant biomass and these herbivores' effects combined additively. However, under increased soil fertility, the specific combinations of the different herbivore groups resulted in higher, lower, or equal plant biomass compared to communities with ambient soil fertility. Additionally, the different herbivore groups altered plant species composition and abundance, but these changes were much smaller in ambient than fertilized communities even when adjusted for differences in biomass. These results suggest that different herbivore taxonomic groups can have unique effects on plant biomass and community structure and these impacts vary with soil fertility...|$|R

40|$|Severe damage often provokes <b>compensatory</b> resprouting of <b>plants,</b> which {{commonly}} modify plant morphological and phenological traits. Rapid {{plant growth}} {{often results in}} poorly defended nutrient-rich foliage, which is more susceptible to foliar-chewing herbivores. It is less known how other guilds of arthropods are affected by plant regrowth. We tested the hypotheses that clipping-induced resprouting and nutrient availability, separately and in combination, would (1) influence plant traits, (2) benefit chewing herbivores, sap-suckers, gaiters, and pre-dispersal seed predators, and (3) cascade up to the third trophic level by positively affecting herbivores. Resprouted plants were morphologically and phenologically different from undamaged plants; as a result, seed predation, infestation rate, richness, and diversity of seed predators increased, and species composition was altered. Leaf consumption by chewing herbivores was four times higher on resprouted plants. The number of galls decreased, whereas the abundance of sap-sucking and leaf-chewing insects was not affected. The incidence of predators and parasitoids was also higher on resprouted plants and on plants with nutrients added, but the increase was less pronounced compared to the herbivores they feed on. Thus, the effects of resprouting, contingent on nutrient availability, can propagate simultaneously through two independent tri-trophic level pathways...|$|R

Growth factors {{found in}} animal saliva are probably key factors underlying <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> responses to herbivory. However, {{there is still}} a lack of knowledge about how animal saliva interacts with herbivory intensities and how saliva can mobilize photosynthate reserves in damaged plants. Methodology/Principal Findings: The study examined compensatory responses to herbivory and sheep saliva addition for the grass species Leymus chinensis in three experiments over three years. The first two experiments were conducted in a factorial design with clipping (four levels in 2006 and five in 2007) and two saliva treatment levels. The third experiment examined the mobilization and allocation of stored carbohydrates following clipping and saliva addition treatments. Animal saliva significantly increased tiller number, number of buds, and biomass, however, there was no effect on height. Furthermore, saliva effects were dependent on herbivory intensities, associated with meristem distribution within perennial grass. Animal saliva was found to accelerate hydrolyzation of fructans and accumulation of glucose and fructose. Conclusions/Significance: The results demonstrated a link between saliva and the mobilization of carbohydrates following herbivory, which is an important advance in our understanding of the evolution of plant responses to herbivory.

40|$|The {{presence}} of melatonin in plants is universal. Evidence has confirmed {{that a major}} portion of the melatonin is synthesized by plants themselves even though a homologue of the classic arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) has not been identified as yet in plants. Thus, the serotonin N-acetylating enzyme in plants may differ greatly from the animal AANAT with regard to sequence and structure. This would imply multiple evolutionary origins of enzymes with these catalytic properties. A primary function of melatonin in plants is to serve as the first line of defence against internal and environmental oxidative stressors. The much higher melatonin levels in plants compared with those found in animals are thought to be a <b>compensatory</b> response by <b>plants</b> which lack means of mobility, unlike animals, as a means of coping with harsh environments. Importantly, remarkably high melatonin concentrations have been measured in popular beverages (coffee, tea, wine, and beer) and crops (corn, rice, wheat, barley, and oats). Billions of people worldwide consume these products daily. The beneficial effects of melatonin on human health derived from the consumption of these products must be considered. Evidence also indicates that melatonin has an ability to increase the production of crops.

40|$|Plant {{communities}} are disturbed by several stressors {{and they are}} expected to be further impacted by increasing anthropogenic stress. The consequences of these stressors will depend, in part, upon the ability of plants to compensate for herbivory. Previous studies found that herbivore impacts on plants can vary from negative to positive because of environmental control of <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> responses, a. k. a. the Compensatory Continuum Hypothesis. While these influential studies enhanced our appreciation of the dynamic nature of plant-herbivore interactions, they largely focused on the impact of resource limitation. This bias limits our ability to predict how other environmental factors will shape the impact of herbivory. We examined the role of salinity stress on herbivory of salt marsh cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, by an herbivore previously hypothesized to influence the success of restoration projects (the scale insect, Haliaspis spartinae). Using a combination of field and mesocosm manipulations of scales and salinity, we measured how these factors affected Spartina growth and timing of senescence. In mesocosm studies, Spartina overcompensated for herbivory by growing taller shoots at low salinities but the impact of scales on plants switched from positive to neutral with increasing salinity stress. In field studies of intermediate salinities, scales reduced Spartina growth and increased the rate of senescence. Experimental salinity additions at this field site returned the impact of scales to neutral. Because salinity decreased scale densities, the switch in impact of scales on Spartina with increasing salinity was not simply a linear function of scale abundance. Thus, th...|$|R

Here we studied how the model legume Medicago truncatula, inoculated or not with a mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis, responded to a gradient of light intensities applied over different periods of time, in terms of growth, phosphorus nutrition and the levels of root colonization by the mycorrhizal fungus. Short-term (6 d) shading, depending on its intensity, resulted in a rapid decline of phosphorus uptake to the shoots of mycorrhizal plants and simultaneous accumulation of phosphorus in the roots (most likely in the fungal tissues), as compared to the non-mycorrhizal controls. There was, however, no significant change in the levels of mycorrhizal colonization of roots due to short-term shading. Long-term (38 d) shading, depending on its intensity, provoked a multitude of <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> mechanisms, which were further boosted by the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Mycorrhizal growth- and phosphorus uptake benefits, however, vanished at 10 % of the full light intensity applied over a long-term. Levels of root colonization by the mycorrhizal fungus were significantly reduced by long-term shading. Our results indicate that even short periods of shade could have important consequences for the functioning of mycorrhizal symbiosis in terms of phosphorus transfer between the fungus and the plants, without any apparent changes in root colonization parameters or mycorrhizal growth response, and call for more focused research on temporal dynamics of mycorrhizal functioning under changing environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Loss in seed {{yield and}} {{therefore}} decrease in plant fitness due to simultaneous attacks by multiple herbivores {{is not necessarily}} additive, as demonstrated in evolutionary studies on wild plants. However, {{it is not clear}} how this transfers to crop plants that grow in very different conditions compared to wild plants. Nevertheless, loss in crop seed yield caused by any single pest is most often studied in isolation although crop plants are attacked by many pests that can cause substantial yield losses. This is especially important for crops able to compensate and even overcompensate for the damage. We investigated the interactive impacts on crop yield of four insect pests attacking different plant parts at different times during the cropping season. In 15 oilseed rape fields in Sweden, we estimated the damage caused by seed and stem weevils, pollen beetles, and pod midges. Pest pressure varied drastically among fields with very low correlation among pests, allowing us to explore interactive impacts on yield from attacks by multiple species. The plant damage caused by each pest species individually had, as expected, either no, or a negative impact on seed yield and the strongest negative effect was caused by pollen beetles. However, seed yield increased when plant damage caused by both seed and stem weevils was high, presumably due to the joint <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> reaction to insect attack leading to overcompensation. Hence, attacks by several pests can change the impact on yield of individual pest species. Economic thresholds based on single species, on which pest management decisions currently rely, may therefore result in economically suboptimal choices being made and unnecessary excessive use of insecticides...|$|R

The emission of NH 3 increased with increasing leaf temperatures in both wild-type and mutant plants, but the increase was much more pronounced in the mutants. Similar results were found when the light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux density) was increased. Compensation points for NH 3 were estimated by exposing intact shoots to 10 nmol NH 3 mol- 1 air under conditions with increasing temperatures until the plants started to emit NH 3. Referenced to 25 [deg]C, the compensation points were 5. 0 nmol mol- 1 for wild-type plants, 8. 3 nmol mol- 1 for 47 % GS mutants, and 11. 8 nmol mol- 1 for 66 % GS mutants.

Besides, it is also an important aspect for human health. In view of this, we attempted to increase the iron content in banana cultivar Rasthali using MusaFer 1 as a candidate gene. Initially, the expression of all five genes of the MusaFer family (MusaFer 1 - 5) was quantified under iron-excess and -deficient conditions. The supplementation of 250 and 350 μM iron enhanced expression of all MusaFer genes; however, MusaFer 1 was increased maximally by 2 - and 4 - fold in leaves and roots respectively. Under iron deficient condition, all five MusaFer genes were downregulated, indicating their iron dependent regulation. In MusaFer 1 overexpressing lines, iron content was increased by 2 - and 3 -fold in leaves and roots respectively, as compared with that of untransformed lines. The increased iron was mainly localized in the epidermal regions of petiole. The analysis of MusaFer 1 promoter indicated that it might control the expression of iron metabolism related genes and also other genes of MusaFer family. MusaFer 1 overexpression led to downregulated expression of MusaFer 3, MusaFer 4 and MusaFer 5 in transgenic leaves which might be associated with the <b>plant's</b> <b>compensatory</b> mechanism in response to iron flux. Other iron metabolism genes like Ferric reductase (FRO), transporters (IRT, VIT and YSL) and chelators (NAS, DMAS and NAAT) were also differentially expressed in transgenic leaf and root, suggesting the multifaceted impact of MusaFer 1 towards iron uptake and organ distribution. Additionally, MusaFer 1 overexpression increased plant tolerance against methyl viologen and excess iron which was quantified in terms of photosynthetic efficiency and malondialdehyde content.

Field experiments were conducted in 2003 and 2004 at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in Burleson County, Texas to assess the effects of plant density on lint yield and fiber quality. Experimental design was a spit-plot design with four replications of three cultivars (SG 215 BG/RR, DP 555 BG/RR, ST 4892 BG/RR) in densities ranging from 74 to 222 thousand plants hectare- 1.

In the dry bean experiment, yield loss occurred at a rate 6. 00 ± 1. 29 g/HIE while the rates of loss in the three soybean experiments were 4. 39 ± 0. 96 g/HIE, 3. 70 ± 1. 21 g/HIE and 2. 12 ± 0. 71 g/HIE. These three slopes were not statistically different (P > 0. 05) and the pooled estimate of the rate of yield loss was 3. 21 ± 0. 55 g/HIE. The first soybean experiment also showed a split-line form of damage curve with a rate of yield loss of 26. 27 ± 2. 92 g/HIE beyond 8. 0 HIE and a rapid decline to zero yield. In dry bean, H. armigera feeding reduced total and undamaged pod numbers by 4. 10 ± 1. 18 pods/HIE and 12. 88 ± 1. 57 pods/HIE respectively, while undamaged seed numbers were reduced by 35. 64 ± 7. 25 seeds/HIE. In soybean, total pod numbers were not affected by H. armigera infestation (out to 8. 23 HIE in Experiment 1) but seed numbers (in Experiments 1 and 2) and the number of seeds/pod (in all experiments) were adversely affected. Seed size increased with increases in H. armigera density in two of the three soybean experiments, indicating <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> responses to H. armigera feeding. Analysis of canopy pod profiles indicated that loss of pods occurred from the top of the plant downwards, but with an increase in pod numbers close to the ground at higher pest densities as the plant attempted to compensate for damage. Based on these results, the economic injury levels for H. armigera on dry bean and soybean are approximately 0. 74 HIE and 2. 31 HIE/m 2, respectively (0. 67 and 2. 1 HIE/row-m for 91 cm rows) ...|$|R
40|$|Savannas are characterised by a {{continuous}} grass layer with scattered trees at varying densities. This vegetation structure {{is determined by}} several interacting factors, including fire, herbivory, resource competition and atmospheric CO 2 concentration. The preservation of savanna biomes is important and a shift towards a woody biome threatens savanna globally. Bush encroachment which describes the shift towards domination of savannas by C 3 woody plants, is especially acute in southern Africa. In semi-arid rangelands, encroachment progresses to dense thickets dominated by thorny and unpalatable bushes and trees. There is evidence that bush encroachment is driven by a reduction in fire and browsing events {{as well as their}} interaction. Despite browsing having strong effects on African savannas its isolated role in maintaining tree-grass coexistence has not received as much attention as the role of fire. Therefore the overall aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of browsing on seedlings of a commonly encroaching species, Vachellia karroo. Browsing was hypothesized to be a demographic release bottleneck for bush encroachment in a semiarid (MAP ~ 550 mm) savanna in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, where fire has been historically rare. In a single study I explored the fate of V. karroo seedlings (less than a year old) following browsing in sub canopy and inter canopy microhabitats. Additionally, I explored how the fate of a seedling changed under high and low tree cover. Firstly, I investigated the type, intensity and frequency of herbivory, from both small and large herbivores, which seedlings were subjected to. Results revealed that browsing was severe and frequent with the majority of seedlings browsed more than twice over a 12 month period. Large browsers such as kudu and impala caused high seedling mortality (46 %) while smaller browsers such as invertebrates were more effective at suppressing growth. Microhabitat had little impact on seedling survival, but significantly influenced <b>plant</b> <b>compensatory</b> growth. Reduced seedling growth following browsing was observed in the sub-canopy in comparison to seedling growth in full sunlight in the intercanopy, suggesting V. karroo may be shade intolerant. Secondly, the effect of tree cover on browsed seedlings was determined by quantifying browsing frequency and intensity at high and low tree cover. No differences in browsing intensity and frequency were observed between high and low tree cover. However, high tree cover due to bush encroachment limited seedling above ground growth. The aim of the second study was to investigate how V. karroo survival and growth were influenced by its age and size following simulated browsing. I explored this aim through field and greenhouse experiments. I was particularly interested in testing how plant sensitivity to varying defoliation intensities of repeated browsing varied with plant age (known ages of 6, 12, 16 and 30 weeks). There were large differences in mortality between the different age groups. Furthermore, age interacted with repeated browsing and negatively influenced seedling survival and regrowth. Older seedlings (16 and 30 week old) had greater survival and higher browsing frequencies resulted in greater mortality and reduced growth. The threshold age after which seedlings become more tolerant to herbivory occurs at an age of 28 weeks. Seedlings less than six weeks old experiencing intense (100 % defoliation) browsing had a very low probability (33 %) of survival following just a single defoliation. Interestingly, all 16 week old seedlings regrew most of their foliage following a moderate (50 %) defoliation with some plants overcompensating for leaf loss. The field study revealed two distinct demographic stages based on age and size (seedlings 9 mm in stem basal diameter (SBD)). Browsing had a strong negative effect on seedlings, resulting in reduced investment in leaf biomass. These findings suggest plant size and age can be used as robust predictors of a plants vulnerability to browsing. An increase in tree cover requires successful transitions of seedlings to saplings (also known as release). The results of this study suggest that in semi-arid savannas, browsing can impact tree cover through imposing a release bottleneck for tree seedlings and to lesser extent saplings. By limiting tree growth plants are kept in a disturbance trap and will therefore be exposed to not only browsers but fire. These findings also have important implications for tree-grass coexistence dynamics, suggesting that specific size and browsing thresholds should be considered in savanna management...|$|R
