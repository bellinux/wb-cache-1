40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to the characterisation of the general properties, differences, and commonalities of the short period <b>comet</b> <b>family</b> and, more in particular, to characterise the dust environment of three poorly studied members of the family: 32 P/Comas Solá, 56 P/Slaughter-Burnham, and 78 P/Gehrels 2. Methods. Multicolour broad-band photometry of the comets observed around their perihelion in October 2004 from the Loiano telescope has been used to characterise their dust coma morphology and properties and to model the dust production rate Results. 32 P/Comas Solá shows no remarkable dust coma features, while both 56 P/Slaughter-Burnham and 78 P/Gehrels 2 show departures from regular brightness distribution, with a north/south asymmetry and axysimmetric lobes, respectively, probably indicating emission features on the nucleus surface. For comet 78 P, it has been possible to compute a 1 -D surface brightness profile with slope m = − 1. 54 ± 0. 05. In an aperture of radius ρ = 7. 2 × 103 km, the measured Afρ is 127 ± 10 cm, 102 ± 8 cm (weighted average between two observing nights) and 846 ± 55 cm for comets 32 P, 56 P and 78 P, respectively. All comets have a redder dust coma than the Sun. Comets 32 P (dust production rate Qd from 2 to 46 kg/s) and 56 P (Qd from 1 to 24 kg/s) are quite standard dust emitters among the short-period <b>comet</b> <b>family,</b> while comet 78 P (Qd from 14 to 345 kg/s) is more active than the average at that heliocentric distance...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the plausibility of a cometary {{source of the}} unusual transits observed in the KIC 8462852 light curve. A single comet of similar size to those {{in our solar system}} produces a transit depth of the order of 10 ^- 3 lasting less than a day which is much smaller and shorter than the largest dip observed (∼ 20 % for ∼ 3 days), but a large, closely traveling cluster of comets can fit the observed depths and durations. We find that a series of large comet swarms, with all but one on the same orbit, provides a good fit for the KIC 8462852 data during Quarters 16 and 17, but does not explain the large dip observed during Quarter 8. However, the transit dips only loosely constrain the orbits and can be fit by swarms with periastrons differing by a factor of 10. To reach a transit depth of ∼ 0. 2, the comets need to be in a close group of ∼ 30, if they are ∼ 100 km in radius or in a group of ∼ 300 if they are ∼ 10 km in radius. The total number of comets required to fit all of the dips is ∼ 70 ∼ 100 km or ∼ 700 ∼ 10 km comets. A single <b>comet</b> <b>family</b> from a tidally disrupted Ceres-sized progenitor or the start of a Late Heavy Bombardment period explains the last ∼ 60 days of the unusual KIC 8462852 light curve.

40|$|International audienceExperiments of {{sublimation}} of {{pure water}} ice {{have been performed}} in the temperature range − 105 °C to − 30 °C and atmospheric partial pressures ranging from 10 − 6 to 10 − 1 mb. Sampling of both vapour and residual ice fractions has been performed {{with the use of}} a vacuum line designed for the extraction and purification of gases before the measurement of their D/H ratios. Sublimation was responsible for sizable isotopic fractionation factors in the range 0. 969 – 1. 123 for temperatures lying between − 105 °C and − 30 °C. The fractionation factor exhibits a cross-over at temperatures around − 50 °C with the water vapour fraction being D-depleted relative to the residual ice fraction at T < − 50 °C (αice-vapour = 0. 969 – 0. 995). This cross-over has implications for the understanding of the atmospheric water cycle of some terrestrial planets such as the Earth or Mars.

40|$|Comet P/ 2010 A 2 LINEAR {{is a good}} {{candidate}} for membership with the Main Belt <b>Comet</b> <b>family.</b> It was observed with several telescopes (ESO NTT, La Silla; Gemini North, Mauna Kea; UH 2. 2 m, Mauna Kea) from 14 Jan. until 19 Feb. 2010 in order to characterize and monitor it and its very unusual dust tail, which appears almost fully detached from the nucleus; the head of the tail includes two narrow arcs forming a cross. The immediate surroundings of the nucleus were found dust-free, which allowed an estimate of the nucleus radius of 80 - 90 m. A model of the thermal evolution indicates that such a small nucleus could not maintain any ice content {{for more than a few}} million years on its current orbit, ruling out ice sublimation dust ejection mechanism. Rotational spin-up and electrostatic dust levitations were also rejected, leaving an impact with a smaller body as the favoured hypothesis, and ruling out the cometary nature of the object. The impact is further supported by the analysis of the tail structure. Finston-Probstein dynamical dust modelling indicates the tail was produced by a single burst of dust emission. More advanced models, independently indicate that this burst populated a hollow cone with a half-opening angle alpha~ 40 degr and with an ejection velocity v_max ~ 0. 2 m/s, where the small dust grains fill the observed tail, while the arcs are foreshortened sections of the burst cone. The dust grains in the tail are measured to have radii between a= 1 - 20 mm, with a differential size distribution proportional to a^(- 3. 44 +/- 0. 08). The dust contained in the tail is estimated to at least 8 x 10 ^ 8 kg, which would form a sphere of 40 m radius. Analysing these results in the framework of crater physics, we conclude that a gravity-controlled crater would have grown up to ~ 100 m radius, i. e. comparable to the size of the body. The non-disruption of the body suggest this was an oblique impact. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures, in pres...|$|E
