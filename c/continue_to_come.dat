25|$|On February 11, 2009, {{charges against}} Chicago Police Department {{officers}} Tom Sherry and Carl Suchocki were dropped. A Cook County judge dismissed all criminal charges {{accusing them of}} robbery and home invasion after some evidence was proven to be false, and witnesses in the case against Sherry and Suchocki were unable to place the officers {{at the scene of}} the crime. Charges against Herrera and Finnigan, however, are still pending. As of September 25, 2009, seven former SOS officers have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the scandal. The investigation is ongoing as police officers <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> forward and cooperate with the state and federal investigation.|$|E

Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people. In the fourth edition of her memoirs, written in 1941, Lúcia said that {{on the occasion of}} their third visit to the Cova da Iria, on 13 July 1917, she asked the Lady to tell them who she was, and to perform a miracle so that everyone would believe. The Lady told her that they should <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the Cova each month until October, when the requested miracle would occur.|$|E

25|$|The Coachella Valley {{was popular}} among celebrities from Frank Sinatra to Dakota Fanning who came and <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to enjoy {{vacations}} and winter {{homes in the}} desert resort community. Also it became a major real estate destination in the 1980s and 1990s, no longer limited to senior citizens, winter residents and retirees. Families with young {{children and young adults}} became interested in Palm Springs and surrounding communities for lower cost housing and apartment rents. Palm Springs has become a world famous tourist attraction. As a tourist destination, the Coachella Valley can be considered a Southwest attraction like Las Vegas, Phoenix, or Santa Fe, or as a part of Southern California along with San Diego, Orange County, and Los Angeles. In a 2003 Condé Nast publication review, Palm Springs was ranked one of the top 10 global vacation destinations, and the smallest one in population.|$|E
25|$|The first Indian {{immigrants}} in British Columbia allegedly faced widespread racism {{from the local}} white Canadians. Race riots targeted these immigrants, {{as well as new}} Chinese immigrants. Most decided to return to India, while a few stayed behind. The Canadian government prevented these men from bringing their wives and children until 1919, another reason why many of them chose to leave. Quotas were established to prevent many Indians from moving to Canada in the early 20th century. These quotas allowed fewer than 100 people from India a year until 1957, when the number was increased to 300. In 1967, all quotas were scrapped. Immigration was then based on a point system, thus allowing many more Indians to enter. Since this open-door policy was adopted, Indians <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in large numbers, and roughly 25,000-30,000 arrive each year, which now makes Indians the second highest group immigrating to Canada each year, after the Chinese.|$|E
500|$|Relatively {{minor changes}} to the form and venue of an {{entertainment}} <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a music hall, a movie theatre, a multiplex, or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a tablet computer. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a theatre, auditorium, or stadium. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the Colosseum, [...] "dedicated AD80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," [...] and in it audiences [...] "enjoyed [...] "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows". Spectacles, competitions, races, and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.|$|E

50|$|Under the Assam Accord, {{a person}} who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> Assam from East Pakistan after 1951 and before 1971 was given {{citizenship}}. The Assam Accord stated in clause 6 that while giving citizenship to immigrants, constitutional protection {{will be given to}} original citizens of Assam. This part of the Accord (clause 6) was never implemented. If the “constitutional protection clause” had been implemented, a large number of illegal immigrants (who <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Assam even after 1971) would not have got voting rights. Instead, the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983 (IMDT Act) was enacted by the Parliament of India in 1983 by Indira Gandhi government to protect illegal immigrants who <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Assam even after 1971. This illegal Act was struck down by the Supreme Court of India in 2005.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{prominent}} {{victim of}} the changing market was the Poverty Row studio Eagle-Lion, which released its last films in 1951. By 1953, the old Monogram brand had disappeared, the company having adopted the identity of its higher-end subsidiary, Allied Artists. The following year, Allied released Hollywood's last two B series Westerns, starring Wayne Morris: The Desperado in June and Two Guns and a Badge in September. Non-series B Westerns would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{out for a few}} more years, but Republic Pictures, long associated with cheap sagebrush sagas, was out of the filmmaking business {{by the end of the}} decade. In other genres, Universal maintained B series featuring Abbott and Costello (through 1955), Francis the Talking Mule (through 1956), and Ma and Pa Kettle (through 1957). Allied Artists kept its Bomba, the Jungle Boy series going through 1955; Allied's Bowery Boys finished their run in 1958—the end of the longest feature series in movie history (48 films, altogether) and the last B series from one of Hollywood's Golden Age studios.|$|E
2500|$|The {{weak and}} sick are borne on litters, and are {{protected}} against {{the attacks of}} the Sadducees; they must be provided with food, for witnesses were bound to journey even on the Sabbath (1:9). Others went along to identify the unknown (2:1). In olden times bonfire-signals on the mountains announced to all as far as Babylon that the month had been sanctified. The custom of having witnesses and messengers was introduced after the Sadducees had attempted to practice deception (2:2, 2:3, 2:4). The large court called Bet Ya'azeḳ was the assembly-place for the witnesses (2:5); bountiful repasts awaited them, and dispensations from the Law were granted to them (2:6); the first pair of witnesses was questioned separately concerning {{the appearance of the}} moon, but all other witnesses were questioned at least cursorily. The Mishnah makes the point that all witnesses must be made to feel their testimony is valued to ensure witnesses <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to courts (2:6). Then the av bet din (head of the Court) called out to a large assembly, [...] "Sanctified!" [...] all the people cried out aloud after him (2:8). Rabban Gamliel II had representations of the moon which he showed to the witnesses. There once arose a dispute between him and Rabbi Yehoshua regarding the Tishri moon; the latter, in obedience to the nasi, came on foot to Jamnia on the day which he had calculated to be the Day of Atonement, and the two scholars made peace (iii.). There were various obstacles to the sanctification of the months, as when time was lacking for the ceremony, or when there were no witnesses present before the bet din. In the first case the following day became the new moon; in the second case the bet din alone performed the sanctification.|$|E

60|$|This {{unexpected}} {{influx of}} grain, &c., {{may be said}} to be the turning-point which secures the success of our expedition. Had we found no grain here we must have lost all the transport-animals, as these have already been on very short commons for some days. The supplies for the men too were running extremely short, and if Magdala holds out for a week our position would have been most unpleasant; now we are safe. We have abundant grain for the animals for another week, and we are told that supplies will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in in any quantities. Very large quantities of bread too have been purchased, and both officers and men have laid in a stock of fowls, eggs, &c. All anxiety is at an end.

Noticing that the child wished to respond, but was evidently troubled as to how to word her answer, she asked what the {{difficulty}} was.
