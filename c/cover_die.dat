500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The <b>cover</b> <b>die</b> {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The <b>cover</b> <b>die</b> is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|E

Coupled with solute concentration, a modified three-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) model was proposed.

The microstructure of the AZ 91 D alloy cylinder head <b>cover</b> <b>die</b> casting was simulated with the proposed models. The simulated results are in agreement with the experimental...|$|E

5000|$|The Plug comic {{was never}} a big hit, {{possibly}} because, at 9 pence, it was too expensive compared to other D.C. Thomson comics at the time, which were priced at around 5 pence.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} computer modeling {{work that}} was designed to help understand how the die casting die and machine contribute to parting plane separation during operation. Techniques developed in earlier research (8) were applied to complete a large computational experiment that systematically explored the relationship between the stiffness of the machine platens and key dimensional and structural variables (platen area <b>covered,</b> <b>die</b> thickness, platen thickness, thickness of insert and the location of the die with respect to the platen) describing the die/machine system. The results consistently show that there are many significant interactions among the variables and it is the interactions, more than the individual variables themselves, which determine the performance of the machine/die system. That said, the results consistently show that it is the stiffness of the machine platens that has the largest single impact on die separation...|$|R

40|$|Reforestation {{efforts are}} often {{severely}} hindered on sites that contain high populations of pocket gophers (Thmmysspp). Strychnine baiting {{is a technique}} used to suppress pocket gopher populations until seedlings are established. Strychnine bait is applied below ground in pocket gopher burrows, however, primary and secondary hazards remain a concern. A study to assess primary hazards indicated that some individual rodents died post strychnine baiting but {{there was not a}} long-term negative impact on non-target rodent populations. Possible secondary hazards reflect the potential for predators OT scavengers to encounter poisoned pocket gophers. Concerns that pocket gophers may surface before they succumb to the bait have been reduced through data acquired in pen trials. Most pocket gophers in trials with natural ground <b>cover</b> <b>died</b> in or near nest and all died below-ground. Carcasses of non-target species may pose some risk. These carcasses, however, are few and are thought to be consumed by insects within a few days. Trials are being conducted to evaluate the fate of these carcasses and to assess whether insects that feed on strychnine-containing carcasses pose a tertiary hazard...|$|R
