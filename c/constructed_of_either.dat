30|$|We {{had five}} {{research}} aims. First, {{we were concerned}} to establish {{the relationship between the}} two clusters of items adapted from the existing measures, the SDHS and the STAI- 6. While problems of depression and anxiety are known to be experientially different, these two states have been found to be strongly associated and difficult to separate empirically, with correlations between measures of depression and anxiety typically in range of r = 0.80 and above (Feldman [1993]; Watson et al. [1995]). Approximately 85 % of patients with depression also experience significant symptoms of anxiety. Similarly, comorbid depression occurs in up to 90 % of patients with anxiety disorders (Gorman [1998]). There is much common content in measures of depression and anxiety (Endler et al. [1992]). Selection of items specific to the <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> depression or anxiety can yield empirically separate tools (Stulz & Crits-Cristoph [2010]) but unless specifically developed in this way tend to be highly correlated. As such, at a higher order level these two theoretically separable dimensions may be combined to provide an overall index of positive functioning.|$|R

40|$|Cities as <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> {{incremental}} development or planned settlement reflect their economic, {{political and social}} condition. Much development is conceived and executed without {{an understanding of the}} intrinsic urban characteristic that resides in the existing urban form; or the traces of its urban evolution that have been lost to the physical landscape. The tendency has been for the urban landscape of the city to morph from a state of cohesion to fragmentation. The research presented in this paper traces the morphological development of Brisbane. Through the mapping of the physical changes that have occurred in a particular place, by extracting information from historical maps and photographs, patterns can be identified that convey the continuity of urban form, active usage and building typology. The analysis can be measured to identify developments that are incongruous, and critically, a methodology of predictive urban form that is indicative of a consonant urban development. The paper presents archival research undertaken at QUT that has documented the morphological evolution of Brisbane, from settlement to the present. A particular emphasis will be the analysis of built types, documenting characteristics of urban scale and aspects of th...|$|R
40|$|The unusual, heterodimeric topoisomerase IB of Leishmania shows {{functional}} activity upon reconstitution of the DNA-binding large subunit (LdTOPIL; or L) and the catalytic small subunit (LdTOPIS; or S). In the present study, we generated N- and Cterminal- truncated deletion <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> subunit and identified proteins LdTOPIL 39 − 456 (lacking amino acids 1 – 39 and 457 – 635) and LdTOPIS 210 − 262 (lacking amino acids 1 – 210) as the minimal interacting fragments. The interacting region of LdTOPIL lies between residues 40 – 99 and 435 – 456, while for LdTOPIS it lies between residues 210 – 215 and 245 – 262. The heterodimerization {{between the two}} fragments is weak and therefore co-purified fragments showed reduced DNA binding, cleavage and relaxation properties compared with the wild type enzyme. The minimal fragments could complement their respective wild-type subunits inside parasites when the respective subunits were down-regulated by transfection with conditional antisense constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis studies identify Lys 455 of LdTOPIL and Asp 261 of LdTOPIS as two residues involved in subunit interaction. Taken together, the present study provides crucial insights into the mechanistic details for understanding the unusual structure and inter-subunit cooperativity of this heterodimeric enzyme...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe leech embryo {{develops}} by spiral cleavage, and {{establishes the}} symmetry properties of its adult body plan through the bilaterally symmetric divisions of mesodermal proteloblast DM″ and ectodermal proteloblast DNOPQ‴. We here show that transcriptional inhibitors α-amanitin and actinomycin D specifically disrupt the symmetry and orientation {{of these two}} proteloblast cell divisions while having no apparent effect on the timing or geometry of other divisions. Transcriptional inhibition had a similar effect on both proteloblasts, i. e. cytokinesis was highly asymmetric and the cleavage plane roughly orthogonal to that seen during normal development. These findings suggest that zygotic gene product(s) are required, either directly or indirectly, for the correct placement of the proteloblast cleavage furrow. The same phenotypes were also observed following in vivo expression of dominant-negative Pax gene constructs. These dominant-negative phenotypes depended on protein/DNA interaction, and could be rescued by coexpression of full length Pax proteins. However, symmetric cleavage of the mesodermal proteloblast was rescued by full length <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> Hau-Paxβ 1 or Hau-Pax 2 / 5 / 8, while only Hau-Paxβ 1 rescued the symmetry of ectodermal cleavage.

The technique of bone regeneration through tissue engineering in this study is quite different from traditional ones, which have attempted to regenerate bone directly by constructing a 3 -D implant [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. This study has used a novel method of experimental {{bone formation}} (intramembranous osteogenesis) in a defect. Our results have asserted that the bone defect, even when large, may be repaired by tissue-engineered bone membrane efficiently because of naturally induced angiogenesis. The materials of this tissue-engineered composite, which are derived from the allogenic and the xenogenic sources are cheap and abundant and, therefore, may be much more practical for widespread clinical use.|$|E

40|$|Interferon alpha (IFN-α) binds to a cell surface {{receptor}} that activates the Jak-Stat signaling pathway. A {{critical component}} of this pathway is the translocation of interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (a complex of three proteins Stat 1, Stat 2 and IRF 9) to the nucleus to activate antiviral genes. A stable sub-genomic replicon cell line resistant to IFN-α was developed in which the nuclear translocation of Stat 1 and Stat 2 proteins was prevented {{due to the lack}} of phosphorylation; whereas the nuclear translocation of IRF 9 protein was not affected. In this study, we sought to overcome defective Jak-Stat signaling and to induce an antiviral state in the IFN-α resistant replicon cell line by developing a chimera IRF 9 protein fused with the trans activating domain (TAD) <b>of</b> <b>either</b> a Stat 1 (IRF 9 -S 1 C) or Stat 2 (IRF 9 -S 2 C) protein. We show here that intracellular expression of fusion proteins using the plasmid <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> IRF 9 -S 1 C or IRF 9 -S 2 C, in the IFN-α resistant cells, resulted in an increase in Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) luciferase promoter activity and significantly induced HLA- 1 surface expression. Moreover, we show that transient transfection of IRF 9 -S 1 C or IRF 9 -S 2 C plasmid constructs into IFN-α resistant replicon cells containing sub-genomic HCV 1 b and HCV 2 a viruses resulted in an inhibition of viral replication and viral protein expression independent of IFN-α treatment.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a {{physiological}} mediator synthesized by NO synthases (NOS). Despite their structural similarity, endothelial NOS (eNOS) has a 6 -fold lower NO synthesis activity and 6 – 16 -fold lower cytochrome c reductase activity than neuronal NOS (nNOS), implying significantly different electron transfer capacities. We utilized purified reductase domain <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> enzyme (bovine eNOSr and rat nNOSr) {{to investigate the}} following three mechanisms that may control their electron transfer: (i) the set point and control of a two-state conformational equilibrium of their FMN subdomains; (ii) the flavin midpoint reduction potentials; and (iii) the kinetics of NOSr-NADP+ interactions. Although eNOSr and nNOSr differed in their NADP(H) interaction and flavin thermodynamics, the differences were minor and unlikely to explain their distinct electron transfer activities. In contrast, calmodulin (CaM) -free eNOSr favored the FMN-shielded (electron-accepting) conformation over the FMN-deshielded (electron-donating) conformation to a much greater extent than did CaM-free nNOSr when the bound FMN cofactor was poised in each of its three possible oxidation states. NADPH binding only stabilized the FMN-shielded conformation of nNOSr, whereas CaM shifted both enzymes toward the FMN-deshielded conformation. Analysis of cytochrome c reduction rates measured within the first catalytic turnover revealed {{that the rate of}} conformational change to the FMN-deshielded state differed between eNOSr and nNOSr and was rate-limiting for either CaM-free enzyme. We conclude that the set point and regulation of the FMN conformational equilibrium differ markedly in eNOSr and nNOSr and can explain the lower electron transfer activity of eNOSr...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Stimulation of {{arginine}} vasopressin 2 receptor (V 2 R) with {{arginine vasopressin}} (AVP) {{results in a}} rise in von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII plasma levels. We hypothesized that gain-of-function variations in the V 2 R gene (AVPR 2) would lead to higher plasma levels of VWF and FVIII. Methods and Results: We genotyped the control populations of two population-based studies for four AVPR 2 variations: a- 245 c, G 12 E, L 309 L, and S 331 S. Rare alleles of a- 245 c, G 12 E, and S 331 S, which were in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with higher VWF propeptide, VWF and FVIII levels. The functionality of the G 12 E variant was studied in stably transfected MDCKII cells, expressing <b>constructs</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> 12 G-V 2 R or 12 E-V 2 R. Both V 2 R variants were fully glycosylated and expressed on the basolateral membrane. The binding affinity of V 2 R for AVP was increased three-fold in 12 E-V 2 R–green fluorescent protein (GFP) cells, which is in accordance with increased levels of VWF propeptide associated with the 12 E variant. The dissociation constant (KD) was 4. 5 nm [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 6 – 5. 4] for 12 E-V 2 R–GFP and 16. 5 nm (95 % CI 10. 1 – 22. 9) for 12 G-V 2 R–GFP. AVP-induced cAMP generation was enhanced in 12 E-V 2 R–GFP cells.
