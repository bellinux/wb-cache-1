5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the <b>complex</b> <b>form,</b> which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|The music {{style in}} Bahrain {{is similar to}} that of its neighbors. The Khaliji style of music, which is folk music, is popular in the country. The sawt style of music, which {{involves}} a <b>complex</b> <b>form</b> of urban music, performed by an Oud (plucked lute), a violin and mirwas (a drum), is also popular in Bahrain. Ali Bahar was one of the most famous singers in Bahrain. He performed his music with his Band Al-Ekhwa (The Brothers). Bahrain was also the site of the first recording studio amongst the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more <b>complex</b> <b>form</b> that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E

The antibodies were mixed with different amounts of antigen. Immune <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> at maximum precipitation proportions were efficient in complement activation, whereas immune <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> at antigen excess had weak complement-activating properties. When injected into rabbit knee joints, the immune <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> at maximum precipitation proportions with FCA or FIA antibodies caused a moderate leucocyte migration into the joints with maximum cell counts 6 - 8 hr after injection. Injection into the joints of immune <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> with FCA antibodies at antigen excess induced a pronounced leucocyte migration with maximum numbers 18 hr after injection.

40|$|The {{formation}} and dissociation of BSA:anti-BSA complexes was studied under two dissociating conditions: (i) low pH, which disrupts Coulombic bonds, and (ii) low surface tension, which disrupts van der Waals bonds. Soluble <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> in marked (thirty-two times) antigen excess were almost totally dissociated at low pH. By contrast, <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> near equivalence {{or in the}} zone of antibody excess, while becoming smaller, were not dissociated at low pH. Lowering surface tension at neutral pH likewise resulted in smaller complexes but not in dissociation of antigen from antibody. Dissociation of <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> near equivalence or in antibody excess was achieved by simultaneously lowering pH and surface tension. These data suggest that <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> in marked antigen excess involve predominantly Coulombic bonding while <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> at other antigen:antibody ratios involve both Coulombic and van der Waals bonding...|$|R

5|$|The {{landscape}} of all dance {{in a large}} country such as Brazil is rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions—Indian native, Black African, and Portuguese. In Brazil, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, capoeiraa dance-like fighting styleand the maculelê fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. Capoeira is of particular interest. In the 19th century, Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa, making them the original capoeristas and making the art a <b>complex</b> <b>form</b> of social interaction, expressing the participants' physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and {{the spirits of the}} ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance “game” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century.|$|E

25|$|A {{more subtle}} form of scale {{symmetry}} {{is demonstrated by}} fractals.

A coast {{is an example of a}} naturally occurring fractal, since it retains similar-appearing complexity at every level from the view of a satellite to a microscopic examination of how the water laps up against individual grains of sand. The branching of trees, which enables small twigs to stand in for full trees in dioramas, is another example.|$|E
25|$|Cluster {{sampling}} {{is commonly}} implemented as multistage sampling. This is a <b>complex</b> <b>form</b> of cluster sampling {{in which two}} or more levels of units are embedded one in the other. The first stage consists of constructing the clusters {{that will be used}} to sample from. In the second stage, a sample of primary units is randomly selected from each cluster (rather than using all units contained in all selected clusters). In following stages, in each of those selected clusters, additional samples of units are selected, and so on. All ultimate units (individuals, for instance) selected at the last step of this procedure are then surveyed. This technique, thus, is essentially the process of taking random subsamples of preceding random samples.|$|E

Immune <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> {{in the absence}} of complement (i. e. in phosphate-buffered saline or in the presence of complement-depleted serum from mice treated with cobra venom factor) were cleared from the blood at a higher rate than was the antigen injected alone. In contrast, immune <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> in the presence of fresh normal mouse serum were cleared from the blood {{at the same rate as}} was the native antigen. Immune <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> in the presence of complement were eliminated mainly by the liver. The <b>complexes</b> <b>formed</b> {{in the absence of}} complement also became located to the liver to approximately the same extent, but an even larger proportion of these immune complexes was deposited outside the reticuloendothelial system. It is concluded that serum complement may inhibit IgG-mediated clearance of antigen, probably by increasing the solubility of the complexes, thereby reducing the risk of deposition outside the reticuloendothelial system...|$|R

25|$|Declensional endings {{depend on}} case (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, instrumental, vocative), number (singular, dual or plural), gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and animacy (animate vs inanimate).

Slovene and Sorbian languages use a rare third number, (in addition to singular and plural numbers) known as dual (in case of some words dual survived also in Polish and other Slavic languages).

In the 218 bars, there are three distinct sections corresponding to the three pronouncements of Isaiah.

500|$|Keats's metre {{reflects}} a conscious development in his poetic style. The poem contains {{only a single}} instance of medial inversion (the reversal of an iamb {{in the middle of}} a line), which was common in his earlier works. However, Keats incorporates spondees in 37 of the 250 metrical feet. Caesurae are never placed before the fourth syllable in a line. The word choice represents a shift from Keats's early reliance on Latinate polysyllabic words to shorter, Germanic words. In the second stanza, [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", which emphasizes words containing the letters [...] "p", [...] "b", and [...] "v", uses syzygy, the repetition of a consonantal sound.
