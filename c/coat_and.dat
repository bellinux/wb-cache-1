5|$|A. f. styani {{has been}} {{described}} by Thomas in 1902 based on one skull from a specimen collected in Sichuan. Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the plasma sprayed 80 Ni- 20 Al coatings on aluminum-magnesium (Mg ≈ 2. 6 ‒ 3. 6 %) alloy substrate, which before plasma spraying was cleaned using blasting with Al 2 O 3 particles. The wear resistance and corrosion tests of sprayed <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> aluminum-magnesium alloy were performed. The volume loss, average {{central part of the}} cross-sectional area of wear track, wear rapidity, wear rate, wear resistance and corrosion current of <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> Al-Mg substrate were evaluated. The wear resistance and corrosion of nickel-aluminum <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> aluminum-magnesium substrate were compared at the work.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{aluminide}} <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> of section thickness were investigated on two cast nickel-base superalloys. Cast section thickness ranged from 0. 038 cm to 0. 15 cm. Simulated engine exposures in a jet fuel burner rig with cyclic air cooling were studied. The effects of surface machining before <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> re-machining and re-coating after exposures were examined.

40|$|Co-YSZ/HAp nano-composite <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> nano-HAp single <b>coating</b> were {{deposited}} on Ti substrate using {{the combination of}} electrocodeposition and electrophoretic deposition, and electrophoretic depositions, respectively.

The adhesive strength of the <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> Ti substrate was determined by shear strength testing. The {{results indicate that the}} adhesive strength of Co-YSZ/HAp nano-composite <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> Ti substrate is higher than that of nano-HAp single <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> Ti substrate.

5|$|While {{individual}} dogs may vary, {{in general}} show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, {{and have a}} thicker <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower heads with longer muzzles.|$|E

5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds {{new light on the}} sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E

5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} occur in many breeds, {{which have been}} {{developed}} since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth <b>coat,</b> <b>and</b> the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.|$|E
5|$|Fox Terriers are two {{different}} breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier. Both of these breeds originated in the 19th century {{from a handful of}} dogs who are descended from earlier varieties of British terriers, and are related to other modern white terrier breeds. In addition, a number of breeds have diverged from these two main types of fox terrier and have been recognised separately, including the Jack Russell Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier. The Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> markings. They have been successful in conformation shows, more prominently in America than their homeland.|$|E
