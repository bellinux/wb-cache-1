40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the variability of}} plant biometrics of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa L.) varieties depending on the concentration of microfertilizer Avatar- 1. Methods. Field study, biometric technique, comparative approach, statistical evaluation, generalization. Results. Dependence of the plant height, {{the diameter of the}} leaf rosette, the number of leaves per plant, the leaf area of plants on the concentration of microfertilizer Avatar- 1 was defined. Investigations of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> ‘Afitsyon’ and ‘Concord’ varieties by Dutch breeding were conducted in 2016 – 2017 in the collection sites of the department of vegetable growing in the scientific-experimental field  “Fruit and vegetable garden” of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine. In order to determine dependence of plant biometrics of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> varieties on the concentration of complex microfertilizer Avatar- 1, the following scheme was used for the both varieties: variant 1 – water (control); variant 2 – 0, 10 % solution; variant 3 – 0, 25 % solution; variant 4 – 0, 50 % solution. Plants were treated with microfertilizer three times during the vegetative period. Alterations of plant biometrics of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> ‘Afitsyon’ and ‘Concord’ varieties  depending on the concentration of complex microfertilizer Avatar- 1 was studied. Conclusions. It was found that in case of three-time plant treatment with complex microfertilizer Avatar- 1 at the time of harvesting, the best plant biometrics was registered in variant 3 (concentration 0, 25 %) for the both ‘Afitsyon’ and ‘Concord’ varie­ties of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce.</b> The height of plants of the <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> in ‘Afitsyon’ variety exceeded this figure in ‘Concord variety by 1, 1 – 1, 4 cm. The concentration of microfertilizer had no significant effect on the diameter of the leaf rosette of ‘Concord’ variety (25, 1 – 25, 9 см). The diame­ter of the leaf rosette of ‘Afitsyon’ variety was 26, 0 – 28, 7 cm. In <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce,</b> the largest leaf area per plant was registered in ‘Afi­tsyon’ variety (3516. 5 cm 2 /plant) in case of plants  treatment with 0, 25 % solution of complex microfertilizer Avatar- 1 that exceeded this figure in ‘Concord’ varie­ty by 660 cm 2 /plant. The best plant biometrics of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> of the studied varieties and optimal concentration of complex microfertilizer Avatar- 1 (0. 25 % solution) was defined that is important for improving agricultural cultivation techniques...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{features of}} commercial head quality formation in varieties of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa var. capitata L.) for different growing methods. To study {{the influence of}} growing methods for <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> plants on the weight of commercial heads, indices of yield and quality of freshly harvested products. Methods. Field study, laboratory testing and statistical evaluation. Results. The results of studying peculiarities of head formation in such <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> varieties as ‘Godar’ (control), ‘Smuhlianka’, ‘Olzhych’ and ‘Dyvohrai’ were shown. Based {{on the results of}} phenological observations, the duration of interstage periods of growth and development of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> plants was determined for the different growing methods. The model of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> of capitata variety for different growing methods was presented in terms of biochemical parameters (content of dry matter, vitamin C, nitrates, amount of sugars). The influence of growing methods for <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> plants on the commercial head weight, indices of yield and quality of freshly harvested products was studied. Obtained results confirmed that in early ripening varie­ti­es the heads were smaller (150 g) and not dense, in late ripening varieties they were large and dense, weight was 150 – 500 g. Freshly harvested commercial products of head lettuce in case of seedling cultivation was characterized by a slight increase in dry matter content by 0. 15 – 0. 29 %. The corresponding pattern was observed for the total sugar content. Its amount was slightly higher: 1. 3 – 1. 9 % in case of direct sowing and 1. 6 – 1. 9 % – for seedlings cultivation. The content of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, mg/ 100 g) was the highest in the ‘Dyvohrai’ variety despite of the method of growing. The largest quantity of nitrates in lettuce heads was in the inner stem (480 mg/kg), while {{in the middle of the}} head it was reduced to 110 mg/kg. Conclusions. Freshly harvested heads of <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuce</b> were analyzed for the content of such basic biochemical indices as dry matter, vitamin C, protein, nitrates, amount of sugars.

This could alleviate the increasing competition for land between food and energy production. In such agrivoltaic systems, an upper layer of PVPs partially shades crops at ground level. The aim of this work was to (i) assess the effect on crop yield of two PVPs densities, resulting in two shade levels equal to 50 % and 70 % of the incoming radiation and (ii) identify morphological and physiological determinants of the plant response to shade. Experiments were conducted on four varieties of lettuces (two crisphead <b>lettuces</b> and two <b>cutting</b> <b>lettuces),</b> during two seasons. In all cases, the relative lettuce yield at harvest was equal or higher than the available relative radiation. Lettuce yield was maintained through an improved Radiation Interception Efficiency (RIE) in the shade, while Radiation Conversion Efficiency (RCE) did not change significantly. Enhanced RIE was explained by (i) an increase in the total leaf area per plant, despite a decrease in the number of leaves and (ii) a different distribution of leaf area among the pool of leaves, the maximal size of leaves increasing in the shade. Our result provides a framework for the selection of adapted varieties according to their morphological traits and physiological responses to PVP shade, in order to optimize agrivoltaic systems...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial midrib rot, {{caused by}} Pseudomonas cichorii, {{has become a}} serious threat to the {{production}} of greenhouse butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata) in Belgium. Currently, there are no strategies for controlling this pathogen. Therefore, greenhouse experiments were conducted to obtain more knowledge about the epidemiology of P. cichorii on butterhead lettuce. Greenhouse butterhead lettuce becomes susceptible to lettuce midrib rot infections at head formation, and a single overhead irrigation with water containing 102 CFU/ml P. cichorii was sufficient to cause disease. The use of surface drip irrigation instead of overhead sprinkler irrigation significantly reduced midrib rot incidence in the greenhouse. P. cichorii isolates can be divided into subgroups based on BOX-PCR genomic fingerprinting, with isolates belonging to subgroup C 1 and C 2 being more virulent than those of (or related to) subgroup C 3. P. cichorii infections with distinct symptoms comparable to midrib rot have also been observed on field-grown crisphead lettuce in California and Japan which, respectively, are referred to as 'varnish spot' or 'tar'. We showed that symptom expression is strongly influenced by the lettuce cultivar group, irrespective of the P. cichorii isolate, resulting in varnish spot/tar on crisphead lettuce and midrib rot on butterhead or <b>cutting</b> group <b>lettuce...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and, {{to a minor}} extent, {{peroxidase}} (POD) {{represent the}} key enzymes involved in enzymatic browning, a negative process induced by cutting fresh-cut produce such as lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and rocket salad (Eruca sativa). Although ascorbic acid is frequently utilised as an anti-browning agent, its mechanism {{in the prevention of}} the browning phenomenon is not clearly understood. RESULTS: The activity of PPO and POD and their isoforms in lettuce (a high-browning and low-ascorbic acid species) and rocket salad (a low-browning and high-ascorbic species) was characterised. The kinetic parameters of PPO and in vitro ascorbic acid-PPO inhibition were also investigated. In rocket salad, PPO activity was much lower than that in <b>lettuce</b> and <b>cutting</b> induced an increase in PPO activity only in lettuce. Exogenous ascorbic acid (5 mmolL- 1) reduced PPO activity by about 90 % in lettuce. POD {{did not appear to be}} closely related to browning in lettuce. CONCLUSION: PPO is the main enzyme involved in the browning phenomenon; POD appears to play a minor role. The concentration of endogenous ascorbic acid in rocket salad was related to its low-browning sensitivity after <b>cutting.</b> In <b>lettuce,</b> the addition of ascorbic acid directly inhibited PPO activity.

The transfer rates among hands, foods, and kitchen surfaces were highly variable, being as low as 0. 0005 % and as high as 100 %. A normal distribution was used to describe the variability in the logarithm of the transfer rates. The mean 6 SD of the normal distri-butions were, in log percent transfer rate, chicken to hand (0. 94 6 0. 68), <b>cutting</b> board to <b>lettuce</b> (0. 90 6 0. 59), spigot to hand (0. 36 6 0. 90), hand to lettuce (20. 12 6 1. 07), prewashed hand to postwashed hand (i. e., hand washing ef ciency) (20. 20 6 1. 42), and hand to spigot (20. 80 6 1. 09).

From October to December 2005, 220 chilled raw filets (without skin) were collected from five local retail outlets in The Netherlands. Filet rinses that were positive after enrichment were enumerated with a three-tube most-probable-number (MPN) assay. Nineteen filets (8. 6 %) were contaminated above the detection limit of the MPN method (10 Salmonella per filet). The number of Salmonella on positive filets varied from 1 to 3. 81 log MPN per filet. The obtained enumeration data were applied in a risk assessment model. The model considered possible growth during domestic storage, cross-contamination from filet via a <b>cutting</b> board to <b>lettuce,</b> and possible illness due to consumption of the prepared lettuce. A screening analysis with expected-case and worst-case estimates for the input values of the model showed that variability in the inputs was of relevance. Therefore, a Monte Carlo simulation with probability distributions for the inputs was carried out to predict the annual number of illnesses. Remarkably, over two-thirds of annual predicted illnesses were caused by the small fraction of filets containing more than 3 log Salmonella at retail (0. 8 % of all filets).

40|$|Leafy vegetables, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Green Oakleaf), pak choi (Brassica sinensis L. cv. Oriental Taisai) and rocket (Eruca sativa L.), {{were planted}} {{in an open}} field at Lincoln University on January 2005. Plants were {{harvested}} at 5 cm cutting height above the growing point with three different harvest start times, early start (ES), mid start (MS) and late start (LS) of harvest respectively. There were three harvests {{during the growing season}} with a 4 -week interval between harvests. Generally, lettuce produced significantly higher total FW/plant (208 g) than pak choi or rocket (123 and 102 g total FW/plant, respectively). Lettuce also produced significantly higher total FW/plant than pak choi or rocket in each treatment. Lettuce produced significantly more total saleable leaf FW/plant in the ES, MS and LS treatment (137. 5, 120. 9 and 169. 3 g FW/plant), compared with pak choi (52. 9, 100 and 92 g FW/plant) or rocket (31. 5, 92. 2 and 56. 4 g FW/plant). Pak choi produced higher total saleable leaf FW/plant than rocket in the ES and LS treatments, but a similar total saleable leaf FW/plant in the MS treatment. The best time to start harvesting was the LS treatment for lettuce, while pak choi and rocket produced better yields in the MS and LS treatments. Results for total DW/plant showed that different harvest start times did not affect the total DW/plant in lettuce. However, pak choi and rocket produced less total DW/plant in the ES treatment compared to the MS or LS treatments. This was due to a faster recovery by lettuce. In addition, lettuce produced significantly higher DW/plant during regrowth at the second and third harvests than pak choi or rocket, even though it was significantly lower at the first harvest. It is likely that after harvesting greater carbohydrate reserves and greater remaining leaf area produced greater regrowth potential in lettuce. These results suggest that lettuce has the most regrowth potential, while rocket has more than pak choi in this reaping and regrowth system. When plants were harvested at the same <b>cutting</b> level, <b>lettuce</b> had the most remaining leaf area of the three species. This remaining leaf area for lettuce could be another reason for faster recovery and more regrowth potential. More reserves and remaining leaf area may also be the reason for more regrowth potential in rocket compared to pak choi. Another important reason for the better performance of lettuce was that temperatures during the growing season were in the range of optimum temperatures (12 - 21 ºС), except for the regrowth between the second and third harvests in the LS. This relates to higher photosynthetic rates and in turn leads to faster recovery and regrwoth. Lettuce was the most suitable crop in the reaping and regrowth system in this experiment. However, rocket might also be appropriate for this system, particularly if the price is high enough to make it economically viable...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas cichorii is an {{important}} plant pathogenic bacterium, with a wide host range and a worldwide distribution. In Belgium, this pathogen is the causal agent of midrib rot on greenhouse-grown butterhead lettuce and a serious threat for butterhead lettuce production. However, knowledge about the epidemiology and pathogenicity mechanisms of this pathogen is very limited. The {{first part of this}} thesis deals with the epidemiology of P. cichorii with the emphasis on disease development in greenhouse-grown butterhead lettuce. Greenhouse experiments revealed that (1) a single irrigation with water containing 102 CFU/mL P. cichorii results in serious midrib rot infections, which established grower’s surface irrigation water as the major inoculum source, (2) lettuce becomes more susceptible for lettuce midrib rot after the onset of head formation, (3) overhead sprinkler irrigation, which is the common practice in Belgian butterhead lettuce production greenhouses, is more conducive to midrib rot compared to sub-plant irrigation, and (4) disease symptom expression is strongly influenced by the lettuce cultivar group, resulting in varnish spot/tar on crisphead lettuce and midrib rot on butterhead or <b>cutting</b> group <b>lettuce.</b> The second and more extended part of this thesis includes our research about pathogenicity factors of P. cichorii. Our first aim was to study its type three secretion system (TTSS), which is encoded by the hrp genes. Many Gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria require this TTSS to cause disease on susceptible plants and to elicit a hypersensitive reaction (HR) on resistant plants. Therefore, a transposon bank was constructed and mutants were screened for their ability to cause a hypersensitive respons (HR) on tobacco. Although several mutants with an altered ability to cause a HR were retained, no hrc/hrp-mutant was obtained. Consequently, a site-specific hrpL-deletion mutant was constructed. This mutant was slightly reduced in initial multiplication in planta, but retained its pathogenicity on greenhouse-grown butterhead lettuce, indicating that the TTSS is not important for P. cichorii SF 1 - 54 to cause midrib rot in butterhead lettuce. Surprisingly, this hrpL-mutant still induced tissue collapse in tobacco leaves resembling HR, which may explain why no hrc/hrp-mutants were found among the HR [...] mutants. However, transposon mutants impeded in their ability to induce a HR-like tobacco leaf collapse were less pathogenic on lettuce and grew poorly in planta. Three mutants were studied in more detail, more specifically a mqoB-mutant, a pqqH-mutant and a lysA-mutant. The mqoB gene codes for malate:quinone oxidoreductase, which is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid/glyoxylate cycle. Growth experiments revealed this mqoB gene is probably required for the glyoxylate cycle and consequently suggests to the importance of the glyoxylate cycle in for growth and pathogenicity of P. cichorii in butterhead lettuce. The pqqH gene belongs to the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthesis gene cluster, pqqFABCDEH, and PqqH is involved in the secretion of PQQ in the periplasm and culture medium. PQQ may function as cofactor or (anti-) oxidant. The lysA gene encodes meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase, an enzyme catalyzing the last step of the lysine biosynthesis. A site-specific lysA-deletion mutant confirmed avirulence and reduced in planta growth of the lysA-transposon mutant. Moreover, duplications of genes of the lysine biosynthesis pathway have occurred in the genome of P. cichorii. Based on these findings, we suggest lysine must be importance for this pathogen. Another remarkable finding was that both lysA-mutants were unable to spread in lettuce tissue. Additionally and surprisingly, the genome of P. cichorii contains lodA and lodB genes, involved in L-lysine-ε-oxidase activity and required for spreading from biofilms for certain marine bacteria. Thus, the hypothesis was set that LodA and LodB might require lysine to spread in the plant and consequently for full pathogenicity. A lodA-deletion mutant, however, was not reduced in pathogenicity, and spread in planta even more aggressively than the wild type, disproving our hypothesis. These finding suggest that P. cichorii posseses TTSS-independent pathogenicity factors, requiring the TCA/glyoxylate cycle and amino acids, which reminded us about toxins, such as cyclic lipopeptides (CLP), which contribute to the virulence of several plant pathogenic pseudomonads. Bioassays revealed surfactant, antimicrobial and phytotoxic activity of P. cichorii cells, activities typical for CLPs, which could be retained in the culture filtrate. Bioassay-guided purification revealed that P. cichorii strain SF 1 - 54 produces a complex mixture of 7 bioactive compounds with lipopeptide characteristics. A combination of chemical analysis and genome mining was used to elucidate the structure and encoding genes of these compounds. Compound A has a molecular weight of 1604 Da and surfactant and antimicrobial activity against B. megaterium, but the lipopeptidic nature of this compound is doubtful due to its colour and poor fragmentation. Additionally, P. cichorii SF 1 - 54 produces cyclic lipopeptides, which are expected to be similar or highly related to pseudomycin C and C’, based on their molecular weight, their antimicrobial activity and the sequence of their biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, P. cichorii SF 1 - 54 produces two new phytotoxic CLPs, cichopeptin A and B. They have a molecular weight of 2066 Da and 2052 Da, respectively and consist both of 22 amino acids, N-acylated with an unsaturated C 12 -fatty acid. They are expected to be members of the tolaasin group and structurally resemble corpeptin B. Cichopeptin B, which was obtained in smaller amounts compared to cichopeptin A, is expected to differ from cichopeptin A only by the C-terminal amino acid residue. Finally, P. cichorii SF 1 - 54 produces cichofactin A and B, which are two related linear lipopeptides with a molecular weight of 1137 Da and 1109 Da, respectively. They consist of a 8 -amino acid peptide moiety and a decanoic lipid chain in cichofactin A, and dodecanoic lipid chain in cichofactin B. They both constitute new members of the syringafactin lipopeptide family. To obtain knowledge about the function of the cichofactins, a cichofactin-deficient mutant was constructed in P. cichorii SF 1 - 54. Disruption of the cichofactin biosynthesis genes, cifA and cifB, abolished cichofactin production and surprisingly enhanced the production of the phytotoxic cichopeptins. The cichofactin-deficient mutant was impaired in swarming motility and enhanced in biofilm formation. Based on these findings, we can conclude that P. cichorii SF 1 - 54 is a strong lipopeptide producer and that lipopeptides appear to be very important in the ecology and pathogenicity of this bacterium...|$|R
