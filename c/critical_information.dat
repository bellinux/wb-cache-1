5|$|Edward Ullendorff {{considered}} the German orientalist Hiob Ludolf (1624–1704) {{to be the}} founder of Ethiopian studies in Europe, thanks to his efforts in documenting the history of Ethiopia and the Ge'ez language, as well as Amharic. The Ethiopian monk Abba Gorgoryos (1595–1658), while lobbying the Propaganda Fide in Rome to become bishop of Ethiopia following his Catholic conversion and expulsion of the Jesuits by Ethiopian emperor Fasilides, collaborated with Ludolf – who never actually visited Ethiopia – and provided him with <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> for composing his Historia Aethiopica and its Commentaries. The ethnically-Ethiopian Portuguese cleric António d'Andrade (1610–1670) aided them as a translator, since Abba Gorgoryos was not a fluent speaker of either Latin or Italian. After Ludolf, the 18th-century Scottish travel writer James Bruce, who visited Ethiopia, and German orientalist August Dillmann (1823–1894) are also considered pioneers {{in the field of}} early Ethiopian studies. After spending time at the Ethiopian royal court, Bruce was the first to systematically collect and deposit Ethiopian historical documents into libraries of Europe, in addition to composing a history of Ethiopia based on native Ethiopian sources. Dillmann cataloged a variety of Ethiopian manuscripts, including historical chronicles, and in 1865 published the Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae, the first such lexicon to be published on languages of Ethiopia since Ludolf's work.|$|E

(The members of the classic InfoSec triad—confidentiality, integrity {{and availability}}—are interchangeably referred to in the literature as security attributes, properties, security goals, fundamental aspects, information criteria, <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> characteristics and basic building blocks.) There is continuous debate about extending this classic trio. Other principles such as Accountability have sometimes been proposed for addition—it has been pointed out that issues such as non-repudiation do not fit well within the three core concepts.|$|E

Alcibiades agreed to return in his ship, but when they stopped in southern Italy at Thurii, he escaped and sailed to the Peloponnese, where he sought refuge in Sparta. Athens passed a death sentence in absentia, his guilt seemingly proven. In Sparta, Alcibiades gave the members of the Peloponnesian League <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> on the Athenian Empire.|$|E
25|$|Critics and {{supporters}} are largely in factual agreement regarding {{the characteristics of}} null hypothesis significance testing (NHST): While it can provide <b>critical</b> <b>information,</b> it is inadequate as the sole tool for statistical analysis. Successfully rejecting the null hypothesis may offer no support for the research hypothesis. The continuing controversy concerns {{the selection of the}} best statistical practices for the near-term future given the (often poor) existing practices. Critics would prefer to ban NHST completely, forcing a complete departure from those practices, while supporters suggest a less absolute change.|$|E

On July 9 and 16, 1861, Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General P.G.T.

25|$|The {{idea that}} planets beyond Earth might host life {{is an ancient}} one, though {{historically}} it was framed by philosophy as much as physical science. The late 20th century saw two breakthroughs in the field. The observation and robotic spacecraft exploration of other planets and moons within the Solar System has provided <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> on defining habitability criteria and allowed for substantial geophysical comparisons between the Earth and other bodies. The discovery of extrasolar planets, {{beginning in the early}} 1990s and accelerating thereafter, has provided further information for the study of possible extraterrestrial life. These findings confirm that the Sun is not unique among stars in hosting planets and expands the habitability research horizon beyond the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|FTL: Faster Than Light is a {{top-down}} roguelike {{space ship}} simulator created by indie developer Subset Games, which was first released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in September 2012. In the game, the player controls {{the crew of}} a single spacecraft, holding <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> to be delivered to an allied fleet eight sectors away, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. The player must guide the spacecraft over eight sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or all of its crew lost, the game ends, forcing the player to restart with a new ship.|$|E

25|$|Line markers are {{generally}} used on permanent guidelines to provide <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> to divers following the line. The slots and notches provided {{are used to}} wrap the line to secure the marker in place. A simple passage of the line through the enlarged area {{at the base of}} the two slots will allow the marker to slide along the line, or even fall off if brushed by a diver. To more securely fasten the marker, an extra wrap may be added at each slot. The basic function of these markers is fairly consistent internationally, but procedures may differ by region, and between teams. The protocol for placement and removal should be well understood by the members of a specific team. Temporary line markers are only for the use of the team who placed them and are removed during exit to avoid littering a cave system with irrelevant and potentially confusing information.|$|E
25|$|PHRs {{have the}} {{potential}} to help analyze an individual’s health profile and identify health threats and improvement opportunities based on an analysis of drug interaction, current best medical practices, gaps in current medical care plans, and identification of medical errors. Patient illnesses can be tracked in conjunction with healthcare providers and early interventions can be promoted upon encountering deviation of health status. PHRs also make it easier for clinicians to care for their patients by facilitating continuous communication as opposed to episodic. Eliminating communication barriers and allowing documentation flow between patients and clinicians in a timely fashion can save time consumed by face-to-face meetings and telephone communication. Improved communication can also ease the process for patients and caregivers to ask questions, to set up appointments, to request refills and referrals, and to report problems. Additionally, {{in the case of an}} emergency a PHR can quickly provide <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> to proper diagnosis or treatment.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights {{declared}} admissible two {{complaints from}} {{relatives of the}} massacre victims against Russia regarding adequacy of the official investigation. In a ruling on 16 April 2012, {{the court found that}} Russia had violated the rights of victims' relatives by not providing them with sufficient information about the investigation and described the massacre as a [...] "war crime". But it also refused to judge the effectiveness of the Soviet Russian investigation because the related events took place before Russia ratified the Human Rights Convention in 1998. The plaintiffs filed an appeal but the 21 October 2013 ruling essentially reaffirmed the prior one, noting that Russian courts failed to substantiate adequately why some <b>critical</b> <b>information</b> remained classified.|$|E

Failure to recognize that the cylinder valve was not opened or that a cylinder was empty has been observed in divers conducting a pre-dive check. Breathing gas bled from a cylinder may be checked for smell. If the gas does not smell right it should not be used. Breathing gas should be almost free of smell, though a very slight aroma of the compressor lubricant is fairly common. No smell of combustion products or volatile hydrocarbons should be discernible.|$|E
