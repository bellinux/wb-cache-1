5|$|A 2006 {{retrospective}} study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use {{for more than}} one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated <b>carboxylation</b> of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E

5|$|In the liver, the <b>carboxylation</b> of cytosolic {{pyruvate}} into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent <b>carboxylation</b> for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin K (in animals) is {{involved}} in the <b>carboxylation</b> of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.|$|E
25|$|When {{carbon dioxide}} is the substrate, {{the product of the}} {{carboxylase}} reaction is a highly unstable six-carbon phosphorylated intermediate known as 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate, which decays virtually instantaneously into two molecules of glycerate-3-phosphate. The extremely unstable molecule created by the initial <b>carboxylation</b> was unknown until 1988, when it was isolated. The 3-phosphoglycerate can be used to produce larger molecules such as glucose.|$|E
25|$|The {{third class}} {{includes}} reactions describing {{the synthesis of}} FDCA from furfural. Furfural can be oxidized to 2-furoic acid with nitric acid and the latter was subsequently converted to its methyl ester. The ester was then converted via chloromethylation at position 5 to give 5-chloromethylfuroate. The latter was oxidized with nitric acid to form dimethyl 2,5-furandicarboxylate, which, after the alkaline hydrolysis gave FDCA in 50% yield. Andrisano reported that potassium 2-furoate, when heated up to 300nbsp&°C in a nitrogen atmosphere, underwent decarboxylation to furan with simultaneous <b>carboxylation</b> at position 5 to di-potassium 2,5-furandicarboxylate.|$|E
25|$|Warfarin {{and other}} 4-hydroxycoumarins block {{the action of}} VKOR. This results in {{decreased}} concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the <b>carboxylation</b> reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results {{in the production of}} clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid overdose.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{function}} of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when three laboratories (Stenflo et al., Nelsestuen et al., and Magnusson et al.) isolated the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) from cows that received a high dose of a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. It was shown that, while warfarin-treated cows had {{a form of}} prothrombin that contained 10 glutamate (Glu) amino acid residues near the amino terminus of this protein, the normal (untreated) cows contained 10 unusual residues that were chemically identified as γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). The extra carboxyl group in Gla made clear that vitamin K {{plays a role in}} a <b>carboxylation</b> reaction during which Glu is converted into Gla.|$|E
25|$|The {{prothrombin}} {{time is the}} time it takes plasma to clot after addition of tissue factor (obtained from animals such as rabbits, or recombinant tissue factor, or from brains of autopsy patients). This measures the quality of the extrinsic pathway (as well as the common pathway) of coagulation. The speed of the extrinsic pathway is greatly affected by levels of functional factor VII in the body. Factor VII has a short half-life and the <b>carboxylation</b> of its glutamate residues requires vitamin K. The {{prothrombin time}} can be prolonged as a result of deficiencies in vitamin K, warfarin therapy, malabsorption, or lack of intestinal colonization by bacteria (such as in newborns). In addition, poor factor VII synthesis (due to liver disease) or increased consumption (in disseminated intravascular coagulation) may prolong the PT.|$|E
500|$|The {{precursors}} {{of these}} factors require gamma <b>carboxylation</b> of their glutamic acid residues to allow the coagulation factors to bind to phospholipid surfaces inside blood vessels, on the vascular endothelium. The enzyme that carries out the <b>carboxylation</b> of glutamic acid is gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. The <b>carboxylation</b> reaction will proceed only if the carboxylase enzyme is able to convert a reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin K hydroquinone) to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The vitamin K epoxide is in turn recycled back to vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone by another enzyme, the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). Warfarin inhibits epoxide reductase (specifically the VKORC1 subunit), thereby diminishing available vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in the tissues, which inhibits the <b>carboxylation</b> activity of the glutamyl carboxylase. When this occurs, the coagulation factors are no longer carboxylated at certain glutamic acid residues, and are incapable of binding to the endothelial surface of blood vessels, and are thus biologically inactive. As the body's stores of previously produced active factors degrade (over several days) and are replaced by inactive factors, the anticoagulation effect becomes apparent. The coagulation factors are produced, but have decreased functionality due to undercarboxylation; they are collectively referred to as PIVKAs (proteins induced [...] vitamin K absence/antagonism), and individual coagulation factors as PIVKA-number (e.g.PIVKA-II). The end result of warfarin use, therefore, is to diminish blood clotting in the patient.|$|E
500|$|Non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} {{that are found}} in {{proteins}} are formed by post-translational modification, which is modification after translation during protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein. [...] For example, the <b>carboxylation</b> of glutamate allows for better binding of calcium cations, and [...] collagen contains hydroxyproline, generated by hydroxylation of proline. Another example is the formation of hypusine in the translation initiation factor EIF5A, through modification of a lysine residue. Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane.|$|E
2500|$|Within the cell, vitamin K {{undergoes}} electron reduction to {{a reduced}} form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).

The <b>carboxylation</b> reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme {{is able to}} oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The <b>carboxylation</b> and epoxidation reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then reconverted to vitamin K by VKOR.

2500|$|Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, {{commonly}} {{known by the}} abbreviations RuBisCO, RuBPCase, or RuBPco, is an enzyme involved in the first major step of carbon fixation, a process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted by plants and other photosynthetic organisms to energy-rich molecules such as glucose. [...] In chemical terms, it catalyzes the <b>carboxylation</b> of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (also known as RuBP). It {{is probably the most}} abundant enzyme on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|... φ is the {{fraction}} of fixed carbon that is respired, pCO2 is the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere, εcarb is {{the fraction}}ation of <b>carboxylation,</b> and εdiff is the fractionation of diffusion in air. The relation of δD in plant leaf waxes to δ13C has been empirically measured and results in a negative correlation of δD to water use efficiency. This can be explained in part by lower water use efficiency being associated with higher transpiration rates. Transpiration exhibits a normal isotope effect, causing enrichment of deuterium in plant leaf water and therefore enrichment of leaf waxes.|$|E
2500|$|However, our {{descriptive}} knowledge {{will become more}} usable when we can translate them into quantitative models that can enable us to calculate {{the outcome of the}} reaction under a given condition. [...] Since RubisCO reacts with RuBP (ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate) first to produce enediol and next with [...] that after some intermediate changes produces PGA (3-phosphoglycerate), a biochemical model is developed [...] and C4 photosynthesis from gas exchange | journal=BioSystems | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 265–284 }} to represent the [...] effects of [...] these steps quantitatively. Since <b>carboxylation</b> or fixation of [...] is possible only after the synthesis of enediol, thus it is suggested that the role of RubisCO is to produce enediol that is carboxylase and oxygenase (EnCO). Accordingly, RubisCO is called enolase-phosphglycerase (EPGase) since it is neither carboxylase nor oxygenase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carboxylation</b> {{of these}} vitamin K-dependent Gla-proteins, besides being {{essential}} for {{the function of the}} protein, is also an important vitamin recovery mechanism since it serves as a recycling pathway to recover vitamin K from its epoxide metabolite (KO) for reuse in <b>carboxylation.</b>|$|E
