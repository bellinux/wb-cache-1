5|$|A {{different}} approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> not allowed to purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in about five minutes.|$|E

30|$|With {{respect to}} the effect of the antecedents of {{customer}} loyalty (e.g., image and customer satisfaction), the total effects of image on customer loyalty for satisfied and dissatisfied <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> 0.57 and 0.21. In other words, the customer loyalty of satisfied <b>customers</b> <b>was</b> affected more by customer satisfaction. <b>Customer</b> satisfaction <b>was</b> significantly related to the customer loyalty of both satisfied and dissatisfied customers, and satisfied <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> affected more by customer satisfaction (β =  0.63 vs. 0.14). Consequently, regarding customer loyalty, <b>customer</b> satisfaction <b>is</b> more important than image for both satisfied and dissatisfied customers. Numerous studies have shown that <b>customer</b> satisfaction <b>is</b> a crucial factor for ensuring customer loyalty (Barsky 1992; Smith and Bolton 1998; Hallowell 1996; Grønholdt et al. 2000). This study empirically supports the notion that <b>customer</b> satisfaction <b>is</b> positively related to customer loyalty.|$|R

50|$|The {{interaction}} between service employees and <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> considered {{an essential part}} of both customers' assessments of service quality and their relationship with the service provider. Positive affective displays in service interactions are positively associated with important customer outcomes, such as intention to return and to recommend the store to a friend. It is the interest of organizations that their <b>customers</b> <b>be</b> happy, since a happy <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> a satisfied one. Research has shown that the emotional state of the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> directly influenced by the emotions displayed by the employee/service provider via emotional contagion. But, this influence is dependent on the degree of authenticity of the employee's emotional display, such that if the employee is only surface-acting, the contagion of the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> poor, in which case the beneficial effects stated above will not occur.|$|R
