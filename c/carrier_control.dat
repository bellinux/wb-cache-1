5000|$|The <b>Carrier</b> <b>Controlled</b> Approach is {{analogous}} to ground-controlled approach using the ship's precision approach radar. Pilots are told (via voice radio) where they are in relation to glideslope and final bearing (e.g., [...] "above glideslope, right of centerline").

50|$|Since {{the radio}} would not {{transmit}} unless the ready light was lit, checking output power, frequency, or deviation {{on the bench}} or outside the system coverage area required the technician to attach a test box. The box bypassed the radio trunking logic so adjustments could be made in a conventional single-channel mode. Antenna forward and reflected power in a vehicle on a working system was typically checked by bringing up a talk channel and transmitting normally. Once a channel was brought up it could be 'held' for up to 3 minutes (the limit of the system <b>carrier</b> <b>control</b> timer).|$|E

50|$|Alternatively {{a series}} {{regulator}} can be inserted between the DC supply and the anode. The DC supply provides twice the normal voltage the anode sees. The regulator can allow none {{or all of}} the voltage to pass, or any intermediate value. The audio input operates the regulator {{in such a way as}} to produce the instantaneous anode voltage needed to reproduce the modulation envelope. An advantage of the series regulator is that it can set the anode voltage to any desired value. Thus the power output of the transmitter can be easily adjusted, allowing the use of Dynamic <b>Carrier</b> <b>Control.</b> The use of PDM switching regulators makes this system very efficient, whereas the original analog regulators were very inefficient and also non linear. Series PDM modulators are used in solid state transmitters also, but the circuits are somewhat more complex, using push pull or bridge circuits for the RF section.|$|E

5000|$|The 660 ST {{structure}} was planned years in advance before Paramount Communications purchased {{the park in}} 1992. [...] However, Paramount took over operations in time to determine the ride's theme {{which was based on}} the Paramount Pictures film Top Gun. They hired John DeCuir Jr., a production designer that worked on the film, to design the ride's loading platform, so that it would resemble the deck of an aircraft carrier. Subsequently, the roller coaster was named Top Gun when it opened in 1993. The ride's queue, where guests wait in line, featured music from the motion picture as well. An aircraft <b>carrier</b> <b>control</b> room exhibit was also a feature that guests would pass through {{on their way to the}} loading platform above. Access to the control room exhibit was blocked off from the line queue several years later, some time before Cedar Fair purchased the park in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{main reason}} for using either MDCL method (or the {{combination}} of the two) is to save power and money. Alternatively, for the same total power consumption, the transmission coverage can be somewhat improved. The AMC method has two other advantages. It limits the peak voltages on transmitter and antenna circuits, possibly preventing damaging arcs. Also, if the degree of AMC is properly adjusted, the power drawn from the mains can be kept nearly constant with modulation. This is especially important when operating from a local generator. With conventional DCC the load variations on a generator are made worse. With both methods, the main disadvantage is marginal loss of coverage, comparable to running slightly less power. Also in lower signal strength parts of the coverage area, a station using Dynamic <b>Carrier</b> <b>Control</b> {{may be more likely to}} be skipped on digital-tuned radios during seek/scan tuning (if the frequency is passed during carrier reduction), an issue compounded by manual tuning (instead of seek/scan) selection not being easy on some receivers.|$|E
50|$|It was the {{responsibility}} of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) at the United Kingdom Regional Air Operations Centre (UK RAOC) located at the Strike Command Operations Centre at High Wycombe to alert the nation to an imminent air attack. Once an alert was initiated the national and local television and radio networks would break into transmissions and broadcast a warning (the warning message would originate from an emergency studio in BBC Broadcasting House in London). Simultaneously the national air raid siren system would be brought into service. A system, which used the same frequency on normal telephone lines as the peacetime speaking clock, was employed for this whereby a key switch activation alerted 250 national <b>Carrier</b> <b>Control</b> Points or CCPs present in police stations across the country. In turn the CCPs would, via a signal carried along ordinary phone lines, cause 7,000 powered sirens to start-up. In rural areas, around 11,000 hand powered sirens would be operated by postmasters, rural police officers, or Royal Observer Corps personnel (even parish priests, publicans, magistrates, subpostmasters or private citizens could be involved in some remote rural areas).|$|E
50|$|Major {{airlines}} historically competed on {{the strength}} of their hub-and-spoke systems in which the <b>carriers</b> <b>controlled</b> valuable real estate at hub airports and a fleet optimised for this business model. The rise of low-cost upstarts such as Southwest and Ryanair depressed industry pricing and poached customers. Traditional carriers could not easily redeploy their hubs and planes to compete cost-effectively against new entrants.|$|R
5000|$|But {{there was}} also a dark side. By the 1870s, railroads were vilified by Western farmers who absorbed the Granger {{movement}} theme that monopolistic <b>carriers</b> <b>controlled</b> too much pricing power, and that the state legislatures had to impose maximum prices. Local merchants and shippers supported the demand and got some [...] "Granger Laws" [...] passed. Anti-railroad complaints were loudly repeated in late 19th century political rhetoric.|$|R
40|$|Auxin {{is a key}} {{regulator}} {{of plant}} growth and development. Within the root tip, auxin distribution {{plays a crucial role}} specifying developmental zones and coordinating tropic responses. Determining how the organ-scale auxin pattern is regulated at the cellular scale is essential to understanding how these processes are controlled. In this study, we developed an auxin transport model based on actual root cell geometries and carrier subcellular localizations. We tested model predictions using the DII-VENUS auxin sensor in conjunction with state-of-the-art segmentation tools. Our study revealed that auxin efflux carriers alone cannot create the pattern of auxin distribution at the root tip and that AUX 1 /LAX influx carriers are also required. We observed that AUX 1 in lateral root cap (LRC) and elongating epidermal cells greatly enhance auxin’s shootward flux, with this flux being predominantly through the LRC, entering the epidermal cells only as they enter the elongation zone. We conclude that the nonpolar AUX 1 /LAX influx <b>carriers</b> <b>control</b> which tissues have high auxin levels, whereas the polar PIN <b>carriers</b> <b>control</b> the direction of auxin transport within these tissues...|$|R
50|$|A {{large amount}} of work was {{completed}} from the mid 1980s to bring the UKWMO up to date. Modern detection instruments were provided to the ROC together with back up detectors at certain Sector or Group Controls known as Atomic Weapons Detection Recognition and Estimation of Yield (AWDREY) equipment. Updated warning equipment was installed in most government buildings, nuclear bunkers, armed forces HQs, police and fire stations and private houses in remote areas. Major police stations were used as the area control points for power operated sirens, so these were equipped with new WB1400 <b>carrier</b> <b>control</b> warning equipment. If a warning was received then the police could operate the sirens via remote control, the carrier warning signal did not automatically operate the warning sirens (a few of which were those used in the Second World War). Many of the sirens are still in operation in coastal areas and are now used for emergency flood warning. Between 1985 and 1990 all communications links used by the warning system, the UKWMO and the ROC were upgraded and hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse damage. Point to point SX2000 automated telephone exchanges were installed in the UKWMO Sector and Group Controls and old fashioned telegraph equipment was replaced with modern computerised message switching equipment.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{models of}} the {{chemical}} and <b>carrier</b> <b>control</b> sub-systems of the Raven SCS- 700 chemical injection system were developed. The step responses of both control sub-systems were predictable using the models. From this process of model development, {{it was observed that}} the voltage saturation effect limited the response speed of the carrier valve motor and the resulting speed at which changes could be made to the carrier flow rate. The rate at which flow rate measurements were available limited the extent to which valve motor speed could be increased without causing instability. The performance of three different types of sprayers was simulated using these models. Simulations were performed with and without <b>carrier</b> <b>control.</b> Sprayers using <b>carrier</b> <b>control</b> misapplied to smaller areas than those without <b>carrier</b> <b>control.</b> Differences between the response of the chemical and carrier sub-system controllers produced concentration variations that contributed to application error.
