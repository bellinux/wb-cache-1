25|$|Some of Crichton's fiction used a {{literary}} technique called false document. For example, Eaters of the Dead is a fabricated recreation of the Old English epic Beowulf {{in the form}} of a scholarly translation of Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century manuscript. Other novels, such as The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park, incorporated fictionalized scientific documents {{in the form of}} diagrams, <b>computer</b> <b>output,</b> DNA sequences, footnotes and bibliography. Some of his novels, such as The Terminal Man and State of Fear, included authentic published scientific works to illustrate his point.|$|E
2500|$|Another odd {{feature of}} the Selectric {{terminals}} was the [...] "keyboard lock" [...] mechanism. [...] If the computer system a user was communicating with {{was too busy to}} accept input, it could send a code to mechanically interlock the keyboard so the user could not press any keys. The keyboard was also locked when the computer was typing, to avoid damaging the mechanism or interleaving user input and <b>computer</b> <b>output</b> in a confusing manner. [...] Though done to protect the print mechanism from damage, an unexpected keyboard lock activation could cause minor injury to a typist with a heavy touch. [...] There was little obvious warning that the keyboard had locked or unlocked, other than a faint click from the interlock solenoid, easily drowned out by the printer and fan noise in many computer facilities. [...] There was a small indicator light, but this was of little help to fast touch typists whose gaze was fixed on copy they were transcribing.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} {{classical}} and quantum Kolmogorov complexity of binary strings agree {{up to an}} additive constant. Both complexities are defined as the minimal length of any (classical resp. quantum) <b>computer</b> program that <b>outputs</b> the corresponding string. It follows that quantum complexity {{is an extension of}} classical complexity to the domain of quantum states.

50|$|The {{designation}} of a device as either input or output depends on perspective. Mouse and keyboards take physical movements {{that the human}} user outputs and convert them into input signals that a computer can understand; the output from these devices is the computer's input. Similarly, printers and monitors take signals that a <b>computer</b> <b>outputs</b> as input, and they convert these signals into a representation that human users can understand. From the human user's perspective, the process of reading or seeing these representations is receiving input; this type of interaction between computers and humans is studied {{in the field of}} human-computer interaction.|$|R

The motivating application is minimum probability of error detection of digital data-link messages aboard civil aircraft in the earth reflection multipath environment. For each known signal, the detector contains one Kalman filter and one probability computer. The filters estimate the multipath disturbance. The estimates and the received signal drive the probability <b>computers.</b> <b>Outputs</b> of all the computers are compared in amplitude to give the signal decision.
