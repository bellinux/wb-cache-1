40|$|Use of seatbelts in late model <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> {{automatic}} or manual belt systems {{was observed}} in suburban Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> automatic two-point belt systems, the use of shoulder belts by drivers was substantially {{higher than in the}} same model <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> manual three-point belts. This finding was true in varying degrees whatever the type of automatic belt, including <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> detachable nonmotorized belts, <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> detachable motorized belts, and especially <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> nondetachable motorized belts. Most of these automatic shoulder belts systems include manual lap belts. Use of lap belts was lower in <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> automatic two-point belt systems than in the same model <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> manual three-point belts; precisely how much lower could not be reliably estimated in this survey. Use of shoulder and lap belts was slightly higher in General Motors <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> detachable automatic three-point belts compared with the same model <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> manual three-point belts; in Hondas {{there was no difference in}} the rates of use of manual three-point belts and the rates of use of automatic three-point belts...|$|R
50|$|The trailer {{cars had}} a number of {{different}} seating configurations, depending upon which of the services they were deployed. There were three First Class passenger cars (TB 801-803), three Second Class sitting <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> buffet with a seating capacity of 38 passengers (TFR 851-853), four First Class sitting <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> buffet with a seating capacity of 38 passengers (TBR 854-857), two composite sitting <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> buffet (TCR 861-862) and three composite sitting <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> a capacity of 24 First Class and 31 Second Class passengers (TC 751-753).|$|R
40|$|Seat belt use was {{observed}} in 1, 628 <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> air bags and manual belts and 34, 223 <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> manual seat belts only. Sixty-six percent of drivers in <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> air bags wore seat belts compared to 63 percent of drivers in <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> manual belts only. The study found no evidence for the speculation that drivers with air bags will reduce their seat belt use because they believe an air bag alone provides sufficient protection...|$|R
5|$|Heydrich was, for {{all intents}} and purposes, {{military}} dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His changes to the government's structure left President Emil Hacha and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone in a <b>car</b> <b>with</b> an open roof—a show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his government's effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the <b>car,</b> <b>with</b> the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the <b>car</b> <b>with</b> gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. The onlookers set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{had already}} become an {{overspill}} for the nearby city of Worcester, {{and the new}} motorways constructed in the early 1960s brought the industrial Midlands within commuting distance by <b>car.</b> <b>With</b> this development came the construction of large private housing developments. The town continues to swell as increasingly more farmland, especially in the Malvern Link area between the villages of Guarlford and Newland, is turned over to housing projects creating new communities and suburbs.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} <b>car,</b> <b>with</b> {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the <b>car</b> <b>with</b> him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the <b>car</b> <b>with</b> the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha {{is on his way to}} the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him.

5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the <b>car</b> <b>with</b> bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a <b>car</b> <b>with</b> an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E
