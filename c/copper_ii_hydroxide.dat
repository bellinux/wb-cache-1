40|$|An {{investigation}} of the species present {{on the surface of}} natural enargite and the effects of X-ray radiation on the surface after electrochemical oxidation at pH 10 has been carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface species present on fractured and polished unoxidized enargite have been compared with those present on the polished surface after oxidation at pH 10. The effect of X-ray irradiation time as a function of temperature on the forms and intensities of the photoelectron signals from the enargite surface was studied. High binding energy (BE) components and shake-ups of the Cu 2 p signals, characteristic of a <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> <b>hydroxide</b> surface layer, reduced in intensity with increasing X-ray exposure time. Associated changes in the relative concentrations of surface oxygen species were also observed. Comparing a surface exposed to X-rays at 35 °C with that maintained at - 135 °C, temperature was shown to significantly influence the rate of change. The observed changes were evaluated in terms of a proposed two-stage mechanism involving the dehydration of Cu(OH) to CuO, followed by photoreduction of CuO to Cu O. The photoreduction effects of X-ray irradiation should be significantly reduced by sample cooling for consistent analysis of the enargite surface using XPS...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{expansion}} and diversification of cellulose-based products market {{has created the}} need for a more accurate pulp characterization, and new parameters have been developed, including cellulose and pulp reactivity. Cellulose reactivity has been often described as the ability degree of the reactive hydroxyl groups within the polysaccharide to react with chemicals, and it has been estimated by means of complex, time-consuming methods. Many studies have utilized these estimations as representative values of pulp reactivity. However, this approach is questionable, because the latter depends not only upon cellulose reactivity, but also on other parameters. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop an alternative fast user-friendly procedure to estimate pulp reactivity as such. This novel evaluation method was based on the monitoring of pulp dissolution in a bis (ethylenediamine) <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> <b>hydroxide</b> solution (CED) at constant measurement conditions using a rheometer equipped with a bob-and-vane geometry. Torque values were first measured throughout the reaction and then plotted as function of time. The resulting torque profile was found to consist of four phases: torque decrement, linear increment, non-linear increment, and the plateau. The dissolution began with the linear phase and ended with the plateau value. Based on the analysis of the profile, three parameters were identified as best representing pulp reactivity: pre-dissolution time (PDT), initial dissolution rate (IDR), and optimal dissolution time (ODT). The first estimated the accessibility of CED to the pulp, while the second and the third evaluated pulp reactivity as such. In particular, high IDRs and low ODTs were found to correspond to high pulp reactivities, though these two parameters were not directly proportional. In order to optimize the method, the experiments were organized in two parts. The first evaluated the measurement conditions affecting the results and allowed the standardization of the procedure. Differently, the second part verified the applicability of the procedure {{on a wide range of}} pulps, evaluating the reactivity of dissolving, kraft and mechanical pulps exposed to different physical and chemical treatments. Although the IDRs showed higher repeatability than the ODTs, all the measurements resulted consistent. Moreover, the optimal dissolution times allowed the comparison among pulps obtained by different manufacturing processes. Finally, the rheological estimations were accompanied by further analyses in order to better understand the factors influencing pulp reactivity. The here proposed rheology-based pulp reactivity estimation method was proved to be sensitive, reliable, fast, and relatively simple. Thus, the procedure was confirmed as an efficient alternative to the other methods based on cellulose reactivity. Nevertheless, the results reported also the necessity of further studies, especially to better interpret the dynamics regulating torque plateau...|$|E

40|$|<b>Copper</b> (<b>II)</b> {{contaminated}} water threatens {{not only the}} aquatic lives but also human health due {{to the ability to}} accumulate in the food chains. Therefore, effective and economical technique must be developed to solve this issue. Although nanoparticles had been found effective in the removal of heavy metal and dye, theirs instability in aqueous solution had limited theirs practical usage. Therefore, in this research, the magnetic nanoparticles of cobalt-doped maghemite (Co-Fe 2 O 3) which were synthesized by coprecipitation method using stable ferric and cobalt salts were immobilized in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) -alginate matrix (in bead form) for the removal of <b>copper</b> (<b>II).</b> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then used to identify the <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> removal mechanism under photo condition. The effects of various parameters such as pH, catalyst dosage, light intensity and presence of negative organic compounds were investigated. After 180 min of sunlight irradiation exposure, <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> concentration was reduced to 1. 080 ppm and 0. 625 ppm at pH 4 and 6, respectively. This concentration complied with the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standard (less than 2. 0 ppm). The optimum pH and catalyst dosage investigated were found to be pH 6 and 8 % (v/v), respectively. In addition, organic additives like acetate and ethanol were found to enhance the <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> removal. The adsorption-desorption test further proved that Co-Fe 2 O 3 -PVA alginate bead has good recyclability with a drop of only 2. 7 % <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> removal efficiency after five cycles. Therefore, this bead is an attractive and ecofriendly separation tool to be applied in domestic water purification system under the sustainable light illuminatio...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{research}} and development of membrane technology are focused towards the improvement of properties and performances through membrane modification by using nanoparticles. In this research, hydrophobic cobalt-iron oxide nanoparticles were coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecular weight MW- 600 to prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles and to improve its dispersion before adding into the dope solution containing 20 wt% polyethersulfone (PES) in dimethylformamide (DMF). The nanomodified membranes were characterized in terms of flux permeation (Q), wetting ability and solute separation. The prepared modified ultrafiltration membranes were then subjected to the separation of <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> ions and the separation efficiency of the nanoparticles modified membrane were found to improve significantly. This may be due to synergistic interaction between two additives that improved the structure as well as the performance of PES ultrafiltration membrane in terms of <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> rejection. The incorporation of 6 % nanoparticles in the membranes had improved the <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> rejection from 10 % to > 90 % with initial concentration of <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> at 20 ppm in cross flow filtration cell at pH 7. The membrane modified with nanoparticles also exhibited good regeneration ability and could be reused for more than five times without significantly drop in performances. In conclusion, incorporating of cobalt iron oxide nanoparticles coated with PEG can improve the <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> rejection of modified ultrafiltration membrane...|$|R

The main objective of the thesis {{was to determine whether}} will occur immobilization of <b>copper</b> (<b>II)</b> ions in mixed gels and diffusion would occur faster or slower in comparison with gel-free modified humic acids. Classic humic acids were modified by methylation, which led to the suppression of their reactivity...|$|R
