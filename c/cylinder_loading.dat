40|$|Electrohydraulic and {{electromechanical}} {{valve train}} technologies for four-stroke engines are emerging which allow much greater flexibility {{and control of}} the valve events than can be achieved using mechanically-based systems. Much of the work done on exploiting the benefits of these systems has been directed towards improving engine fuel economy and reducing emissions. In the present work a study has been made, using an engine simulation program, in to some of the possible benefits to engine performance that may be facilitated by the flexibility of fully variable valve train (FVVT) systems. The simulation study indicates that FVVT systems, limited by realistic opening and closing rates, provide sufficient range in the valve event duration and timing to enable the engine to produce very high specific outputs whilst achieving a high level of torque in the low- and mid-speed range. It is also shown that an FVVT system makes it possible to modify the basic intake manifold tuning mechanism by modifying the engine firing order, without recourse to variable geometry manifold systems. Additionally, the operation of a 'pneumatic hybridisation' concept are investigated and a range of further operating strategies, including Differential <b>Cylinder</b> <b>Loading,</b> which become viable upon the adoption of FVVT systems are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Fracture {{conductivity}} {{testing is}} a measure of how proppant will perform downhole when injected. The current American Petroleum Institute (API) procedure for conductivity testing produces results that are difficult to replicate. In one case three commercial labs tested the same sample of proppant, the results varied between labs and the highest spread in data had an 80 % variation (Anderson, 2013). The goal of this thesis is to investigate cell loading procedures that reduce the variation in laboratory results. A variety of cell loading techniques were tested including Hoke cylinder injection, guar injection, and cell vibration. Hoke <b>cylinder</b> <b>loading</b> was determined not to be a feasible technique with the current lab equipment at Montana Tech’s Research Lab. The guar injection produced a smaller spread in the data when compared to the API loading technique. However, when the results from the guar injection were analyzed it was apparent the guar had not been completely removed from the cell after injection. The remaining guar reduced the overall permeability of the proppant pack, which lead to an unfair comparison with the API Standard procedure. The cell vibration technique produced conductivity values that were very similar to the results produced by the API procedure but with a considerable reduction in the overall variance. From the data, it is recommended to test the effect of cell vibration on long-term fracture conductivity tests...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} numerical results, {{based on}} Donnell shell theory, for the axial compressive buckling loads for eccentrically stringer-stiffened circular cylindrical panels, {{in a study}} of the effect of boundary conditions and panel width on the buckling load. The two cases of inside and outside stiffeners were considered. The complete <b>cylinder</b> buckling <b>load</b> was reached only for panels under classical simply supported boundary conditions. The prevention of circumferential displacement is found {{to be the most important}} in-plane boundary condition from the point of view of increasing the buckling load. Clamping is found more effective in increasing the buckling loads of panels with free circumferential edge displacement than of panels with zero edge displacement. When panel width is equal to or greater than 180 deg, the panel buckling loads are within 10 % of the complete <b>cylinder</b> <b>load</b> for all cases except one simply supported panel with outside stringers. Buckling loads were higher for outside stringers, except for very narrow panels that are restrained against circumferential edge displacement.

40|$|Abstract — The elastic {{characteristics}} of a material are a measure of its stiffness. It is also needed for computing the design stresses under load in simple elements and moments and deflection in complicated structure. The modulus of elasticity development for SF-RPC was monitored {{over a period of}} 365 days. And results are compared with available reference however for design purposes; a modulus of elasticity value related to compressive strength is suggested. The modulus of elasticity of RPC is governed not only by the cementitious matrix but also by the fibres. Since the application of heat treatment has no effect on the stiffness of the fibres, it has a limited effect on the modulus of elasticity of the composites. ASTM C- 469 describes a standard test method for measurement of the static modulus of elasticity (the chord modulus) and Poisson‘s ratio of 150 mm- by 300 mm. concrete <b>cylinders</b> <b>loaded</b> in longitudinal compression at a constant loading...|$|R

The following three geometries of verti-cal cylinders are considered: (i) circular cylinders, (ii) concentric circular cylinders, and (iii) cylinders with elliptical cross-section. In total, test results on nineteen shells are given. The experimental data is benchmar-ked against the FE predictions of buckling loads. Good agreement has been obtained between the experimental results and numerical predic-tions for all tested shells except for buckling of the concentric <b>cylinders</b> <b>loaded</b> by the horizontal edge force. Possible reasons for discrepancies are discussed. The paper offers insight into buckling performance of vertical cylinders subjected to combined loading, {{and in the}} case of concentric cylinders, into the interaction between the inner and outer shells.

40|$|The {{present study}} treats {{as a typical}} example a ring the center line of which is {{produced}} by the intersection of two circular cylinders of different diameter.

(2) Pure longitudinal tension in the large cylinder. (3) Pure shear (torsion) in the large cylinder. To simplify the calculation, it is assumed that the ring, compared to the shell, is very strong, so that its deformations have no perceptible effect on the stress condition in the shell. This provides an upper limit for the ring stresses actually produced in a shell design, for, according to the theory of stressed skin statics the shells, by elastic flexibility of the ring, regroup the forces deposited on it in such a manner that the ring is relieved...|$|R
