5000|$|The DMM {{specification}} {{also includes}} a profile for the pressing of 12-inch records. To the naked eye, this profile has no obvious contour {{on the face of}} the record giving the appearance of a totally flat-faced record. For the purpose of <b>compression</b> <b>moulding,</b> which is the process by which records are pressed, the face of the record does indeed have a contour and a cross-sectional view of a 12-inch record will reveal that it is wedge shaped from the centre to the edge. The lack of obvious contour in the groove area {{on the face of the}} record closely replicates the original disc surface and reduces playback errors. Pressing records with this profile was mandatory for a record to bear the [...] "DMM" [...] logo. DMM licensees that did not use this profile were unable to use the DMM logo on its products, but were of course free to use terms such as [...] "Mastered on Copper" [...] as did EMI Australia when not using the DMM-profiled moulds or when cutting a DMM master for another record manufacturer.

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{determine}} the thermo-mechanical properties of <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> composite parts. The flow-induced fibre orientation is first calculated by numerical simulation, and the resulting orientation state is used as input in a micromechanical model that predicts the thermo-mechanical properties of the part. A two-step homogenization scheme based on the grain model approach is followed. First, the properties of a reference composite with aligned fibres are estimated {{by means of a}} mixture rule between the upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman bounds (derived by Willis). This method is in agreement with the Mori-Tanaka estimates for moderate concentrations, and gives better results for higher concentrations. Next, the properties of the composite are obtained by averaging several reference composites with different fibre directions.

40|$|Two {{procedures}} {{conducive to}} blending wheat gluten with other polymers {{in view of}} enhancing the mechanical properties of rigid gluten materials, were investigated. Method 1 involved extrusion of an aqueous gluten dough at 30 – 110 °C. In method 2, gluten was processed in 70 % ethanol at temperatures ≤ 130 °C in a pressurised reactor. After solvent removal, the dried powders were <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> into products exhibiting fewer defects than gluten moulded directly without any pre-treatment, suggesting that application of either method improved polymer flow. In temperature regimes where little or no crosslinking occurred during the shear treatments, the mechanical properties of <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> samples were also better than those of directly moulded gluten. Further improvements were observed when glutenin aggregates depolymerised via breaking of disulfide bonds. This occurred in method 2 at temperatures exceeding 90 °C. Materials processed via method 2 at 110 °C displayed {{a high level of}} strain hardening in compression tests, which suggests an increase in molecular entanglements. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The polymer {{composites}} {{consist of}} phenolic resin, natural graphite, carbon fiber and copper powder, are fabricated by hot <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> or <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing. The density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites are analyzed {{to determine the}} influences of post-curing temperature and preparing method on the physical, electrical and mechanical properties of composites. It is found that the density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites increase with increasing post-curing temperature for composites prepared by <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing. The flexural strength is more strongly dependent on post-curing temperature. At 170 ℃, the density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites were 1. 85 g/cm 3, 2. 94 × 103 S/m and 40 MPa respectively. The cross-linking skeleton structure well established in the composites could be {{the main reason for}} the largely increasing of flexural strength as post-curing temperature increases. The results also show that the properties of composites prepared by hot <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> are higher than those of composites prepared by <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing...|$|E

40|$|DC {{conductivity}} {{measurements are}} important for gain- ing fundamental understanding of conduction mecha- nisms of insulation materials, {{as well as in}} the develop- ment of HVDC power system components, such as extruded cable systems. In this study, the influence of sample processing on the morphology and DC conduc- tivity of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been studied. Direct <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> of LDPE pellets is commonly used in research laboratories for obtaining plaque samples, whereas extrusion is an additional commonly used technique for dispersion of particles in nanocomposites prior to the <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> process. In this study LDPE plaques have been obtained by either <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> directly from pellets, or by extrusion followed by <b>compression</b> <b>moulding.</b> The morphology obtained in the first case consisted of band- ed spherulites, whereas the latter method yielded a mor- phology of small axialites. The difference in sample processing had also an impact on the DC conductivity. The DC conductivity at 22 °C and 3. 3 kV mm- 1 was of the order of 4 x 10 – 18 S m- 1 for the plaques obtained by extrusion and <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> whereas the plaques obtained by direct <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> ex- hibited a conductivity of 1 x 10 – 16 S m- 1.

40|$|Renewable and {{biodegradable}} bioplastics can {{be produced}} from biopolymers such as proteins. Animal blood is a by-product from meat processing and is rich in protein. It is dried into low value bloodmeal and is used as animal feed or fertiliser. Previous work has shown that bloodmeal can be converted into a thermoplastic using water, urea, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), sodium sulphite and triethylene glycol (TEG). To increase its range of applications and acceptance from consumers, the colour and odour was removed from bloodmeal using peracetic acid (PAA). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the bioplastic processing of 3 - 5 % (w/w) PAA treated bloodmeal. 3 - 5 % PAA treated bloodmeal powder was <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> using different combinations of water, TEG, glycerol, SDS, sodium sulphite, urea, borax, salt and sodium silicate at concentrations up to 60 parts per hundred bloodmeal (pphBM). Partially consolidated extrudates and fully consolidated <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> sheets were obtained using a combination of water, TEG and SDS. 4 % PAA treated bloodmeal produced the best <b>compression</b> <b>moulded</b> sheets and extrudates and was chosen for investigating the effects of water, TEG and SDS concentration on consolidation, specific mechanical energy input (SME) and product colour during extrusion. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed SDS was the most important factor influencing its ability to be extruded because it detangled protein chains and allowed them to form new stabilising interactions required for consolidation.

40|$|Problem statement. Improvement of {{thermoelectric}} {{figure of}} merit is connected with the usage of nanostructured thermoelectric materials fabricated from powders by the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method. Preservation of powder nanostructure during sintering is possible at optimum temperature modes of thermoelectrics fabrication. The choice of these modes becomes complicated because of anisotropic properties of semiconductor thermoelectric materials. The decision of the given problem by sintering process simulation demands the competent approach to the problem formulation, a correct specification of thermoelectric properties, the properties of materials forming working installation, and also corrects boundary conditions. The paper deals with the efficient model for sintering of thermoelectrics. Methods. Sintering process of the bismuth telluride thermoelectric material by means of SPS- 511 S installation is considered. Temperature dependences of electric and thermal conductivities of bismuth telluride, and also temperature dependences of installation elements materials are taken into account. It is shown that temperature distribution in the sample can be defined {{within the limits of}} a stationary problem. The simulation is carried out in the software product Comsol Multiphysics. Boundary conditions include convective heat exchange and also radiation under Stefan-Boltzmann law. Results. Computer simulation of electric and thermal processes at spark plasma sintering is carried out. Temperature and electric potential distributions in a sample are obtained at the sintering conditions. Determinative role of graphite <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> in formation of the temperature field in samples is shown.

This paper presents gas injection parameter studies on polypropylene based recycled glass mat-reinforced thermoplastic (GMT).

Although <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> was performed at 191 °C, thermal degradation was not apparent and materials with good tensile properties could be obtained. For compression-moulded poly(ST–TMC–ST) specimens containing approximately 16 mol % lactide, the values for E-modulus, yield stress and elongation at break were respectively 17, 1. 7 MPa and 90 %. Also a very low long-term creep rate of 2. 2 × 10 – 7 s– 1 was determined when specimens were loaded to 20 % of the yield stress. When compared with compression-moulded poly(TMC), poly(ST–TMC–ST) specimens deform {{at a rate that}} is one to two orders of magnitude lower. Furthermore, poly(ST–TMC–ST) specimens showed complete dimensional recovery within 24 h after loading to 20 % and 40 % of the yield stress for 40 and 5. 5 h, respectively.
