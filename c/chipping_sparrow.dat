He wore a chestnut cap, almost exactly like that of Chippy the <b>Chipping</b> <b>Sparrow.</b> It reminded Peter that Dotty is often called the Winter Chippy.|$|E
6000|$|Johnny grinned. [...] "Listen!" [...] said Johnny. Peter listened. From a tree just {{a little}} way off came a clear [...] "Chip, chip, chip, chip." [...] Peter didn't {{need to be told}} to look. He knew without looking who was over there. He knew that voice for that of one of his oldest and best friends in the Old Orchard, a little fellow with a red-brown cap, brown back with {{feathers}} streaked with black, brownish wings and tail, a gray waistcoat and black bill, and a little white line over each eye--altogether as trim a little gentleman as Peter was acquainted with. It was Chippy, as everybody calls the <b>Chipping</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> the smallest of the family.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Peter, {{looking at}} Teacher thoughtfully, [...] "they've given you that name {{because you are}} dressed {{something}} like the Thrushes. That olive-green coat, and white waistcoat all streaked and spotted with black, certainly does {{remind me of the}} Thrush family. If you were not so much smaller than any of the Thrushes I should almost think you were one myself. Why, you are not very much bigger than Chippy the <b>Chipping</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> only you've got longer legs. I suppose that's because you spend so much time on the ground. I think that just Teacher is the best name for you. No one who has once heard you could ever mistake you for any one else. By the way, Teacher, where did you say your nest is?" ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{they are}} wary, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> often allow close approach. A quiet {{observer}} can often get to within 50 - 100 ft {{of one or}} more <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> feeding on the ground. When spooked, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> fly a short distance to the nearest tree or fencerow.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the year, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> forage on {{the ground}} in covered areas, often in loose flocks. Their diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds and crumbs of mostly any food, especially those fallen {{on the ground}}. <b>Chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> frequently forage directly from forbs and grasses, too. At any time of the year, especially, in spring, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> may be seen in trees, even up in the canopy, where they forage on fresh buds and glean for arboreal arthropods.|$|R
50|$|These birds {{migrate to}} the United States or {{southern}} Canada to spend the winter. Usually, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> are moving south {{around the same time}} as these birds arrive.|$|R
50|$|Chipping sparrows vary {{across their}} {{extensive}} North American range. There is minor geographic variation in appearance, {{and there is}} significant geographic variation in behavior. Ornithologists often divide the <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> into two major groups: the eastern <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> and the western <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow.</b> However, there is additional plumage and behavioral variation within the western group.|$|E
50|$|In 1894, Watson {{submitted}} a note regarding the taming of a <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{which was published}} in The Auk.|$|E
50|$|At {{least two}} {{subspecies}} of chipping sparrows occur in western North America. The widespread Spizella passerina arizonae {{is associated with}} mountains and arid habitats of the western interior. A Pacific slope population constitutes subspecies S. p. stridula. Although these two races are both western, and are often lumped together as the western <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow,</b> they do not necessarily form a single entity that stands apart from the eastern <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> (S. p. passerina).|$|E
50|$|Juvenile <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> are {{prominently}} streaked below. Like non-breeding adults, {{they show}} a dark eye-line, extending both {{in front of}} and behind the eye. The brownish cap and dusky eyebrow are variable but generally obscure in juveniles.|$|R
50|$|In the winter, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> are gregarious {{and form}} flocks, {{sometimes}} associating with other bird species. They mostly forage {{on the ground}} for seeds and other food items, as well as clambering on plants and trees, feeding on buds and small arthropods. In the west of their range they breed mainly in coniferous forests, but in the east, they choose woodland, farmland, parks and gardens. Breeding starts in late April and May and the nest is often built in a tree.|$|R
5000|$|The song is a trill {{similar to}} the <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow's</b> (Spizella passerina), except that the red-backed junco's (see below) song is more complex, {{similar to that of}} the yellow-eyed junco (Junco phaeonotus). The call also resembles that of the black-throated blue warbler's, which is a member of the New World warbler family. Calls include tick sounds and very high-pitched tinkling chips. [...] It is known among bird {{language}} practitioners as an excellent bird to study for learning [...] "bird language." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Spizella passerina) is {{a species}} of American sparrow, a {{passerine}} bird in the family Emberizidae. It is widespread, fairly tame, and common across most of its North American range. There are two subspecies, the eastern <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> and the western <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow.</b> This bird is a partial migrant with northerly populations flying southwards in the fall to overwinter in Mexico and the southern United States, and flying northward again in spring. It molts twice a year. In its breeding plumage it has orangish-rust upper parts, gray head and underparts and a distinctive reddish cap. In non-breeding plumage, the cap is brown and the facial markings are less distinct. The song is a trill and the bird has a piercing flight call that can be heard while it is migrating at night.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is part of}} {{the family}} Emberizidae, and is not closely related to the Old World sparrows of the family Passeridae.|$|E
50|$|In eastern North America, {{chipping}} sparrows {{breed in}} woodlands, farmlands, and suburban and urban districts. In western North America, the <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> prefers conifer forests for breeding. The <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> is partially migratory, with almost all mid-latitude and high-latitude breeders withdrawing in winter {{to the southern}} United States and Mexico. On the wintering grounds and during migration, chipping sparrows are gregarious, forming tight flocks with other chipping sparrows or loose assemblages with other species such as eastern bluebirds and pine warblers.|$|E
50|$|Adults have {{light brown}} upperparts and pale underparts, with darker streaks on the back. They have a pale crown stripe {{on a dark}} brown crown, a white line over the eyes, a dark line through the eyes, a light brown cheek patch and brown wings with wing bars. The short bill is pale with a dark tip {{and the back of}} the neck is grey; they have a long tail. Non-breeding adults and {{immature}} resemble <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> and Brewer's sparrows; they often form flocks with these birds outside of the nesting season.|$|R
5000|$|In her {{autobiography}} Research Is a Passion With Me (1979), {{she wrote}} that [...] "the most cherished Christmas present {{of my life}} came in 1895. Mabel Osgood Wright's Bird-Craft." [...] This book had color illustrations of birds and it guided her to keep notes on local birds when she was twelve years old. With careful note making she was even able to compare her notes taken when she was 13 years old and compare the rates of fledgling success of young American robins, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows,</b> and least flycatchers 61 years later.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the forest}} around the lake, {{there are large}} numbers of {{northern}} flickers, American robins, hermit thrushes, mountain chickadees, dark-eyed juncos, western tanagers, red-breasted nuthatches, yellow-rumped warblers, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows,</b> song sparrows, red crossbills, golden-crowned kinglets, ruby-crowned kinglet, Townsend's solitaire, and Steller's jays. [...] The forest {{is also home to}} western wood pewee, olive-sided flycatcher, Hammond's flycatcher, American dusky flycatcher, warbling vireo, brown creeper, brown-headed cowbird, and pine siskin. [...] Pileated woodpeckers and hairy woodpeckers have been abundant in the forest around the lake since the 1990s when the spruce budworm infestation increased the insect population they feed on.|$|R
50|$|The song is a dry, {{chipping}} trill of 2-3 seconds {{duration and}} {{is described as}} a cross between that of the field sparrow and that of the <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The song of {{the swamp}} sparrow is a slow {{monotone}} trill, slower {{than that of the}} <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow.</b> A male can have a repertoire of several different trills. The common call note is a loud chip reminiscent of a phoebe.|$|E
5000|$|Molt in the <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{follows the}} [...] "Complex Alternate Strategy" [...] as usual for American sparrows. It {{consequently}} has two molts per year as adults and three molts {{in their first}} year of life, also called their first plumage-cycle. The chipping sparrow's two adult molts occur in late summer and late winter.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 118 species were seen by 60 Nebraska birders {{and a few}} from other states, in the Nebraska National Forest near Halsey, Thomas County where the Forest is located, and three other nearby counties, Blaine, Cherry, and Brown (see Table 1). There was a nice variety of forest, lake, riparian, wetland, and sandhill habitats. Notable {{sightings}} were a subadult Mississippi Kite in the camp area of the Forest and along the Middle Loup River west of the bridge, and a White-faced Ibis. Ruth Green banded House Wrens, 1 Gray Catbird, 1 Yellow-breasted Chat, 2 Rufous-sided Towhees, 64 <b>Chipping</b> <b>Sparrows,</b> 2 Clay-colored Sparrows, and 20 Field Sparrows...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic sounds {{influence}} animal vocal behaviour, species distributions, {{and community}} assemblages. Natural sounds {{also have the}} potential to affect the behaviour and ecology of animals, but it is currently unknown if the effects of natural sounds match those of anthropogenic sounds. Here, we quantified and compared the effects of natural and anthropogenic sounds on avian song performance by calculating trade-off frontiers based on trill rate and bandwidth of 2 emberizid species. <b>Chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella passerina) and white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia luecophrys) were recorded in areas with and without anthropogenic sound and along a natural sounds gradient generated from ocean surf, respectively. We analysed individuals’ song performance relative to the trade-off frontier and found that both species vocalizing in environments with louder background sounds sang songs that were significantly further below the trade-off frontier than songs sung by birds in quiet settings. <b>Chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> vocalizing in noisy areas sang almost twice as far below the trade-off frontier than individuals in quiet areas, and white-crowned sparrow song performance declined by ~ 25 % with each 3 dB(A) increase in environmental sounds, or halving the size of a signaller’s listening area. These results suggest that natural and anthropogenic sounds can {{have a significant effect on}} song performance, a trait known to influence the outcome of malemale contests and influence female mate choices. Considering that natural sounds are pervasive, quiet acoustic refuges may be far more important than previously thought, and anthropogenic development may be infringing on larger portions of prime habitat than we realize...|$|R
50|$|C. virens {{makes an}} open cup nest made of grasses, bark, and lichen, {{attached}} to a horizontal tree branch with spider webs. Nest sites range in height from 15 to 60 ft, but average around 30 ft. Common nest trees used include oaks (Quercus), pines (Pinus), birches (Betula), and maples (Acer). The female lays almost always three (sometimes two) translucent-white eggs with brown flecking concentrated towards the larger end of the ovate egg. Males are territorial and defend the nesting area aggressively, often fighting with neighbouring conspecifics and even pursue attacks on other species (e.g., least flycatchers, American robins, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows,</b> red-eyed vireos, etc.). Males can sometimes be polygynous, mating with two females, simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Wildlife {{commonly}} seen in {{the area}} of the park include hawks, pelicans and other water birds, including Clark’s, Western, and eared grebes and black tern. Numbered among the forest birds are western tanager, yellow-rumped warbler, house wren, <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow,</b> and Cassin's vireo.

50|$|Adults have a rusty cap and grey underparts {{with a small}} {{dark spot}} on the breast. They have a rusty back with lighter stripes, brown wings with white bars and a slim tail. Their face is grey with a rusty line through the eye. Their flanks are splashed with light brown. They are similar in {{appearance}} to the <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is {{abundant}} birdlife in the Macal Basin; for example, in the Mountain Pine Ridge sub-watershed alone are found: the rufous-capped warbler, crossbill, pine siskin and eastern bluebird. Between autumn and spring, the hepatic tanager and <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> are also evident. Raptors hunt among the valleys of Mountain Pine Ridge, and affords the most probable location in Belize {{to observe the}} orange-breasted falcon.|$|E
40|$|Natural History & EvolutionIn {{some species}} of birds male and female plumage {{reflects}} differently in the UV spectrum. This “hidden” (to the human eye) form of sexual dichromatism has been uncovered through advances in reflectance spectrometry. We were interested in crown color as a potentially UV dichromatic sexually selected trait in <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows.</b> We studied sexual dichromatism in the UV and visible spectrums, as well as correlations between crown color and morphology. In our study sample of live birds and dead museum specimens there was {{no statistically significant difference}} between males and females in the UV or visible spectrums, however there was a trend towards dichromatism in UV hue. We also found a significant correlation between male wing length and UV hue as well as a significant degree of sexual dimorphism in wing length. Previous studies relating dimorphism in wing length to sexual dichromatism may support the trend in sexual dichromatism...|$|R
40|$|Hazards of DRC- 1339 treated {{brown rice}} to non-target birds were {{assessed}} during an operational baiting program near Point Blue, Louisiana, USA. The predominant non-target birds using DRC- 1339 bait sites and surrounding habitat were savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), killdeers (Charadrius rociferus), and unidentified sparrows (Fringillidae). Systematic searches of DRC- 1339 bait sites and adjacent habitat for non-target dead or affected birds produced 1 northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). There was no mortality of potential non-target species, savannah sparrows, white-crown sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) and <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella passerina) that {{were held in}} captivity and offered only 2 % DRC- 1339 treated brown rice diluted 1 : 27 with untreated brown rice for 1 and 12 h each day for 5 days. There was no hazard of DRC- 1339 to most non-target species using the test areas...|$|R
40|$|Identifying species {{responsible}} for crop damage {{is an important}} first step in developing management strategies. Previous studies have surveyed bird species flying through cherry orchards but have not documented which species were consuming cherries. We conducted traditional surveys and behavioral observations in orchards of sweet cherries (Prunus avium) and tart cherries (Prunus cerasus) in Michigan during 2010 to compare results from the 2 techniques. American robins (Turdus migratorius) were detected most frequently during sweet cherry surveys, while behavioral observations showed that cedar waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) consumed more sweet cherries than did robins. <b>Chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella passerina) were the most commonly detected species during tart cherry surveys, while observations showed that American robins and common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) consumed the most tart cherries. Although observational work is more labor-intensive than surveys, observations are more likely to provide accurate information on the relative importance of fruit-consuming species...|$|R
50|$|The flight {{call of the}} <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is heard}} year-round. Its flight call is {{piercing}} and pure-tone, lasting about 50 milliseconds. It starts out around 9 kHz, then falls to 7 kHz, then rises again to 9 kHz. The flight call may be transliterated as seen? Chipping sparrows migrate by night, and their flight calls are a characteristic sound {{of the night sky}} in spring and fall in the United States. In the southern Rockies and eastern Great Plains, the <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> appears to be the most common nocturnal migrant, judged by the number of flight calls detected per hour. On typical nights in August in this region, chipping sparrows may be heard at a rate of 15 flight calls per hour. On better-than-average nights, chipping sparrows occur at a rate of 60 flight calls per hour, and on exceptional nights chipping sparrows' flight calls are heard more than 200 times per hour.|$|E
50|$|The song is a trill that varies {{considerably}} among birds {{within any}} particular region. Two broad classes {{of variation in}} {{the song of the}} <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow</b> are the fast trill and the slow trill. Individual elements in the fast trill are run together about twice as fast as in the slow trill; the fast trill sounds like a buzz or like someone snoring, whereas the slow trill sounds like rapid finger-tapping. Individual elements in the trill are very similar to a high pitch chi chi chi call.|$|E
50|$|Native {{species of}} bird include the rufous-capped warbler, common crossbill, pine siskin, eastern bluebird, stygian owl, king vulture, ocellated turkey, acorn woodpecker, Lesson's motmot, plumbeous vireo, keel-billed toucan and red-lored parrot. Winter {{visitors}} include the hepatic tanager and <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrow.</b> Orange-breasted falcons {{are more common}} in the area than elsewhere in Belize. Other fauna present in the reserve are the frog species Rana juliani (which is restricted to the Maya Mountains) and Eleutherodactylus sandersoni, and the fish species Poecilia teresae. The pine forest has been seriously damaged by the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis, with 80% of the trees showing signs of attack.|$|E
40|$|The {{duration}} of songs and the intervals between these songs are more variable when wild, adult, free-ranging <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows</b> sing at dawn {{than when they}} sing during the day. The more variable delivery is used to interact with males, and the stereotyped delivery is used to attract females. In captive birds, however, the variability observed at dawn persists during the day. We quantified the expression of an immediate early gene, ZENK, in wild and captive birds {{and found that the}} level of song-associated ZENK expression in two song nuclei, Area X and lMAN, was positively related to variability in song duration and intersong interval and could be dissociated from the social context in which the song occurred. Thus, a combination of field and laboratory approaches helped us identify nuclei, context, and behavioral features associated with a change in gene expression thought to be a marker of behavioral variability...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} bird predation on insect pest populations within two cornfields of Southwestern Quebec. Birds were excluded from portions of these fields {{through the use of}} bird-proof netting. Rhopalosiphum maidis, Ostrinia nubilalis, Agrotis spp. and Sphenophorus spp. were all found at greater densities in plots where birds were excluded as compared with the non covered plots. Only the adult Diabrotica longicornis population was not reduced by birds. Results significantly suggest that birds can reduce insect pest populations. Bird visits in cornfields with respect to distance from field edge, type of edge habitat and corn phenology were also studied. Red-winged Blackbird, Song and <b>Chipping</b> <b>Sparrows</b> and American Robin were the most frequently observed bird species inside cornfields. Early in the summer, birds tended to stay closer to the field edge, especially when composed of mature coniferous trees. Different bird species visited the cornfields at specific periods during corn development...|$|R
5000|$|The Doub Farm {{supports}} abundant wildlife. Large {{herds of}} deer are common. [...] "Piebald" [...] deer are occasionally seen. Peyton Doub has noted {{over the years}} numerous groundhogs, skunks, possums, cottontail rabbits, red and yellow foxes, and coyotes. Increasing numbers of grey squirrels are present, likely resulting from the many oaks that the Doubs have planted on the property. Mr. Doub, an avid birder, has noted most common birds of Maryland on the property. Especially common are northern cardinals, blue jays, eastern bluebirds, northern starlings, house finches, song <b>sparrows,</b> <b>chipping</b> <b>sparrows,</b> northern juncos, Carolina chickadees, eastern phoebes, red bellied woodpeckers, pileated woodpeckers, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, and eastern goldfinches. Large numbers of turkey vultures often congregate on trees. Red-tailed hawks have established territories in the front pasture. Large clusters of deep groundhog burrows are present, indicative of large underground colonies. Mr. Doub also commonly sees wild turkeys and an occasional ring-neck pheasant. Venturing out at night on the Doub Farm one will frequently hear barred owls, great horned owls, and barn owls. Brian Baker, who rents and farms much of the land, has anecdotally spoken of black bears and mountain lions in the area.|$|R
