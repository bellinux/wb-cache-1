He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated.

5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.|$|E

The Mishnat ha-Middot {{has nothing}} in common with the Baraita cited by the old scholars under that name: for the citations leave no doubt that the Baraita, even in its mathematical parts, was founded on the Bible; whereas the Mishnat ha-Middot is a purely secular work, and, possibly, it drew upon the same source as did Mohammed b. Musa, the oldest Arabic mathematician. The plea that the Mishnat ha-Middot has not been preserved in its entirety, and that in its original form there were references to the Bible for special points, is of no weight, since it is absolutely incomprehensible that haggadic or halakic matter should fit into the frame of the work as it now is.|$|E
25|$|According to Silva Lake, textual critic, it {{is hardly}} to prove it have been written earlier than the year 1000, and is perhaps {{as late as the}} middle of the {{eleventh}} century. This assessment was based rather on the textual dependency from other manuscript, members of the family Π, than on the palaeographical ground (variations of letter forms). According to Silva codex 1219 represents text of the family Π in its earlier stage than Codex Cyprius. Cyprius could be copied from the codex 1219 (Gregory-Aland) or copy of codex 1219 (Lake's hypothetical codex b).

25|$|Now, in {{the chapter}} on Pangenesis in my Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any {{circulating}} system. It is, indeed, obvious {{that the presence of}} gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, , are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1918, Dr. Cadbury treated lepers, {{who were}} outpatients in the Canton Hospital leprosy clinic, for one year. The Canton Hospital {{was the first}} to have an {{organized}} leprosy clinic in China. He injected these patients with a mixture of chaulmoogra oil, resorcin, and camphorated oil. Then, he reported the results in The China Medical Journal in 1920. He wrote:"We must state that the various remedies, as outlined above, while in most cases of leprosy they have definite therapeutic value, yet unless the patients are cared for in a sanatorium, given proper food, together with baths and attention to personal hygiene, a complete cure <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> looked for."In 1926, Dr. Cadbury tackled widespread issue of Chinese children not knowing their birth dates. He collected information from 1013 Cantonese children. His calculations to estimate the ages of these children revealed an understanding of the customs of the Canton people. For example, he learned that most of the children claimed they were born in August, September, and October most likely due to the tradition that Canton merchants were gone for most of the year except around Chinese New Year.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, at {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, Napoleon ordered Ney to capture La Haye Sainte at whatever the cost. Ney accomplished this with what was left of D'Erlon's corps soon after 18:00. Ney then moved horse artillery up towards Wellington's centre and began to destroy the infantry squares at short-range with canister. This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square. Wellington's centre was now {{on the verge of collapse}} and wide open to an attack from the French. Luckily for Wellington, Pirch I's and Zieten's corps of the Prussian Army were now at hand. Zieten's corps permitted the two fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on Wellington's extreme left to be moved and posted behind the depleted centre. Pirch I Corps then proceeded to support Bülow and together they regained possession of Plancenoit, and once more the Charleroi road was swept by Prussian round shot. The value of this reinforcement at this particular moment <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> overestimated.|$|E

25|$|The extravagant {{administration}} of Ismail, for which perhaps Nubar <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> held wholly responsible, had brought Egypt to {{the verge of}} bankruptcy, and Ismail's disregard of the judgments of the Court at last compelled Great Britain and France to interfere. Under pressure, Ismail, who began to regret {{the establishment of the}} International Courts, assented to a mixed ministry under Nubar, with Charles Rivers Wilson as minister of finance and the Marquis de Blignières as minister of public works. Nubar, finding himself supported by both Great Britain and France, tried to reduce Ismail to the position of a constitutional monarch, and Ismail, with an astuteness worthy of a better cause, took advantage of a somewhat injudicious disbandment of certain regiments to incite a military rising against the ministry. The governments of Great Britain and France, instead of supporting the ministry against the khedive, weakly consented to Nubar's dismissal; but when this was shortly followed by that of Rivers Wilson and de Blignières they realized that the situation was a critical one, and they succeeded in obtaining from the sultan the deposition of Ismail and the substitution of his son Tawfiq as khedive (1879). Nubar remained out of office until 1884.|$|E
25|$|Xenocrates {{recognized}} three {{grades of}} cognition, each appropriated to {{a region of}} its own: knowledge, sensation, and opinion. He referred knowledge (episteme) to that essence which {{is the object of}} pure thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation (aisthesis) to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion (doxa) to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense, and endeavoured, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception. All three modes of apprehension partake of truth; but in what manner scientific perception (epistemonike aisthesis) did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates's preference for symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above three stages of knowledge with the three Fates: Atropos, Clotho, and Lachesis. We know nothing further about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his dialectic, as it is probable that what was peculiar to Aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it, for it <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> doubted that the division of the existent into the absolutely existent, and the relatively existent, attributed to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of categories.|$|E
25|$|Dr Oliver, I was told, … had a liking and a ′flair′ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject. Dr Oliver had invented a small instrument with which he claimed to be able to measure, through the unbroken skin, the diameter of a living artery, such as the radial artery at the wrist. He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. … We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, … finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. … To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, with the statement that injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf’s suprarenal gland was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery. Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. … He <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>be</b> blamed, I think; knowing even what we now know about the action of this extract, which of us would be prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy’s skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E
