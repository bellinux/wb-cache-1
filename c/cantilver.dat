5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{preceded the}} US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, but {{fits into the}} category, including FAR 103's maximum empty weight of 254 lb. The aircraft has a standard empty weight of 200 lb. It features a <b>cantilver</b> high-wing, a single-seat, partially enclosed cockpit, tricycle landing gear and twin [...] Soarmaster engines powering a single propeller in pusher configuration. Twin go-cart engines have also been employed.|$|E
50|$|The G-1 was {{designed}} in 1941 and 1942 {{and was a}} ten-seat semi-monocoque wooden glider. The fuselage was covered with 2-ply molded plywood with the rudder and elevators fabric covered. The single-spar <b>cantilver</b> wing had spoilers on the upper surface. The cockpit had dual controls for a pilot and co-pilot in tandem and the enclosure had framed transparent plastic panels for increased visibility, the cockpit enclosure could be removed to allow access and was jettisonable in an emergency. The rear fuselage had room for eight passengers with a large door on the right-hand side, the plastic windows in the fuselage had gun ports to allow the troops to fire rifles during the flight. One prototype was built with parts produced for a further ten gliders, only the prototype flew and the other ten were not assembled.|$|E
40|$|WO 2004102583 A UPAB: 20050112 NOVELTY - The method uses an {{acoustic}} coupling medium (7) between the sprung cantilever (3) and an underlying surface which {{is subjected to}} linearly polarized lateral oscillations, for excitation of free torsional oscillations in the sprung cantilever. The polarization axis of the lateral oscillations is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the sprung cantilever. USE - The method is used for exciting free torsional oscillations in a sprung <b>cantilver</b> of an atomic force microscope for elasticity measurements. ADVANTAGE - Method provides simple free torsional oscillation of sprung cantilever having a length of 6 cm or less...|$|E
50|$|One {{signature}} {{aspect of}} 150 North Riverside building {{is the way}} the office floors cantilever out from the central core. The building is constructed with a smaller base for a height of 8 stories (104ft), but the building <b>cantilvers</b> out to the full size of the office floor space.|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, atomic force {{acoustic}} microscopy (AFAM), an advanced scanning probe microscopy technique, has played a promising role in materials characterization with a good lateral resolution at micro/nano dimensions. AFAM is based on inducing out-of-plane vibrations in the specimen, which are generated by an ultrasonic transducer. The vibrations are sensed by the AFM cantilever when its tip is {{in contact with the}} material under test. From the <b>cantilverâ€™s</b> contactresonance spectra, one determines the real and the imaginary part of the contact stiffness k*, and then from these two quantities the local indentation modulus M' and the local damping factor Qloc- 1 can be obtained with a spatial resolution of less than 10 nm. Here, we present measured data of M' and of Qloc- 1 for the insulating amorphous material, a-SiO 2. The amorphous SiO 2 layer was prepared on a crystalline Si wafer by means of thermal oxidation. There is a spatial distribution of the indentation modulus M' and of the internal friction Qloc- 1. This is a consequence of the potential energy landscape for amorphous materials...|$|R
40|$|When cyclic high {{overturning}} momens {{induced by}} a strong earthquake excitations make a footing of a large cantilever shear wall situated in a general framed structure rotate and uplift in a limit state, interactive response properties between the uplifting shear wall and the other peripheral frames may cause the seismic behavior of the framed structure to differ from a simple behavior of either a flexural frame or an isolated uplifting shear wall. Then, in order to reasonably establish a seismic design philosophy for a medium-rise reinforced concrete structure which consists of some flexural frames and one or more large <b>cantilver</b> shear walls, the fundamental seismic response analysis of an idealized multi-degrees-of-freedom system having the nonlinear story stiffnesses derived from the instantaneous stiffness matrix which is incrementally determined {{by a variety of}} the mechanical models proposed in this paper is exmined for appropriate analytical models and not only the quantitative factors influencing the seismic stability of the framed structure are carried out but also the peculiar properties of the response under real strong earth-quake excitations are discussed...|$|E
