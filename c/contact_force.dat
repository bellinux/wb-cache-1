5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{differences in}} ACL reconstructed (ACLR) and healthy individuals {{in terms of}} the magnitude of the tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>forces,</b> as well as the relative muscle and external load contributions to those <b>contact</b> <b>forces,</b> during walking, running and sidestepping gait tasks. METHODS: A computational electromyography-driven neuromusculoskeletal model was used to estimate the muscle and tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> in those with combined semitendinosus and gracilis tendon autograft ACLR (n= 104, 29. 7 ± 6. 5 years, 78. 1 ± 14. 4 kg) and healthy controls (n= 60, 27. 5 ± 5. 4 years, 67. 8 ± 14. 0 kg) during walking (1. 4 ± 0. 2 ms), running (4. 5 ± 0. 5 ms) and sidestepping (3. 7 ± 0. 6 ms). Within the computational model, the semitendinosus of ACLR participants was adjusted to account for literature reported strength deficits and morphological changes subsequent to autograft harvesting. RESULTS: ACLRs had smaller maximum total and medial tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> (~ 80 % of control values, scaled to bodyweight) during the different gait tasks. Compared to controls, ACLRs were found to have a smaller maximum knee flexion moment, which explained the smaller tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>forces.</b> Similarly, compared to controls, ACLRs had both a smaller maximum knee flexion angle and knee flexion excursion during running and sidestepping, which may have concentrated the articular <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> to smaller areas within the tibiofemoral joint. Mean relative muscle and external load contributions to the tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> were not significantly different between ACLRs and controls. CONCLUSION: ACLRs had lower bodyweight-scaled tibiofemoral <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> during walking, running and sidestepping, likely due to lower knee flexion moments and straighter knee during the different gait tasks. The relative contributions of muscles and external loads to the <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> were equivalent between groups...|$|R

50|$|Surface <b>forces</b> or <b>contact</b> <b>forces,</b> {{expressed}} as force per unit area, can act {{either on the}} bounding surface of the body, {{as a result of}} mechanical contact with other bodies, or on imaginary internal surfaces that bound portions of the body, {{as a result of the}} mechanical interaction between the parts of the body to either side of the surface (Euler-Cauchy's stress principle). When a body is acted upon by external <b>contact</b> <b>forces,</b> internal <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> are then transmitted from point to point inside the body to balance their action, according to Newton's third law of motion of conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum (for continuous bodies these laws are called the Euler's equations of motion).

Hertz was attempting to understand how the optical properties of multiple, stacked lenses might change with the force holding them together. Hertzian contact stress refers to the localized stresses that develop as two curved surfaces come in contact and deform slightly under the imposed loads. This amount of deformation is dependent on the modulus of elasticity of the material in contact. It gives the contact stress {{as a function of the}} normal <b>contact</b> <b>force,</b> the radii of curvature of both bodies and the modulus of elasticity of both bodies.

2500|$|Weight2: Weight {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} as that quantity which is measured when one uses scales. What is being measured there is the force exerted by the body on the scales. In a standard weighing operation, the body being weighed {{is in a state}} of equilibrium as a result of a force exerted on it by the weighing machine cancelling the gravitational field. By Newton's 3rd law, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the body on the machine. This force is called weight2. The force is not gravitational. Typically, it is a <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> and not uniform across the mass of the body. [...] If the body is placed on the scales in a lift (an elevator) in free fall in pure uniform gravity, the scale would read zero, and the body said to be weightless i.e. its weight2 = 0. This describes the condition in which the body is stress free and undeformed. This is the weightlessness in free fall in a uniform gravitational field. (The situation is more complicated when the gravitational field is not uniform, or, when a body is subject to multiple forces which may, for instance, cancel each other and produce a state of stress albeit weight2 being zero. See below.) ...|$|E
