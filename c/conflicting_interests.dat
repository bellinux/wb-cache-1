5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to <b>conflicting</b> <b>interests</b> and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
5|$|Expansion on {{the campus}} {{continued}} rapidly, with new buildings, institutes and expansions being added nearly every year. But by the late 1970s, the university faced a crisis. During its fast expansion, it relied on draft bylaws, mostly borrowed from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, and lacked formal internal regulations with the aging Zeferino Vaz, while no longer the rector, acting as a moderating force between parties with <b>conflicting</b> <b>interests,</b> in particular the leftist academic community and the State's government, appointed by the conservative military regime ruling the country.|$|E
5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have <b>conflicting</b> <b>interests.</b> Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E

5|$|Much of Suffolk's early {{activity}} in East Anglian local politics was probably at the instigation of his mother, Alice, {{and he would}} later spend as much {{of his adult life}} at her manor of Ewelme as he did at his own manors. Suffolk played a prominent role in Commissions of the Peace in Norfolk and Suffolk, and these became a permanent position from 1464. On at least two occasions, Suffolk attempted to affect the outcome of a local parliamentary election, and the appointment of the county sheriff. Furthermore, he was a justice of the peace in Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the later 1460s. He involved himself {{in some of the most}} controversial episodes in East Anglian society of the time, for instance, attempting to purchase part of the by-then somewhat infamous Fastolf inheritance in 1461. This was another occasion in fact where we may in fact see his mother's guiding hand at work, as she is known to have been canvassing for support at court for such an outcome, and even Margaret Paston believed her to be personally behind the attacks. Both of them were involved in a severe feud with the Paston family as a result of <b>conflicting</b> <b>interests</b> in the Fastolf inheritance. The duke also made other disputed (and in some cases outrightly illegal) claims to other properties in the region over the following decade, and in 1465, a group of his retainers destroyed the manor house of Hellesdon, ransacking its church. For these and other illegalities alleged by contemporaries, Suffolk escaped retribution, probably due to his royal connections. On the other hand, he was never able to use such connections to his advantage and persuade the king to intercede in any disputes on the duke's behalf.|$|E

25|$|In late 1889, Boqor Osman {{entered into}} a treaty with Italy, making his realm an Italian protectorate. His rival Sultan Kenadid had signed a similar {{agreement}} vis-a-vis his own Sultanate the year before. Both rulers had signed the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist objectives, with Boqor Osman looking to use Italy's support in his ongoing power struggle with Kenadid over the Majeerteen Sultanate. Boqor Osman and Sultan Kenadid also hoped to exploit the <b>conflicting</b> <b>interests</b> among the European imperial powers that were then looking to control the Somali peninsula, {{so as to avoid}} direct occupation of their territories by force.|$|E
25|$|In this environment, states Rosalind O'Hanlon, a {{professor}} of Indian History, the newly arrived colonial East India Company officials, attempted to gain commercial interests in India by balancing Hindu and Muslim <b>conflicting</b> <b>interests,</b> by aligning with regional rulers and large assemblies of military monks. The British Company officials adopted constitutional laws segregated by religion and caste. The legal code and colonial administrative practice was largely divided into Muslim law and Hindu law, the latter including laws for Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. In this transitory phase, Brahmins together with scribes, ascetics and merchants who accepted Hindu social and spiritual codes, became the deferred-to-authority on Hindu texts, law and administration of Hindu matters.|$|E
40|$|<b>Conflicts</b> of <b>{{interests}}</b> arise due to {{the fact}} that a personâs right to demand to act in his interests imposes a duty on another person to act in such a way. Different concepts of <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests</b> used in various sectors and their problems are analyzed in the article. Whereas there is no unified concept of <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests</b> used in practice it is unclear which types of relations are regarded as <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests,</b> when <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests</b> arises and what are the solutions to it. Due to these reasons universal concept of <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests</b> is constructed and elements of <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests</b> are analyzed in this article. The concept of <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests</b> is discussed in the context of agency theory in the broad sense, i. e. in the legal and economic sense. Theoretical model and types of <b>conflicts</b> of <b>interests</b> are particularly important while trying to solve <b>conflicts</b> of <b>interests.</b> There are two main categories of solutions: preventive and managing measures. Preventive measures are intended to avoid <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests</b> before it arises and managing measures are intended to manage already risen <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests</b> and to prevent negative consequences. The article concludes with the concept of <b>conflict</b> of <b>interests,</b> its types and solutions...|$|R

25|$|McDonnell (2006) shows a grave {{complication}} in Virginia's {{mobilization of}} troops was the <b>conflicting</b> <b>interests</b> of distinct social classes, which tended to undercut a unified {{commitment to the}} Patriot cause. The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, the middling yeomen (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion {{of the state in}} 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.|$|E
25|$|One of Broad's first {{challenges}} as an incoming minister was {{to deal with}} the fate of the Snowy River, which had diminished to a trickle as a result of being dammed for various purposes. Though it had been an environmental issue for many years, it became of particular concern to the Bracks government, as the issue was central to the support of independent Craig Ingram, who they relied on to retain a majority in parliament. It fell to Broad, as the relevant minister, to handle negotiations on the issue with both the federal and New South Wales state governments. Despite the involvement of a number of <b>conflicting</b> <b>interests,</b> a major agreement was reached between the three parties in October 2000. This saw A$160 million put towards regenerating the river, with the intention of increasing its water flow to 28% of its original capacity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conflicting</b> <b>interests</b> also existed within Australia, {{particularly}} in the northern colony of Queensland, where plantation owners sought to expand their holdings on the northern coastlands using imported cheap native labour. Local 'white' labourers objected to this as it undercut their wages and prospects, and the government also had some objections, preferring to establish a pattern of smaller farms operated by resident owners, rather than absentee landlords creating vast estates. Part of the squadron's duties included patrolling the waters between Queensland and the islands of New Guinea to prevent kidnapping and human trafficking of native labourers to supply new plantations. The South East corner of New Guinea around Port Moresby had only been annexed as a British protectorate the previous year (1884) by Commodore Erskine on behalf of Queen Victoria. The Germans had similarly claimed an area in the north-east corner of the island, and France was using New Caledonia as a penal colony. The convicts would {{from time to time}} escape to Australia where they would cause difficulties.|$|E
