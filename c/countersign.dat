25|$|Richelieu {{demanded that}} the King dismiss Vaublanc, {{threatening}} to resign if he did not. The King finally acquiesced, and, when he asked for the statute so he could <b>countersign</b> it, the episode (according to the account of Louis-Mathieu Molé) descended into farce.|$|E
25|$|The draft faced staunch {{opposition}} by royalist {{members of}} the convention, led by Kasem Chatikavanich. A new draft was demanded, granting the monarch greater power and increasing royal powers to the level granted by the 1949 constitution. The monarch would appoint a Senate with the <b>countersign</b> of the privy council president. The royal veto could be overridden only with a two-thirds majority of the combined parliament. Furthermore, the Senate could kill any laws by not voting on them for six months. Civil servants and soldiers could not become MPs, but could form {{up to half of}} the cabinet. The new draft would not require approval by a public referendum.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, the cabinet {{introduced}} a bill providing for an extensive land reform, which proposed allocating land based on peasant status. The fruntași ("foremost people"), who owned 4 or more oxen, were to receive 5 fălci of land, or approx. 7.5 hectares; mijlocași ("middle people"), with two oxen—approx. 6 hectares; pălmași ("manual laborers"), with no oxen—approx. 3 hectares. Peasants were to own their plots after making 14 yearly payments to their respective landowner. This caused uproar in Parliament, which represented around 4,000 mostly boyar electors, and voices from among the Conservatives deemed it [...] "insane". The latter party prepared a censure vote, {{based on the fact}} that Kogălniceanu had publicized the project through Monitorul Oficial in contradiction with the one endorsed by the Focșani Commission, thus going against the letter of the law—he later justified himself saying: [...] "Publication was necessary in order to quell the rural population, agitated by the [...] ". The cabinet handed in its resignation, but Cuza refused to <b>countersign</b> it.|$|E

50|$|In {{accordance}} with article 96 of the Belgian Constitution, the King appoints and dismisses his ministers. However article 88 of the Belgian Constitution {{states that the}} King cannot act alone {{and all of his}} acts must be <b>countersigned</b> by a minister. In practice the outgoing Prime Minister <b>countersigns</b> the Royal Order appointing the new Prime Minister. Subsequently, the new Prime Minister <b>countersigns</b> the Royal Order accepting the resignation of the outgoing Prime Minister and the Royal Orders appointing {{the other members of the}} new Federal Government.|$|R

2500|$|The 1949 {{constitution}} {{elevated the}} throne to its most powerful position since the 1932 {{overthrow of the}} absolute monarchy. [...] The Supreme Council of State {{was transformed into a}} nine-person Privy Council. For the first time, members this council would be selected by the king alone. A 100-member senate would also be selected by the king alone. [...] The president of the privy council, rather than the prime minister, would <b>countersign</b> all laws. The king's veto was strengthened, with a two-thirds vote of parliament required to overrule it.|$|E
2500|$|However, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the password was actually obtained by Lieutenant Colonel Harvey. According to an account given after the war by Frederick Snider, a neighbour of the Gages, Harvey had executed a ruse on the first sentry to be accosted. Pretending to be the American officer of the day making Grand Rounds, he approached the sentry and when challenged, came close to the sentry's ear as if to whisper the <b>countersign.</b> But with bayonet secreted in hand, he grabbed the surprised sentry by the throat and threw him to the ground. With the bayonet at his throat, the sentry gave up the password. This suggestion illustrates the incomplete research into several aspects of the Battle of Stoney Creek. Snider gave this account not long before his death in 1877 [...] and his source for it was the April 1871 issue of The Canadian Literary Journal. [...] Snider was confusing Harvey with Colonel Murray, June 1813 with December 1813 and Stoney Creek with Youngstown near Fort Niagara. Snider makes several obvious errors, such as [...] "the British General St. Vincent was found some days after wandering about in the woods nearly dead of hunger." [...] His name was Vincent and he did not wander about the woods for days. [...] Snider's source for the provenance of the <b>countersign</b> should thus be considered to be unreliable.|$|E

2500|$|The {{taxation}} {{reached its}} peak with the re-introduction of the despised văcărit tax (per head of cattle owned), which had been dismissed for perpetuity by his predecessor, Constantine Mavrocordatos – Hangerli purchased the lifting of a curse on the latter (cast in 1763) from Gregory V, Patriarch of Constantinople. Despite this, the tax continued to face stiff opposition from the part of Orthodox clergy and Metropolitan Dosiftei Filiti. The boyars also refused to sign the decree, and Hangerli had to bribe four of them (among them Nicolae Brâncoveanu and Cornescu) in order to agree to <b>countersign</b> it; {{so as to avoid}} a rebellion against Hangerli, all the boyars were subsequently exempt from this new tax.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new draft}} was very {{different}} from the intentions of the drafting committee, and at one point, Sanya actually resigned from the premiership, only to be pressured back into position. [...] The new draft was approved by the convention and promulgated on 7 October 1974. The majority of the constitution conformed to the convention's alternative draft. [...] However, the premier, rather than the privy council president, was allowed to <b>countersign</b> the royal declaration appointing senators. [...] Legislative elections were held in January 1975, resulting in none of the 22 parties coming close to winning a majority. The Democrats, led by Seni Pramoj, formed a coalition government in February 1974. The coalition was highly unstable, and was replaced {{in less than a month}} by a Social Action Party-led coalition which appointed Kukrit Pramoj as premier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{movement}} of SGTs on highways is monitored from a dispatch center in Albuquerque, New Mexico {{known as the}} Transportation and Emergency Control Center (TECC). In {{the event of an}} attack on a SGT, the TECC makes contact with predesignated state law enforcement agencies to assist in the defense of the vehicle. Due to the possibility that an armed attack may involve an adversary with the capability to realistically present itself as law enforcement or military forces, a [...] "sign-countersign" [...] system is in use; the TECC provides [...] "countersigns" [...] to responders which they are required to use to signal NNSA defenders when approaching a SGT that is under attack. The NNSA has advised local law enforcement to [...] "take cover" [...] in the event they signal an incorrect <b>countersign</b> to NNSA personnel when attempting to provide aid during a threat incident.|$|E

2500|$|A monarch-appointed senate with 100 {{members was}} established, equal {{in size to}} the house of representatives. As in {{previous}} constitutions, the monarch still did not have an absolute veto. However, the monarch-appointed senate could, through a simple majority over the combined houses of parliament, sustain a royal veto. The chairman of the Supreme State Council had to <b>countersign</b> any royal orders in order to make them official (when the constitution was announced, Bhumibol Adulyadej was still a minor and the privy council performed the king's regnal duties on his behalf. Thus in practice, the Supreme Council of State itself selected and appointed senators and had the power of veto). [...] The ban on civil servants and soldiers serving in parliament and the cabinet was removed. Another key change stated that the policies of one government could not be altered by a succeeding government without royal approval. A multi-member constituency system replaced the single member constituency system which had been in effect since 1932. The minimum age of electoral candidates was raised from 23 to 35. Numerous MPs elected under the 1946 constitution had been under the age of 30, but were ineligible under the junta's constitution.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 23 February 1848 the king summoned his minister from the chamber, which was then sitting, and informed him that considering the situation in Paris {{and elsewhere in the}} country during the Banquet agitation for electoral reform, and the alarm and division of opinion in the royal family, led him to doubt whether he could retain Guizot as his prime minister. Guizot instantly resigned, returning to the chamber only to announce that the administration was at an end and that the king had sent for Louis-Mathieu Molé. Molé failed in the attempt to form a government, and between midnight and one in the morning Guizot, who had according to his custom retired early to rest, was again sent for to the Tuileries. The king asked his advice. [...] "We are no longer the ministers of your Majesty," [...] replied Guizot; [...] "it rests with others to decide on the course to be pursued. But one thing appears to be evident: this street riot must be put down; these barricades must be taken; and for this purpose my opinion is that Marshal Bugeaud should be invested with full power, and ordered to take the necessary military measures, and as your Majesty has at this moment no minister, I am ready to draw up and <b>countersign</b> such an order." [...] The marshal, who was present, undertook the task, saying, [...] "I have never been beaten yet, and I shall not begin to-morrow. The barricades shall be carried before dawn." [...] Adolphe Thiers and Barrot decided to withdraw the troops. Guizot found a safe refuge in Paris for some days in the lodging of a humble miniature painter whom he had befriended, and shortly afterwards effected his escape across the Belgian frontier and thence to London, where he arrived on 3 March. His mother and daughters had preceded him, and he was speedily installed in a modest habitation in Pelham Crescent, Brompton.|$|E
