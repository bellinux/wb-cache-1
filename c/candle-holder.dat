50|$|Glass <b>candle-holders</b> are {{sometimes}} cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, {{particularly when the}} candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2 inch or less of wax remains.|$|R
5000|$|The hall, {{which is}} on the first floor, has a vaulted ceiling; this {{supports}} a withdrawing room. [...] Above the main staircase is an entresol bedroom, almost 7 ft square, reached by an eleven-step staircase in the east wall. The stairs lead from the hall. [...] The withdrawing room has a spy-hole into the hall below. [...] This would have allowed all movement to the main turnpike stair to be observed. [...] The room has window seats, wall closets, and a shafted fireplace. A step up from this room leads to a circular oratory, equipped with aumbry, piscine, holy-water stoup and stone <b>candle-holders.</b> [...] This room is also vaulted. There is a bedroom in each of the upper floors.|$|R
50|$|In 1944 when Provence was liberated. The Fidlers {{returned}} to Mougins, {{where he and}} Edith turned out utilitarian objects like vases, ashtrays, dishes and <b>candle-holders.</b> A daughter, Catherine, was born in 1947, but the couple divorced in 1950 and Fidler moved to Paris where he would works {{for the next couple}} of years. In 1952 Fidler resettled in Vallauris where he has regular shows of his work. At this period he became friends with Picasso and Jacqueline Roque. In 1956 he married his second wife, Edith Ramos, from the Azores, his student in ceramics and then co-worker. The couple had a daughter, Nathalie, in 1956. Fidler returned again to Roussillon in 1959, while travelling frequently across Europe and the Americas. He remained there painting and producing ceramics pieces in Roussillon-en-Provence until his death in 1990.|$|R

5000|$|The {{card table}} arose around 1700 AD as card games became wildly popular in Europe. The {{manufacture}} of card tables as fine home furniture lasted {{to the middle}} of the 1800s. Card tables made in this era often had a folding top, which enabled them to serve as pier tables, console tables, or end tables when not in use. Styles ranged from simple to elaborate, with higher-end card tables featuring inlaid wood or stone, extensive delicate carvings, and expensive veneers. Some even had indentations carved into the playing surface to hold playing tokens, and slots around the rim which served as <b>candle-holders.</b> Semicircular (or [...] "D" [...] or [...] "half-round") tables 36 in in diameter (when opened) were the most popular card table in both North America and Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Inside, {{alterations}} {{have removed}} {{some of the}} original features, but much still remains. A room {{to the east of}} the entrance has Corinthian-style pilasters with volute capitals and various carvings, including inscriptions such as the Ten Commandments; it is believed it may have originally been a private chapel, and the wood on which the Commandments and other inscriptions are carved is known to be 17th-century. [...] The room also has high-quality late-16th-century panelling and floor tiles, a Tudor-style moulded ceiling with heraldic emblems, and a piscina (again suggesting a former religious use for this part of the building). [...] The main staircase winds round a square newel and has <b>candle-holders,</b> and in the attic there are the remains of an older staircase of similar design, with oak treads and chamfering.|$|R
5000|$|The {{village at}} Tubutama is {{situated}} {{on a broad}} lowland of good and fertile fields where few Indians cultivate their individual fields and communally plant wheat, Indian corn, beans and other crops. The house of the Father Missionary is decent and roomy with an adjoining garden of quinces, pomegranates, peaches, and other trees. The church is interiorly adorned with two altars, paintings in gilded frames, and a small side chapel. In the sacristy are three chalices, a pyx, a ceremonial cross, ceremonial <b>candle-holders,</b> censer, three dishes and cruets, all of silver, vestments of every kind and color and other interesting adornments for the altar and divine services. According to the Census Book, which I have here before me, there are forty-five married couples, twelve widowers, six widows, eighteen orphans, the number of souls in all one hundred seventy-six." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Julleuchter {{was based on an}} early modern (late 18th century or early 19th century) unburnt clay <b>candle-holder</b> from Halland, Sweden. This {{particular}} specimen is kept in the Nordic Museum in Stockholm (inv. nr. 32.477). It has a height of 15 cm and a base of 8.2 cm squared. The <b>candle-holder</b> has an incised heart shape and below a six-spoked opening.This artefact was described in 1888 in the magazine of the Swedish literary club Runa (founded by Johan August Strindberg), which compared the six-spoked window in its base with the shape of the medieval h-rune; the 1888 article attributed a 16th-century date to the object (the earliest date of the introduction of candles to Scandinavian households).|$|E
50|$|A Schwibbogen is a {{decorative}} <b>candle-holder</b> from the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge) region of Saxony, Germany. The first metal Schwibbogen {{was made in}} 1740 in Johanngeorgenstadt. The early candle arches always consisted of black ore. They were made out of one single forged piece and could be painted. The number of candles varies {{with the size of}} the arc. The original one featured 11.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{surviving}} specimens {{of this type}} of early modern <b>candle-holder</b> from Sweden. There is nothing to suggest that it was in any way connected to Yule in particular. The artefact type was also called Turmleuchter ("tower lantern") in some 1920s to 1930s German sources.A comparable specimen was on display in the open-air museum of Skansen, based on a photograph kept in the Detmold state archive.|$|E
2500|$|Today {{the home}} is owned by Winchester Investments LLC, a privately held company {{representing}} the descendants of John and Mayme Brown. The home retains unique touches that reflect Mrs. Winchester's beliefs and her reported preoccupation with warding off malevolent spirits. These spirits {{are said to have}} directly inspired her as to the way the house should be built. The number thirteen and spider web motifs, which carried spiritual significance for her, occur throughout the house. For example, an expensive imported chandelier that originally had 12 <b>candle-holders</b> was altered to accommodate 13 candles, wall clothes hooks are in multiples of 13, and a spider web-patterned stained glass window contains 13 colored stones. The drain covers on the sinks also have 13 holes. In tribute, the house's current groundskeepers have created a topiary tree shaped like the numeral 13. Also, every Friday the 13th, the large bell on the property is rung 13 times at [...] "1300 hours" [...] (13:00 PT, 1:00 PM) in tribute to Winchester.|$|R
5000|$|Literally, {{the word}} Schwibbogen means an arch [...] "hanging" [...] (schweben) above you, between two walls. This <b>candle-holder</b> is indeed arch-shaped, {{representing}} the arched {{entrance to a}} mine hung with guiding lights; another connection to the area's mining past. Today the [...] "candles" [...] are often lit with electricity, and the scenes {{cut out of the}} wooden centre of the arch are not only on mining themes. At night during Advent, nearly every single window in Dresden is lit with these ornaments, traditionally bought at the Striezelmarkt.|$|E
50|$|In the interior, {{the walls}} are {{plastered}} and the roof trusses are whitewashed. The floor is paved with quarry tiles. The fittings date from the 19th century and are made in pine that has been painted and grained. They include box pews, open back pews, benches, and a three-decker pulpit. The pulpit is octagonal, with a single <b>candle-holder</b> and a reading desk. Above the pulpit is a sounding board, also octagonal, and decorated on its underside with an eight-ray sun pattern. The font is medieval and consists of a rough stone bowl on a whitewashed pier. The bell is dated 1894.|$|E
50|$|The single-aisle St. Georgeâ€™s {{church with}} its joisted eight-sided tower is a late Gothic {{construction}} from around 1520. It retains its groined tracery vault, its Renaissance choir and font, its late Gothic Mount of Olives sculptural group and 14 tomb epitaphs from the 16th century. Originally it was fortified, as witnessed by its preserved embrasures. It was given its Baroque styling in the 18th century. By the church {{there is also}} a late Gothic campanile from 1540 which was rebuilt in 1686. Opposite there is a preserved late Gothic <b>candle-holder</b> with a spiral shaft which is often mistakenly designated as a wayside column.|$|E
5000|$|In the 15th century a vestry and a 'weapon-house' (porch) were added, {{the choir}} was {{extended}} {{to make it as}} wide {{as the rest of the}} church, the roof was raised with vaults of brick, the windows enlarged, the Maria-bell was cast, and there is a <b>candle-holder</b> featuring a cock and a spiral central pillar. In the vaults and on the walls there are well-preserved frescos from the late 15th century, featuring a variety of biblical references and the legends of saints. It also includes an inscription interpreted by the art historian Henrik Cornell in 1918 as spelling maalede Eghil, [...] "painted by Eghil". This was re-interpreted by Einar Bager in a 1969 publication as simply the incipit of the alphabet; the anonymous painter, who belonged to the Tierp school, is now known as AlfabetsmÃ¤staren, the Alphabet Master.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a classic}} {{experiment}} demonstrating functional fixedness, Duncker (1945) gave participants a candle, {{a box of}} thumbtacks, and a book of matches, {{and asked them to}} attach the candle to the wall so that it did not drip onto the table below. Duncker found that participants tried to attach the candle directly to the wall with the tacks, or to glue it to the wall by melting it. Very few of them thought of using the inside of the box as a <b>candle-holder</b> and tacking this to the wall. In Duncker's terms, the participants were [...] "fixated" [...] on the box's normal function of holding thumbtacks and could not re-conceptualize it in a manner that allowed them to solve the problem. For instance, participants presented with an empty tack box were two times more likely to solve the problem than those presented with the tack box used as a container ...|$|E
50|$|TsÃ¤sson is {{furnished}} traditionally: {{there is}} an icon table in the rear wall covered by a white towel. Most of the icons are attached on the rear wall {{and there is a}} carved crate with a glass door (kibot) on the icon table. Icon depicting Virgin Mary is fixed on the wall and covered by a knitted woollen red-patterned icon scarf (pÃ¼haserÃ¤tt). Other icons are covered by two icon scarves painted on dark fabric and one newer knitted icon scarf. There are embroidered and crocheted tea towels and a few icons on the side walls. There is a smallish metal oil lamp hanging in front of the right-hand angled icon and a <b>candle-holder</b> made from a gnarled tree-trunk. An analoi {{stands in the middle of}} the tsÃ¤sson, a table in one wall and a long bench in the other wall. Floor is covered by rag carpets. The ceiling of the tsÃ¤sson is made from unedged boards that are fitted with the edges placed on top of each other. The floor is made from wide planks. There is no extra finishing on the floors-ceilings and inner walls.|$|E
