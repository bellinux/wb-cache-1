The complexation of Eu(III), as an analogue of lanthanide and actinide radionuclides at their + III oxidation state for oxygen containing functions, is evidenced {{both from the}} increasing of Eu(OH) (3) (s) dissolution, and from a complexometric titration by time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy. The dissolution of Eu(OH) (3) (s) in a simplified alkaline solution (0. 3 M KOH/ 0. 1 M NaOH) increases moderately, but significantly, with the HDPs concentration. The luminescence signal of the supernatant clearly indicates the presence of several complexed Eu(III) species. Performing a complexometric titration of Eu(III) from pH 6 by alkaline HDPs shows the formation of two different species with increasing HDPs' concentration and pH. Operational complexation constants - based on dissolved carbon concentration - are proposed. The analyses of the spectra and luminescence decays seem to confirm the presence of two different species...|$|E

40|$|The {{complexation}} of lead(II) with mono-deprotonated {{caffeic acid}} {{in aqueous solution}} (pH = 6. 50) has been investigated by UV-visible, fluorescence, and vibrational spectroscopies combined with quantum chemical calculations (DFT). The caffeate ion presents two chelating sites in competition: the carboxylate and the catechol functions. Electronic spectroscopies highlighted two different complexed forms with, respectively, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 stoichiometry. The 1 : 1 complex predominates for low lead concentrations, even if the second complexed form appears before the first chelating site is fully occupied. Both spectroscopic data and calculations reveal that Pb(II) preferentially coordinates with the carboxylate function, in opposition with previous results found for the Al(III) complexation, where the catechol group presents the greater <b>complexing</b> <b>power.</b> The structural and vibrational modifications between the mono-deprotonated ligand and 1 : 1 complex engendered by the chelation are discussed. Water molecules have been added on the Pb ion to modify its coordination, and structures of Pb(H 2 CA) (H 2 O) n+ with n = 0 - 4 were optimized.

40|$|A simple {{operative}} {{procedure is}} described for the speciation of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Ni and Cd) in landfill leachates. The procedure {{is based on}} the kinetics of metal removal from the liquid phase by a cation-chelating resin (Chelex- 100) in batch tests. The metals were divided in three different classes of behaviour (free-labile fraction, slowly exchangeable fraction and stable-inert fraction). The leachate was spiked with the metals at mg L(- 1) level and a strong effect of the aging time (the time elapsed between metal spike of the leachate and kinetic tests) was observed. This is to be ascribed to a slow complex formation in the spiked leachate. As a comparison, the procedure was also applied on synthetic solutions containing several simple ligands (chloride, acetate, glycinate and salycilate), proposed in the literature to model the <b>complexing</b> <b>power</b> of landfill leachates. The metals in the leachate behaved in a different way than in the synthetic solutions. The metal removal rate was in general slower than observed in the synthetic solutions and a not negligible stable/inert fraction was always present for each of the metals. The results suggest that the complexing properties of the leachate are mainly related to substances not representable by the simple ligands proposed in the literature to model these matrixes...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the antioxidant activity against the radical species DPPH, the reducing capacity against Fe II ions, and the inhibitory activity on the tyrosinase enzyme of the T. triangulare. Hydromethanolic crude extract provided two fractions after the liquid/liquid partition with chloroform. The Folin-Ciocalteu method determined the total phenolic content of the crude extract (CE) and the hydromethanolic fraction (Fraction 1), resulting in a concentration of 0. 5853 g/ 100 g for Fraction 1, and 0. 1400 g/ 100 g for the CE. Taking into account {{the results of the}} DPPH, the free radical scavenging capacity was confirmed. The formation of complexes with Fe II ions was evaluated by UV/visible spectrometry; results showed that CE has <b>complexing</b> <b>power</b> similar to the positive control (Gingko biloba extract). The inhibitory capacity of samples against the tyrosinase enzyme was determined by the oxidation of L-DOPA, providing IC 50 values of 13. 3 μg·mL− 1 (CE) and 6. 6 μg·mL− 1 (Fraction 1). The values indicate that Fraction 1 was more active and showed a higher inhibitory power on the tyrosinase enzyme than the ascorbic acid, used as positive control.

40|$|Successful {{coupling}} of electrochemical preconcentration (EPC) to {{capillary electrophoresis}} (CE) with contactless conductivity detection (C(4) D) is {{reported for the}} first time. The EPC-CE interface comprises a dual glassy carbon electrode (GCE) block, a spacer and an upper block with flow inlet and outlet, pseudo-reference electrode and a fitting for the CE silica column, consisting of an orifice perpendicular {{to the surface of}} a glassy carbon electrode with a bushing inside to ensure a tight press fit. The end of the capillary in contact with the GCE is slant polished, thus defining a reproducible distance from the electrode surface to the column bore. First results with EPC-CE-C(4) D are very promising, as revealed by enrichment factors of two orders of magnitude for Tl, Cu, Pb and Cd ion peak area signals. Detection limits for 10 min deposition time fall around 20 nmol L(- 1) with linear calibration curves over a wide range. Besides preconcentration, easy matrix exchange between accumulation and stripping/injection favors procedures like sample cleanup and optimization of pH, ionic strength and <b>complexing</b> <b>power.</b> This was demonstrated for highly saline samples by using a low conductivity buffer for stripping/injection to improve separation and promote field-enhanced sample stacking during electromigration along the capillary.

40|$|The {{properties}} of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) complexes and Co 2 + and Al 3 + {{are reported in}} this work. The <b>complexing</b> <b>power</b> of CMC was greater to Al 3 + than to Co 2 +, {{although it was not}} possible to determine some of the equilibrium constants. The infrared (IR) spectroscopy and thermal analysis helped in showing the existence of these complexes in the solid state. The films observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provided a certainty that the chains of the biopolymer were not extensively broken by the use of strong mineral acid employed in some of the experimental steps of this study. Two water solutions — bidistilled and deionized water and an Iraí River, Curitiba, PR (Brazil) sample — were obtained by adding metal salts of Al 3 +, Co 2 +, Cu 2 +, Mo 6 +(initially in the form of molybdate) and VO 2 + to which CMC was later added as a remediation agent. At different times, aliquots of those water samples were analyzed for their metal contents and showed ability to sequester different percentages of each of the metal ions, therefore, rendering the water samples within the Brazilian and Spanish standards for potable water (varying from b 0. 3 to 5 mg/L depending on toxicity). The CMC complexes could be recovered by mechanical removal at the pH where these complexes are not very soluble. This process can be applied to municipal wasterwater treatment plants as CMC is a more cost-effective and non toxic alternative material than commercial employed alum. The metals can be recycled after the decomplexing process from the recovered solid complexes and with the additional benefit of using CMC that it will leave no trace of Al 3 + ions in the water rising from the use of alum.

40|$|Although {{anhydrous}} {{formic acid}} exhibits all the properties required by a solvent for ideal polarographic characteristics, no {{study of the}} dropping mercury electrode in this medium has hitherto been described. Formic acid besides having a high dielectric constant (56. 1 at. 25 ᵒC) and considerable ionizing properties, also exhibits a strong solvent action upon many organic compounds. Furthermore, {{it has been shown}} by Pleskov (2) to be a solvent with small <b>complexing</b> <b>power,</b> a feature which enhances its value for the examination of ions which are normally hydrated in aqueous solution. The above author also showed that the standard electrode potentials in formic acid, of the elements he studied, differed little from the values found in aqueous solution. Exceptional behaviour was shown by zinc and cadmium the potentials of which were displaced to more positive values. This shift was attributed to hydration of ions in aqueous solution as opposed to the absence of solvation in formic acid. The remaining electrochemical investigations in anhydrous formic acid have been confined to conductance measurements, the measurement of transport numbers and potentiometric titrations. The conductance measurements were made almost entirely by Schlesinger and his co-workers. The conductivities of ammonium, alkali and alkaline earth formates as well as hydrogen chloride solutions in anhydrous formic acid were measured together with the behaviour of mixtures of two salts containing a common ion. More recently, Lange has measured the conductance of potassium chloride in this solvent. Schlesinger and Bunting obtained values for the transference numbers of the formates of sodium potassium and calcium in formic acid. The outcome of these experiments was that anhydrous formic acid should be considered to be a highly acidic solvent; hydrogen chloride was, for example, found to be incompletely ionised, while salts such as the alkali and alkaline earth formates, which are bases in anhydrous formic acid, were highly ionized. A number of workers (10 - 15) have employed anhydrous formic acid as the medium for potentiometric titrations and conclude that "formic acid is more like water, then is such a solvent as acetic acid, in that solutions of salts give cryoscopic and conductivity values which correspond to extensive dissociation with respect to acidity and basicity, however, formic acid differs greatly from water, and solutions in it are even more deserving of the term superacid than those acetic acid solutions in which the pioneer work on the potentiometric investigation of strongly acid solvents was done". In view of the interesting properties shown by anhydrous formic acid, it was decided to investigate the electrochemical properties of this solvent, paying particular attention to its suitability for the reduction of electroreducible ions at a dropping mercury cathode...|$|E

In order for the variations in real and reactive powers of the slack bus to be a small percentage of its generating capacity during the solution process, the bus connected to the largest generating station is normally selected as the slack bus. The slack bus is crucial to a load flow problem since it will account for transmission line losses. In a load flow problem, conservation of energy results in the total generation equaling to the sum of the loads. However, there still would be a discrepancy in these quantities due to line losses, which are dependent on line current. Yet to determine line current, angles and voltages of the buses connected to the line would be needed. Here, the slack bus will be required to account for line losses and serve as a generator, injecting real power to the system.|$|R
