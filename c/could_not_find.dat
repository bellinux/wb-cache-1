5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> a clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of}} the series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E

5|$|Even at the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide.

It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> an American publisher.
