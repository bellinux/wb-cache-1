The RFR is characterized by the periodic reversal of the gas flow that aims to trap the heat of reaction inside the RFR. The control issue is to confine the hot spot temperature inside an envelope (in order to ensure complete conversion of the pollutant and to prevent <b>catalyst</b> <b>overheating)</b> in spite of stochastic variations of the inlet pollutant concentration (the input disturbance).

40|$|The {{design and}} testing of a control system for {{reverse-flow}} catalytic afterburners based on a two-variable bifurcation map is focused on. The combustion of lean methane-air mixtures is considered as the test reaction and a bench-scale apparatus, with a special temperature-control system based on dynamic compensation of the thermal losses to achieve adiabatic operation, is used for validation purposes. The aim of the control system is to avoid both <b>catalyst</b> <b>overheating</b> and reaction extinction when the adiabatic temperature increases and the flow rate of the feed changes. Stability maps of the reactor are obtained by means of numerical simulations, showing {{the values of the}} operating parameters (switching time), which allows fulfillment of the operating constraints (catalyst maximum temperature and methane conversion) when the inlet concentration and flow rate change. This system was realized and tested experimentally, mainly for inlet concentration changes, proving to be effective in all cases investigated...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{models were}} {{developed}} for the dynamic response of steam-reformed, methanol-fueled, polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) systems for transportation applications. Focus is on heat transfer effects likely to limit rapid response of PEFC systems. Depending on the thermal mass, the heat exchangers and steam reformer can have time constants {{on the order of}} several seconds to many minutes. On the other hand, the characteristic time constants associated with pressure/density disturbances arising from flow rate fluctuations are on the order of milliseconds. In vehicular applications, the response time of the turbomachinery, which is determined by rotational inertia, can be on the order of seconds or less. Dynamic reformer model was used to examine methanol conversion efficiency and thermal performance during a cold start. Response times are determined to achieve 50 - 100 % of the steady-state methanol conversion for two catalyst tube diameters. Thermal performance is considered in terms of the approach to steady-state temperature, possibility of <b>catalyst</b> <b>overheating,</b> and penalty in system efficiency incurred during startup time. For the complete reference PEFC system, various turn-down scenarios were simulated by varying the relative rates of change of fuel cell loading and system flows. Depending on relative rates of cell loading changes to flow rate changes, overheating of the catalyst can occur due to excess heat transfer in the reformer preheater; this can be controlled by an additional water quench between catalyst bed and preheater, but only if the flow rate change is sufficiently fast relative to load changes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Micro-structural failure {{analysis}} of the heat resisting HP 40 Nb modified alloy was studied by light and electron methods. Samples from the failed reformer furnace tube were cut and prepared for metallographic examination. Examination with electron microscope was carried out with secondary and backscattered electron detectors; x-ray analysis was conducted at the grain boundary areas. In tubes, which are filled with a supported nickel catalyst, methane reacts with steam, carbondioxide and oxygen into synthesis gas. The overall heat of reactions may be positive, zero, or negative, depending on the process conditions. The catalyst {{plays a key role}} in developing overheating in the tubes. The catalyst deactivation caused by feeding is heavier than that designed hydrocarbon. Using an unsuitably designed hydrocarbon causes a thin layer of carbon coating on the <b>catalyst</b> surface. <b>Overheating</b> due to <b>catalyst</b> poisoning caused creep failure. The presence of inter-granular voids in the microstructure of the failed tube seems to be the result of creep phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} the growth of a catalyst-polymer {{particle}} during gas-phase polymerization of (alpha) -olefins is developed. In order to design the polymerization reactor, the behavior of a pellet is analyzed through the model. ^ Low-pressure, gas-phase polymerization processes use various heterogeneous catalysts, supported and unsupported. Initial catalyst particles break into small fragments, kept in contact through polymer entanglements. This phenomenon creates a pellet formed by the aggregation of thousands of microparticles, each with a catalyst micronucleus surrounded by a growing polymer layer. Monomer diffuses from the gas phase to the active sites {{on the surface of the}} micronucleus. This process include transport within the pellet along the voids among microparticles, and through their growing polymer layer. Heat of polymerization must be transferred from the active sites to the bulk phase. ^ Approximate analytical solutions are developed to model the heat and mass transfer in the microparticle. A multigrain model combines these solutions to predict transport in the pellet. The analytical solutions make the separate treatment of the microparticle and pellet scales tractable. Consequently, fragmentation steps are included in the model. Polymerization and pellet growth rates are predicted. ^ Results show energy transfer effects are critical during initial steps of the pellet growth. Thermal runaways leading to polymer melting are possible if heat transfer to the bulk phase is inadequate. <b>Catalyst</b> fragmentation and <b>overheating</b> phenomena occur at the same time scale, and their interaction is important. Diffusion effects in the pellet are critical at the initial growth steps and during thermal excursions. Time scales for these processes are much shorter than the pellet total reaction times. Thus, transport through the pellet has little effect on the molecular weight distribution of the polymer. ^ The pellet model is applied to the base-case design of a fluidized-bed reactor. The fluid velocity and reactor dimensions are predicted. The model is used to analyze the effects of the reactor environment on the polymerization process. ...|$|R

More open archives publications of Pascal Dufour are available on: [URL] audienceThis paper {{is intended to}} show the comparison of two closed-loop controllers performances for a catalytic reverse flow reactor (RFR) : a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and a model predictive control (MPC) strategy that both use a high-gain observer. The aim of the RFR is to reduce, by catalytic reaction, the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released in the atmosphere. The particularity {{of this process is}} that the gas flow inside the reactor is periodically reversed in order to trap the heat released during the reaction inside the process. Very few papers are dealing with the control of the RFR. The new multivariable optimal control issue tackled here is to confine the hot spot temperature within two temperature limits, in order to ensure complete conversion of the pollutant and to prevent <b>catalyst</b> <b>overheating,</b> while optimizing the process yield and the consumption of electrical power. Both control laws aim to optimize the tuning of the dilution and the internal electric heating. The model considered here for control of the RFR is obtained from a countercurrent pseudo-homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) model. The feed concentration (acting as an important input disturbance) and the temperature profile in the RFR are estimated on-line using a high-gain observer based on three temperatures measurements. In order to maintain the safe use of the reactor, the estimate state is injected in the LQR whereas the MPC is based on the estimated input disturbance. Simulation results allow comparing performances of the LQR and the MPC...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the dynamics and control of forced unsteady-state catalytic reactors and it is focused on two topics: 1. auto-thermal after-treatment of lean VOC mixtures. Two reactor configurations have been taken into consideration: the reverse-flow reactor (RFR), where the flow direction is periodically changed, and the network {{of two or three}} reactors (RN), where the flow direction remains the same, but the feeding position is periodically changed, thus simulating a moving bed. This study (§ 3) has been organised as follows: - modelling of the two reactor configurations and study of the influence of the main operating parameters (§ 3. 1 and § 3. 2). As the RFR shows higher stability with respect to disturbances in the feed a deeper investigation has been carried out on this device; - optimisation of the RFR. A simplified model has been used for this analysis in order to strongly reduce the computational effort which is required by detailed models. It has been pointed out that both heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the catalyst play a role, not less important than kinetic activity, strongly influencing the minimum inlet VOC concentration required for autothermal operation (§ 3. 3); - experimental validation of the modelling results in a bench-scale RFR with reduced influence of the wall effects. This activity has been carried at the Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Tecnología del Medio Ambiente-Universidad de Oviedo (Spain) in the framework of the Research Project "Azioni Integrate Italia-Spagna", granted by the Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR). In addition to the intrinsecally dynamic behaviour of the RFR, one must deal with unexpected external perturbations (feed concentration, composition and temperature) which may lead to reactor extinction or <b>catalyst</b> <b>overheating.</b> In order to avoid these problems it is necessary to implement some closed-loop control strategy based on the measurement of the inlet concentration (and composition) and the outlet conversion. This study has been organised as follows: - a model-based soft-sensor (observer) has been developed, in order to quickly and reliably estimate the feed composition from some temperature measurements in the reactor, thus avoiding expensive hardware sensors and time consuming on-line measurements. As deriving an observer from a detailed model is an overwhelming task, a simplified model has been developed and validated in a medium size RFR. This research has been carried out in cooperation with prof. H. Hammoury and D. Schweich of the CPE-Lyon, France (§ 4. 1); - a Model Based control strategy has been proposed and tested to prevent reaction extinction and <b>catalyst</b> <b>overheating</b> (§ 4. 2); 2. enhancement of conversion and selectivity in exothermic, equilibriumlimited reactions. Methanol synthesis and syngas prouction by partial oxidation of methane have been considered as test reactions. This section has been organised as follows: - modelling of the two processes in the two reactor configurations previously described. The influence of the main operating conditions has been addressed with the aim to optimise the two processes. As the RN has shown higher conversion and selectivity with respect to the RFR, in the following the research will be focused on this device (§ 5); - a simple open loop control policy, which can be useful for a safe startup, has been also tested to study the response of the RN to disturbances on the input parameters, showing that a more robust control strategy is needed for this application; - if a tight control on the outlet product conversion is needed, a Model Predictive Control scheme (MPC) should be used, varying the switching time to maximise the conversion and the selectivity of the reactor. The on-line optimisation requires a simplified model and a Neural Network based model has been developed (§ 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} partial oxidation (CPO) {{of natural}} gas over noble metal catalysts is an attractive way to obtain syngas (CO and H 2) which can be employed for downstream processes to produce synthetic fuels. The preliminary conversion of methane to syngas is also interesting {{in the context of}} advanced combustion systems with reduced NOx emissions. Several catalysts have been studied for CPO of methane, but Rh-based systems have established as the best performing catalysts in terms of both activity and selectivity. Sulphur poisoning is a tricky issue for industrial processes, leading to catalysts loss of activity. Recently, the presence of sulphur containing compounds naturally occurring in natural gas or added as odorants necessary for safety reasons, was recognized as a serious drawback for the costly Rh catalysts. Indeed, sulphur adversely affects the catalytic performance during catalytic partial oxidation adsorbing onto Rh active sites, causing a (reversible) suppression of their steam reforming activity, with an associated risk of <b>catalyst</b> <b>overheating</b> during CPO autothermal operation. Therefore the development of catalysts that are intrinsically sulphur tolerant and are not readily poisoned by the amounts of sulphur commonly found in natural gas is desirable. On the basis of recent works that have shown that metal phosphide catalysts have promising hydrodesulphurization (HDS) properties due to a higher sulphur tolerance than the correspondent metal based catalysts, in this work, a novel structured Rh catalyst doped with phosphorous and supported on alumina, has been prepared and investigated during the CPO of methane under self-sustained conditions at short contact time in the presence of sulphur. Results were compared with the reference undoped Rh/γAl 2 O 3, showing a significant enhancement of the specific steam reforming reaction rate of P-doped catalyst, and a higher sulphur tolerance. Both the findings were correlated to the presence of phosphorous, whose interaction with Rh improved the metal dispersion on the support and inhibited the strong sulphur adsorption lowering the resulting surface S coverage. Since natural gas may comprise significant amounts of ethane beside methane, the CPO of ethane is also object of study, in the view of a direct use {{of natural gas}} as feed at the on-site gas field without separating respective components. The importance {{of the role of the}} gas phase chemistry, which was found negligible in the case of CH 4 CPO over Rh and Pt catalysts, increases for higher alkanes following the progressive lower stability of the C-H bond, as in the case of CPO of ethane or propane, when large quantities of ethylene can be formed with Pt based catalysts (but not with Rh). However, the literature data available in the field of sulphur poisoning during CPO of higher hydrocarbon is so far scarce and somehow contradictory. Therefore, in the second part of this PhD thesis, the effect of sulphur addition to the feed during the CPO of ethane for syngas production (C 2 H 6 /O 2 = 1) has been investigated over more conventional Rh and Pt catalysts supported on a γ-alumina washcoat anchored to honeycomb monoliths. The findings obtained confirmed the previous results on CPO of methane on Rh: sulphur addition resulted in a rapid and reversible poisoning, depending on its concentration. However the adverse impact of sulphur is much larger on Rh than on Pt. Due to the more complex chemistry of ethane, two main effects related to the presence of sulphur during its CPO have been identified: i) the strong inhibition of the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane occurring on Rh but not on Pt; ii) the progressive inhibition of steam reforming of both the reactant (ethane) and one of the products, ethylene, whose formation in turn increases after the introduction of sulphur. The latter result was also observed for Pt catalyst. Since ethylene is thought to be mainly formed by the homogeneous oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, this result suggested the possibility to take advantage of selective sulphur poisoning in order to maximize the formation of ethylene. The oxidative catalytic conversion of light alkanes (in particular ethane) to olefins is an attractive solution to obtain ethylene and propylene, the most important building blocks for the polymers industry. The CPO of ethane to ethylene (stoichiometric feed ratio C 2 H 6 /O 2 = 2) is characterized by a complicated chemistry which involves both heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction paths, whose contribution and synergy may be strongly alterated by S-poisoning. In the final part of this PhD work, S-poisoning of catalytic steam reforming of C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4 has been investigated as a strategy to increase the process selectivity and yield to ethylene during the CPO of ethane to ethylene (C 2 H 6 /O 2 = 2) over Rh and Pt catalysts. In other words, the possibility to use sulphur as an intentional selective poison of undesired heterogeneous reactions to boost the production of ethylene has been exploited. At the same time, taking advantage of the selective poisoning of sulphur on catalytic reforming paths, an attempt has been done to shed light on the complex interaction of hetero-homogeneous chemistry available in a C 2 H 6 CPO reactor, to understand the contribution of heterogeneous reforming reactions to the overall performance of the reactor...|$|E
