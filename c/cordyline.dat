5|$|Numerous cultivars of C.australis {{are sold}} within New Zealand {{and around the}} world. Like other <b>Cordyline</b> species, C.australis can produce sports which have very {{attractive}} colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: <b>Cordyline</b> australis 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, {{and a range of}} variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other <b>Cordyline</b> species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of C.australis and C.banksii in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.|$|E

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of <b>Cordyline</b> australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of <b>Cordyline</b> australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
40|$|The active {{components}} in Folium <b>Cordylines</b> Fruticosae were extracted by heat reflux method. The solvents used were distilled water and ethanol.

The micro-Kjeldahl method was used to measure the cell protein contents and to make a comprehensive comparison. The results showed that the MGC- 803 cell inhibition rates of three different concentrations (32. 5, 75 and 150 mg/ml) of ethanol extracts increased with the increase of concentration, which was 48. 9 % at a concentration of 150 mg/ml; aqueous extract of Folium <b>Cordylines</b> Fruticosae had very low inhibitory activity at a low concentration (32. 5 mg/ml), which was remained at about 20 %. After being affected by two types of extracts, cells had uneven sizes, with very low brightness, while the normal cells presented a uniform full form, with high definition...|$|R
50|$|He {{brought back}} {{a number of the}} {{glasshouse}} plants in vogue at the time, such as Acalyphas, <b>Cordylines,</b> Codiaeums (Crotons) and Dracaenas, and, from Fiji, a palm of a new genus later named after him, Veitchia joannis. The Veitch family name is honoured by hundreds of plant names, including the genus Veitchia. The Veitch nursery introduced 232 orchids, some 500 greenhouse plants, 118 exotic ferns, about 50 conifers, 153 deciduous trees, 72 evergreen and climbing shrubs, 122 herbaceous and 37 bulbous plants from various corners of the globe.|$|R
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals are {{associated}} with C.australis in healthy ecosystems. The most common epiphytes are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern Asplenium, and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. Astelia species and Collospermum often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include Griselinia lucida, {{as well as a}} range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—Phanaerochaeta <b>cordylines</b> and Sphaeropsis cordylines—occur almost exclusively on C.australis.|$|R
5|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis was {{collected}} in 1769 by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific. The type locality is Queen Charlotte Sound. It was named Dracaena australis by Georg Forster who published it as entry 151 in his Florulae Insularum Australium Prodromus of 1786. It is sometimes still {{sold as a}} Dracaena, particularly for the house plant market in Northern Hemisphere countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{plight of}} <b>Cordyline</b> australis in the Sudden Decline {{epidemic}} {{drew attention to}} another widespread threat to the tree in rural areas throughout New Zealand. Rural Decline was the name proposed by botanists {{to refer to a}} decline in health of older trees in pasture and grazed shrubland, leading over many years to the loss of upper branches and eventual death.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like a palm tree. Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily grown from fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.|$|E
50|$|A {{weakness}} for Sacred Mechanoids {{is due to}} their human anatomy, they are vulnerable to pressure points, which was demonstrated when Kenshi paralyzed <b>Cordyline's</b> Sacred Mechanoid using one of Wahanly's Mechaworker. Another weakness {{is that if the}} pilot passes their operational limits or if one of the energy reactors (the rings on a Sacred Mechanoid's back and forearms) either break or go out of control, the Sacred Mechanoid will revert to its cocoon form. According to Aura, Sacred Mechanoids are a cost-effective alternative to raising armies or building heavy artillery to defend their homelands. To repair a damaged Sacred Mechanoid using Aho, a Sacred Mechamaster has to undergo being baptized by the Church in order to repair them. Otherwise, the damaged Sacred Mechanoid has to be sent to the Church directly for repairs. To maintain {{the balance of power in}} each country, the Church can only supply a certain number of Sacred Mechanoids to each country to prevent further power struggles.|$|R
5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete <b>cordylines,</b> micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|R
40|$|Camellia flower blight {{is caused}} by the sclerotial-forming fungus Ciborinia camelliae Kohn, and is {{specific}} to flowers of most species of camellias. An investigation was conducted into the feasibility {{of a wide range of}} biological methods for control of the pathogen by attacking soil-borne sclerotia and thereby preventing apothecial production, and protecting camellia flowers against ascospore infection. Two methods were developed to assess the viability of C. camelliae sclerotia for subsequent use in sclerotial parasitism assays. One method involved washing and rinsing sclerotia twice in 13. 5 % NaOCl, followed by immersion in antibiotics, bisection of sclerotia fragments onto potato dextrose agar, and identification of C. camelliae mycelium after incubation. Another method used sclerotial softness as an indicator of viability. Softness was determined from the energy required to push a 2. 76 diameter penetrometer with a force of 40 N into a 6 mm thick segment of healthy sclerotia (17 and 14 Nmm for medium and large sizes). This method was modified by recording as parasitised those sclerotia that were pierced under a 1 -kg probe with a footprint of 6. 2 mm², which delivered a pressure 1. 6 MPa. The known mycoparasites Trichoderma virens, T. hamatum, T. stromaticum, Clonostachys rosea, Coniothyrium minitans and Sporidesmium sclerotivorum were not effective in reducing sclerotia viability. However, in screens of 400 candidate microorganisms isolated from sclerotial baits and decaying sclerotia, two isolates of Trichoderma and an isolate of Fusarium lateritium reduced the number of viable sclerotia by 38 - 50 %. This indicated that moderately parasitic micro-antagonists were present in soil under camellia bushes. A range of soil treatments, which were postulated to stimulate micro-parasitic activity, was investigated in an attempt to reduce the viability and germination potential of the overwintering sclerotia. Urea, applied to soil at 50 kg N/ha, with Bio-Start soil conditioners in February and again in June reduced field populations of sclerotia from 294 to 105 sclerotia/m² by the following November. Covering soil under camellia bushes with 100 mm thick tree mulches for 9 months resulted in total suppression of apothecia and a 77 % reduction in the population density of soil-borne sclerotia, compared to bare soil. However, tree mulches had no effect on the new generation of C. camellia sclerotia developing in fallen flowers. Mulches amended with lignin-degrading white-rot fungi offered potential for decay of newly formed sclerotia. In laboratory assays, pine (Pinus radiata) sawdust amended with Phanerochaete <b>cordylines</b> LU 900 led to a 77 - 83 % reduction in viability of sclerotia after 12 weeks, compared to a 1 - 7 % reduction in sclerotia embedded in sawdust alone. Ligninolytic enzymes released by the isolate were shown to degrade the rinds of sclerotia, exposing them to microbial parasitism. The practical application of P. <b>cordylines</b> is dependent upon confirmation that it is non-pathogenic to camellia. Integration of the three soil treatments offers potential for longterm control of camellia blight. A single application of the fertiliser calcium cyanamide at 500 - 1000 kg/ha to soil under camellia bushes immediately before flowering (August), gave complete suppression of apothecial production, and can be used for short-term control of the disease. Potassium bicarbonate and ammonium bicarbonate at 300 kg/ha was less effective. Attempts to protect camellia flowers from infection by C. camelliae ascospores were only partially successful. Although isolates of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Aureobasidium and Cladosporium spp. provided almost complete protection against camellia blight in petal assays, they did not prevent symptoms in whole flowers on camellia bushes, even after repeated applications with or without adjuvants. Weekly applications of the elicitor acibenzolar-S-methyl to camellia bushes, 3 weeks before and during flowing to induce systemic acquired resistance, were also not effective in controlling camellia blight. The genetic diversity of C. camelliae isolates was investigated using a universally primed polymerase chain reaction DNA fingerprinting technique. The 27 isolates from four regions in New Zealand were found to be distinctly different to those from United States, which comprised three isolates each from Georgia, Oregon and Virginia. However, a low level of genetic variation (< 20 %) existed between isolates, suggesting that biocontrol agents are likely to be effective for control of all isolates of C. camelliae. The successful control strategies developed in this study could be integrated into a programme for effective control of camellia blight. Urea applied to soil beneath camellia bushes followed by a 100 mm thick layer of tree mulch should result in total suppression of apothecia, thereby preventing infection in flowers, and resulting in a gradual decline in numbers of soil-borne sclerotia. Amendment of the mulch with lignin-degrading white-rot fungi may control newly formed sclerotia developing in fallen flowers that have been infected by air-borne inoculum from adjacent untreated areas. Alternatively, apothecial production can be totally suppressed with calcium cyanamide applied to soil under camellia bushes immediately before flowering each year...|$|R
5|$|In the North Island, Māori {{cultivated}} selected {{forms of}} C.australis for food. One of these, called tī para or tī tāwhiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple ﬂeshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of C.australis, {{it has a}} rubbery, pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar <b>Cordyline</b> 'Thomas Kirk'. Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from C.australis of the central North Island.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{generally}} considered native are the alder (Alnus glutinosa), silver birch (Betula pendula), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), hazel (Corylus avellana), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), beech (Fagus sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), aspen (Populus tremula), wild cherry (Prunus avium), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), holm oak (Quercus ilex), oak (Quercus robur), sallow (Salix cinerea), elder (Sambucus nigra), elm (Ulmus spp.) and medlar (Mespilus germanica). Among notable introduced species, the cabbage palm (<b>Cordyline</b> australis) has been planted in coastal areas {{and may be}} seen in many gardens.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's native <b>Cordyline</b> {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million {{years ago in the}} warm Miocene era. Because it has evolved in response to the local climate, geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: Tītī in the north, tī manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree was}} well known to Māori before its {{scientific}} discovery. The generic Māori language term for plants in the <b>Cordyline</b> genus is tī, and names recorded as specific to C.australis include tī kōuka, tī kāuka, tī rākau, tī awe, tī pua, and tī whanake. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight {{the characteristics of the}} tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether it was a large tree (tī rākau, tī pua), the whiteness of its flowers (tī puatea), whether its leaves were broad (tī wharanui), twisted along the edges (tī tahanui), or spiky (tī tarariki). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (tī manu), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (tī whanake) and nets (tī kupenga). The most widely used name, tī kōuka, refers {{to the use of the}} leaf hearts as food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis (Torbay palm, Ti palm, Palm lily) (family Asparagaceae) {{and other}} {{representatives in the}} genus <b>Cordyline</b> and perhaps also in Dracaena with which <b>Cordyline</b> may be confused.|$|E
25|$|Most monocots {{are unable}} to thicken their stems once they have formed, since they lack the {{cylindrical}} meristem present in other angiosperm groups. Asparagales have a method of secondary thickening which is otherwise only found inDioscorea (in the order Disoscoreales). In a process called 'anomalous secondary growth', {{they are able to}} create new vascular bundles around which thickening growth occurs. Agave, Yucca, Aloe, Dracaena, Nolina and <b>Cordyline</b> can become massive trees, albeit not of the height of the tallest dicots, and with less branching. Other genera in the order, such as Lomandra and Aphyllanthes, have the same type of secondary growth but confined to their underground stems.|$|E
500|$|To {{add to the}} confusion, {{these may}} be misidentified as <b>Cordyline</b> indivisa (syn. Dracaena indivisa).|$|E
500|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis, {{commonly}} known as the cabbage tree, cabbage-palm [...] or , is a widely branched monocot tree endemic to New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cordyline</b> 'Ti Tawhiti' was [...] "the {{subject of}} an intense {{discussion}} amongst the leading botanists of New Zealand {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society ... in Wellington 100 years ago. It was saved from extinction because its dwarf form found favour with gardeners and it came to be known as <b>Cordyline</b> 'Kirkii' recording the interest Thomas Kirk had in the plant. Its origin as a Maori selection was forgotten until rediscovered in 1991. The name 'Tawhiti' is equivalent to 'Hawaiki' and indicates the traditional belief that the plant was introduced to Aotearoa by the ancestral canoes of Maori. However, it is more probable that the name arose from it being moved around its native land as a domesticated plant." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis is {{the tallest}} of New Zealand's five native <b>Cordyline</b> species. Of these, the commonest are C.banksii, {{which has a}} slender, {{sweeping}} trunk, and C.indivisa, a handsome plant with a trunk up to [...] tall bearing a massive head of broad leaves up to [...] long. In the far north of New Zealand, C.australis can be distinguished by its larger heavily branched tree form, narrower leaves and smaller seeds from C.obtecta, the Three Kings cabbage tree, its closest relative. C.australis is rather variable, and forms from the northern offshore islands may be hybrids with C.obtecta. Hybrids with C.pumilio and C.banksii also occur often where the plants are in close vicinity, because they flower {{at about the same}} time and share the chromosome number 2n=38, with C.australis.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis {{grows up}} to [...] tall with a stout trunk [...] in diameter. Before it flowers, {{it has a}} slender {{unbranched}} stem. The first flowers typically appear at 6 to 10 years old, in spring. The right conditions can reduce the first flowering age to 3 years (Havelock North, 2015 mast year). After the first flowering, it divides to form a much-branched crown with tufts of leaves at {{the tips of the}} branches. Each branch may fork after producing a flowering stem. The pale to dark grey bark is corky, persistent and fissured, and feels spongy to the touch.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cordyline</b> australis occurs from North Cape to {{the very}} south of the South Island, where it becomes less and less common, until it reaches its southernmost natural limits at Sandy Point (46° 30' S), west of Invercargill near Oreti Beach. It is absent from much of Fiordland, {{probably}} {{because there is no}} suitable habitat, and is unknown on the subantarctic islands to the south of New Zealand, probably because it is too cold. It occurs on some offshore islands—Poor Knights, Stewart and the Chathams—but was probably introduced by Māori. In the Stewart Island region, it is rare, growing only on certain islands, headlands and former settlement sites where it may have been introduced by muttonbird collectors, while on the Chatham Islands it is also largely [...] "a notable absentee".|$|E
500|$|The genus name <b>Cordyline</b> {{derives from}} an Ancient Greek {{word for a}} club (kordyle), a {{reference}} to the enlarged underground stems or rhizomes, while the species name australis is Latin for [...] "southern". The common name cabbage tree is attributed by some sources to early settlers having used the young leaves as a substitute for cabbage. However the name probably predates the settlement of New Zealand — Georg Forster, writing in his Voyage round the World of 1777 about the events of Friday, April 23, 1773, refers on page 114 to the discovery of a related species in Fiordland as [...] "not the true cabbage palm" [...] and says [...] "the central shoot, when quite tender, tastes something like an almond's kernel, with a little of the flavour of cabbage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ti (<b>Cordyline</b> fruticosa): After {{distillation}} technique came to Hawaii, {{the root}} of the ti was turned into liquor called 'okolehao' ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{although}} most {{species in the}} order are herbaceous, some no more than 15cm high, {{there are a number}} of climbers (e.g., some species of Asparagus), as well as several genera forming trees (e.g. Agave, <b>Cordyline,</b> Yucca, Dracaena, Aloe [...] ), which can exceed 10m in height. Succulent genera occur in several families (e.g. Aloe).|$|E
2500|$|Structural {{material}} that resembles ordinary, [...] "dicot" [...] or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics {{is produced by}} a number of monocot plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, bamboo, botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material in their own right and, these days, in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and veneer. Another major plant group that produces {{material that}} often is called wood are the palms. Of much less importance are plants such as Pandanus, Dracaena and <b>Cordyline.</b> With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.|$|E
