5|$|The {{story begins}} {{branching}} into different timelines {{that can be}} experienced in any order, depending on the choices made by the player. While completing {{the first set of}} puzzle rooms, the participants learn of a pandemic caused by Radical-6, a virus that slows down its victims' cognition and drives them to suicide. Depending on the given timeline, the characters also discover either the murdered body of an old woman or antimatter bombs. The other participants' backstories are explored: Luna is a humanoid robot, tasked with maintaining the Nonary Game; K was raised by Zero Sr. inside of the facility; Tenmyouji willingly joined the game, together with his adopted grandson Quark, after being promised a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a certain woman; Alice and Clover are government secret agents tasked with stopping the religious cult Free the Soul; and Dio is a member of Free the Soul.|$|E
25|$|The part of Sophia Petrillo was {{the first}} of the four roles to be cast. Estelle Getty auditioned and won the role of the feisty mother of {{character}} Dorothy Zbornak. This was due, in part, to the rave reviews she garnered in her Off-Broadway role reprisal for the 1984 Los Angeles run of Torch Song Trilogy. Afterwards, Getty had returned to New York but gained permission from her manager to return to California in early 1985. Getty figured it would be her last <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> television or film work. She would return home to New York if she was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|In September 1812, now 23 years old, after {{becoming}} ill from overwork, Cauchy returned to Paris. Another {{reason for his}} return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a mathematics related position. Therefore, when his health improved in 1813, Cauchy chose to not return to Cherbourg. Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric functions, the symmetric group and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king Louis XVIII took the restoration in hand. The Académie des Sciences was re-established in March 1816; Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy {{to take the place of}} one of them. The reaction by Cauchy's peers was harsh; they considered his acceptance of membership of the Academy an outrage, and Cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse auction {{is a type}} of {{auction in}} which the roles of the buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary {{objective}} to drive purchase prices downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find the best price among interested buyers, reverse auctions give buyers a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the lowest-price supplier. During a reverse auction, suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers’ offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to the lowest price they are willing to receive. By revealing the competing bids in real time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote “information transparency”. This, coupled with the dynamic bidding process, improves the chances of reaching the fair market value of the item.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And so I {{have a list of}} questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E

[...] "I was involved from A-Z," [...] she said. [...] "Every song on the album was inspired by my life [...] I wanted to talk about how I feel on so many levels.

2500|$|In 2003 Doom was {{the villain}} in the Fantastic Four story arc [...] "Unthinkable", in which Doctor Victor Von Doom viscerally skins his {{childhood}} love Valeria alive to the bone, and turns her flesh into mystic armour, imprisons Franklin Richards in Hell, captures Valeria Richards, and succeeds in de-powering and imprisoning the Fantastic Four. Writer Mark Waid sought to redefine Doctor Doom's {{character in a}} way that had not been seen before. Waid punctuated this reinterpretation of Doom during his [...] "Unthinkable" [...] saga (Vol 3 #66-70 & Vol 1 (restart) #500) as an absolute sadist by having Von Doom ruthlessly murder Valeria (namesake of the Richards's daughter), his first love and granddaughter to his long-serving faithful retainer Boris, in order to be granted access to powerful magic by a trio of demons, Valeria being the treasured possession that they demanded in exchange. He subsequently attempted to prove his superiority to Reed by giving him the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> his way out of a prison that could only be escaped by mastering magic, in the belief that Reed would fail to do so, but with the aid of the astral projection of Doctor Strange, Richards learned to utilize magic on a basic level by accepting that he could not understand it and escapes. With Doom still his superior in this particular field, Richard instead tricked him into rejecting the demons, resulting in them dragging Doom to Hell. This was the case until the events of Ragnarok when Thor's hammer Mjolnir fell through dimensions and gave Doom a way out of Hell when it was lost after Thor's apparent death. The events of [...] "Unthinkable" [...] were deleted from continuity in the 2015 series Secret Wars.|$|E

The {{contestant}} had 60 seconds and eight <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> these symbols in any order. Also hidden on the board were six cash squares (two each of £5, £25, and £50), and five police helmets that each deducted 5 seconds from the clock if found.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, the Meteor can {{be fired}} without using mid-course update, hampering its <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a target, but {{allowing}} the Rafale to immediately turn away (similar to [...] "Fire and forget" [...] AASM, MICA or Exocet missile types). This makes it kinematically {{less likely that}} the engaged aircraft can hit the Rafale fighter with a missile of comparable capabilities unless the Meteor missile was launched at much shorter range than its engagement range limit.|$|R

It becomes apparent that those individuals that, arguably, have better <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a job, i.e., that are more highly skilled and still fairly young, have a higher job search intensity. Furthermore, there is a hump-shaped pattern of search intensity with respect to unemployment duration, with long-term unemployed individuals using the lowest number of search methods. Finally, holding all other characteristics constant, unemployed women search less intensively than men.|$|R
