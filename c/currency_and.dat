The role of the national <b>currencies</b> <b>and</b> exchange rate regimes in regional economic links are elaborated.

5|$|Metallic lead beads {{dating back}} to 7000–6500 BCE {{have been found in}} Asia Minor and may {{represent}} the first example of metal smelting. At that time lead had few (if any) applications due to its softness and dull appearance. The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena (a common lead mineral). The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an application that spread to Ancient Greece and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material, as <b>currency,</b> <b>and</b> for construction. Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant, as <b>currency,</b> <b>and</b> as a contraceptive; the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in wire drawing.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 1898, the Spanish–American War {{ended with}} Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the United States. The Banco Español de Puerto Rico was renamed Bank of Porto Rico and issued bills {{equivalent}} to the United States dollar, creating the Puerto Rican dollar. In 1902, the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner. Two more series were issued until 1913. After Puerto Rico's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States' economic and monetary system, the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the United States Treasury. The peso and dollar have been followed by other contemporary issues, including commemorative banknotes, private <b>currency,</b> <b>and</b> a quarter coin designed with Fort San Felipe del Morro in the face.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{has stated}} that the trade of items for real {{currency}} is officially {{a violation of the}} Terms of Service for Final Fantasy XI. In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate game <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> exchange it for real currency, which, in turn, drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300billion gil was removed from circulation. In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce. Since 2006, Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While waiting for a response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E
5|$|The coins met {{a hostile}} {{reception}} {{from the business}} community in Honolulu, who feared inflation of the currency {{in a time of}} recession. After legal maneuvering, the government agreed to use over half of the coinage as backing for paper <b>currency,</b> <b>and</b> this continued until better economic times began in 1885. After that, the coins were more eagerly accepted in circulation. They remained in the flow of commerce on the islands until withdrawn in 1903, after Hawaii had become a US territory.|$|E
