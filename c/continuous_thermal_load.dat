40|$|Nowadays, the {{application}} of glass-fibre composites in light-weight structures is growing. Although mechanical characterizations of those structures are commonly performed in testing, chemical changes of materials under stresses {{have not yet been}} well documented. In the present work coupon tests and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) have been used to categorise possible chemical changes of glass-fibre reinforced polymers (GFRP) which are currently used in the aircraft industry. HSI is a hybrid technique that combines spectroscopy with imaging. It is able to detect chemical degradation of surfaces and has already been successfully applied {{in a wide range of}} fields including astronomy, remote sensing, cultural heritage and medical sciences. GFRP specimens were exposed to two different <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. One <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> condition was a <b>continuous</b> <b>thermal</b> exposure at 120 °C for 24 h, 48 h and 96 h, i. e. ageing at a constant temperature. The other <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> condition was <b>thermal</b> cycling with three different numbers of cycles (4000, 8000, 12000) and two temperature ranges (0 °C to 120 °C and - 25 °C to 95 °C). The effects of both conditions were measured using both HSI and interlaminar shear (ILSS) tests. No significant changes of the physical properties of the thermally cycled GFRP specimens were detected using interlaminar shear strength tests and optical microscopy. However, when using HIS, differences of the surface conditions were detected. The results showed that the different <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> conditions could be successfully clustered in different colours, using the HSI linear unmixing technique. Each different <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> condition showed a different chemical degradation level on its surface which was indicated using different colours.

40|$|Abstract: The most {{promising}} technique {{for reducing the}} weight of cooling systems for burst-mode <b>thermal</b> <b>loads</b> is by reducing the chiller size. Addition of thermal storage provides the means to achieve this weight reduction. The heat reservoir must be designed to absorb high peak thermal powers as well as having a large energy storage capacity. Storing energy as phase-change latent-heat, rather than as temperature-change sensible-heat, results in {{a significant increase in}} storage capacity. Distributing the heat through a large volume is achieved by imbedding the phase-change-material (PCM) in a porous, high thermal-conductivity matrix. When the heat load is cyclical, even higher peak power capabilities can be achieved by first absorbing the heat in a small quantity of water and then transferring it to the PCM between heating pulses. We developed high-power, high-energy dual-material heat-reservoirs consisting of graphite-porous plates impregnated with paraffin PCM combined with water in order to cool bursts of thermal pulses. The bursts consisted of multiple, short, high-power heating pulses followed by longer interpulse periods. Bursts were followed by longer recovery period during which the small chiller extracted energy from the Paraffin. Measurements were made to characterize the cooling performance of water-PCM graphite reservoirs under <b>continuous</b> and burst <b>thermal</b> <b>loads,</b> and they were compared to a theoretical model. The main conclusions are that the measurements agree well with the model and that substantial weight reduction of burst-mode cooling-systems can be achieved by using the water plus PCM graphite heat-reservoir.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to evaluate the effect of potential changes to the TSPA-VA base case design on long-term repository performance. The design feature that is evaluated in this report is a higher <b>thermal</b> <b>load</b> (Feature 26 or F 26). The following paragraph briefly describes the motivation for evaluating higher <b>thermal</b> <b>loading.</b> Higher <b>thermal</b> <b>load</b> {{has been identified as}} a design feature that might have a beneficial effect on long-term repository performance. A higher <b>thermal</b> <b>load</b> will increase temperatures and decrease relative humidity on the waste package surface. The decrease in relative humidity may delay the onset of corrosion, thus delaying the failure of waste packages and the release of radionuclides from the engineered barrier system (EBS). For the current calculation a <b>thermal</b> <b>load</b> of 109 MTU/acre (metric tons of uranium per acre) is considered. Two cases are evaluated, one with the base case inventory and a higher <b>thermal</b> <b>load</b> and a second with an increased inventory that would cover the current repository footprint at the higher <b>thermal</b> <b>load.</b> This report documents the modeling assumptions and calculations conducted to evaluate the long-term performance of higher <b>thermal</b> <b>loading.</b> The performance measure for this evaluation is dose-rate.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Mined Geologic Disposal System (MGDS) <b>Thermal</b> <b>Loading</b> Systems Study being conducted by the is to identify a thermal strategy that will meet the performance requirements for waste isolation and will be safe and licensable. Specifically, both postclosure and preclosure performance standards must be met by the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> strategy ultimately selected. In addition cost and schedule constraints must be considered. The Systems Engineering approach requires structured, detailed analyses that will ultimately provide the technical basis for the development, integration, and evaluation of the overall system, not just a subelement of that system. It is also necessary that the systems study construct options from within the range that are allowed within the current legislative and programmatic framework. For example {{the total amount of}} fuel that can legally be emplaced is no more than 70, 000 metric tons of uranium (MTU) which is composed of 63, 000 MTU spent fuel and 7, 000 MTU of defense high level waste. It is the intent of this study to begin the structured development of the basis for a <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> decision. However, it is recognized that {{to be able to make}} a final decision on <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> will require underground data on the effects of heating as well as a suite of ''validated'' models. It will be some time before these data and models are available to the program. Developing a final, <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> decision will, therefore, be an iterative process. In the interim, the {{objective of}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> systems study has been to utilize the information available to assess the impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>loading.</b> Where technical justification exists, recommendations to narrow the range of <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> options can be made. Additionally, recommendations as to the type of testing and accuracy of the testing needed to establish the requisite information will be made. A constraint on the ability of the study to select an option stems from the lack of primary hard data, uncertainties in derived data, unsubstantiated models, and the inability to fully consider simultaneously coupled processes. As such, the study must rely on idealized models and available data to compare the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> options. This report presents the findings of the FY 1993 MGDS <b>Thermal</b> <b>Loading</b> Systems Study. The objectives of the study were to: (1) if justified, place bounds on the <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> which would establish the loading that is ''too hot''; (2) ''grade'' or evaluate the performance as a function of <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> of the potential repository to contain high level spent nuclear fuel against performance criteria; (3) evaluate the performance of the various options with respect to cost, safety, and operability; and (4) recommend the additional types of tests and/or analyses to be conducted to provide the necessary information for a <b>thermal</b> <b>loading</b> selection...|$|R
