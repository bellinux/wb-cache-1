5|$|The {{golden jackal}} often hunts alone, and {{sometimes}} in pairs, but rarely hunts in a pack. When hunting alone, it trots around an area and occasionally stops to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, the jackal conceals itself, quickly approaches its prey and then pounces on it. Single jackals hunt rodents, hares, and birds. They hunt rodents in grass by locating them with their hearing before leaping {{into the air and}} pouncing on them. In India, they <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> Indian gerbils out from their burrows, and they can hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates up to 4–5 times their body weight. Jackals search for hiding blackbuck calves throughout the day during the calving period. The peak times for their searches are the early morning and the late evening. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams and drive their prey from one jackal to another.|$|E
5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts. Each character has different traits and advantages. The eight characters consist of: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker. The Locksmith can open doors {{twice as fast as}} the other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies who are not in the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which runs around collecting coins; the Mole <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> holes through walls and takes less time to open vents; the Gentleman has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the Redhead can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to security systems, resulting in them shutting off temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E

The top handles are wrapped in colored ribbons: black, green, red and yellow, colors indicative of the American Indian community. Writing, in black marker, travels around the handle, until {{the top of the}} blade. The four shovels represent his father and one for his three aunts, who are represented on their own shovel by a photograph affixed before the blade. A cattle brand is welded into each shovel blade, like those found on Clarke's family ranch. His goal with Artifacts is to show how one <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> up the past to reveal American Indians in the world today.|$|E

When a Pacific razor clam (Siliqua patula) is laid {{on the surface of}} the beach it can bury itself completely in seven seconds [...] and the Atlantic jackknife clam, Ensis directus, can do the same within fifteen seconds. Scallops and file clams can swim by opening and closing their valves rapidly; water is ejected on either side of the hinge area and they move with the flapping valves in front. Scallops have simple eyes around the margin of the mantle and can clap their valves shut to move sharply, hinge first, to escape from danger. Cockles can use their foot to move across the seabed or leap away from threats. The foot is first extended before being contracted suddenly when it acts like a spring, projecting the animal forwards.|$|E
500|$|Srijit Mukherji's period drama Begum Jaan (2017) saw Vidya {{play the}} role of the titular procurer. A Hindi {{language}} remake of the Bengali film Rajkahini (2015), Begum Jaan tells the story of how the lives of prostitutes living in brothel are affected by the partition of India in 1947. In preparation, Vidya worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character, and she researched on the era by reading Urvashi Butalia’s novel The Other Side of Silence. Filming in the barren landscape of rural Jharkhand proved to be a challenge for Vidya, and she said that the experience taught her that [...] "if push comes to shove, I can brave scorpions, snakes and whatever else". Anna M.M. Vetticad of Firstpost disliked the film, and wrote that [...] " [...] – who has been so wonderful in the past – is unable to dig deep and summon up a relatable human being, because {{there is nothing in the}} writing that she <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> into." ...|$|E

Concepcion further stated: [...] "Then I watched the above interview she did with Perez Hilton, {{and it made me}} respect her even more. She stood her ground and made no excuses for her words or her visuals, and I <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> that." [...] Niki A. M. of Vibe wrote that Hilson [...] "made quite tails wag with her titillating video" [...] and that [...] "men reeled over the scantily clad vixen gyrating and shouting sexplicit phrases like [...] "fuck me" [...] while females seethed in disappointment over her crotch shots that went viral just days ago." [...] Becky Bain, writing for Idolator, stated that [...] "the stilted dialog between Hilson and Columbus Short {{near the end of the}} mini-movie as well as the former's delivery makes the scene come off like the beginning of a porn movie, and unsurprisingly, the scene ends much like a porn movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Zeta-Jones {{returned}} to stage in 2009 with {{a revival of}} the musical A Little Night Music, which marked her Broadway debut. Set in Sweden during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the relationship between three people (Zeta-Jones, Angela Lansbury and Alexander Hanson) during the course of an evening. She played Desirée Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the play, saying, [...] "There's no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings,... It's not one of those shows where you <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging". She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the play so she could bring her own interpretation to them. The critic Claire Prentice of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a [...] "quiet, reflective poignancy" [...] in her rendition of the song [...] "Send in the Clowns", but Emma Brocks of The Guardian was more critical, remarking that [...] "with her pretty voice, head wresting this way and that, [...] seems to be auditioning for stage school". For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E
500|$|When {{developing}} {{the characteristics of}} their version of Lois Lane, the writers took inspiration from other leading ladies in cinema, for example, Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood, from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Todd Slavkin describes the character as having a [...] "sophisticated, worldly experience", and {{was considered to be}} more of an adult {{than the rest of the}} cast. Durance believes that she embodies many of the characteristics that the creative team wanted to show in their version of Lois, specifically the fact that Lois has a lot of [...] "nervous energy" [...] from trying to [...] "find herself", the same nervous energy that Durance brings to the role. The actress also relates to Lois's sassy, and independent nature, but, conversely, she is not as extroverted as Lois. Gough describes the character as coming from the school of hard knocks; she is street smart, and a very capable woman. Durance believes her character is [...] "fiercely independent", but at the same time she is not afraid to admit that she has flaws, and she is only human; Lois also does not feel sorry about having those flaws. She goes into further detail, identifying the character as more of a tomboy who is vulnerable, with Gough adding that she is also [...] "slightly neurotic". BuddyTV's John Kubicek characterizes her as a fast-talking woman, who, though she whines over petty annoyances, can take care of herself. He goes on to further describe how she is not afraid of getting herself into trouble just so she <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> herself out.|$|E

2500|$|Nightingale {{suggested}} that the storyline [...] "echoed" [...] the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted {{to make her own}} decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a [...] "subtle" [...] reinforcement of an [...] "underlying implication" [...] that women should be punished for exercising their legal right. She comments, [...] "I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment – such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point – and the only one I <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure – come on, what do you know?".|$|E

2500|$|Boars can be {{damaging}} to agriculture. Populations {{living on the}} outskirts of towns or farms <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> up potatoes and damage melons, watermelons and maize. They generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce. In the Belovezh forest for example, 34–47% of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods. While the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated, cases are known of boar depredations causing famines, {{as was the case in}} Hachinohe, Japan in 1749, where 3,000 people died of what became known as the 'wild boar famine'. Still within Japanese culture, the boar's status as vermin is expressed through its title as [...] "king of pests" [...] and the popular saying (addressed to young men in rural areas) [...] "When you get married, choose a place with no wild boar." [...] In Central Europe, farmers typically repel boars through distraction or fright, while in Kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dogs in plantations. Although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth, they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as June bugs under control. The growth of urban areas and corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food. As in natural conditions, sounders in peri-urban areas are matriarchal, though males tend to be much less represented, and adults of both sexes can be up to 35% heavier than their forest-dwelling counterparts. As of 2010, at least 44 cities in 15 countries have experienced problems of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar.|$|E
2500|$|Platinum {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} region of Sinnoh, an island based on the Japanese island Hokkaidō. Like Hoenn and Alola, Sinnoh is not {{connected}} to any other region in the Pokémon universe. It is also characterized by large, snow-covered mountains (Mt. Coronet, part of a mountain range, divides Sinnoh in half). In this game, the starters are Grass-type Turtwig, Fire-type Chimchar, and Water-type Piplup. Unlike other regions, Sinnoh has a [...] "northern" [...] feel to it as it is the only region with permanent snow on the ground, and with routes with snow on the ground and active snowfall. In Platinum, there is snow on the ground in other locations where it was not found in Diamond and Pearl, and the player characters and the player's rival are dressed for colder weather when compared with the designs from the original games. Sinnoh is also characterized by its waterways; it has three main lakes (Verity, Acuity, and Valor) that form a triangle. Unlike the Hoenn region, however, which is mostly water routes, only 30 percent of Sinnoh's landscape comprises waterways. Underneath Sinnoh's surface is the Sinnoh Underground, a large maze of caves and tunnels where players <b>can</b> <b>dig</b> for rare items. Pokémon Platinum, while keeping to the same plot as Diamond and Pearl for the most part, introduces several new elements to it. Two characters are introduced—the first being Charon, a scientist in Team Galactic, and the other being a detective investigating Galactic under the codename [...] "Looker". Giratina is also the focus of the plot, whereas Dialga and Palkia were the focuses of Diamond and Pearl, respectively. However, the player can still obtain both Dialga and Palkia, whereas in Diamond and Pearl, the player could only catch Giratina and the respective game's mascot.|$|E
