30|$|Myocardial {{perfusion}} scintigraphy (MPS) {{is widely}} regarded as a clinically useful noninvasive imaging method for the diagnosis of suspected coronary artery disease, identification of culprit lesions and risk assessment [1 – 4]. Technetium-labeled agents, which are most often used for assessing myocardial perfusion, are cleared by the liver and excreted by the biliary system. Activity in the subdiaphragmatic organs can interfere with evaluation of perfusion in two general ways. Spillover from the extra-cardiac activity into the myocardium, especially the inferior wall, might <b>conceal</b> <b>defects</b> and lower the diagnostic accuracy of the study. The spillover {{is a result of the}} limited spatial resolution of the camera system and scattered photons that are detected in the myocardial area but emanate from the extra-cardiac activity.

A total of 45 sets were built in total, none larger than about two square feet, with the most expensive costing $1.67. It took days to prepare these sets. Florey cut cardboard from laundered shirts and shaped them into squares while Vorkapić painted them impressionistically to resemble buildings. The elevated trains in the cityscape scenes were actually toy trains Florey purchased and mounted on pasteboard runaways. He would pull them along the track on a string with one hand while he shot the scene with the other. Movement on the miniature sets was simulated by moving lamps and casting shadows. To make the miniature sets look more realistic and to <b>conceal</b> <b>defects,</b> prisms and kaleidoscopes were placed in front of the camera lens and moved during filming, and cylinder lens systems were used and rotated during shooting to magnify the image to the desired diameter.

40|$|Sudden {{death is}} a {{frequent}} mode of fatal outcome in cardiac disease and does not exclude young people. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to establish whether and to what extent sudden death in the young may be ascribable to the substrate of underlying congenital heart disease. Among 182 young people (< or = 35 years) who died of cardiac sudden death and underwent postmortem examination, 58 (32 %) had congenital heart disease. Seven showed an intrapericardial rupture of aortic dissection, in the setting of Marfan syndrome in two, isolated bicuspid aortic valve in two, and bicuspid aortic valve and isthmic coarctation in three; all exhibited equally severe degeneration of the aortic wall. Sixteen cases had conduction system anomalies, mostly bypass tracts; 15 coronary artery anomalies (three ostial valve-like stenosis, five origin from the wrong aortic sinus, and seven deep intramyocardial course); 12 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; five postoperative congenital heart disease including scar following ventriculotomy, conduction system injury, and defects left unrepaired; and three congenital aortic valve stenosis. One third of sudden deaths in the young was ascribable to structural defects present since birth. A large spectrum of congenital heart disease involves the risk of sudden death, but most structural defects are usually not considered to be life threatening.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} work {{practices}} of Taiwanese TV producers working in China. Following cross-Strait cultural and media exchanges and Chinese media {{reform in the}} mid to late 1980 s, some Taiwanese TV producers began to work formally with Chinese TV stations, as part of collaborations between TV stations, or informally as freelancers. This thesis explores Taiwanese TV producers‘ work practices in China as a process of engaging in a round or several rounds of career creation. In dissecting and uncovering these work practices, this thesis adopts a theoretical framework consisting of Pierre Bourdieu‘s field theory, James Scott‘s notions of hidden transcripts and everyday forms of resistance, and the Chinese concept of guanxi. Specifically, this research employs Bourdieu‘s notions of field, capital and habitus to investigate the nature of the Chinese TV production field, and how Taiwanese TV producers, with a cultural capital and habitus which differs from that of the Chinese, struggle for position-taking and position-keeping, and negotiate with Chinese officialdom. Scott‘s notions of hidden transcripts and everyday forms of resistance are adopted to uncover the disguises that the dominant display to <b>conceal</b> the <b>defects</b> of their policy, and that the powerless use to resist power and minimize their losses during their work practices within the Chinese TV production field. The Chinese concept of guanxi is analyzed to understand how it influences actors 2 ̆ 7 conduct within this field. Based on Chinese cultural logic, collaboration or competition between Taiwanese TV producers and Chinese TV stations consists not only of an exchange of technical and professional resources, but also consists of the competitive application of guanxi and the calculation of mutual values and interests. This research adopted two data collection methods: in-depth interviews and participant observation. The former were conducted in Taipei, Shanghai, and Beijing between February 2008 and November 2008, and between 31 October 2009 and 13 November 2009, with 11 China-based TV producers, 8 participants from related fields, and 7 scholars who have done Chinese related research. The latter was conducted in a consultancy company in Shanghai between 2 September and 18 October 2009. The findings of thesis show that, in the Chinese TV system, Taiwanese TV producers are considered freelancers, regardless of the titles they apply to themselves, and cannot have a high profile in that field because of their ambiguous work status. Guanxi, in this sense, becomes crucial for Taiwanese TV producers in positioning themselves when they enter into this field. An understanding of the logic of officialdom, in which position is a priority for the officials, is essential to successfully negotiate with the actors within the Chinese TV production field. Negotiation for job opportunities can work out only on the premise that they will keep their position or that their position will not be prejudiced. In addition, TV production is also guided by hidden rules and taboos in relation to politics, religion, and customs. During their work practices, Taiwanese TV producers are exposed to the differences in cultural capital and habitus between themselves, the Mainlanders in the TV production field, and the Mainlander audiences in different regions. Additionally, both dominant and powerless groups tacitly and respectively perform their public transcripts and hidden transcripts to <b>conceal</b> <b>defects,</b> obtain benefits, and minimize potential losses. This thesis also shows that Taiwanese TV producers find themselves in a difficult position when working in the Chinese TV production field. Taiwanese TV producers feel justifiably uncertain because of their ambiguous status. Uncertainty further intensifies the symbolic power of Chinese TV stations because the dominant have absolute power to make the rules and policy and interpret them in the fuzzy area that is between rigid regulations issued by the central authority and TV stations‘ symbolic power. In this circumstance, the superiors and subordinates establish and exercise guanxi to protect themselves from uncertainty: once they have successfully established guanxi with their targets, these targets are also under the symbolic violence of guanxi. However, in the long term, there are no prospects for Taiwanese TV producers to develop their career in China as TV producers, or to fulfil their ambition of signing a contract for a TV program time slot because they are not the qualified workers that Chinese TV stations currently need. In sum, this thesis argues that Bourdieu‘s and Scott‘s notions, and guanxi, which centre on power relations and the exercise of power in a ―fuzzy‖ area, complement each other and can be combined into a theoretical framework in order to comprehensively study the work practices in the Chinese production field...|$|R

The effect of two fibre architectures on the surface finish of unidirectional and 2 &# 0215; 2 twill laminates combined with a surfacing film was studied using surface profilometry and wave-scan distinctness of image (DOI) techniques.

This antiquated dress assorted well with the faded complexion, grey eyes, thin lips, and austere visage of the antiquated maiden, which was, moreover, enhanced by a black hood, worn as her head-gear, carefully disposed so as to prevent any of her hair from escaping to view, probably because the simplicity of the period knew no art of disguising the colour with which time had begun to grizzle her tresses.

Within the framework of a joint project sponsored by the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology, a novel modular concept for a Sewer Inspection Robot (KARO) has been developed and realised as a prototype, which in addition to testing for leaks makes it possible to obtain further necessary data such as the objective and qualified recognition of the location of the defect, the cause of the damage as well as its extent vis-a-vis jeopardising the groundwater. The inspection robot (KARO) distinguishes itself compared with similar developments through a number of advanced functional and design features.

5000|$|July 5, 2013Rolls-Royce [...] "cut corners on quality-control requirements" [...] and [...] "lied to" [...] customers, {{two former}} {{employees}} have alleged in a US lawsuit. The {{company is also}} claimed to have [...] "routinely used defective parts designated as [...] "scrap only" [...] and concealed internal records of potentially dangerous defects in its engine making process. The incendiary allegations are made in a lawsuit filed in the district court for the Southern District of Indiana by two former quality-control officers at Rolls-Royce Corp, part of the UK aerospace group's American operations. It is the legal filing in a long-running dispute brought by Thomas McArtor, a senior quality-control officer from 2003 to 2006 at Rolls' Indianapolis plant, its main US facility. His original complaint in 2008 was joined in 2011 by a second former employee, Keith Ramsey, a quality-control officer who oversaw key parts of the manufacturing and assembly process. Mr. Ramsay alleges he was dismissed for [...] "refusing to cooperate" [...] in the company's [...] "knowing deviations from its quality-control plan". The pair claim that Rolls routinely <b>concealed</b> thousands of <b>defects</b> in engines it sold to clients including the US Department of Defense, collating them in a [...] "secret set of books". The duo are now challenging a court order that prevents them releasing information they claim reveals what Rolls allegedly concealed. The lawsuit comes at a difficult time for Rolls, which was recently taken to task by Australian safety regulators for failing to spot a problem which led to one of its engines on board a Qantas A380 exploding shortly after taking off from Singapore in November 2010. The report criticised the culture at Rolls’ Hucknall plant in the UK, saying it was “considered acceptable to not declare what manufacturing personnel determined to be ‘minor’ non-conformances in manufactured components”.|$|R
40|$|Home sellers in the 1950 s had no {{obligation}} to mention property defects to their buyers {{as long as they}} resisted the temptation to <b>conceal</b> latent <b>defects</b> or to lie about the condition of the property. By the mid- 1960 s the consumer-protective norms applicable to the sale of goods were being applied to protect home buyers. This paper recounts the common law evolution from caveat emptor to ‘seller tell all’, and how, incident to the transition away from caveat emptor, some courts began holding brokers liable for seller errors and omissions that courts believed brokers, as licensed professionals, should have detected and disclosed to prospective buyers. Amorphous, court-imposed disclosure requirements invited fact-laden trials with unpredictable outcomes, as litigators wrestled over what information was “material”, “latent”, “known to the seller”, and inaccessible to the buyer. Eventually, to reduce their own exposure to legal liability, brokers warmed to the idea of insisting upon sellers filling out detailed property condition disclosure forms which brokers would then transmit to prospective buyers. To cut back on their own expanding liability, assist buyers to become fully informed about the property before committing to a purchase, and clarify for sellers exactly what they need to disclose, REALTORS® developed a protocol now in place throughout the country. Home sellers are given no practical choice but to fill out a detailed property condition disclosure form for the benefit of prospective buyers. In all but a rapidly-dwindling number of states home sellers nowadays are expected to provide buyers with a detailed account of known material defects–a statutory norm in about two-thirds of the states, and an accepted practice implemented by real estate sales agents nationwide. As the REALTORS® anticipated, buyers who receive these reports {{are less likely to be}} disappointed with their home purchases afterward and, thus, are also less likely to file insurance claims and lawsuits against sellers or brokers for undisclosed defects. As the use of property condition disclosure forms has become commonplace, more buyers than ever are yielding to the repeated entreaties of REALTORS® and hiring home inspectors to check out the items signaled for attention in the disclosures presented to them. In the course of establishing full seller disclosure as the norm, brokers needed to answer some key questions, addressed in this paper. (1) Should property condition disclosure forms be embedded in state statutes, promulgated by state regulatory agencies, or issued by local associations of REALTORS®? (2) Should seller compliance be mandated by statute or implemented voluntarily through language in broker-drafted listing and residential purchase agreements obligating sellers to make full disclosure? (3) What topics should disclosure forms cover? (4) Should forms be extensive or abbreviated?(5) Should sellers who pay for professional physical inspections of their properties be excused from having to complete disclosure forms? (6) Should sellers be able to avoid disclosure through disclaimers and waivers? (7) Should sellers be required to disclose the existence of area-wide natural and man-made hazards, even if they had to pay firms to gather this information for the benefit of prospective buyers...|$|R
