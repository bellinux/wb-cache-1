The pervasive application of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> has outpaced knowledge about why <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> are such useful indicators of individual behavior. Here we test if the same factors that lead to poor <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> also lead to poor health. Following the Dunedin (New Zealand) Longitudinal Study cohort of 1, 037 study members, we examined the association between <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> and cardiovascular disease risk and the underlying factors that account for this association.

40|$|Abstract: The {{literature}} has documented {{a positive relationship}} between the use of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> for small business loans and small business credit availability, broadly defined. However, this literature is hampered by the fact that all of the studies are based on a single 1998 survey of the very largest U. S. banking organizations. This paper addresses a number of deficiencies in the extant literature by employing data from a new survey on the use of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> in small business lending, primarily by community banks. The survey evidence suggests that the use of <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> in small business lending by community banks is surprisingly widespread. Moreover, the scores employed tend to be the consumer <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> of the small business owners rather than the more encompassing small business <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> that include data on the firms {{as well as on the}} owners. Our empirical analysis suggests that <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> is associated with increased small business lending after a learning period, with no material change in the quality of the loan portfolio. However, these quantity and quality results appear to vary depending on the way in which <b>credit</b> <b>scores</b> are implemented in the underwriting process...|$|R

25|$|New credit {{scores have}} been {{developed}} {{in the last decade}} by companies such as Scorelogix, PRBC, L2C, Innovis etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS <b>Credit</b> <b>Score</b> uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay. It is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative <b>credit</b> <b>score</b> that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.|$|E

The utilization ratio is the amount owed divided by the amount extended by the creditor and the lower it is the better a FICO rating, in general. So if a person has one credit card with a used balance of $500 and a limit of $1,000 as well as another with a used balance of $700 and $2,000 limit, the average ratio is 40 percent ($1,200 total used divided by $3,000 total limits). If the first credit card company raises the limit to $2,000, the ratio lowers to 30 percent, which could boost the FICO rating.|$|E
40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>scoring</b> is {{a common}} tool used by lenders in credit risk management. However, recent <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> methods are error-prone. Failures from <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> will {{significantly}} affect the next process, which is payment collection from customers. Bad customers, who are incorrectly approved by <b>credit</b> <b>scoring,</b> end up making payments that, are overdue. In this dissertation, we propose a solution for pre-empting overdue payment as well as improving <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> performance. Firstly, we utilize data mining algorithms including Logistic Regression, C 4. 5, and Bayesian Network to construct payment predictions that can quickly find overdue payments in advance. By utilizing payment prediction, customers who may make overdue payments will be known by the lender earlier. As a result, the lender can proactively approach such customers to pay their payments on schedule. The second solution is to define a refined scoring model that will use feedback from the payment prediction models to improve the initial <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> mechanism. The payment prediction result will give information to review the combinations of current <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> parameters that work inappropriately. By updating the current <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> parameters, the performance of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> {{is expected to increase}} significantly. As a result, this mechanism will create a dynamic <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> model. We also investigate the impact of the imbalanced data problem on the payment prediction process. We employ data segmentation as a tool to overcome the problem of imbalanced data. By using a novel technique of data segmentation, which we call Majority Bad Payment Segments (MBPS), learning bad payments become much easier. The results of our experiments show that payment prediction based on MBPS produces much higher performance when compared to conventional methods of dealing with imbalanced data. We perform extensive experimentation and evaluation with a variety of metrics such as Hit Rates, Cost Coverage, F-measure, and the Area under Curve measure...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in the retail banking sector is that of evaluating the creditworthiness of credit applicants. This problem is addressed by the methodology of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring.</b> The methodology of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> involves the construction of models (i. e. <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> models) which classify each credit applicant into one of two classes: the class of applicants who are predicted not to default with their obligations and are granted credit and the class of applicants who are predicted to default with their obligations and are not granted credit. The goal of this thesis is to study the methodology of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> and how this methodology can be implemented by means of computer software applications. In pursuing this goal, this thesis examines the theoretical background of the methodology of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> and analyzes <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> data by means of the XLMiner software package and constructed software templates. Within the framework of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> data analysis, methods used for the construction of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> models are assessed. Particular emphasis is given into the method known as the Naive (Simple) Bayes Rule (NBR). Specifically, a real-world <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> data set from a major Greek bank is used to benchmark NBR against linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, classification trees and k-nearest neighbours. Five partitions of this data set into training and test sets are used. Predictive ability is measured by the percentage of correctly classified cases and the bad rate amongst accepts. NBR appears to have a lower predictive ability than the other methods under both the aforementioned predictive ability measures. This result may be attributed to properties inherent in the field of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring,</b> i. e. significant dependence given the class of the variables used in this field and large training set sizes. The results allow the application of NBR as a method for the construction of <b>credit</b> <b>scoring</b> models, because of the small (statistically non-significant) differences in predictive ability between the methods and the simplicity of NBR. ...|$|R
