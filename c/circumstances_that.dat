5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E

Doggett appeared in the opening credits and every episode from the season eight premiere to the final episode of season 9.|$|E
5|$|In August 1814, British forces {{attacked}} Washington, D.C. {{and burned}} the White House. Congress formed {{a committee to}} investigate the <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> allowed Washington to be captured. Johnson chaired this committee, and delivered its final report. After the sacking of Washington, the tide of battle turned against the British, and the Treaty of Ghent ended the war even as Johnson prepared to return to Kentucky to raise another military unit. With {{the end of the}} war, he turned his legislative attention to issues such as securing pensions for widows and orphans and funding internal improvements in the West.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> led him to Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, {{does not provide a}} definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E
5|$|The area constituting Pakistan was {{historically}} {{a part of}} the British Indian Empire {{throughout much}} of the nineteenth century. The East India Company begun their trade in South Asia in the 17th century, and the company rule started from 1757 when they won the Battle of Plassey. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control over much of the Indian subcontinent. All-India Muslim League was founded by the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference at Dhaka, in 1906, {{in the context of the}} <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> were generated over the division of Bengal in 1905 and the party aimed at creation of a separate Muslim state.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} to East Timor {{highlighted the}} limits of the Australian Defence Force and the need for an Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers.|$|E

5|$|Benbow's next post was as Master Attendant of Chatham Dockyard. He {{then moved}} to become Master Attendant at Deptford Dockyard in early March 1690, a post he {{intermittently}} held {{for the next six}} years. He was master of HMS Sovereign in summer 1690, under his old commander Arthur Herbert, now Lord Torrington. He was assigned to act as master of the fleet, and took part in the English defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head. After the defeat, a Royal Commission was held into the <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> led to it. Benbow was highly regarded as a specialist in both navigation and pilotage, and his evidence given in July 1690 to the preliminary investigation strongly favoured his old patron, Torrington. He did not however testify during Torrington's court-martial in December that year.|$|E
5|$|During the conflict, it is {{revealed}} that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who {{was thought to}} be dead. The real Madara saved Tobi's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.|$|E

5|$|I. C. Filitti {{was not in}} {{a celebratory}} mood as the National Liberals publicized their August 1916 Treaty, when Romania became part of the Entente. His diaries record not only his general frustration, but also his belief that the decades of PNL rule had left the {{military}} ill-prepared, and claims about generalized embezzlement within the Army. He was soon after drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, as officer of the Second Field Army, and stationed in Bucharest. When the German-led counteroffensive forced the army on the retreat, resulting in the Central Powers' occupation of southern Romania, Filitti took his most controversial decision. In <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> are largely unknown, he opted to stay behind in occupied territory, and greeted the enemy. According to Boia, Filitti received two contradictory orders: one to follow the Imperial Russian Army as liaison officer, the other to stay behind in Bucharest; he conveniently opted to follow the latter.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Archibald Wavell called Clarke to Cairo {{and placed}} him in charge of {{strategic}} deception. As a cover, he was employed {{to set up a}} regional organisation for MI9, a British escape and evasion department. The following year Clarke received a war establishment and set up Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force with a small staff to plan deception operations. Once satisfied with the department's structure, he pursued intelligence contacts in Turkey and Spain. In late 1941 Clarke was called to London, where his deception work had come to the attention of Allied high command. Shortly afterward, while in Madrid, he was arrested wearing women's clothing, in <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> remain unclear. He was released and after being questioned by the governor of Gibraltar, allowed to return to Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} because they believe Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E

5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon leakage {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This acts as a subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> justify it and that governments could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries. A problem with border adjustments is {{that they might be}} used as a disguise for trade protectionism. Some types of border adjustment may also not prevent emissions leakage.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1894 Eberhardt began {{corresponding}} with Eugène Letord, a French officer {{stationed in the}} Sahara who had placed a newspaper advertisement for a pen pal. Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her {{about life in the}} Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged the two of them to relocate to Bône, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> remain unclear though involved financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Stigand did {{not travel}} to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium, the band worn around the neck that is the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from the pope. Travelling to Rome for the pallium had become a custom, practised {{by a number of}} his predecessors. Instead, some medieval chroniclers state that he used Robert of Jumièges' pallium. It is not known if Stigand even petitioned the papacy for a pallium soon after his appointment. Owing to the reform movement, Stigand {{probably}} knew the request would be unsuccessful. In 1058 Antipope Benedict X, who opposed much of the reform movement, gave Stigand a pallium. However, Benedict was deposed the following year; the reforming party declared Benedict an antipope, and nullified all his acts, including Stigand's pallium grant. The exact <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> led to Benedict granting a pallium are unknown, whether it was at Stigand's request or was given without prompting.|$|E
