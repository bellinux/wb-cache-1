25|$|Placing a {{conductive}} {{thick plate}} as a heat transfer interface between a heat source {{and a cold}} flowing fluid (or any other heat sink) may improve the <b>cooling</b> <b>performance.</b> In such arrangement, the heat source is cooled under the thick plate instead of being cooled {{in direct contact with}} the cooling fluid. It is shown that the thick plate can significantly improve the heat transfer between the heat source and the cooling fluid by way of conducting the heat current in an optimal manner. The two most attractive advantages of this method are that no additional pumping power and no extra heat transfer surface area, that is quite different from fins (extended surfaces).|$|E
25|$|One key {{advance in}} the Kestrel {{was the use of}} a {{pressurised}} cooling system. Water boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure, but this temperature decreases with altitude. Since the amount of heat carried out of the engine is a function of coolant temperature and volume, the coolant has to be kept below boiling point and an increasing amount of fluid has to be used, along with an increasingly large radiator to cool it. The solution was to pressurise the entire cooling system, thereby not only preventing the decrease in <b>cooling</b> <b>performance</b> with altitude, but in fact increasing the boiling point even on the ground. The Kestrel was built to maintain enough pressure to keep the boiling point at about 150°C.|$|E

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics {{codes are}} {{increasingly}} used to simulate containment conditions after various transient accident scenarios. This paper presents validation experiments, {{conducted in the}} frame of the OECD/SETH- 2 project. These experiments address the combined effects of mass sources and heat sinks related to gas mixing and hydrogen transport within containment compartments. A wall jet interacts with an operating containment cooler located in the middle (M-configuration) and the top (T-configuration) of the containment vessel. The experiments are characterized by a 3 -phase injection scenario. In Phase I, pure steam is injected, while in Phase II, a helium-steam mixture is injected. Finally, in Phase III, pure steam is injected again. Results for the M-configuration show helium stratification build up during Phase II. During Phase III, a positively buoyant plume emerging from the cooler housing becomes negatively buoyant once it reaches the helium-steam layer and continuously erodes the layer. For the M-configuration, a strong degradation of the <b>cooler</b> <b>performance</b> was observed during the injection of the helium/steam mixture (Phase II). For the T-configuration, we observe a mainly downwards acting cooler resulting in a combination of forced and natural convection flow patterns.
