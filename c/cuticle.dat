5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the <b>cuticle,</b> a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new <b>cuticle.</b> At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old <b>cuticle</b> splits and the new <b>cuticle</b> expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars undergo ecdysis {{and have}} a number of larval instars, usually five but varying between species. The new <b>cuticle</b> is soft and allows the {{increase}} in size and development of the caterpillar before becoming hard and inelastic. In the last ecdysis, the old <b>cuticle</b> splits and curls up into a small ball at the posterior end of the pupa and is known as the larval exuvia.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius fallax is {{classified}} in the section Plinthogalus of the subgenus Plinthogalus of the genus Lactarius. Species in this section have brown to blackish caps, and a cap <b>cuticle</b> that contains a dissolved brown pigment. The <b>cuticle</b> of most species is of the trichoderm type—where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface.|$|E
5000|$|Remy {{human hair}} is {{considered}} to be the best quality of human hair because the <b>cuticles</b> are kept intact and not stripped away. The preserved <b>cuticles</b> are also aligned in a unidirectional manner, which decreases tangling and matting. [...] It has been carefully separated after collecting from the hair donor to ensure all the <b>cuticles</b> are of the same length.|$|R
40|$|Dispersed <b>cuticles</b> with surface {{ornamentation}} {{recovered from}} the Lower Old Red Sandstone (Gedinnian) of Hereford and Worcester, England, are described, named and placed in an artificial, morphologically based classification system. Four species of the new genus Cosmochlaina are distinguished {{on the nature of}} the ornament. The affinities of the plants covered by such <b>cuticles</b> remain unknown: the <b>cuticles</b> are named to facilitate their use in biogeographic, stratigraphic and evolutionary studies...|$|R
50|$|In botany, plant <b>cuticles</b> are protective, hydrophobic, waxy {{coverings}} {{produced by}} the epidermal cells of leaves, young shoots and all other aerial plant organs. <b>Cuticles</b> minimize water loss and effectively reduce pathogen entry due to their waxy secretion.|$|R
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough <b>cuticle</b> made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new <b>cuticle</b> hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap <b>cuticle</b> black, and the stipe <b>cuticle</b> pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe <b>cuticle</b> light gray.|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap <b>cuticle</b> will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous sulphate solution turns the <b>cuticle</b> yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cuticles</b> of Nematothallus Lang scnsu Edwards are {{described}} from a Lower Devonian (Ditton) exposure on the M 50 motorway (Hereford and Worcester, England).

40|$|The {{composition}} of Malus pumila Mill. cutin from <b>cuticles</b> isolated using ZnCl 2 -HCl reagent {{has been compared}} to that isolated by an oxalate-enzymic method.

40|$|The uptake {{kinetics}} {{and storage}} of PCBs by isolated <b>cuticles</b> and cuticular waxes from Hedera helix, Prunus laurocerasus, and Ilex aquifolium were studied. Small chambers were used, allowing variation in plant uptake parameters {{to be studied}} by having the same air boundary layer in each chamber. During the 64 day study tri- and tetrachlorinated biphenyls generally reached equilibrium in waxes but not in whole <b>cuticles.</b> Differences between species were observed. Higher chlorinated PCB congeners did not approach equilibrium in either sample type. Although PCBs showed higher affinity for waxes than whole <b>cuticles,</b> the latter dominated the total uptake capacity on a surface area basis, {{because of the large}} amount of nonwax cuticular components. Mass transfer coefficients (MTCs) for PCB uptake (into both <b>cuticles</b> and waxes) indicated partition dependence up to log octanol/air partition coefficients (KOA) of 8. 5 − 10, depending on species and sample type. For <b>cuticles,</b> higher MTCs occurred {{at the beginning of the}} experiment than later. This was not seen in reconstituted waxes, a difference which may be explained by the dispersion of intracuticular waxes within <b>cuticles.</b> For more lipophilic compounds, uptake appeared to be limited by diffusion processes, which may be influenced by plant physiology. Leaf surface area is, therefore, likely to control the ability of vegetation to scavenge these compounds from the air in many field situations...|$|R
5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a <b>cuticle.</b> This would have been impermeable and thus forced {{the development of more}} sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the <b>cuticle</b> would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E
5|$|The spores are broadly , smooth, colorless, amyloid (staining bluish to blue-black when {{treated with}} Melzer's reagent), {{thin-walled}}, and measure 8–9 by 5–6µm. The basidia are 40–60 by 10–12µm, club-shaped, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant, club-shaped, and measure 30–45 by 10–17µm. Their tips {{are covered with}} one or more, knob-like short excrescences that are colorless and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The hymenophoral tissue (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 12–21µm wide, cylindrical (but often somewhat inflated), smooth, and contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. These hyphae are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. The cap <b>cuticle</b> is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2–7µm wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are smooth, or can be covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or pale brownish, and dextrinoid. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap <b>cuticle</b> is parallel, cylindrical, hyaline or brownish, and dextrinoid; it has short and inflated cells that are up to 48µm wide. The stem <b>cuticle</b> is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3–8µm wide, and similar to the hyphae of the cap <b>cuticle.</b> The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are 45–88 by 5–8µm, cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless or brownish, and thin-walled. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 8–25µm wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} cap <b>cuticle,</b> the stem <b>cuticle,</b> the gill flesh, and at the basal septa of the basidia.|$|E
5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap <b>cuticle</b> red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the flesh, and brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both the flesh and the <b>cuticle.</b> Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the <b>cuticle.</b>|$|E
40|$|Using {{isolated}} cuticular membranes {{from ten}} woody and herbaceous plant species, permeance and diffusion coefficients for water were measured, and partition coefficients were calculated. The cuticular membranes of fruit had much higher permeance and diffusion coefficients than leaf cuticular membranes from either trees or herbs. Both diffusion and partition coefficients increased with increasing membrane thickness. Thin <b>cuticles,</b> therefore, {{tend to be}} better and more efficient water barriers than thick <b>cuticles.</b> We compared the diffusion coefficients and the water content of <b>cuticles</b> as calculated from transport measurements with those obtained from water vapor sorption. There is good to fair agreement for cuticular membranes with a low water content, but large discrepancies appear for polymer matrix membranes with high permeance. This is {{probably due to the}} fact that diffusion coefficients obtained from transport measurements on membranes with high permeance and water content are underestimated. Water permeabilities of polyethylene and polypropylene membranes are similar to those of leaf cuticular membranes. However, leaf <b>cuticles</b> have much lower diffusion coefficients and a much greater water content than these synthetic polymers. This suggests that <b>cuticles</b> are primarily mobility barriers as far as water transport is concerned...|$|R

5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains <b>cuticle</b> layers with randomly located blocks of <b>cuticle</b> that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal end of each scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old <b>cuticle.</b> When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old <b>cuticle</b> split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on foliar fertilization. It is {{nowadays}} {{one of the most}} widespread types of application of commercial fertilizers. Concern of this thesis is the study of plant <b>cuticles</b> as a thin layer on the leaves. These thin membranes are responsible for regulation of water transport and nutrients. Further function of plant <b>cuticles</b> is the mechanical protection of the outer part of the plant. Plant <b>cuticles</b> were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, classical optical microscopy and profilometry. The main aim of this thesis is the optimization and verification of experimental methodology aimed to the transport of commercial humic product through plant <b>cuticles</b> by simple diffusion techniques. The results obtained by presented diffusion techniques of humic product through plant <b>cuticles</b> were correlated with the same diffusion experiments through synthetic membranes with defined pore size and density. The study on transport of commercial humic product was realized in hydrogel medium by two different diffusion methods – non-stationary diffusion technique and diffusion couple. The important part of this diploma thesis is the characterization of supported hydrogel matrix by rheology tests, mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanned electron microscopy. Conclusions of this diploma thesis could be used for improving of efficiency of foliar fertilization...|$|R

40|$|Leaf {{samples of}} six tree species were {{collected}} along urban roadsides and a campus site in Beijing for measurement of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs). PAHs in leaves were attributed to two fractions, leaf <b>cuticles</b> and inner leaf tissues, using sequential extraction. Total concentrations of 16 PAHs in the <b>cuticles</b> and the inner tissues were 69. 3 +/- 64. 6 mu g g(- 1) (d. w.) and 1. 07 +/- 0. 2 mu g g(- 1) (d. w.) at roadside and 57. 5 +/- 52. 6 mu g g(- 1) and 0. 716 +/- 0. 2 pg g(- 1) on campus, respectively. The lipid-normalized inner tissue PAHs varied from 5. 8 mu g g(- 1) to 15. 0 mu g g(- 1). Similarities in PAH spectra between leaf <b>cuticles</b> and airborne particles and between the inner tissues and gaseous phase imply that airborne particulates and gaseous PAHs are likely the sources of PAHs for <b>cuticles</b> and the inner tissues, respectively. Difficulty in migration of heavier PAHs into inner tissues could be another reason. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
