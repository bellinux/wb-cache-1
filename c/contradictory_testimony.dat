5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is <b>contradictory.</b> <b>Testimony</b> from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered.

25|$|As stated before, most of {{the story}} is {{reported}} by direct speech of the women and Solomon, with a few sentences and utterance verbs by the narrator. The dialogues move the plot forward. The women's <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimonies</b> create the initial conflict necessary to build up the dramatic tension. The king's request to bring him a sword enhances the tension, as the reader wonders why it is needed. The story comes to its climax with the shocking royal order to cut the boy, which for a moment casts doubt on the king's judgment. But {{what seems to be the}} verdict turns out to be a clever trick which achieves its goal, and results in the recognition of the true mother and the resolution.|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the assertion found in post–World War II Yugoslav historiography, that a mobile gas van was deployed in Nazi-occupied Serbia not just at the Semlin Judenlager in Belgrade but also at another camp in the city, Banjica. This claim {{is based on a}} small number of <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimonies,</b> mainly from survivors, which were collected by local institutions after the war. How can we explain the presence of this by all accounts erroneous claim in the testimonies of survivors? Why and how was it incorporated into the camp's history in spite of the glaring inconsistencies and the absence of corroborating evidence? The article argues that individual memories of the gas van encountered in the testimonies, and their subsequent assimilation into the historical memory of the war, are both products of the same dynamic, namely the socially mediated and institutionally embedded nature of 'witnessing. ï¿...|$|R

5000|$|Piotr Gontarczyk of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance {{was one of}} {{the first}} Polish historians to {{publicize}} the fact that the often <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimonies</b> on which the book was based were extracted from Polish witnesses in pre-trial beatings conducted by the Security Office (UB) in 1949. According to Gontarczyk, Gross's narrative was uncritical in that regard. Plus, additional accounts used by Gross came from recollections of Jewish emigrants from postwar Poland (pg. 18) which since have been proven also to be factually inaccurate. Gontarczyk noted that Gross fails to inform the reader about Polish-Jewish relations in the Soviet-occupied Eastern Borderlands and the Jewish participation in the communist terror apparatus in Jedwabne preceding the German attack on the Soviet Union controlling the area since 1939. Gontarczyk writes that in Neighbours Gross [...] "constructs a historical narrative on the basis of stereotypes, prejudices and common gossip... which have no scholarly basis whatsoever." ...|$|R
50|$|The four trials, {{during the}} course of which most of the youths were convicted and sentenced to death by all-white juries despite the weak and <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimonies</b> of the witnesses, are now widely {{regarded}} (including in Scottsboro) as one of the worst travesties of justice perpetrated against blacks in the post-Reconstruction South. Only the first trials were held in Scottsboro. Of the original nine young black defendants (some of them minors), accused of gang raping two fellow hobo white women on a freight train, eight were quickly convicted and sentenced to death in quick succession in trials occurring in a mob atmosphere in Scottsboro by all-white juries. The only two attorneys who were willing to take the cases had few qualifications for criminal defense work. They were unable to put up much of a defense when the judge gave them no time to prepare their defenses before the trials. He started the first trial as soon as they agreed to take the cases and then began each next case as soon the jury had gone out on the previous one.|$|R

50|$|In 2007, two {{officers}} {{were charged with}} causing bodily harm with fatal consequences and with involuntary manslaughter, respectively, but were acquitted in December 2008 for lack of evidence. According to the presiding judge, <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimony</b> had prevented clarification of the circumstances and had obstructed due process. The Federal Court of Justice annulled one of the acquittals, and since January 2011, a different Landgericht than before {{is concerned with the}} case.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} notable early refutations of the Protocols as a forgery were a series of {{articles}} printed in The Times of London in 1921. This series revealed that much of the material in the Protocols was plagiarized from an earlier political satire that did not have an antisemitic theme. Since 1903, when the Protocols first appeared in print, its earliest publishers have offered vague and often <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimony</b> detailing how they obtained their copies of the rumored original manuscript.|$|E
50|$|In June 2010, Chief Advocate General Avichai Mandelblit summoned a {{recently}} discharged Givati Brigade sniper {{for a special}} hearing. The soldier was suspected of opening fire on Palestinian civilians {{when a group of}} 30 Palestinians that included women and children waving a white flag, approached an IDF position. The incident, which occurred on 4 January 2009, resulted in the death of a non-combatant. Mandelblit decided to indict the soldier on a charge of manslaughter, despite <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimony</b> and the fact that IDF investigators could not confirm that the soldier was responsible for the death.|$|E
50|$|The Gobernadorcillo of Dapdap, Mr. Villanueva Perez, {{and other}} principales opposed to move. They {{manifested}} that it’s {{hard for them}} to abandon their fields, their livestock and their lands in which they were accustomed to live, but apparently their arguments centered on their desire to prevent the transfer of the blessed image of Saint Francis of Assisi to Tarangnan. The parish priest, Fr. Angel Pulido OFM., refuted all and every reason and ultimately filed a complaint against for the imputed crime of insurrection. The <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimonies</b> presented {{in the course of the}} investigation precipitated and incident resulting in the arrest of the Dapdap officials. However, Adolfo Rodriguez of the Visayan Regional Office recommended their release and reinstatement to their public office, but the phenomenal removal in 1882 of the altar and the image of Saint Francis to Tarangnan deeply touched the Dapdap leaders and followers.On October 9, 1883, disregarding evaluation of the attendant circumstances, the move of the poblacion was ordered by a decree of Governor General Fernando Primo de Rivera, and was approved by King Alfonso I of Spain in April 1884. The new pueblo of Tarangnan rapidly prospered. Subsidiary population clusters from nearby visitas, barangays, Rancherias, and sitios immigrated to the poblacion. By 1896, Tarangnan had 1,392 inhabitants while Dapdap just 533, and indication that Tarangnan indeed surpassed the former poblacion in strategic importance.|$|R

50|$|The {{murder trial}} began on July 16, 1979 in the Federal {{courthouse}} in Raleigh, North Carolina. Although MacDonald’s lawyers, Bernard Segal and Wade Smith, were confident of an acquittal {{from the first}} day, one thing after another went badly for the defense. It began when Dupree refused a defense request {{to admit into evidence}} a psychiatric evaluation of MacDonald, which suggested that someone of his personality type was unable to kill his family. Dupree explained that since no insanity plea had been entered for MacDonald, he did not want the trial bogged down by <b>contradictory</b> psychiatric <b>testimony</b> from prosecution and defense witnesses.|$|R
50|$|The local {{authorities}} {{are eager to}} convict Clyde, {{to the point of}} manufacturing additional evidence against him, although he repeatedly incriminates himself with his confused and <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimony.</b> Clyde has a sensational trial before an unsympathetic and prejudiced jury of mostly religious conservative farmers. Despite a vigorous (and untruthful) defense by two lawyers hired by his uncle, Clyde is convicted, sentenced to death, and after an appeal is executed by electric chair. The jailhouse scenes and correspondence between Clyde and his mother are exemplars of pathos in modern literature.|$|E

60|$|It {{being the}} month of August, when the pale face of the {{townsman}} and the stranger is to be seen among the brown skins of remotest uplanders, not only in England, but throughout the temperate zone, few of the homeward-bound labourers paused to notice him further than by a momentary turn of the head. They had beheld such gentlemen before, not exactly measuring the church so accurately as this one seemed to be doing, but painting it from a distance, or at least walking round the mouldy pile. At {{the same time the}} present visitor, even exteriorly, was not altogether commonplace. His features were good, his eyes of the dark deep sort called eloquent by the sex that ought to know, and with that ray of light in them which announces a heart susceptible to beauty of all kinds,--in woman, in art, and in inanimate nature. Though he would have been broadly characterized as a young man, his face bore <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimonies</b> to his precise age. This was conceivably owing to a too dominant speculative activity in him, which, while it had preserved the emotional side of his constitution, and with it the significant flexuousness of mouth and chin, had played upon his forehead and temples till, at weary moments, they exhibited some traces of being over-exercised. A youthfulness about the mobile features, a mature forehead--though not exactly what the world has been familiar with in past ages--is now growing common; and with the advance of juvenile introspection it probably must grow commoner still. Briefly, he had more of the beauty--if beauty it ought to be called--of the future human type than of the past; but not so much as to make him other than a nice young man.|$|R
5000|$|Browne v. Dunn (1893) 6 R. 67, H.L. is {{a famous}} British House of Lords {{decision}} on the rules of cross examination.

50|$|In 2007, an {{employee}} in a Boston area store {{was fired after}} she announced her pregnancy. The terminated employee filed suit for sex discrimination. The employee claimed that after telling her employer of her pregnancy, he became unfriendly, as well as demanding towards her, and gave her increasingly more work. The owner's credibility was severely compromised when he gave <b>contradictory</b> <b>testimony</b> about the employee's performance. Additional testimony alleged that the owner refused to consider applicants for employment if they came into the store with small children. The terminated employee was awarded $9,471.00 in back pay, as well as $20,000.00 in damages for emotional distress.|$|E

50|$|A trial {{against the}} Mashpee Nine was called and Lew Gurwitz, an {{attorney}} who specialized in defending indigenous peoples, decided to take their case for no pay (instead {{he was given a}} place to sleep, food, and gas money). The Mashpee Nine considered pleading guilty on the basis that the fine or probation they received would be better than being harassed by the same cops again. Lew helped to coach the Mashpee Nine how to hold themselves in court and succeeded in discovering discrepancies in the story during depositions of several police officers involved. The trial was held on December 27, 1976, where Lew’s motion to have the native people swear on a traditional medicine pipe instead of the Bible was granted (unprecedented in Massachusetts courts, and probably the entire country). When Lew asked the police to produce the photos of campsite damage, they were said to be “lost”, causing Lew to show the second set that Dawn had secretly kept. In combination with the extremely <b>contradictory</b> officers’ <b>testimonies</b> and after months of hearings, the Mashpee Nine were found not guilty.|$|R
40|$|In 1982, the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law (AAPL) was {{a growing}} and ambitious {{professional}} organization. Its membership {{was a small}} but vigorous group united {{by the desire to}} develop the emerging psychiatric subspecialty of forensic psychiatry within the larger context of psychiatry. The organization was 13 years old. It was devoted to the goal of uplifting the practice of forensic psychiatry in the United States through continuing education and specialty training. AAPL was well positioned to achieve its goal. Its leaders were fairly single-minded and many were strategically placed within the hierarchy of the American Psychiatric Association. Subspecialty recognition within psychiatry and medicine appeared attainable. Then came the United States v. Hinckley case. Every aspect of the case was controversial: {{the facts of the case}} itself, the use of the insanity defense, the <b>contradictory</b> psychiatric <b>testimony</b> and, finally, the verdict. Forensic psychiatry was put on the defensive, and at the height of the controversy the former President of the American Psychiatric Association and the nation’s most prominent Professor of Law and Psychiatry delivered a simple luncheon speech.

40|$|At present, {{experts have}} become a {{mainstay}} of modern litigation, although criticisms suggest that the problems of how to fit expert knowledge comfortably into the method of adversarial fact-finding are numerous, significant, and without simple solutions. Concerns about partisanship and lack of scientific competence by adjudicators to evaluate <b>contradictory</b> expert <b>testimony</b> have been widely recognized in the traditional use of party-called expert witnesses. While such concerns cannot be wholly ameliorated, there may be alternative mechanisms that can help. One solution would be to call {{for the use of}} neutral court-appointed experts, to create a nonpartisan source of expert knowledge. A system of neutral court-appointed experts is an advisory tribunal to the court that could deliver "those general truths, applicable to the issue, which they may treat as final and decisive. " However, no matter in which country, the choice of appointing neutral experts still seems to be a rare option for trial judges to consider and exercise. An obvious question would be: Why are neutral experts not used more frequently at trial? This paper did a study on court-appointed experts, with a focus on challenges that such mechanism faces. Part I examines problems in the traditional use of expert witnesses in an adversarial system. Part II discusses the incentives to make greater use of court-appointed experts in a typical adversarial system and to what extent such mechanism would solve difficulties within the traditional use of party-called expert witnesses. Part III further explores and analyzes obstacles that a typical neutral expert system nowadays encounters when it operates in practice. Taking all analysis together, Part IV makes an overall evaluation of the mechanism of court-appointed experts...|$|R
