50|$|A wood shaper, {{usually just}} shaper in North America or spindle moulder in the UK, is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine {{in which a}} vertically oriented spindle drives <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> to mill profiles on wood stock.

40|$|Geotechnical risks play an {{important}} role in the selection of tunneling method and machine types. In order to prevent some geological and geotechnical hazards during tunneling, selecting the most appropriate tunneling machine is very important. In this research study the main geotechnical hazards of tunneling by roadheader with their common mitigation measures are discussed. At present, three roadheader are excavating the three drifts of the Tabas coal mine in Iran. Hence, these drifts were used in this research study. The risk assessment matrix method in these tunnels showed that there is a lower risk of tunneling by roadheader than utilising the drilling and blasting method. The determined geotechnical risk assessment showed that the transverse <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> was more suitable in comparison to a longitudinal <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> for such tunnels. Then by using an instantaneous cutting rate model, the <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> power of the roadheader was determined. According to the model, a lightweight roadheader with a <b>cutter</b> <b>head</b> power of about 80 - 110 KW and 40 t weight are suitable.

50|$|A {{router table}} is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine in which a vertically oriented spindle of a woodworking router protrudes from the machine table and can be spun at speeds typically between 3000 and 24,000 rpm. <b>Cutter</b> <b>heads</b> (router bits) may be mounted in the spindle chuck. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a router table and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a router table {{with the aid of}} pushtool accessories etc.|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of recent methane and coal dust explosions worldwide, {{the need for the}} {{improvements}} in the existing environment control technology continue to exist. Considerable progress in environment (dust and methane) control in South African mines has indeed been made but they remain a matter of great concern. The introduction of the 1997 Directive on dust exposure levels and face ventilation was a milestone for the South African coal mining industry in improving health and safety standards. These stricter guidelines and the latest dust control technologies are beneficial not only in the long-term health perspective, but also to in terms of controlling methane and coal dust explosions (high-risk) in the short term.

40|$|Abstract: In {{manufacturing}} area, one of {{the most}} complex technological processes is the machining of spiral bevel gears. For these processes, special machine tools designed with peculiar manuals for calculating the gear geometry, and the setting-up processes were developed. The known technologies and design of gear-cutting machine tools are different and based on processes that cut the concave and convex sides of the spiral tooth separately or simultaneously. These processes are different in productivity and quality of gear machining. Due to these circumstances, manufacturers created many modifications, with different qualities of the gear-cutting processes. Presently, there are following technologies: continuous indexing (face-hobbing) and single indexing (face-milling) that unlimitedly available to the user. This paper presents a new face-milling process of machining spiral bevel gears that can increase productivity and improve the quality of gears. The new process presents a solution that uses two <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> simultaneously for machining both concave and convex sides of the spiral teeth. Manufacturers can accept the new technology of the spiral bevel gear that needs a wide spectrum of research to get optimal solutions...|$|E

However, a few years back I came across an interesting chapter in a vacuum tube book[1] which spoke of a mythical 3. 18 ms corner in the RIAA response. Huh? That’s 50 kHz. The seminal works[2][3] never mentioned this, equalization was to appear as Figure 1. Figure 1. Desired inverse RIAA response from Lipshitz. Hmmm. The mythical corner frequency is shown as f 4 but ideally should be missing. Or should it? To quote from Allen Wright’s book[1]: “ [...] . look back at the graph of the recording EQ, they cut the LF and boost the HF. But do you really think they continue boosting to way out past whatever? Of course not, they’d burn out their <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> or something even more expensive [...] .

No amplifier has gain out to infinity. Hopefully, all cutting head manufacturers chose the same 3. 18 ms corner for limiting gain. Where is all this leading?

40|$|When {{multifunctional}} pipeline repair machinery (MPRM) {{is used in}} {{the deep}} sea area, it is difficult to grip the pipeline and ensure concentricity between the <b>cutter</b> <b>heads</b> and the pipeline during its operation. In view of this, a new system of two-arm holding self-centering pipeline clamping device was proposed. The system is composed of two groups of parallelogram double-rocker mechanism and cranking block mechanism which are symmetrically distributed on the frame. The geometric parameter solutions of the clamping device were analyzed with motion and transmission as the constraints. A mechanical model was established to associate the friction torque of clamping points with the driving force. Clamping device and machinery were designed and manufactured for the Ø 304. 8 – 457. 2  mm pipelines used in this test. ADAMS simulation experiments were conducted underwater, and the cutting and beveling tests were carried out onshore. The following results are achieved. First, the smaller the pipe diameter, the smaller the transmission angle of the oscillating slider mechanism; the longer the hydraulic cylinder stroke, the greater the transmission angle of the double rocker mechanism. Second, the driving force of the clamping device increases with the increase of the pipe diameter. When the diameter reaches 457. 2  mm, the hydraulic cylinder driving force of the clamping device should be greater than 10219  N. Third, the feed rate of the cutters increases suddenly due to the slight shaking of the machinery which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} pipe cutting, so it is necessary to adopt a small feed rate. And fourth, onshore experiment results agree well with the theoretical design and simulation results, proving the rationality of the system. The research results in this paper provide technical basis for the research and development of similar engineering prototypes...|$|E
40|$|The article {{represents}} an overview {{and analysis of}} trenchless technologies used {{to provide for the}} leak resistance and strength of dilapidated sections of pipelines made of ceramics, cast iron, asbestos cement and other materials. Sectional pipeline repair technologies, considered by the authors, include those for the repair of loose joints of straight sections of pipelines and loose joints in the points of connection to secondary pipelines. Technologies analyzed by the authors also include those applied for the restoration of pipe shell cracks. Organic resins and bandages are to be used as repair materials. Besides, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the composition and properties of pumping resins injected into pipe cracks to restore the structural strength of pipelines and to assure their further reliable operation. Moreover, the authors assess the basic strengths of the bandage technology, including its low cost, low time consumption, and suitability to various types of pipeline damages (depressurization of joints, cracks, leaks, etc.). Besides, this method does not require any excavations, trenches, hoists or other machines. In particular, sections of underground pipelines, having diameters of 150 – 180 mm, may be repaired by specialized repair robots. Robots may be equipped with special-purpose devices, including <b>cutter</b> <b>heads,</b> bandage application heads, and color motion cameras. Besides, sectional repair of pipelines, having the diameter of up to 600 mm, may be performed using robots produced by Hachler Umwelttechnik, which are particularly efficient if the repair work is needed to be performed in the points of pipeline branching. The choice of specific pipeline repair methods and substantiation of their application are mainly driven by (1) the post-cleaning condition of a pipeline, (2) the findings of the telediagnostics, (3) options for arrangement and use of specialized machinery on location, and (4) feasibility of the pipeline operation in the course of repair works and procedures.
