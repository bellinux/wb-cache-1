40|$|A Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage System (SMES) {{works on}} the {{principle}} of superconductivity, which is a phenomenon of occurring exactly zero resistance in certain materials when they are cooled below a certain temperature. The power conditioning system (PCS) of SMES consists of a bidirectional voltage source converter (VSC), a bidirectional chopper and a superconducting coil, which I designed mainly for the compensation of non-linear and pulsating loads. In this paper the PCS of SMES is designed to work both as a shunt active power filter and power conditioner at the same time. Two Hysteresis band controllers have been used to generate the pulses for the two bidirectional converters so as to attain the sinusoidal input source current at any load condition and to maintain the <b>charge</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>cycle</b> of SMES. DC link voltage is kept constant by DC/DC Bidirectional Converter and source current is controlled by Voltage Source Converter (VSC). At light loaded condition the superconducting coil will be in the charging mode and heavy loaded condition the superconducting coil discharges the stored energy in order to compensate the load changes, which is done {{with the help of a}} PI controller. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the charging and discharging mode is well below 5 % of the fundamental component. Simulation has been done in MATLAB/Simulink and results presented demonstrating the reliability of the power conditioning system...|$|E

To investigate the electrochemical performance of LiFePO 4 -Li 3 V 2 (PO 4) (3) composites, a series of compositions are prepared with end member of LiFePO 4 and Li 3 V 2 (PO 4) (3). A specific composition of 0. 97 LiFePO(4) - 0. 03 Li(3) V(3) (PO 4) (3) shows a high reversible capacity of similar to 163. 8 mAh g(- 1) at 1 C current rate in the potential window of 2 - 4. 5 V. The present study could provide a great physical insight into the stability of solid electrolyte interface and subsequent decrease in charge transfer resistance of composite materials and exhibits an excellent electrode kinetics and electrochemical stability compared to pristine LiFePO 4. Electrode kinetics is studied at 100 % depth of discharge at open circuit potential and continuous <b>charge</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>cycle</b> by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique. It is observed that the improvement of electrochemical performance is mainly controlled by the Li 3 V 2 (PO 4) (3) phase because of its unique three-dimensional open structure.
