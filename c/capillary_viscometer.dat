40|$|Deficiencies in the {{description}} of pulp properties is a major factor limiting improvements in modelling of the flow within mineral processing separation devices such as jigs and cyclones. Two factors severely hamper the development of accurate descriptions of pulp rheology - the large number of variables which influence pulp behaviour and the difficulty of making accurate measurements of pulp viscosity. Many factors make measurements of pulp viscosity difficult, including wall effects, turbulence, setting and the physical size of particles, particularly at high shear rates. This paper examines the measurement of pulp viscosity using <b>capillary</b> <b>viscometers,</b> and in particular the high shear rate regions for which turbulent flow (or the transition to turbulent flow) occurs.
