50|$|The {{vertical}} columns {{supporting the}} roof were kept relatively narrow by designing a thick steel tube filled with concrete {{to serve as}} the wall. This was achieved by setting the columns in place and then having a cement slurry poured inside to stiffen them. The building's air-conditioning units had to be out of view of visitors for aesthetic reasons and a vent system has been designed that encompasses the entire perimeter of the building which brings <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> through hidden <b>grilles</b> between the glass.The 1001-seat auditorium's interior is clad with acoustically deafened Canadian Elmwood, which was meant to give visitors the impression of being on a Dhow. In fact, the 1001 seats symbolically represent the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. The seats face an 18 m long stage in a raked seating method that was designed to improve the viewpoint for the audience. The forestage and proscenium, which covers an area of 19,000m x 10,500m, of the stage were specially modified to present a variety of different methods of staging, with the orchestra pit lying on top of Serapid LinkLift Systems to alter the size of the stage and auditorium. The Orchestra Pit Lift is made up of two halves for versatility. A seating wagon can be moved manually to fill the orchestra pit to enlarge the auditoriums capacity. The 150-seat studio theatre has dual purposes and can be used to host conferences and rehearsals as well as serving as a small theatre, with different seating arrangements and staging configurations. These seats and configurations can be transported around using a retractable seating unit and a demountable platform system where configurations can be constructed from a ready-made kit.|$|R

Lack of fresh air inside the bus compartment could increase the contaminant concentration level and affect the passenger's health.

40|$|High {{pressure}} {{turbine nozzle}} guide vane of a gas turbine engine, which operates at gas temperatures in excess of 1700 K, employs various cooling techniques to keep the vane within safe operating limits. Even though {{nozzle guide vane}}s are designed using heat transfer co-relations available in published papers and fundamental data, it is required to test the nozzle guide vane to ascertain the surface metal temperature and verify the adequacy of cooling. Adequacy of cooling is quantified by the term cooling effectiveness expressed and as percentage. Cooling effectiveness {{is a function of}} gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and surface metal temperature. The objective of the current work was to study the effect of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature on <b>cooling</b> effectiveness. Tests were conducted on a high pressure turbine nozzle guide vane.

25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and <b>cooling,</b> see <b>Air</b> flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be <b>cooled</b> with <b>air</b> flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> required. Transpiration <b>cooling</b> results in a much more even temperature profile, as the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is uniformly introduced through pores. Film <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film <b>cooling).</b> Using less <b>air</b> for <b>cooling</b> allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|R

40|$|Passenger cars {{represent}} the largest {{part of all}} means of personal transportation today. Thus, {{it is important to}} work towards reduced energy consumption of cars if a sustainable mobility is to be achieved. This involves many aspects of vehicle engineering; one of them being aerodynamics. This study focuses on aerodynamic drag and the contributions from the wheels at different <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow configurations. Wheels and wheel housings are important for the overall aerodynamic drag on passenger cars. It has been shown that as much as 25 % of the aerodynamic drag originates from these components. Therefore, it is desirable to understand the flow structures related to the wheels and wheel housings, and how they interact with other important flow regions. This paper presents an investigation of the effects of wheel designs on aerodynamic drag at different <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow configurations on a sedan type passenger car. Comparisons between numerical simulations and wind tunnel measurements are made for some of the configurations as well. Several additional wheel configurations were investigated numerically to further investigate the flow structures at the front and rear wheels. The numerical results show that the effects of radial wheel covering varied noticeably with <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow configuration. In two of the configurations this resulted in a net drag increase with closed <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets. The best configuration with closed <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets generated an overall drag reduction of 29 drag counts compared with the numerical baseline with open <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets. In addition to the obvious drag reduction of closing the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets, the main reasons for the additional decrease was limiting the drag increase at the front stagnation region and positive interference effects along the underbody and vehicle base...|$|R
