Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200sacks of rice to Pangasinan. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council assisted in relief operations by allocating ₱10million (US$200,000) and 800bags of rice for such efforts. In addition, one of eight regional Filipino health offices distributed roughly ₱600,000 (US$10,000) worth of various medicines to Dagupan and Urdaneta, Pangasinan.

5|$|Damage {{assessments}} in the Philippines began on October31, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads blocked off or washed away, clearing operations were a priority. The Philippine Red Cross {{assisted in the}} immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16,000people in Aurora. The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Council</b> was received. By November1, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2million PHP (US$81,000). Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck nearly the same areas. A weaker, though still powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited.|$|E

40|$|States have {{reported}} mixed results {{in their efforts}} to implement early intervention interagency <b>coordinating</b> <b>councils</b> as mandated by Public Law 99 - 457. The pur-poses of this paper are to (1) discuss why interagency coordination is important for the development of services for young children with handicaps and their families, (2) present a summary of the difficulties that early interven-tion interagency <b>coordinating</b> <b>councils</b> have been facing, and (3) suggest strategies that interagency <b>coordinating</b> <b>councils</b> can use to improve their functioning. Strategies are discussed that involve the council's membership, role definition, commitment to common goals, vision of the Early Intervention system, achievement of goals, and use of political strategies. THE MOST RECENT early intervention legislation, Public Law 99 - 457 (Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986), mandated the creation of In-teragency <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Councils</b> (ICCs) to advise and assist each state's lead agency in its efforts to coordinate services. At its best, interagency coordination can stream-line services, create services more responsive to client needs, reduce costs, and minimize the duplication and fragmentation of services to families (Flynn & Harbin...|$|R

5|$|Due to the city's {{population}} decline, {{beginning in}} the 1920s and accelerating through the 1950s, local government leaders made several attempts to consolidate services. A preGreat Depression annexation attempt by the city failed due to opposition from county voters, and only after World War II would more efforts be made toward consolidation. The first (and one of the few) successful attempts at consolidation resulted {{in the creation of}} the Metropolitan Sewer District, a citycounty water and sewer company formed in 1954. The next year, however, a citycounty mass transit agency was rejected by voters, followed by a failed charter revision in 1955 that would have unified the city and the county. As the County population grew, local subdivisions began multiplying and incorporating into cities and towns, producing more than 90 separate municipalities by the 1960s. Regional planning advocates succeeded in the 1965 creation of the EastWest Gateway <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Council,</b> a group given the power to approve or deny applications for federal aid from cities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} after Chanchu moved through the Philippines, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ordered that the country's National Disaster <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Council</b> help all towns {{affected}} by the storm. The agency helped coordinate search and rescue missions. Several areas were {{declared a state of}} calamity, mostly on Mindoro, Samar, and Batangas. The Tzu Chi Foundation visited islands in eastern Samar, providing money to the families whose houses were destroyed. Towns in the region also assisted by supplying thatch to rebuild homes. In Oriental Mindoro, the Philippine Red Cross provided food and relief items to families in Calapan. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency also provided building materials for 200families in Mindoro. Ultimately, the government provided storm victims with ₱415.1million (PHP, $7.6million USD) worth of relief supplies. Rainfall from the storm caused a red tide in Taal Lake, after dispersing a Ceratium bloom.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, the Philippine Air Force were mobilized to help deliver {{supplies}} and aid in {{search and rescue}} missions. On July24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Council</b> would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134million (PHP, $2.5million USD) for farmers to buy new seeds, and P35million (PHP, $650,000 USD) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24million (PHP, $435,000 USD) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon {{for up to three}} weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873houses. The Philippine government provided rice, sardines, and coffee to many affected houses. Damaged houses were supposed to receive 1,000pesos, although few received the monetary aid. In the town of San Mariano in Isabela province, most farmers incurred more debt and continued their same general farming practice, despite sustaining heavy losses from the storm.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Cimaron {{struck the}} Philippines with winds {{estimated}} at 195km/h (120mph) and gusts {{in excess of}} 230km/h (145mph). Along coastal Aurora Province, a mother and daughter were killed when strong winds destroyed their home. Numerous trees and power lines were felled by the winds as well, causing widespread blackouts in Luzon. The majority of Aurora and Isabela provinces were left without power and telecommunications {{for more than two}} weeks. Approximately 90percent of the homes in Dinapigue were damaged. Heavy rains across the region swelled many rivers, flooding low-lying areas along their banks. Several bridges became impassable and officials had to release water from two major dams to prevent them from overflowing. The most significant flooding occurred along the Allied-Sinocalan and Tagamusing rivers in Pangasinan. Low-lying areas along the Cagayan, Chico, Magat, Pinacanauan, Tuguegarao Pared rivers throughout Cagayan province were also affected by flooding. Numerous roads were blocked off by landslides or washed away by flooding, severely limiting travel. A landslide temporarily isolated four barangays in Nueva Vizcaya. A Provincial Disaster <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Council</b> search and rescue team was later deployed to Kasibu where at least four people were killed by flooding. Fatal landslides took place in Benguet and Kalinga provinces. A traffic accident blamed on the storm in La Union resulted in one death and seven injuries.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after forming, Kujira tracked near Pohnpei, {{resulting}} in heavy rainfall across the island, peaking at 250mm (10in). Despite the typhoon's far {{distance from the}} island, two people were killed– one died after being crushed by a prostrated tree, while the other was killed offshore for unknown reasons. It also caused minor damage to buildings and crops on the island. The outer rainbands of the typhoon would later bring gale-force winds and heavy precipitation as it passed well south of Guam. Afterwards, the storm remained well removed from landmasses {{for a period of}} time. On April18, however, PAGASA issued a public storm warning signal No.1 for Catanduanes in the Philippines due to the likelihood for gusty winds and rainfall. As Kujira neared the archipelago, the No.1 warning was expanded to include the Babuyan Islands while a No.2 warning was introduced for the Batanes Islands in northern Philippines. In preparation for the typhoon, the National Disaster <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Council</b> readied regional disaster coordinating councils and contingency plans while the Armed Forces of the Philippines prepared for any potential emergency situation. The Philippine Coast Guard patrolled Filipino waters throughout Kujira's close passage in order to redirect ships away from the typhoon. Though the typhoon had also threatened to cancel the biennial San Fernando Race, the concurrent SARS outbreak which had impacted the Philippines ultimately resulted in its cancelling. Eventually any effects in the Philippines remained minimal.|$|E

40|$|Conflict {{resolution}} {{is an important}} communication skill for members of local interagency <b>coordinating</b> <b>councils</b> attempting to <b>coordinate</b> services to young {{children with special needs}} and their families. Harbin and McNulty (1990) proposed a conceptual model of local interagency councils and described six dimensions of the collaborative process among agencies providing early intervention services. Each dimension (climate, people, resources, agency, process, policies) has the potential of becoming a barrier to collaboration. This article reviews the literature on conflict resolution skills within the context of these six potential barri-ers, identifying strategies that may reduce these threats to collaboration. Conflict {{resolution is}} an important communication skill, espe-cially in a field undergoing significant and rapid change (Kelly, 1980). Early intervention is such a field, requiring increasing collab-oration among a wide variety of diverse players. Early intervention offers many settings in which the various parties involved have opportunities to practice conflict resolution, including family/practi-tioner relationships (Turnbull & Turnbull, 1990), professional/para-professional relationships (Musick & Stott, 1990), interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teams (McCollum &c Hughes, 1988), and inter-agency councils (Harbin & McNulty, 1990).
