The study further investigated the effect of the CLDSLM and DSLM methods on performance in <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> and scientific reasoning among students with different motivation levels.

The sample consisted of 240 stu¬dents in six (form four) classes selected from three different schools, i. e. two classes from each school, with students randomly selected and assigned to the treatment groups. The results showed that students in the CLDSLM group outperformed their counterparts in the DSLM group—who, in turn, significantly outperformed other students in the traditional instructional method (T) group in scientific reasoning and <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding.</b> Also, high-motivation (HM) students in the CLDSLM group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the T groups in <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> and scientific reasoning. Furthermore, HM students in the CLDSLM group significantly outperformed their counterparts in the DSLM group in scientific reasoning but did not significantly outperform their counterparts on <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding.</b> Also, the DSLM instructional method has significant positive effects on highly motivated students’ (a) <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> and (b) scientific reason¬ing.

40|$|ABSTRACT Several {{studies are}} {{reviewed}} that examine differences in moral schema development using techniques intermediate between measuring implicit knowledge (such {{as with the}} De � ning Issues Test) and explicit knowledge (such as with the Moral Judgment Interview). Findings include signi � cant differences in the comprehension of moral narratives based on age/education and on level of expertise. Also, intended moral themes in stories are not understood by younger children. It {{is safe to say}} that most research in moral development has focused on moral judgement (i. e. the reasoning used to advocate a certain action choice in a moral dilemma). In this tradition, researchers recognise that people conceptualise moral problems differently, based on developmental age and education (e. g. Kohlberg, 1984; Rest, 1986). As individuals develop in moral judgement, transformations occur in how they construe their obligations to others. According to a moral constructivist theory, these transformations can be viewed as changing moral schemas (<b>conceptual</b> <b>understandings)</b> about how it is possible to organise co-operation (Rest et al., 1999, 2000). <b>Conceptual</b> <b>understandings</b> are transformed as individual...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{possible}} goals that instructors have {{for students in}} general chemistry, {{the idea that they}} will better understand the conceptual underpinnings of the science is certainly important. Nonetheless, identifying with clarity what exemplifies student success at achieving this goal is hindered by the challenge of clearly articulating what <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> entails. While this may be a case of “we know it when we see it”, the design of assessments ultimately requires a specific definition of <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding.</b> Without such a specific definition of the construct, it may be readily argued that a proposed measure does not provide evidence about, in this case, <b>conceptual</b> <b>understanding</b> because the construct itself is insufficiently identified.
