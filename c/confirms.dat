40|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>confirmer</b> signatures and ordinary digital signatures {{is that a}} <b>confirmer</b> signature can be verified only {{with the assistance of}} a semitrusted third party, the <b>confirmer.</b> Additionally, the <b>confirmer</b> can selectively convert single <b>confirmer</b> signatures into ordinary signatures. This paper points out that previous models for <b>confirmer</b> signature schemes are too restricted to address the case where several signers share the same <b>confirmer.</b> More seriously, we show that various proposed schemes (some of which are provably secure in these restricted models) are vulnerable to an adaptive signature-transformation attack. We define a new stronger model that covers this kind of attack and provide a generic solution based on any secure ordinary signa [...] ...|$|R

40|$|As an {{extension}} of digital signature, designated <b>confirmer</b> signature (DCS) efficiently realizes the privacy protection of the signer. In a DCS scheme, {{the validity of the}} sig-nature must be <b>confirmed</b> by the signer or a semi-trusted third party, called <b>confirmer.</b> Since the DCS signature is generated by encrypting a standard signature with the designated confirmer’s public key, only the <b>confirmer</b> can disavow invalid signatures. Moreover, the <b>confirmer</b> al-ways can further convert a DCS into an ordinary signature by decrypting the DCS such that it is publicly verifiable. This property is necessary in some cases. However, from the view of the signer, the privacy is leaked if the DCS is converted into an ordinary signature by the <b>confirmer.</b> In this work, we propose a new DCS scheme without the random oracles. Both the signer and <b>confirmer</b> in this new construction can <b>confirm</b> a valid DCS and disavow an invalid signature. Furthermore, the authority of the <b>confirmer</b> is limited. He is designated by the signer to verify the validity of a signature only when the signer is unavailable. However, the <b>confirmer</b> cannot convert a valid DCS into a standard signature. This new property of DCS is more favorable to the signer...|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} of society-oriented {{designated}} <b>confirmer</b> signatures (SDCS) is introduced in this paper. SDCS {{is well suited}} to applications where the capability of the signer {{and that of the}} <b>confirmer</b> are both expected to be shared among a group of individuals. The ways to share the signing capability and the <b>confirming</b> capability are different due to the distinct stabilities of the signer group and the <b>confirmer</b> group. Based on the techniques of threshold cryptography, a concrete SDCS scheme is proposed and its security is analyzed. Ordinary designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures and threshold designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures can be regarded as special cases of the proposed society-oriented designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures. Meanwhile, our scheme can be converted into an ordinary signature scheme or a designated verifier signature scheme...|$|R
