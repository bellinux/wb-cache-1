40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract We discuss eight major {{challenges in the}} field of carbon nanomaterial toxic-ity. Generally, we pick up some of them, and the most important challenge is searching of the qualitative relationships between nanofactors and cytotoxicity. This is important since it can provide the possibility of conscious changes of carbon nanotubes cytotox-icity by manipulation with selected nanofactors. Therefore, the toxicity of a series of gradually oxidized carbon nanotubes is studied. We show, for the first time, that toxicity of those materials depends strongly on the ratio of acidic to basic group concentration—the higher is this ratio value, the more toxic are nanotubes. In this way, by changing this ratio, one can change toxicity. This correlation is more evident after ultrasonication, and it is connected with the accessibility of charged groups for interactions with proteins. Toxicity also depends on the ability of nanotubes for protein adsorption. We suggest that the changes in the protein <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>medium,</b> especially lack of important growth factors, inhibit cell proliferation...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Parallel {{physiological}} and cytological investigations of a chlortetra-cycline-producing culture-Streptomyes aureofaciens, strain 53 Gindicate some intracellular {{causes of the}} dependence of chlortetracycline biosynthesis upon the inorganic phosphorus content of the nutrient medium. Increase of inorganic phosphorus in the fermentation medium led to a formation of large nuclear elements containing much DNA (in corn steep medium) or ribonucleo-proteid complexes {{in the shape of}} large volutin granules (corn steep liquor ash medium). As compared with the control, the nuclear substance/cytoplasm ratio in the hyphae is increased. The ability of mycelium overloaded with nuclear elements or volutin granules for chlortetracycline biosynthesis is markedly decreased. The ihfluence of phosphorus on the microscopical structure of mycelium and biosynthesis of anti-biotic depends on the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>medium.</b> The poor quality of certain batches of corn steep liquor used for the production of chlortetracycline is largely due to their high content of inorganic phosphorus.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{effect of}} area:volume ratio and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> on the {{accumulation}} of diazotizable amine (‘ amine ’) and hypoxanthine by yeast 47 growing in biotin-deficient medium are reported. The ‘ amine ’, isolated from culture filtrates by mercury precipitation and separation on ion exchange resins, gave the Pauly reaction for imidazoles: on acid hydrolysis it yielded ribose, glycine, ammonia and formic acid, but no phosphate. These properties {{are consistent with the}} view that the ‘amine ’ is 5 -amino-imidazole riboside or a closely related compound. When the growth medium contained 500 pg. L-aspartic acid/ml., instead of ‘amine ’ and hypoxanthine, substances accumulated which on hydrolysis yielded adenine as the only purine. ‘Amine ’ accumulation by yeast 47 may be a symptom of a derangement of purine metabolism resulting from a biotin-conditioned block in aspartate synthesis.
