40|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in CE separations of basic compounds is the adsorption of analytes in negatively charged capillary wall {{which could lead to}} poor repeatability of migration time and peak area. Additionally, separation of enantiomers of chiral of basic drugs is commonly carried out in low pH buffer which contributes to strong ionic interaction of the cationic drug ions with negatively charged chiral selectors. The two phenomena results in poor enantioseparations. To overcome {{the problems}} associated with chiral separations of basic drugs by CE, the effect of guanidine (GU) on the improvement of chiral separation of a model basic drug, fluoxetine (FLX), was investigated.

The developed emulsion could be used for the determination of thiocyanate in human saliva with standard deviation < 4 %.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} gene delivery vectors based on connecting together two well-defined low-generation poly(L-lysine) (PLL) dendrons using a disulfide-containing linker unit. We report that the transfection ability of these vectors {{in their own right}} is relatively low, because the low-generation number limits the endosomal buffering capacity. Importantly, however, we demonstrate that when applied in combination with Lipofectamine 2000 (TM), a vector from the cationic lipid family, these small <b>cationic</b> <b>additives</b> significantly enhance the levels of gene delivery (up to four-fold). Notably, the <b>cationic</b> <b>additives</b> have no effect on the levels of transfection observed with a cationic polymer, such as DEAE dextran. We therefore argue that the synergistic effects observed with Lipofectamine 2000 (TM) arise as a result of combining the delivery advantages of two different classes of vector within a single formulation, with our dendritic additives providing a degree of pH buffering within the endosome. As such, the data we present indicate that small dendritic structures, although previously largely overlooked for gene delivery owing to their inability to transfect in their own right, may actually be useful well-defined additives to well-established vector systems in order to enhance the gene delivery payload...|$|R

The use of laccase from Trametes villosa {{in combination with the}} mediator 1 - hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) produces an oxidation of the cellulose to carbonyl groups, and reduced the amount of carboxyl groups present in TCF pulp through partial removal of hexenuronic acids from it.

30|$|Nano {{polyacrylic}} acid or nano polyphosphates often used, with anchoring cations, {{to reduce the}} zeta potential of some fillers [143]. This helps filler dispersion, but may interfere with their aggregation during drainage [144, 145]. Neutral synthetic nano polymer retention aids included nano polyacrylamide, nano polyvinyl alcohol and nano polyethylene oxide [146]. They are generally inexpensive nano polymer, easily formulated for high molecular weight about several millions g/mol and added to the dry strength [143]. In other studies, polymeric nano xylan may use as the strength-increasing paper additives. In contrast to dissolving pulp production, a high polymeric nano xylan concentration is desirable for paper grade pulp to increase the pulp yield and strength properties [141]. The subsequent addition of isolated polymeric nano xylan during the paper making process may improve mechanical properties. Because the pulping and bleaching processes introduce COOH groups, the cellulosic fibers carry a slightly negative charge [142]. These negative charges cause electrostatic repulsion between single anionic fibers and reduce the possible inter fiber linkages [146]. The absorption of polymeric nano xylan as <b>cationic</b> <b>additives</b> into the anionic pulp surface decreases the electrostatic repulsion effect and therefore enhances the inter-fiber linkage and mechanical properties of the produced paper [147]. Cationic side groups lead to higher additive retention; however, a number of cationic groups are not directly proportional to the mechanical properties of the paper [148]. For example, a slight cationization of polymeric nano xylan {{to the degree of}} substitution of 0.1 causes increase in tensile and tear strength of paper up to 60  %. Polymeric nano xylan exhibited as a good O 2 barrier, suggesting possible applications in food packaging [149].

The main focus has been to determine if colloidal wood resin is adsorbed by suspended fines or fillers, and how the dissolved material influences this adsorption. The effect of some synthetic polymers on this adsorption has also been investigated. Successive refining of mainly Norway spruce followed Successive refining of mainly Norway spruce followed by removal of the produced fines after each refining stage, resulted in fines with different physical and chemical properties. In the first refining stage mainly flake-like fines were produced, while more fibrillar fines were produced in later refining stages. The different types of fines were analysed for both the bulk and the surface composition. Variation in the chemical composition between the fines was particularly striking {{with regard to the}} surface composition. Special attention was also given to the amount and origin of charged groups since these may consume <b>cationic</b> <b>additives</b> in the papermaking process. After alkali treatment, between 80 and 90 % of all the charged groups measured by polymer adsorption originated from three uronic acids. Fines were shown to adsorb model colloidal wood resin, but the adsorption was greatly influenced by the pH or salt content. Also the amount of dissolved components in the suspension, which sterically stabilised the colloidal wood resin, was shown to strongly influence the adsorption of the colloidal wood resin to the fines. The flake-like fines adsorbed the colloidal wood resin to a higher extent than the fibrillar fines. This selectivity was also possible to obtain by using polyethyleneoxide (PEO). PEO removed the sterically stabilised colloidal wood resin more efficiently when flake-like fines rather than fibrillar fines were present. For comparison, cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) did not have this selectivity. The selectivity of PEO was explained by a higher affinity to flake-like fines than fibrillar fines. It was shown that more PEO adsorbed to flake-like fines rather than to fibrillar ones. PEO may adsorb to extractive surfaces, but was inhibited by adsorbed components from the dissolved fraction. The degree of stabilisation was also shown to influence the adsorption of the colloidal wood resin by other particles like fillers.

However, the transient nature of these intermediates has hindered definitive characterization and confirmation of their roles in catalysis. Ultimately, a fundamental understanding of catalytically relevant organometallic complexes will inform the optimization of known transformations and the development of new catalytic reactions. This thesis describes the design, synthesis, and isolation of high-valent nickel and palladium complexes and studies of their reactivity towards challenging bond-forming reactions. 	Chapter 1 describes in detail the roles of palladium and nickel catalysts in carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bond-forming reactions, as well as the relevant history and precedent for the work detailed herein. Chapter 2 is focused on reactivity studies of well-defined PdIV complexes supported by bypyridines and cyclometallated carbon-donor ligands. These design strategies enable the direct study of C(sp 3) –heteroatom bond-forming reductive elimination from PdIV. We demonstrate that a diverse set of oxygen nucleophiles participate as coupling partners in C(sp 3) –O coupling from PdIV and that <b>cationic</b> <b>additives</b> {{play an important role in}} the chemoselectivity of competing C(sp 3) –O and C(sp 3) –F bond-forming reactions. Experimental and computational studies provide insight into the mechanism of these reductive elimination reactions. 	Chapter 3 details our systematic investigation into the organometallic chemistry of high-valent nickel. We demonstrate that a series of isolable NiIV complexes can be accessed by the treatment of NiII precursors with common two-electron oxidants. The importance of the trifluoromethyl (CF 3) ligand and tris(pyrazolyl) borate (Tp) scaffold in stabilizing these traditionally transient species is highlighted. Furthermore, reactivity studies show that these NiIV complexes participate in highly selective carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bond-forming reactions that remain extremely challenging to achieve at lower oxidation states of nickel. 	In Chapter 4, the reactivity profiles of diorgano-NiIII complexes are evaluated and compared to the NiIV counterparts. Throughout these studies, NiIV was shown to promote reductive elimination events more readily than analogous NiIII complexes. In addition, selective carbon–carbon or carbon–heteroatom coupling could be achieved depending on the oxidation state of the nickel center. 	Finally, Chapter 5 details a comparative study between high-valent nickel and palladium complexes. Electrochemical analyses, kinetic studies, and computational insights demonstrate the remarkable similarities in the chemistry of NiIV and PdIV, but an enhanced role for NiIII in enabling reactivity that is distinct from palladium...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that ionic surfactants, whether cationic or anionic, provide crystalline molecular complexes stably with various aromatic compounds as additives. Among various additives phenolic compounds are especially favorable for both surfactant species. Other than these <b>additives,</b> <b>cationic</b> surfactants easily provide crystalline molecu-lar complexes with basic materials and even with non-polar substances such as biphenyl and phenanthrene. The isolated surfactant molecular complexes were analyzed by X-ray. To date {{the number of the}} obtained surfactant molecular com-plexes exceeds two hundred species or more and thirty or more of them were structurally analyzed. These surfactant molecular complexes were shown to be novel surfactant species diŠerent from their mother species, supplied with en-hanced solubility to the complex additives. We applied these characteristics to sparingly water soluble drugs as the com-plex additive to modify them into easily water soluble drugs. The obtained complex drugs revealed an improved behavior in solubility and dissolution rate compared with pure drugs.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of Pt(II) - and Pt(IV) -porphyrins as novel ionophores for anion-selective polymeric membrane electrodes is performed. Polymeric membranes of different compositions, prepared by varying plasticizers, <b>cationic</b> and anionic <b>additives</b> and Pt porphyrins, have been examined by potentiometric and optical techniques. Pt porphyrin-based devices were found to exhibit enhanced potentiometric selectivity toward iodide ion compared to electrodes based on a typical anion-exchanger (e. g. tridodecylmethylammonium chloride). It is shown that Pt(II) -porphyrins function as neutral anion carriers within the electrode membranes, while those based on Pt(IV) TPPCl 2 operate via a mixed mode carrier mechanism, evidencing also a partial reduction of the starting ionophore to Pt(II) TPP. Spectrophotometric measurements of thin polymeric films indicate that no spontaneous formation of hydroxide ion bridged porphyrin dimers occurs in the membrane plasticized both with high or low dielectric constant plasticizer, due to a low oxophilicity of central Pt. The computational study of various anion–Pt(IV) TPPCl 2 complex formation by means of semi-empirical and density functional theory (DFT) methods revealed a good correlation between calculated and measured ionophore selectivity...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel surface Smart Polymer Antibody Material (SPAM) for Carnitine (CRT, a potential biomarker of ovarian cancer), {{tested for the}} first time as ionophore in potentiometric electrodes of unconventional configuration. The SPAM material consisted of a 3 D polymeric network created by surface imprinting on graphene layers. The polymer was obtained by radical polymerization of (vinylbenzyl) trimethylammonium chloride and 4 -styrenesulfonic acid (signaling the binding sites), and vinyl pivalate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (surroundings). Non-imprinted material (NIM) was prepared as control, by excluding the template from the procedure. These materials were then used to produce several plasticized PVC membranes, testing the relevance of including the SPAM as ionophore, and the need for a charged lipophilic additive. The membranes were casted over solid conductive supports of graphite or ITO/FTO. The effect of pH upon the potentiometric response was evaluated for different pHs (2 - 9) with different buffer compositions. Overall, the best performance was achieved for membranes with SPAM ionophore, having a <b>cationic</b> lipophilic <b>additive</b> and tested in HEPES (4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl) - 1 -piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer, pH 5. 1. Better slopes were achieved when the membrane was casted on conductive glass (- 57. 4 mV/decade), while the best detection limits were obtained for graphite-based conductive supports (3. 6 × 10 − 5 mol/L). Good selectivity was observed against BSA, ascorbic acid, glucose, creatinine and urea, tested for concentrations up to their normal physiologic levels in urine. The application of the devices to the analysis of spiked samples showed recoveries ranging from 91 % (± 6. 8 %) to 118 % (± 11. 2 %). Overall, the combination of the SPAM sensory material with a suitable selective membrane composition and electrode design has lead to a promising tool for point-of-care applications...|$|R

40|$|Metal cations {{represent}} a considerable part among surface water and land pollutants. Industrial and agronomic effluents, containing {{in the most}} cases mercury, cadmium, lead and other cations, until now have been treated by mechanical, physicochemical and biological methods. Biological treatments are {{the most effective and}} economically suitable method. Anyway, even biological treatment could not remove all organic and anorganic pollutants. Latest researches deal with removing pollutants from land using bioextraction, based on biosynthetic processes in plants, including toxic metals (phytoremedation). Bioextraction processes where metal cations are transported from land in plant, especially cations of heavy metals, are dependent on balances that are establishing in aqueous solutions, depending on pH and present coexisting components. Present investigations of bioextraction treatment included monitoring of efficiency in removing heavy metals with addition of various organic components. This paper deals with investigation of Cd(II), Pb(II) and Fe(III) interactions in aqueous solutions with addition of crown ethers, cationic and anionic tenzides. Specially there is considered impact of tenzides, as surface active components, present in waste waters. Mechanism of complexation and balance state restoration are investigated depending on solution pH and metal <b>cationic</b> and organic <b>additive</b> concentration.

To achieve nernstian response {{over a wide}} linear range, the influence of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT-CPE), carbon paste composition (lipophilic <b>cationic</b> and anionic <b>additives</b> and amount of carbon nanotubes) was investigated and their values was set as Carbon powder, MWCNT: Nujol, Carrier MTOACl, (0. 25 g, 60 mg, : 50 mg, 8. 0 mg: 4. 8 mg) respectively. The proposed electrode exhibited near-Nernstian slopes of- 58. 02 ± 0. 35 of iodide concentration over the range 5. 0 × 10 - 7 - 1. 0 × 10 - 1 M with detection limits of 4. 0 × 10 - 7 M for the MWCNT-CPE electrodes based on IPC respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Twenty-one boronic acids {{were studied}} {{for their ability}} to {{transport}} saccharides in and out of liposomes. The rates of liposome efflux were determined using an enzymatic assay, whereas the influx studies used a radiotracer method. All boronic acids examined, except those that were highly hydrophilic, facilitated monosaccharide transport. The order of transport selectivity was sorbitol> fructose> glucose. The disaccharides maltose and sucrose were not transported to any significant degree. Facilitated transport was demonstrated with a variety of liposome types, including multilamellar and unilamellar vesicles with anionic or <b>cationic</b> polar lipid <b>additives.</b> Transport mechanism studies included the accumulation of structure-activity data, as well as systematic investigations of various environmental changes such as pH, added salt, membrane potential, and temperature. Overall, the evidence is strongly in favor of a membrane carrier mechanism. The boronic acid combines reversibly with a diol group on the monosaccharide to produce a tetrahedral, anionic boronate, which is the major complexed structure in bulk, aqueous solution. At the bilayer surface, the tetrahedral boronate is in equilibrium with its neutral, trigonal form, which is the actual transported species. At low carrier concentrations, a first-order dependence on carrier was observed indicating that the transported species was a 1 : 1 sugar-boronate. At higher carrier concentrations the kinetic order approached 2, suggesting the increased participation of a 1 : 2 sugar-bisboronate transport pathway. The effect of boronic acids on liposomal bilayer fluidity was probed by fluorescence spectroscopy using appropriate reporter molecules. Adding cholesterol to the liposome membranes reduced translational fluidity by “packing and ordering” the bilayer. Addition of lipophilic arylboronic acids (either free or complexed with monosaccharides) induced a similar but smaller effect...|$|R
