25|$|Ammonia {{can act as}} a ligand in {{transition}} metal complexes. It is a pure σ-donor, {{in the middle of the}} spectrochemical series, and shows intermediate hard-soft behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named ammine in the nomenclature of coordination compounds. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) (2+), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as Schweizer's reagent, and has the remarkable ability to dissolve cellulose. Diamminesilver(I) (+) is the active species in Tollens' reagent. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: silver chloride (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, silver bromide (AgBr) is only soluble in <b>concentrated</b> <b>ammonia</b> solution, whereas silver iodide (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} properties of ammonia is its basicity. Ammonia {{is considered to be}} a weak base.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, low {{concentration}} ammonia liquor ranging from 2 to 7 wt. % {{was used to}} remove CO 2 from model BFG with various packing materials. CO 2 removal efficiencies were to be more than 90 % with proper gas to liquid flow rate ratio. Additional column is required to <b>concentrate</b> <b>ammonia</b> gas captured from the absorber and the regenerator. With regard to the required energy for regeneration process, the distillation energy should be taken into consideration in addition to regeneration energy itself. The reboiler temperature for CO 2 stripping in ammonia liquor process decreased from 96  ∘C at 2 wt. % solution to 83  ∘C at 7 wt. % solution, which is an important advantage over conventional MEA-based CO 2 absorption process. The outlet gas concentrations of ammonia of the absorber and regenerator were as high as 3 vol. % implying that the installation of washing stage for ammonia capture should be considered for practical application...|$|R
