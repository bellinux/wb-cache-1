25|$|Students at UNC {{are only}} {{allowed to play}} on the team for two years, and then they are given a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> for the varsity. The J.V. team also serves as a way for coaches to {{evaluate}} players for two years on the J.V. so they will better know what to expect when they try out for varsity later in their careers.|$|E
2500|$|A recent {{addition}} to the school is the brand new information and communications technology (ICT) block, built in 2005, which contains four rooms, each with around 30 computers. Many of the local primary schools come to St Crispin's for special ICT days where they have the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> the new system. Recently, the school has upgraded its computer system, implementing better and faster computers with more educational software, available for the students' use.

40|$|Librarians {{spend so}} much of their time {{assisting}} others in the research process that they may suffer from information overload {{when it comes to their}} own research. This session is focused on showing librarians tools that will help them become more effective and efficient in their own research. This hands-on session will not only show you where to find useful web tools, but will also give you a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> them <b>out</b> and decide which ones are right for you.

50|$|The game {{does not}} have a plot, but it does feature a couple of {{characters}}. One of these characters is Vince, an art tutor who would help the player/art trainee with his/her lessons in a step-by-step manner through each stage, and is most helpful towards novice artists. His teaching methods include explaining the drawing and painting techniques, describing how each available art tool should be used, elaborating on methods, styles, and certain art tools technically and historically. Show off finished examples and comprehendible references sometimes, Vince would also always draw before his students to illustrate how each step in every stage of every lesson is practically done before giving them the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it <b>out</b> themselves. Vince’s character is inspired by real life artist Vincent van Gogh.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout his career, Dickey did {{not know}} that his [...] "forkball" [...] pitch was {{actually}} a hard knuckleball, but by 2005, Dickey had realized {{that the best way to}} extend his career was to perfect the pitch. At the beginning of the 2006 season, the Rangers gave Dickey a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> his knuckleball at the major league level by naming him the 5th starter. However, after giving up 6 home runs in his first start on April 6, tying the modern era baseball record with another knuckleballer, Tim Wakefield, he was demoted to the Rangers' Triple-A minor league affiliate, the Oklahoma RedHawks.|$|E
2500|$|LaPradd {{attended}} the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, {{where he played}} for coach Bob Woodruff's Florida Gators football team from 1950 to 1952. [...] He had hitch-hiked to Gainesville for a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> for the Florida Gators football team. [...] He initially played for the Gators as a freshman walk-on in 1949, after convincing the coaches to permit him {{to try out for}} the squad, and later earned an athletic scholarship. [...] As was typical of college football in the 1950s, when the rules required athletes to play both offense and defense and permitted only limited substitutions, he played tackle on both the offensive and defensive lines.|$|E
2500|$|Following the season, LaPradd was a first-team All-SEC {{selection}} and received first-team All-American honors from the Associated Press and the New York Daily News. [...] He was the Gators' only All-America first team member since Dale Van Sickel in 1928. [...] Coach Woodruff would later recall LaPradd, the former walk-on {{who had to}} plead for a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> for the team, as the Gators' greatest lineman of the 1950s. [...] The Green Bay Packers selected LaPradd in the 1952 NFL Draft, but he injured his legs {{in a car accident}} on the day he graduated from college and never had the opportunity to play in the National Football League.|$|E
40|$|This {{introduction}} to circuit design {{is unusual in}} several respects. First, it offers not just explanations, but a full course. Each of the twenty-five sessions begins {{with a discussion of}} a particular sort of circuit followed by the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it <b>out</b> and see how it actually behaves. Accordingly, students understand the circuit's operation {{in a way that is}} deeper and much more satisfying than the manipulation of formulas. Second, it describes circuits that more traditional engineering introductions would postpone: on the third day, we build a radio receiver; on the fifth day, we build an operational amplifier from an array of transistors. The digital half of the course centers on applying microcontrollers, but gives exposure to Verilog, a powerful Hardware Description Language. Third, it proceeds at a rapid pace but requires no prior knowledge of electronics. Students gain intuitive understanding through immersion in good circuit design...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2014, Jess Day, a Let Toys be Toys campaigner told UK {{newspaper}} the Daily Mirror: [...] "It's easy {{to dismiss}} toys as trivial, {{but this is}} one way we can help our children feel confident that they don't have to fit in with old-fashioned stereotypes. Labelling construction toys as boys’ toys and craft or dolls as girls’ toys restricts play. Play is important and different types toys help hone different skills. Telling girls that construction and science toys are for boys we limit what they think they can achieve before they've even had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it <b>out.</b> … There's nothing wrong with giving a girl a doll for Christmas, or a boy a car - but children need a variety of play. Why would we want to tell them that only certain types of play are allowed for them? That sounds like the opposite of fun!” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cost of an}} IOD in 1936 was $2,670. Sails, spars, running rigging, cradle, insurance, and {{shipping}} charges from Norway {{were included in the}} price. With the backing of the enthusiastic Shields, the boat was quickly adopted by the top racers on Long Island Sound. [...] The first of the initial order of 25 yachts was delivered at City Island, New York in December 1936. [...] "I finally arranged to sail her the week after Christmas...the first time anyone had sailed an International,” recalled Shields, many years later. “I don't think I've ever had a more joyous day on the water. The wind was from the northeast, light in the morning and then stronger at mid-day, so we had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> her <b>out</b> under a variety of conditions. The boat was a delight to handle, and balanced perfectly. I felt great satisfaction at this -- the planning and hope and care hadn't been in vain." ...|$|R
2500|$|First is the [...] "American Idol Small Town Audition Bus Tour", a ten town {{nationwide}} {{tour that}} will give hopefuls who couldn't make {{it to one of}} the large audition cities a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out.</b> The cities are Idaho Falls, Idaho; Billings, Montana; Casper, Wyoming; Rock Rapids, Iowa; Iowa City, Iowa; Bowling Green, Kentucky; Clarksdale, Mississippi; Joplin, Missouri; Dodge City, Kansas and Grand Junction, Colorado. Idol is also starting the [...] "Nominate an Idol" [...] program, which will let friends and family of individuals they think could be the next American Idol nominate said person in secret by filling out an online form and existing video or URL of their nominee—they must be singing solo and a cappella. The chosen auditions will then be surprised on location by a film crew and given an opportunity to advance to the next round. Finally, online auditions for season 12 were open from August 1 to 14, 2012, and October 12 to November 4, 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the 2004–05, Stewart's {{older brother}} Anthony, {{who was the}} captain of the Kingston Frontenacs, put his {{reputation}} on the line when he asked Frontenacs General Manager Larry Mavety to give Chris the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> with the Frontenacs as an undrafted free agent. Mavety complied, and Stewart made the team in training camp, allowing the brothers to play together on the same team. [...] Initially given the position with the Frontenacs as an energetic fighting role player, Stewart took advantage of his increased playing time and had a solid rookie season, scoring 18 goals and 30 points in 64 games. [...] Stewart played in his first OHL game on September 26, 2004, getting no points in a 4–3 loss to the Brampton Battalion. Stewart scored his first goal in the League on October 3, 2004, beating Sudbury Wolves goaltender Patrick Ehelechner in a 6–4 loss. The Frontenacs failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing in ninth place in the Eastern Conference.|$|E
2500|$|The first TV {{spot was}} {{released}} on September 8, 2011, during the 2011 NFL Kickoff game between the Packers and Saints. On October 16, 2011, Naughty Dog released the launch TV spot for the game. The trailer contains around 25 seconds of footage, and features Drake traversing canyons, riding horses, and battling above wrecked airplanes. On October 19, 2011, a Japanese commercial to promote the game was released, which starred actor and producer Harrison Ford, and what Harrison Ford himself thought about a game he inspired. Also on October 19, 2011, Naughty Dog released the launch trailer for the game, which featured deserts, boats, planes, horse-riding and treasure hunting. To promote the game, Sony had several promotional events during October 2011, where the public had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> the multiplayer and single-player gaming experience, which {{was accompanied by a}} Q session with Naughty Dog. These events were in several regions, such as the European countries Norway and UK. On October 15, Sony offered gamers [...] "the first ever public sampling" [...] of Uncharted 3s single player campaign at The Pelican Bar, London. Developers from Naughty Dog also turned up at the event, with a subsequent Q session.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tour was}} {{announced}} in full on 8 March 2016, initially with 15 dates. Two more, one in Scotland and one in Isle of Wight were added later. The Scotland date was later cancelled due to technical issues. [...] Cardle {{described it as a}} warm up tour for his fourth album, giving him a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> showcase new material before finalising it in the studio, saying [...] "Normally, you record an album, then take it on tour, but this is a <b>chance</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> my new music, and develop it {{over the course of the}} tour, before I take it into the studio. It's new music that fans won't have heard before." ...|$|R
50|$|The Grandfather Mountain Highland Games {{has been}} {{designated}} by the Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing as the official site of the Atlantic International championship. Each dancer must dance four separate dances laid down {{by the board of}} Highland Dancing and each is judged accordingly. People {{come from all over the}} world to compete and also to watch the best dancers in the nation compete. The United States Inter-Regional Championship has been held at the games twice in the past, thanks to retired dance director Anne Andrews. Pat Johnston is the director of dance now, and has recently restarted a dance camp in the mountains (a week before the games) by the dreams of Sally Southerland. There is also the <b>chance</b> for everyone <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> their highland dancing skills at the many evening events that feature piping and highland reels.|$|R

2500|$|On August 21, 1915 the St. Louis Browns traded Williams to {{the minor}} league Toronto Maple Leafs of the Double-A International League in {{exchange}} for a pitcher to be named later. On the season with Toronto, Williams batted [...]285 with 97 hits, 15 doubles, nine triples, and eight home runs in 90 games played. He finished the seasons fifth in the International League in home runs. After the season, Williams wrote Rowdy Elliott, the manager of the Oakland Oaks, requesting a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>out</b> for the team. Elliott said that he was not interested in another left-handed hitter, as he already had outfielders Rube Gardner and Robert Middleton, who were also left-handed. Before the start of the 1916 season, Williams signed with the Nashville Volunteers of the Class-A Southern Association. The Volunteers won the Southern Association Championship that year. As a member of the winning team, Williams received a cash reward, and supply of cake from a local Atlanta bakery. With the Volunteers, he batted [...]298 with 156 hits, 33 doubles, 13 triples, and five home runs in 138 games played. Williams led the league in doubles, was second in hits, tied for second with Joe Harris in total bases (230), and tied for third with Ham Hyatt in triples.|$|E

60|$|May 11th, 1838.--At Boston last week. Items:--A young man, {{with a small}} mustache, dyed brown, reddish {{from its}} {{original}} light color. He walks with an affected gait, his arms crooked outwards, treading much on his toes. His conversation is about the theatre, where he has a season ticket,--about an amateur who lately appeared there, and about actresses, with other theatrical scandal.--In the smoking-room, two checker and backgammon boards; the landlord a great player, seemingly a stupid man, but with considerable shrewdness {{and knowledge of the}} world.--F------, the comedian, a stout, heavy-looking Englishman, of grave deportment, with no signs of wit or humor, yet aiming at both in conversation, in order to support his character. Very steady and regular in his life, and parsimonious in his disposition,--worth $ 50,000, made by his profession.--A clergyman, elderly, with a white neckcloth, very unbecoming, an unworldly manner, unacquaintance with the customs of the house, and learning them in a childlike way. A ruffle to his shirt, crimped.--A gentleman, young, handsome, and sea-flushed, belonging to Oswego, New York, but just arrived in port from the Mediterranean: he inquires of me about the troubles in Canada, which were first beginning to make a noise when he left the country,--whether they are all over. I tell him all is finished, except the hanging of the prisoners. Then we talk over the matter, and I tell him the fates of the principal men,-- some banished to New South Wales, one hanged, others in prison, others, conspicuous at first, now almost forgotten.--Apartments of private families in the hotel,--what sort of domesticity there may be in them; eating in public, with no board of their own. The gas that lights {{the rest of the house}} lights them also, in the chandelier from the ceiling.-- A shabby-looking man, quiet, with spectacles, at first wearing an old, coarse brown frock, then appearing in a suit of elderly black, saying nothing unless spoken to, but talking intelligently when addressed. He is an editor, and I suppose printer, of a country paper. Among the guests, he holds intercourse with gentlemen of much more respectable appearance than himself, from the same part of the country.--Bill of fare; wines printed on the back, but nobody calls for a bottle. Chairs turned down for expected guests. Three-pronged steel forks. Cold supper from nine to eleven P. M. Great, round, mahogany table, in the sitting-room, covered with papers. In the morning, before and soon after breakfast, gentlemen reading the morning papers, while others wait for their <b>chance,</b> or <b>try</b> <b>to</b> pick <b>out</b> something from the papers of yesterday or longer ago. In the forenoon, the Southern papers are brought in, and thrown damp and folded on the table. The eagerness with which those who happen to be in the room start up and make prize of them. Play-bills, printed on yellow paper, laid upon the table. Towards evening comes the Transcript.|$|R
