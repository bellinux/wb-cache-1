5|$|Although {{many species}} of Psittacosaurus have been named, their {{relationships}} to each other {{have not yet been}} fully explored and no scientific consensus exists on the subject. Several phylogenetic analyses have been published, with the most detailed being those by Alexander Averianov and <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2006, Hai-Lu You and <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2008, and Paul Sereno in 2010. The middle one is shown below.|$|E
5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} did not {{go unnoticed}} by his <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to expel Burnett from Congress. The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 11 September 1867, police arrested two men found {{loitering}} in Oak Street, Shudehill, suspecting them of planning to rob a shop. Both were charged under the Vagrancy Act and held in custody. The Manchester police were initially unaware of their identities, until their <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the Irish police identified them as Kelly and Deasy.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{retained}} close {{connections with}} York throughout his life. After Jonathan Martin's arson attack on York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, Etty was {{prominent in the}} effort to restore the building to its original state. One of his <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> that campaign was Welsh politician Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn, the long-serving Conservative Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Hwang et al. {{found that}} Microraptor {{was the most}} {{primitive}} dromaeosaurid. Xu and <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2003 cited the basal position of Microraptor, along with feather and wing features, {{as evidence that the}} ancestral dromaeosaurid could glide. In that case the larger dromaeosaurids would be secondarily terrestrial—having lost the ability to glide later in their evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|Kurzanov and <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2003 {{designated}} six teeth from Siberia as Allosaurus sp.

Also, reports of Allosaurus in Shanxi, China go back to at least 1982.|$|E

5|$|The {{external}} {{relationships of}} the Thysanoptera {{shown in the}} cladogram are based on analysis of the phylogeny of the Paraneoptera by Hu Li and <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2015, using mitochondrial DNA sequences. The lice (Liposcelididae + Phthiraptera) are the sister group to the Thysanoptera. English names are given in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|The name Pluto, {{after the}} god of the underworld, was {{proposed}} by Venetia Burney (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in classical mythology. She suggested it in a conversation with her grandfather Falconer Madan, a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library, who passed the name to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|E

5|$|Two of Vermigli's former <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> Lucca—Lacizi and Tremellius—would {{join him}} in Strasbourg. In 1544 he was elected canon of St. Thomas Church, Strasbourg. In 1545 Vermigli married his first wife, Catherine Dammartin, a former nun from Metz. Catherine knew no Italian, and Peter very little German, so {{it is assumed that}} they conversed in Latin.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, published by Björn Stelbrink and <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2010, {{reported that the}} sister species of the Pacific angelshark is the sand devil (S. dumeril) of the western North Atlantic. The two species are estimated to have diverged approximately 6.1 Ma, close to when the Isthmus of Panama first began to form. The authors also found that Pacific angelsharks from the Gulf of California differed genetically from those elsewhere, though they were equivocal as to whether this represented a species-level distinction.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell and <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and monotremes, but argued that Ambondro was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and the contrast between the talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E

5|$|Andrew Farke and his <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2014 {{published}} {{a description of}} a new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|As {{dozens of}} newly {{unemployed}} professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the United States sought {{to provide assistance}} and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions, Bryn Mawr College in the United States and Somerville College at the University of Oxford in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.|$|E
5|$|As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became clearer. The {{group was}} defined as all allosauroids closer to Carcharodontosaurus than Allosaurus or Sinraptor by Thomas R. Holtz and <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2004. In 2006, Coria and Currie united Giganotosaurus and Mapusaurus in the carcharodontosaurid {{subfamily}} Giganotosaurinae based on shared features of the femur, such as a weak fourth trocanther, and a shallow, broad groove on the lower end. In 2008, Sereno and Stephen L. Brusatte united Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, and Tyrannotitan in the tribe Giganotosaurini. Giganotosaurus {{is one of the}} most complete and informative members of Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
