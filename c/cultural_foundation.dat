The first award-winner from outside those continents was American Sean Kennard, who finished fifth in the 2004 competition's piano category.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu is {{the subject}} of many paintings, and {{features}} prominently in Costin Petrescu's fresco at the Romanian Athenaeum (where he is shown alongside Cuza, who is handing a deed to a peasant). In 1911, Iași became host to Kogălniceanu bronze statue by Raffaello Romanelli, purported to have been recast from one of the sculptor's older works. In 1936, the Mihail Kogălniceanu <b>Cultural</b> <b>Foundation</b> commissioned Oscar Han to create a monument dedicated to Kogălniceanu, which was erected in Bucharest during the same year. Actors have portrayed Kogălniceanu in several Romanian films—most notably, Ion Niculescu in the 1912 Independența României, and George Constantin in Sergiu Nicolaescu's 1977 Războiul Independenței. During the latter stages of the Romanian Communist regime, under Nicolae Ceaușescu, Mihail Kogălniceanu's image was present in official propaganda, alongside those of other historical figures who were considered progressive.|$|E

5|$|Mihail Kogălniceanu {{was married}} to Ecaterina Jora (1827–1907), the widow of Iorgu Scorțescu, a Moldavian Militia colonel; they had more than eight {{children}} together (three of whom were boys). The eldest son, Constantin, studied Law and had a career in diplomacy, being the author of an unfinished work on Romanian history. Ion, his brother, was born in 1859 and died in 1892, being {{the only one of}} Mihail Kogălniceanu's male children to have heirs. His line was still surviving in 2001. Ion's son, also named Mihail, established the Mihail Kogălniceanu <b>Cultural</b> <b>Foundation</b> in 1935 (in 1939–1946, it published a magazine named Arhiva Românească, which aimed to be a new series of the one published during the 1840s; its other projects were rendered ineffectual by the outbreak of World War II).|$|E
5|$|Young Filitti made {{a remarkably}} early {{entry into the}} {{diplomatic}} corps, and stayed on with the Romanian Legation in France. In this capacity, he purposefully embarrassed PNL Foreign Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu by not sending in all Legation employees to receive him during an official visit. During his return trips to Romania, Filitti was focusing on researching his own family archives, and, in 1910, published the volume Așezământul cultural al mitropolitului Dositei Filitti, de la înființare până azi ("Metropolitan Dositei Filitti's <b>Cultural</b> <b>Foundation,</b> from Its Establishment to the Present Day"). In researching this work, Filitti sought input from the genealogical school in Greece and Macedonia, and from Romanian diplomats working in Istanbul. In a show of perfectionism, Filitti constantly revised the work as new data surfaced, and, in 1936, declared the 1910 edition to be entirely unusable.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, two further {{handwriting}} {{analyses of}} the Mar Saba MS were undertaken by two Greek graphologists {{at the behest of}} Biblical Archaeology Review. The first, Venetia Anastasopoulou, a forensic handwriting expert witness with experience in many Greek court cases, compared the Mar Saba photos with known samples of Morton Smith's Greek handwriting, and concluded that it was most probably not written by Morton Smith. However the second graphologist, Agamemnon Tselikas, a paleographer, director of the National Bank of Greece <b>Cultural</b> <b>Foundation</b> and also of the Mediterranean Research Institute for Paleography, Bibliography and History of Texts, concluded it was a 20th-century forgery of 18th century script, and that the most likely forger was either Smith or someone in Smith's employ.|$|E
