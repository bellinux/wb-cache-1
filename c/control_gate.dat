2500|$|The first {{thyristor}} {{devices were}} released commercially in 1956. Because thyristors can control {{a relatively large}} amount of power and voltage with a small device, they find wide application in control of electric power, ranging from light dimmers and electric motor speed control to high-voltage direct current power transmission. Thyristors {{may be used in}} power-switching circuits, relay-replacement circuits, inverter circuits, oscillator circuits, level-detector circuits, chopper circuits, light-dimming circuits, low-cost timer circuits, logic circuits, speed-control circuits, phase-control circuits, etc. [...] Originally, thyristors relied only on current reversal to turn them off, making them difficult to apply for direct current; newer device types can be turned on and off through the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> signal. [...] The latter is known as a gate turn-off thyristor, or GTO thyristor. [...] A thyristor is not a proportional device like a transistor. In other words, a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states. This makes a thyristor unsuitable as an analog amplifier, but useful as a switch.|$|E
2500|$|In flash memory, each {{memory cell}} resembles a {{standard}} MOSFET, {{except that the}} transistor has two gates instead of one. On top is the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> (CG), as in other MOS transistors, but below this there is a floating gate (FG) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer, electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field (e.g. Applied voltage or UV as in EPROM). Counter-intuitively, placing electrons on the FG sets the transistor to the logical [...] "0" [...] state. Once the FG is charged, the electrons in it screen (partially cancel) the electric field from the CG, thus, increasing the threshold voltage (VT1) of the cell. This means that now a higher voltage(VT2) must {{be applied to the}} CG to make the channel conductive. In order to read a value from the transistor, an intermediate voltage between the threshold voltages (VT1 & VT2) is applied to the CG. If the channel conducts at this intermediate voltage, the FG must be uncharged (if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the intermediate voltage is less than VT2), and hence, a logical [...] "1" [...] is stored in the gate. If the channel does not conduct at the intermediate voltage, it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical [...] "0" [...] is stored in the gate. The presence of a logical [...] "0" [...] or [...] "1" [...] is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the intermediate voltage is asserted on the CG. In a multi-level cell device, which stores more than one bit per cell, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.|$|E
50|$|As {{processes}} {{continue to}} shrink, this becomes increasingly problematic. For this reason the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> in modern NAND flash has been reconfigured to cap the floating gate. In a cap structure the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> is extended {{to form a}} barrier between adjacent floating gates in a conventional floating gate cell (see Figure 5.) This serves to reduce coupling to the adjacent floating gate while increasing the coupling between the floating gate and the <b>control</b> <b>gate.</b> One drawback is that the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> couples to the channel, so measures {{must be taken to}} minimize this coupling.|$|E

50|$|When the {{polysilicon}} <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> {{is biased}} positively, electrons from the transistor source and drain regions tunnel through the oxide layer and get {{trapped in the}} silicon nitride. This results in an energy barrier between the drain and the source, raising the threshold voltage Vt (the gate-source voltage necessary for current to flow through the transistor). The electrons can be removed again by applying a negative bias on the <b>control</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E

50|$|Both {{floating}} gate flash and charge trapping flash use a stacked gate structure {{in which a}} {{floating gate}} or charge trapping layer lies immediately above the channel, and below a <b>control</b> <b>gate.</b> The floating gate or charge trapping layer is insulated from the channel by a tunnel oxide layer and from the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> by a gate oxide layer.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{the results from}} three separate studies performed in the experimental automatic milking system at Kungsängen Research Centre, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. In the first study, 30 high-yielding cows in early lactation were subjected to two different degrees of controlled cow traffic, and the effects on milk yield, dry matter intake, feeding patterns and voluntary visits to the milking unit and the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> were measured. A model of mixed distributions for estimations of biologically relevant meal criteria from registrations in roughage stations was also evaluated. In the second study, the behaviour of 24 cows after they had been redirected in <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> was observed, {{and the cause of}} long redirection times from gates until they showed up in the milking unit was examined. In the third study, 9 cows were subjected to three different cow traffic systems in a carry-over design and the effects on cortisol concentrations in milk and ruminating patterns were studied. The studies showed that milking frequency and thereby milk production can be altered by different time settings in the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> without limiting the daily feed intake of the cows. A high degree of guidance provokes social effects in the queue in front of the milking unit and in the feeding areas. It also makes it difficult for the cows to follow their natural feeding patterns. Judging from measurements of milk cortisol concentrations, controlled cow traffic was not stressful for the cows. Cows initiated meals with short intervals, which offered many opportunities to milk them. But the queue in front of the milking unit caused long redirection times, and the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> failed to guide cows to high milking frequencies. Individual differences in feeding patterns and how cows respond to redirections in the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> suggest that the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> should be making decisions on an individual level...|$|R

50|$|NAND flash {{has been}} scaling very aggressively (Figure 4.) As {{processes}} migrate, {{the width of}} the interface of the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> and the floating gate shrinks in proportion to the square of the shrink, and the spacing between floating gates shrinks in proportion to the process shrink, but the floating gate’s thickness remains the same. (The thinner the floating gate is made the less tolerant the cell becomes to electron loss.) This means that the coupling between adjacent floating gates becomes larger than the coupling between the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> and the floating gate, leading to data corruption between adjacent bits.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{floating}} gate memory cell, a charge trapping cell uses a variable charge between the <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> {{and the channel}} to change the threshold voltage of the transistor.
