40|$|In {{the actual}} {{context of the}} {{international}} economic and financial crises, the necesity for capital is deepening. Subsidies represents a form of financial assistance given by the government, representing a transfers of resources to an entity in return for past or future certain conditions. They exclude those forms of government assistance {{which can not be}} assigned reasonably to a specific value, and those transactions with government which can not be distinguished from normal business operations <b>of</b> the entity. <b>Subsidies</b> represent amounts received for free (non-refundable and non-interest bearing) from the government, government agencies and similar institutions at national and international level.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of inequality {{in the distribution of}} the economic result in businesses engaging in field production in the Czech Republic, by way of the assessment of the impact <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> on the said inequality and by defining the effect {{of the size of the}} business on the economic result as well as inequality. The methodical tool is the quantification of the Gini coefficient and its elasticity. The data basis consists of panel data of 140 agricultural businesses focusing on field production for the period of the years 2005 – 2010. The main results of the submitted article substantiate a high inequality in the distribution of the economic result for the accounting period among field production businesses. The said inequality is not generally caused by the differing size of the analyzed businesses, and the associated volume <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> obtained, but is affected by other factors, such as the management quality, the investment activity of the business, or exceptional events. Subsidies do contribute to the more equal distribution of the economic result, but their impact is very small.

40|$|To motivate {{more people}} to {{participate}} in vaccination campaigns, various subsidy policies are often supplied by government and the health sectors. However, these external incentives may also alter the vaccination decisions of the broader public, and hence the choice of incentive needs to be carefully considered. Since human behavior and the networking-constrained interactions among individuals significantly impact the evolution of an epidemic, here we consider the voluntary vaccination on human contact networks. To this end, two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> typical <b>subsidy</b> policies are considered: (1) under the free subsidy policy, the total amount <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> is distributed to a certain fraction of individual and who are vaccinated without personal cost, and (2) under the partial-offset subsidy policy, each vaccinated person is offset by a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>subsidy.</b> A vaccination decision model based on evolutionary game theory is established to study the effects <b>of</b> these different <b>subsidy</b> policies on disease control. Simulations suggest that, because the partial-offset subsidy policy encourages {{more people to}} take vaccination, its performance is significantly better than that <b>of</b> the free <b>subsidy</b> policy. However, an interesting phenomenon emerges in the partial-offset scenario: with limited amount <b>of</b> total <b>subsidy,</b> a moderate subsidy rate for each vaccinated individual can guarantee the group-optimal vaccination, leading to the maximal social benefits, while such an optimal phenomenon is not evident for the free <b>subsidy</b> scenario.

40|$|The recent WTO cotton ruling {{has led to}} a {{paradoxical}} result for the United States, a result that seems a textbook illustration of the "law of unintended consequences". Indeed, during the Uruguay Round negotiations of the present WTO agreements, the United States refused to put agricultural export credits in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> agricultural export <b>subsidies,</b> where they would then have been subject only to reduction commitments. Paradoxically, the United States finds itself now in a position where these same agricultural export credits that it did not condescend to reduce during the Uruguay Round are openly considered as prohibited export subsidies.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the international legal discipline on public subsidies carried out in this monograph is mainly founded on a critical examination of the relevant disputes. The volume begins with {{the study of the}} rules on subsidies in the 1947 GATT, so as to single out both its positive features and its flaws. This historical overview intends to highlight the goals that the WTO Agreements had to accomplish in order to fill the gaps in the international regulation <b>of</b> <b>subsidies.</b> The research continues with an in-depth exam of the relevant rules in the WTO Agreements, based on several rulings issued by the panels and the Appellate Body throughout the last fourteen years. First, the monograph is directed to reconstruct the notion <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> and to check as well if the notion provided by the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) has a general nature and could also apply to other Agreements, in particular to the special <b>category</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>subsidies,</b> regulated by the Agreement on Agriculture. This question – addressed both by the doctrine and the case law – has been settled by assuming that WTO Agreements are part of a single system of rules. Therefore it seems necessary to find solutions that could preserve its consistency, including the contextual application of different Multilateral Agreements. This aspect is further discussed in the final part of the study, that deals with the {{analysis of}} the rules on agricultural <b>subsidies.</b> The examination <b>of</b> the disputes settlement bodies reports shows that prohibited subsidies – especially “export” subsidies – are more challenged than “actionable” subsidies. Hence, one cannot consider that Uruguay Round negotiators fully succeeded in establishing more precise rules for the definition of the concepts of “injury” and “causal link” and in rendering the so-called “effect-based norms” provided for in the Agreement more effective. Thus, the provision of actual prohibitions turns itself into an essential means to limit these measures that distort international trade and that are commonly used during times of economic crisis. The book also analyses the remedies established by the WTO system – with particular reference to the SCM Agreement – in order to offset the distortive use <b>of</b> <b>subsidies.</b> As in the past, the imposition of countervailing duties is currently the most rapid and effective means to re-establish a balance between the industries of the importing and the exporting Members. This unilateral action is therefore widespread and is subject to “quasi-jurisdictional” review by the DSB, in order to avoid abuses that could turn into protectionist practices. Nevertheless, this international trade area is also characterised by a wider access to the multilateral mechanism of disputes settlement if compared to the past. The research deeply focuses on the problems raised by these two competing options allowed to Member States under the system...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the degree to which public universities are providing subsidies to tax-exempt, non-profit, legally distinct corporations which serve as university-affiliated foundations. Specifically, this investigation sought to determine (a) the percentage <b>of</b> universities providing <b>subsidies,</b> (b) the types <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> provided, (c) the dollar value <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> provided by the universities, and (d) whether statistically significant differences exist among the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> the value of the foundations' endowed funds, university size, and the amounts of foundation unrestricted and restricted expenditures with respect to the presence, type, and dollar ranges <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> provided by universities to their affiliated foundations. A survey instrument was developed for purposes of gathering data for this study. The accessible population surveyed consisted of all four-year public universities and colleges with an enrollment exceeding 2, 500 full-time students which were members of the National Association of College and University Auditors. Of the selected sample size of 125, a total of 83 usable responses were received, resulting in a completion rate of 66 percent.

As the sector’s importance for economic development is often highlighted, this paper seeks to provide a conceptual overview of the various forms <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> in aviation, as a contribution to a more holistic understanding of economic interrelationships. Based on a purposive sampling strategy, existing forms <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> are identified and categorized along the value chain.

These contribute to global economic growth related to aviation, but they also influence capacity in global aviation markets, strengthen the market position of individual airlines, and create conflicts between airlines and the countries they are based in. While the actual scale <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> cannot be determined within the scope of this paper, it provides a discussion of options to empirically assess the effects <b>of</b> aviation <b>subsidies</b> on market outcomes. Finally, general conclusions regarding the impact <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> on the overall sustainability of the air transport sector are drawn: These include rapidly growing capacity in the aviation system, economic vulnerabilities, and negative climate change related impacts.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the diploma paper {{was to assess the}} role, structure and development <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> within the system of financing of municipalities of the Czech Republic after 1993; to find out how the public administration reform was reflected in the system of municipal financing and whether it supported a higher financial self-sufficiency. The analysis <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> development was carried by means of comparing the total amount <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> and own revenues in relation to the total revenue in the period 1994 - 2007. In addition, the analysis <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> structure and the analysis of average volume <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> per unit in the period 2001 - 2007 were used in order to reach the intended objective. The paper is focused in particular on the municipalities of South Bohemia Region. Out {{of the total number of}} 662 municipalities, a representative sample of 179 municipalities was selected where the analysis was performed. The analysis also included all municipalities of the Czech Republic with population higher than 40, 001. The total number of municipalities in the representative sample amounted to 203. The municipalities were classified into eight size categories by population. The public self-administration reform resulted in the fact that revenues from shares and assigned taxes started to flow into the municipal budgets, which contributed to a higher financial and decision-making self-sufficiency of the municipalities. Despite the public administration reform, the volume <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> still represents a considerable portion of sources of regional budgets. By means of analysing the structure <b>of</b> <b>subsidies,</b> it was ascertained that the share <b>of</b> the claimed <b>subsidies</b> in the total revenues from subsidies was growing with the growing number of population and on the other hand, the share <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> that may not be claimed in the total revenues from subsidies has been declining with the growing population. By means of analysing an average volume <b>of</b> <b>subsidies</b> per unit, it was ascertained that the amount <b>of</b> provided claimed <b>subsidies</b> as well as subsidies that may not be claimed grows with the number of population. In the same time, a considerable variability in revenues from subsidies was ascertained within municipalities in individual size categories.

Anaerobic digester installation is heavily subsidised. Depending on caste, the rate <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> offered for the smallest system available (1 m 3) varies between 32. 35 % and 41. 18 % of the total installation price. Yet, there are gaps in knowledge regarding the usefulness <b>of</b> such <b>subsidies</b> from a sustainability perspective. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to evaluate the circumstances required for digester sustainability. The analysis used household data collected from 115 cattle owning households in Odisha, India to evaluate profitability at three levels <b>of</b> <b>subsidy</b> (none, General caste subsidy, and Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe subsidy). Additional analyses considered the effect of; taking a loan, replacing electric lighting with biogas lighting, and the wealth level of the household.
