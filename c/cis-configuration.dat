40|$|Abstract: We have {{constructed}} {{models for}} a series of platinum-DNA adducts that represent the binding of two agents, [Pt 2 (DTBPA) Cl 2](II) and [Pt 2 (TPXA) Cl 2](II), to DNA via inter- and intra-strand cross-linking, and carried out molecular dynamics simulations and DNA conformational dynamics calculations. The effects of trans- and <b>cis-configurations</b> of the centers of these di-nuclear platinum agents, and of different bridging linkers, have been investigated on the conformational distortions of platinum-DNA adducts formed via inter- and intra-strand cross-links. The results demonstrate that the DNA conformational distortions for the various platinum-DNA adducts with differing cross-linking modes are greatly influenced by the difference between the platinum-platinum distance for the platinum agent and the platinum-bound N 7 –N 7 distance for the DNA molecule, and by the flexibility of the bridging linkers in the platinum agent. However, the effects of trans/cis-configurations of the platinum-centers on the DNA conformational distortions in the platinum-DNA adducts depend on the inter- and intra-strand cross-linking modes. In addition, we discuss the relevance of DNA base motions, including opening, shift and roll, to the changes in the parameters of the DNA major and minor grooves caused by binding of the platinum agent...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the LiFeSO 4 F {{material}} {{has been reported}} as the highest potential Fe-based cathode material for Li-ion batteries. Its working voltage vs. Li +/Li 0 jumps from 3. 6 V to 3. 9 V when LiFeSO 4 F is synthesized with the fully ordered tavorite structure and the fully disordered triplite structure, respectively. The present study aims at rationalizing this voltage increase by means of DFT + U calculations combined with crystallographic and electrostatic analyses. We show that the triplite polymorph, although characterized by two distinct edge-shared crystallographic sites, locally exhibits corner-sharing connections between consecutive FeO 4 F 2 octahedra, exactly as in the tavorite polymorph. As a consequence, edge-sharing connections exist in the lithiated triplite structure between consecutive FeO 4 F 2 and LiO 4 F 2 polyhedra. We then demonstrate that {{the origin of the}} voltage increase lies in the difference in the anionic networks of the two polymorphs, and more specifically in the electrostatic repulsions induced by the configuration of the fluorine atoms around the transition metal in the two polymorphs (trans- vs. <b>cis-configurations</b> in tavorite vs. triplite polymorphs). Such a finding should help in the design of novel high potential fluorosulphate materials, which beyond enhanced performances present sustainability attributes as they can be made from abundant elements and via low temperature eco-efficient processes. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

40|$|The {{motional}} {{restrictions of}} the proline pyrrolidine ring allow this secondary amine amino acid {{to act as}} a turn inducer in many peptides and proteins. The pyrrolidine ring is known to exhibit two predominant pucker modes (i. e., C- 4 (Cç) exo and endo envelope conformers whose ratio can be controlled by proper substituents in the ring). In nature, the exo puckered 4 (R) -hydroxy-L-proline plays a crucial role as a building block in collagen and collagen-like structures. It has been previously concluded that the electronegativity of the 4 -cis-substituent increases the endo puckering while the electronegativity of the 4 -trans-substituent favors the exo puckering. Here, we have introduced a sterically demanding tert-butyl group at C- 4 in trans- and <b>cis-configurations.</b> In the case of transsubstitution, the induced puckering effect on the pyrrolidine ring was studied with X-ray crystallography and 1 H NMR spectral simulations. Both cis- and trans- 4 -tert-butyl groups strongly favor pseudoequatorial orientation, therebycausing opposite puckering effects for the pyrrolidine ring, cis-exo and trans-endo for L-prolines, in contrast to the effects observed in the case of electronegative C- 4 substituents. The syntheses and structural analysis are presented for the conformationally constrained 4 -tert-butylprolines. The prolines were synthesized from 4 -hydroxy-L-proline, substitution with t-BuCuSPhLi being the key transformation.

The bivalent congener 1 was generated via electrochemical reduction Of [1]ClO 4. Although in [1](+) the dipyridylamine ligand (L) is bonded {{to the metal}} ion in usual bidentate fashion, in 2 /[2](+) and 3, the unusual monodentate binding mode of L has been preferentially stabilized. Moreover, in 2 /[2](+) and 3, two such monodentate L's have been oriented in the trans- and <b>cis-configurations,</b> respectively. The binding mode of L and the isomeric geometries of the complexes were established by their single-crystal X-ray structures. The redox stability of the Ru(II) state follows the order 1 < 2 much less than 3. In contrast to the magnetic moment obtained for [1]ClO 4, mu = 1. 84 mu(B) at 298 K, typical for low-spin Ru(III) species, the compound [2]ClO 4 exhibited an anomalous magnetic moment of 2. 71 mu(B) at 300 K in the solid state.

Twenty-eight of the tolans were structurally characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Their phase behavior was characterised by tplm; only the tolans in series 3 show liquid crystalline phases. The melting {{points of the}} tolans decrease with increasing chain length due to {{a higher degree of}} flexibility of the terminal chain. An odd-even effect is clearly observed for the clearing point of the nematic phase upon both heating and cooling, with the higher temperature for even and low temperature for odd number carbon chains for series 3. Monomeric and dimeric palladium dichloride complexes containing the monodentate thioureas, tetramethyl thiourea (tmtu) and a chiral C(_ 2) symmetric thiourea were synthesized. Their structures were obtained from single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structures of the mono-palladium complexes are the trans-isomers, whereas the dimer complexes present <b>cis-configurations,</b> and are also the first examples of palladium complexes with sulfur-bridging thiourea ligands. NMR studies of the monomeric and dimeric complexes with tmtu reveal that, in solution, the dimeric complexes are interconverting with mono-palladium complexes, which suggests that the systems are labile. A dynamic equilibrium in solution was also observed between the rac- and meso-dipalladium complexes with the C(_ 2) -symmetric ligand. The energy barrier to exchange was obtained from a variable temperature NMR study. It is proposed that this equilibrium results from the monomer-dimer interconversion. S,N-bidentate ß-dimethyl and ß-monomethyl oxazoline thiourea ligands and α-isoquinoline thiourea ligands and their palladium complexes have been obtained. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses allow us to distinguish between some of their atropoisomers and diastereomers. Most of the Pd complexes were shown to be monomers in the solid state, although one ligand with a cyclohexyl group formed exclusively dimers, and one formed a trimer, as well as a monomer, depending on the solvent mixture that the crystals were grown from. The ligands were found to coordinate through their S and N atoms. All of the mono-palladium complexes and most of the dimers have <b>cis-configurations</b> at the Pd centers; however, we also found a trans-configuration in the trimer and the dimer of one of the palladium complex of the ß-monomethyl ligands. The structures show that the ß- monomethyl oxazoline and a-isoquinoline thiourea complexes appear to be more weakly coordinated than the ß-dimethyl oxazoline ones which may be responsible for their lower stabilities in solution. The structure of the ligands (in particular the 'up' or 'down' conformation of the atropoisomers) is intimately related to their enatioselectivities in bis(methoxycarbonylation) reactions of styrene using palladium complexes. The ß-dimethyl ligands were, in general, found to be more selective in this reaction than the ß -monomethyl oxazoline ones, with palladium complexes of the latter generally found to be less stable in NMR studies. Several bis(phosphine) monosulfide and disulfide ligands and their palladium complexes have been synthesized and analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The reaction with 1 : 1 molar ratios of Pd source to monosulfide ligands were found to produce monomeric palladium complexes with chelating ligands, apart from the reaction with is(diphenylphosphino) butane monosulfide, which was found to result in a dimer being formed. The reactions with 1 : 2 molar ratios of Pd source to monosulfide ligand gave complexes which were coordinated only through the phosphine groups, except for that with bis(diphenylphosphino) methane monosulfides which formed cafionic palladium complexes with two chelating ligands. Analogous reactions with the disulfide ligands and the Pd source [Pd(CH(_ 3) CN) (_ 4) ](BF(_ 4)) (_ 2) also resulted in cationic Pd complexes incorporating two chelating ligands. In some cases, in solution, the complexes showed dynamic equilibria between cis- and trans- isomers which suggests that the phosphine sulfide ligands are labile. The Pd-S-P angles in the complexes were found to be variable but, since there are none less than 90, it is unlikely that there is any ƞ(^ 2) -π bonding involving the P=S bond.

Structural comparison of E. coli CcmG with its deletion mutants reveals that the N-terminal b-sheet is essential for maintaining the folding topology and consequently maintaining the active-site structure of CcmG. Pro 144 and Glu 145 are key residues of the fingerprint region of CcmG. Pro 144 is in <b>cis-configuration,</b> and it makes van der Waals interac-tions with the active-site disulfide Cys 80 –Cys 83 and forms a CH [...] .

Ameltolide and structurally related benzanilides were subjected to molecular modeling studies using both molecular mechanics (MM 2, Amber 96, and OPLS) and semiempirical quantum mechanics (AM], PM 3, and PM 3 Cosmo) to resolve a paradox: while compounds with a phenytoin-like pharmacological profile possess a CO-NH moiety in a <b>cis-configuration,</b> ameltolide was found via X-ray crystallography {{to exist in the}} trans-configuration. Results obtained both by molecular mechanics and semiempirical methods indicate that for ameltolide, the cis and trans forms have similar energy content. Additional ab initio calculations performed at 63 31 G** gave a Delta E (Z - E) on the order of 3 kcal/mol. In view of this small energy difference between the cis and trans forms, it is conceivable that these benzanilides bind to their biological target in their cis configuration, therefore assuming a common structure-activity relationship with classical antiepileptic agents...|$|E

In the structure the Ni atoms are coordinated with four oxygen atoms in two oxalate ions and two nitrogen atoms in one ethylenediamine molecule. The oxalate anion {{acts as a}} bis-bidentate ligand bridging Ni atoms in <b>cis-configuration.</b> This completes the infinite zigzag neutral chain, [Ni(en) (ox) ]. The interchain space is filled by water molecules that link the chains through a network of hydrogen bonds. Thermal variance of the magnetic susceptibility shows a broad maximum around 50 K characteristic of one-dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling. The theoretical fit of the data for T> 20 K led to the nearest neighbor spin interaction J =- 43 K and g = 2. 25. The rapid decrease in susceptibility below 20 K indicate this compound to be a likely Haldane gap candidate material with S = 1...|$|E

It {{was shown}} that recognition of Nβ-methylated substrates occurred on both binding and catalytic steps, while peptides and their aza-β 3 -derivatives were recognized primarily in their non-covalent binding step. This {{can be explained}} by the increase of backbone rigidity called forward by Nβ-methylation and the reduced ability of Nβ-methyl-aza-β 3 peptidomimetics to adopt conformations favorable for the phosphate transfer step in the protein binding site. In other words, N-methylation changed the orientation of the side-chains, thus hampering the substrates recognition by the protein. This conclusion was supported by the structure calculations of peptidomimetic substrates, which showed the preferred <b>cis-configuration</b> of -CO-NMe- peptide bond in three out of four Nβ-Me-aza-β 3 -amino acid-containing RRASVA derivatives, except Nβ-Me-aza-β 3 -RRASVA, where the methylated N-terminal amino group did not participated in peptide bond formation. This means that Nβ-methylation can be used as an efficient tool for tuning both peptidomimetics reactivity and selectivity for the target site, while for the non-methylated compounds only reactivity seems to be mostly affected.|$|E

All X-ray structures showed that the WeC bond trans AsPh 3 < WeC bond trans carbene < WeC bond trans CO. DFT calculations on all possible conformations of each complex due to the different possible positions of the ligands and carbene substituents to each other, correlated with the experimental results.

The crystal structure of human CRYM's bacterial homolog Pseudomonas putida ornithine cyclodeaminase and Archaeoglobus fulgidus alanine dehydrogenase have been available, but no CRYM structure has been reported. Here, we report the crystal structure of human CRYM bound with NADPH refined to 2. 6 Å, {{and there is}} one dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure contains two domains: a Rossmann fold–like NADPH-binding domain and a dimerization domain. Different conformations of the loop Arg 83 –His 92 have been observed in two monomers of human CRYM in the same asymmetric unit. The peptide bond of Val 89 –Pro 90 is a trans-configuration in one monomer but a <b>cis-configuration</b> in the other. A detailed comparison of the human μ-crystallin structure with its structurally characterized homologs including the overall comparison and superposition of active sites was conducted.

The maleinisation of linoleic acid leads to cyclohexenoic anhydrides having an allylic double bond. The <b>cis-configuration</b> of this double bond {{was confirmed by}} synthesis of the corresponding anhydrides via Diels-Alder reaction of calendic acid, alpha-eleostearic acid and beta-eleostearic acid with maleic anhydride, which {{was reported to be}} highly regio- and stereoselective. These compounds were co-injected with the products of the Rh-catalysed maleinated linoleic acid into HPLC column so that the peaks of the resulting chromatogram could be allocated to the corresponding cyclohexenoic anhydrides. Besides the activity of the used catalysts RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3 and Rh(OAc) 2, their selectivity towards the cyclohexenoic anhydrides was investigated. Furthermore the influence of reaction temperature, equivalents of maleic anhydride and reaction time was analysed to determine the optimum reaction conditions for the highest overall yields of the resulting 3, 6 -disubstituted- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-phthalic acid anhydride derivatives...|$|E
40|$|In recent papers [1 - 3] we {{have pointed}} out that stable {{configurations}} of polypeptide chains must show the bond distances and bond angles found in simple peptides and related simple substances, that each amide group must be planar, with either the <b>cis-configuration</b> or the trans-configuration about the C'-N bond, and that the carbonyl and imino groups (except for proline or hydroxyproline residues) must be involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds, with N-H•••O distance approximately 2. 8 Å, and with the oxygen atom nearly on the N-H axis. We have also presented evidence indicating that certain configurations around the two single bonds from the amide groups to the a carbon atom are energetically favored, and have discussed the 36 polypeptide-chain structures involving equivalent trans-amide groups with one or another of six favored azimuthal orientations about the N-C single bond and also one of six favored orientations about the C-C' single bond.
