25|$|Bitumen {{was used}} in early {{photographic}} technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a <b>camera.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist {{in the production of}} printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.|$|E

2500|$|When {{images are}} {{acquired}} from locations with large differences in openness (for example, closed canopy locations and canopy gaps) {{it is essential}} to control <b>camera</b> <b>exposure.</b> If the camera is allowed to automatically adjust exposure (which is controlled by aperture and shutter speed), the result is that small openings in closed conditions will be bright, whereas openings of the same size in open conditions will be darker (for example, canopy areas around a gap). This means that during image analysis the same-sized holes will be interpreted as [...] "sky" [...] in a closed-canopy image and [...] "canopy" [...] in the open-canopy image. Without controlling exposure, the real differences between closed- and open-canopy conditions will be underestimated.|$|E

50|$|Some classic <b>camera's</b> <b>{{exposure}}</b> guide {{also has}} the old conversion, for example the exposure guide of classic camera Tessina, DIN 21 is related to ASA80, DIN 18 to ASA 40. User of classic cameras who does not know the historic background, may be confused.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the large}} {{f-number}} of a pinhole <b>camera,</b> <b>exposures</b> will often encounter reciprocity failure. Once exposure time has exceeded about 1 second for film or 30 seconds for paper, one must compensate for the breakdown in linear response of the film/paper to intensity of illumination by using longer exposures.|$|R

50|$|The {{illuminance}} E {{is controlled}} by the f-number but also depends on the scene luminance. To avoid confusion, some authors (Ray 2000, 310) have used <b>camera</b> <b>exposure</b> to refer to combinations of camera settings. The 1964 ASA standard for automatic exposure controls for cameras, ASA PH2.15-1964, took the same approach, and also used the more descriptive term <b>camera</b> <b>exposure</b> settings.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film speed}} dial of the Canon A-1 (1978) {{supported}} a speed range from 6 to 12800 ASA (but already called ISO film speeds in the manual). On this <b>camera</b> <b>exposure</b> compensation and extreme film speeds were mutually exclusive.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1960s, cameras {{did not have}} {{built-in}} exposure meters, andmany photographers did not have external exposure meters.

50|$|Exposure can be {{adjusted}} by changing either the lens f-number or the exposure time; which one is changed usually depends on the <b>camera's</b> <b>exposure</b> mode. If the mode is aperture priority, exposure compensation changes the exposure time; if the mode is shutter priority, the f-number is changed. If a flash is being used, some cameras will adjust it as well.|$|R
50|$|Aperture {{priority}} mode (commonly abbreviated to Av) gives the photographer manual {{control of the}} aperture, whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the TTL meter. Shutter {{priority mode}} (commonly abbreviated to TV) gives manual shutter control, with automatic aperture compensation. In each case, the actual exposure level is still determined by the <b>camera's</b> <b>exposure</b> meter.|$|R
5000|$|The EV {{concept was}} {{developed}} by the German shutter manufacturer [...] in the 1950s (Gebele 1958; Ray 2000, 318). Its intent was to simplify choosing among equivalent <b>camera</b> <b>exposure</b> settings by replacing combinations of shutter speed and f-number (e.g., 1/125 s at f/16) with a single number (e.g., 15).|$|E
50|$|Another {{challenge}} for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper <b>camera</b> <b>exposure.</b> Underexposing or overexposing a colored backdrop {{can lead to}} poor saturation levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of noise, as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.|$|E

50|$|A neutron {{camera is}} an imaging {{system based on}} a digital camera or similar {{detector}} array. Neutrons pass through the object to be imaged, then a scintillation screen converts the neutrons into visible light. This light then pass through some optics (intended to minimize the <b>camera's</b> <b>exposure</b> to ionizing radiation), then the image is captured by the CCD camera (several other camera types also exist, including CMOS and CID, producing similar results).|$|R

40|$|A Pointing Covariance Analysis Tool (PCAT) {{has been}} {{developed}} for evaluating the expected performance of the pointing control system for NASA s Space Interferometry Mission (SIM). The SIM pointing control system is very complex, consisting of multiple feedback and feedforward loops, and operating with multiple latencies and data rates. The SIM pointing problem is particularly challenging due {{to the effects of}} thermomechanical drifts in concert with the long <b>camera</b> <b>exposures</b> needed to image dim stars. Other pointing error sources include sensor noises, mechanical vibrations, and errors in the feedforward signals. PCAT models the effects of finite <b>camera</b> <b>exposures</b> and all other error sources using linear system elements. This allows the pointing analysis to be performed using linear covariance analysis. PCAT propagates the error covariance using a Lyapunov equation associated with time-varying discrete and continuous-time system matrices. Unlike Monte Carlo analysis, which could involve thousands of computational runs for a single assessment, the PCAT analysis performs the same assessment in a single run. This capability facilitates the analysis of parametric studies, design trades, and "what-if" scenarios for quickly evaluating and optimizing the control system architecture and design...|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1820s, {{prior to}} his {{association}} with Daguerre, Niépce used a coating of bitumen of Judea {{to make the first}} permanent camera photographs. The bitumen was hardened where it was exposed to light and the unhardened portion was then removed with a solvent. A <b>camera</b> <b>exposure</b> lasting for hours or days was required. Niépce and Daguerre later refined this process, but unacceptably long exposures were still needed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an {{exposure}} meter is {{to estimate the}} subject's mid-tone luminance and indicate the <b>camera</b> <b>exposure</b> settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it {{has to make a}} number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an exposure meter is taken as the [...] "reference" [...] exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies.|$|E

50|$|High-speed {{video cameras}} {{are used to}} augment other {{industrial}} technologies such as x-ray radiography. When used with the proper phosphor screen which converts x-rays into visible light, high-speed cameras {{can be used to}} capture high-speed x-ray videos of events inside mechanical devices and biological specimens. The imaging speed is mainly limited by the phosphor screen decay rate and intensity gain which has a direct relationship on the <b>camera's</b> <b>exposure.</b> Pulsed x-ray sources limit frame rate and should be properly synchronized with camera frame captures.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{permanent}} photograph, a contact-exposed copy of an engraving, {{was made}} in 1822 using the bitumen-based [...] "heliography" [...] process developed by Nicéphore Niépce.

50|$|In photography, some cameras include {{exposure}} compensation as {{a feature}} {{to allow the}} user to adjust the automatically calculated exposure. Compensation can be either positive (additional exposure) or negative (reduced exposure), and is frequently available in third- or half-step, less commonly in full steps or even quarter-step increments, usually up {{to two or three}} steps in either direction; a few film and some digital cameras allow a greater range of up to four, five or even six steps in both directions. <b>Camera</b> <b>exposure</b> compensation is commonly stated in terms of EV units; 1 EV is equal to one exposure step (or stop), corresponding to a doubling of exposure.|$|E

40|$|Incorrectly {{setting the}} <b>camera’s</b> <b>exposure</b> {{can have a}} {{significant}} negative effect on a photograph. Over-exposing photographs causes pixels to exhibit unpleasant artifacts due to saturation of the sensor. Saturation removal typically involves user intervention to adjust the color values, which is tedious and time-consuming.

Our method {{is based on a}} smoothness prior: neighboring pixels have similar channel ratios and color values.

50|$|The {{direction}} of the adjustment relative to the camera's meter reading depends on the dynamic range (or contrast ratio) of the scene. Typically, with low-contrast scenes, an increase in exposure over that indicated by the camera's meter will be required. When attempting a single-exposure of a high dynamic-range scene, a reduction in exposure from the meter's reading may be needed. In the final analysis, however, the camera's meter is irrelevant to ETTR since the ETTR exposure is established, not by a meter reading, but by the <b>camera's</b> <b>exposure</b> indicators, the histogram and/or the highlight-clipping indicators (blinkies/zebras).|$|R
