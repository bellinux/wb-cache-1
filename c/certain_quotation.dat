40|$|Inferno {{constitutes}} {{a turning point}} in Strindberg's literary production in that scriptural quotations appear more frequently and a new style emerges. This thesis presents the characteristics of the scriptural quotations appearing in Inferno (1897) and Jacob Wrestles (a fragment following Légendes, written in French and in Swedish in 1898). Comparative, discourse, textual and intertextual approaches are used to define the place and role of scriptural quotations in this literary corpus. From a historical point of view, both novels are part of the religious history of late 19 th century France, where religion played a more important role than during the scientific, rationalist era characterizing the preceding decades. Strindberg adopts a new style corresponding to the spirit of his time. The art of "quoting the Bible at random" is a rhapsodic style, which appears mainly in Strindberg’s correspondence, in his Occult Diary (writings contemporary with Inferno) and in the work of some French 19 th century writers. This style originates, above all, in the occult tradition, {{but it is also a}} means of imitating the Bible and identifying with a prophetic figure. The research discussed in this dissertation has made it possible to determine, for the first time, what Bible translations are used in the two novels by Strindberg (translations by Ostervald and Martin / Roques). Five different types of rewritings of quotations were found: omissions, cutting of verses, substitutions, typographical changes and inversions. These variations were aimed at harmonising the Biblical text and the Strindbergian text, while removing contextual and theological elements that bothered the writer. The discourse analysis has concentrated on the quotations viewed as reported speech, distinguishing different ways of introducing Biblical verses in the novel. It was found that the narrator's subjectivity is present in the comments leading up to the quotations. The polyphonic character of some quotations has stressed the importance of identification play between the narrator and <b>certain</b> <b>quotations</b> characters such as Christ, Job and the psalmist. The intertextual analysis has revealed a large number of similarities in the scriptural quotations in the literary production of Strindberg, Swedenborg and French 19 th century literature. It is shown that Inferno contains various quotations that appear in Occult Diary and in other writers’ works, such as those of Swedenborg, Péladan, Zola, Huysmans and Chateaubriand. Jacob Wrestles, on the other hand, does not include as many intertextual elements but instead reassembles many scriptural quotations that were underlined in the Bible translation used for this novel: La Sainte Bible, Ostervald's translation from 1890, which can be found in Blå Tornet (The Strindberg Museum in Stockholm). Strindberg is consequently recycling Biblical material when he writes Inferno, while resorting to the French Bible of Ostervald from 1890 to write Jacob Wrestles. The quotations strewn in Inferno constitute a crescendo and reveal the narrator’s unsuccessful attempt at conversion, at the same time forming the structure of a complaint psalm in which the narrator cries out his suffering and awaits liberation. In the French text of Jacob Wrestles, the writer offers a package of scriptural quotations in order to identify the narrator as "a religious man", imploring God's mercy like Moses and Job. In the Swedish text of Jacob Wrestles, a new perspective is introduced as a result of the change in language, the change from Old to New Testament, the new spiritual disposition of the narrator and the sudden intrusion of the writer in the narrator’s space. The role of scriptural quotations in the entire fragment of Jacob Wrestles is a true linguistic, thematic and theological revolution, which accounts for the narrator's extraordinary religious evolution. The misery of the narrator in Inferno allows a ray of Christian hope, which will persist in Strindbergs’s literary production post-Inferno...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (New Testament)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The book of Hebrews {{presents}} fascinating {{material for}} the study of Scripture on many dimensions. This is especially true when it comes to Hebrew's use of the Old Testament. Hebrews is not only the book that quotes from the Old Testament more than any other book in the New Testament, it also implements and organizes these quotations in a remarkable fashion. These quotations, references and reminiscences are also not made at random but are implemented in an organized structure. Not only does the Hebrew writer use the message of the Old Testament, but he also gives a message in the way that he organizes his <b>quotations.</b> <b>Certain</b> <b>quotations</b> appear right through the book, while they are also quoted in a more concentrated area in specific sections of the book. The quotations also appear to have introductory formulas unique to Hebrews. The specific source of these quotations appears to be the Psalms and the Pentateuch. One such text, which is used in a very high frequency and which has an enormous impact on Hebrews is Psalm 110. The present study makes clear that especially this Psalm is used in an organized and decisive way in the thought pattern of Hebrews. Quotations from, references to and reminiscences on verse 1 and verse 4 appear to form the proverbial "backbone" of Hebrews. It is even possible to indicate a that there is a parallel thought pattern between that of Psalm 110 and the basic thought structure of the "sermon" to the Hebrews. The study shows that Psalm 110 plays even more than a structural role in the book of Hebrews. The exposition of the quoted verses constitutes the central message of the book as a whole. The message is that Jesus is the risen Christ, the King-Priest of our salvation. The way in which Hebrews explains the message of Psalm 110 leads to the conclusion that Hebrews can be viewed as an example of an early-Christian Midrasj on Psalm 110. In accordance with the characteristics of a Midrasj the Hebrew writer makes abundant use of the expository methods of the rabbinical hermeneutics of it's time. In accordance with this method Psalm 110 is explained and applied as a Messianic Psalm. The Hebrew writer makes even a further step than his contemporary Jewish expositors, by applying the Messianic prophecy of the Psalm directly to Jesus Christ. Both Hebrews and the other Jewish expositors did justice to the messianic message of Psalm 110 by adherence to the literary and historical context of the Psalm. Through an exegetical study of Psalm 110, in it's context of the Hebrew Tenach, this is the conclusion to which this study comes. Even in it's original form the Psalm was destined to refer to more than an ordinary earthly king is. It proclaimed the coming of a Priest-King who would finally conquer the enemies and foes of the people of God and who will reign forever. Hebrews makes clear than this became a reality in the work of Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God. By studying the way in which Hebrews uses and explains Psalm 110 this study contributes some valuable insights into the hermeneutics of our own day, especially the contemporary hermeneutics on the Messianic Psalms. It shows that present day expositors, in complying with the approach of Hebrews, can rightly maintain that the Messianic Psalms did indeed make reference to the person and work of Jesus Christ and can still be interpreted as such today. The study finally examines the use of Psalm 110 in Hebrews with the aim of determining the hermeneutic principles of the book and comparing them with that of the Jewish exegetes of its time. These principles are then also compared with those being used today and the points of critique against the hermeneutics of Hebrews are evaluated. Master...|$|R
