40|$|Abstract: Grinding {{process is}} {{generally}} used for making products requiring high surface finish. However, {{due to high}} thermo-mechanical load, stresses are generated inside the ground workpiece. Residual stress, if tensile in nature, has detrimental effect on the workpiece. Thus, assessment of residual stress is important for fatigue analysis, safety design and strength evaluation. In this paper, a finite element thermo-mechanical model is used for evaluating distribution of stress induced during surface grinding of titanium Grade- 1 flats. The stress generated in the product can be minimized by using coolant. Wet with pneumatic barrier condition gives more control on stress generation due to effective <b>cooling.</b> <b>Stress</b> generated during grinding can be controlled by controlling infeed also.

In this study two approaches to prepare ZTA are compared. For the first approach, an ultrafine alumina powder was coated with 5 vol% zirconia by a wet chemical method.

Samples were consolidated at 1350 - 1600 °C by hot pressing and their mechanical properties, microstructure and transformation behavior were compared. Toughness increments derived from different toughening mechanisms are also briefly discussed. Besides better sinterability, the mixed material exhibited a finer grain size of both matrix and dispersion and thus higher hardness and strength. The alumina matrix was under compressive hydrostatic residual <b>cooling</b> <b>stress,</b> whereas zirconia was under tensile one.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2003 Injection {{moulding}} is {{a process}} by which molten polymer is forced into an empty cavity of the desired shape. At its melting point, polymers undergo a volumetric expansion when heated, and volumetric contraction when cooled. This volumetric contraction is called shrinkage. Once the mould cavity is filled, more pressure is applied and additional polymer is packed into the cavity and held {{to compensate for the}} anticipated shrinkage as the polymer solidifies. The cooling takes place via the cooling channels where the polymer is cooled until a specific ejection criterion is met. Heat from the polymer is lost to the surrounding mould, a part of this heat reaches the cooling channel surfaces, which in turn exchange heat with the circulating cooling fluid. Due to the complexity of injection moulded parts and the cooling channel layout, it is difficult to achieve balanced cooling of parts. Asymmetric mould temperature distribution causes contractions of• the polymer as it cools from its melting temperature to room temperature. This results in residual stresses, which causes the part to warp after ejection. Given the understanding of the mathematical model describing the heat transfer process during the cooling stage, the objectives of this study were three fold. Firstly, an alternative numerical model for the heat transfer process was developed. The proposed model was used to investigate the <b>cooling</b> <b>stress</b> build-up during the injection moulding process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Titania was {{progressively}} {{added in}} the range 3 – 9 wt % into a triaxial porcelain body consisting of clay, quartz and feldspar. The composed bodies were heated at five different temperatures in the range 1200 – 1400 °C and their fired properties as well as phases evolved were studied. The results revealed that beyond 1300 °C, formation of more liquid phases caused bloating in samples which led to generation of pores. This effect is more pronounced in TiO 2 containing samples. In the present system, 1300 °C appeared to b the optimum temperature at which porosity was almost negligible and strength was maximum (45 MPa), particularly in presence of TiO 2. From the results of XRD studies, {{it was revealed that}} quartz content primarily decreased with increase in TiO 2 content due to excess glass formation and its subsequent dissolution. Mullite content increased with increase in TiO 2 content. No significant effect was observed beyond 6 wt % addition. Micro-structure primarily showed the presence of quartz grain and cluster of smaller sized primary mullite crystals in both the samples without and with TiO 2. Very few secondary mullite crystals were also observed.

The drastic reduction of residual strength after 8 cycles of heating at 800 °C and cooling particularly in TiO 2 containing samples suggests controlled heat treatment of the vitrified samples necessary to promote secondary crystallization process for the enhancement of strength.

The ferrimagnetic and AMS fabrics are similar, indicating that the ferrimagnetic minerals dominate the AMS signal. The paramagnetic fabric is different from the previous ones. Based on the crystallization timing of the different mineralogical phases, the paramagnetic fabric appears related to the upward flow, while the ferrimagnetic fabric rather reflects the late-stage of dyke emplacement and <b>cooling</b> <b>stresses.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Actes disponibles : [URL] audienceThe {{majority}} of the Lesser Antilles islands are characterized by andesitic volcanism. However, their hydrogeological functioning and associated structures are little known and little studied, while water needs are obvious. Indeed, {{at the end of}} dry seasons, water cuts mark the daily routine of the population, although,significant volumes of water could be collected through water boreholes. Volcanic aquifers are complex in terms of geological structure (geometry) and spatial distribution of hydrodynamic parameters. Indeed, only basaltic islands have hydrogeological schemes: the Hawaiian model (low-lying basal aquifer and perched aquifer) and the Canary Island model (continuous basal aquifer). The objective of this presentation is to summarize the results of geological, hydrogeological and geophysical prospecting conducted in Martinique since 2006. Dozens of electrical profilings were conducted to characterize the geological structure. Boreholes were then carried out firstly to calibrate the electrical profiles and also to identify the aquifers. Finally, pumping tests were conducted to determine the hydrodynamic parameters of the encountered aquifers. These researchs have provided new evidence showing that the hydrogeological scheme of the Martinique aquifers is different from the two previously mentioned: Martinique is not marked by lava flows of large extension with high permeability and has not any basal aquifer. The Martinique aquifers are on the contrary very heterogeneous. Their structure and groundwater flow are mainly controlled by embricated and tight paleo-valleys and, for lavas, fissures resulting from <b>cooling</b> <b>stress.</b> Thus, the aquifers are often characterized by a high spatial variation in hydraulic properties, a low storage coefficient and bounded by several no-flow boundaries. Some low permeable layers, resulting from weathering processes (which transforms primary minerals into clay-rich materials) also play an important role as capacitive layers. In some conditions, they can be drained by underlying lavas groundwaters, thus increasing the sustained yield of water boreholes...|$|E

A 13 ~ diffusion barriers in a-AI~O ~ by the vacancy mechanism are in reasonable agreement with experiment. The barrier to Y~ § diffusion is predicted to be much higher. Since addition of yttrium to transition metal alloys is known to reduce the growth rate and stress convolutions in protective alumina scales, this result suggests the rate-limiting step in scale growth is cation vacancy diffusion.

It is possible to obtain these fast thermal gradients in con"ned environments, called climatic chambers where the air is heated by an electrical resistance and is cooled with a "nned evaporator which is linked to a vapour compression system subjected to a particular control system of the refrigerating power. In particular, in this paper the air and object tested thermal transients are studied from an analytical and experimental point of view.

Based on evidence that stress influences temperature, and that psychology and physiology influence each other, we investigated the novel possibility that reducing brain temperature reduces stress in a sample of 91 university students. We used head fanning to reduce brain temperature and measured this change with an infrared ear thermometer. Participants were randomly assigned so that the fans faced toward half of the participants (cooling condition) and faced away from the other half (non-cooling control condition). Differences in stress between conditions during the Vandenberg and Kuse (1978) Mental Rotations Test were then examined to test the hypotheses that (a) <b>cooling</b> would buffer <b>stress</b> and (b) that this would be mediated by changes in brain temperature, as indicated by ear temperature. Participants in the cooling condition were less stressed (p =. 02) and also performed better (p =. 03) during the task but neither of these findings were mediated by ear temperature. Thus, some uncontrolled variable(s), and not changes in temperature, may have been responsible for the effect of <b>cooling</b> on <b>stress.</b> Alternatively, error in measuring brain temperature may have obscured the hypothesised causal relationship between temperature and stress.

40|$|Coral {{bleaching}} {{has become}} more frequent and widespread {{as a result of}} rising sea surface temperature (SST). During a regional scale SST anomaly, reef exposure to thermal stress is patchy in part due to physical factors that reduce SST to provide thermal refuge. Tropical cyclones (TCs - hurricanes, typhoons) can induce temperature drops at spatial scales comparable to that of the SST anomaly itself. Such cyclone cooling can mitigate bleaching across broad areas when well-timed and appropriately located, yet the spatial and temporal prevalence of this phenomenon has not been quantified. Here, satellite SST and historical TC data are used to reconstruct cool wakes (n= 46) across the Caribbean during two active TC seasons (2005 and 2010) where high thermal stress was widespread. Upon comparison of these datasets with thermal stress data from Coral Reef Watch and published accounts of bleaching, it is evident that TC <b>cooling</b> reduced thermal <b>stress</b> at a region-wide scale. The results show that during a mass bleaching event, TC <b>cooling</b> reduced thermal <b>stress</b> below critical levels to potentially mitigate bleaching at some reefs, and interrupted natural warming cycles to slow the build-up of thermal stress at others. Furthermore, reconstructed TC wave damage zones suggest that it was rare for more reef area to be damaged by waves than was cooled (only 12 % of TCs).
