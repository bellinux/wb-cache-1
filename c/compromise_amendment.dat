5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a <b>compromise</b> <b>amendment</b> banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his governorship, Romney opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions, but advocated tolerance and supported some domestic partnership benefits. A November 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision required the state to recognize same-sex marriages (Goodridge v. Department of Public Health). Romney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed civil unions, viewing it as the only feasible way to accomplish the former. In May 2004, in compliance with the court decision, the governor instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, he said no marriage licenses were to be issued to those people not planning to move to Massachusetts. In June 2005, Romney abandoned his support for the <b>compromise</b> <b>amendment,</b> stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions. Instead, he endorsed a ballot initiative led by the Coalition for Marriage and Family (an alliance of socially conservative organizations) that would have banned same-sex marriage and made no provisions for civil unions. In 2004 and 2006, he urged the U.S. Senate to vote in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E

500|$|The Committee of Fifteen began {{consideration}} {{of what would}} become the Fourteenth Amendment. Stevens had begun drafting versions in December 1865, before the Committee had even formed. In January 1866, a subcommittee including Stevens and John Bingham proposed two amendments: one giving Congress the unqualified power to secure equal rights, privileges, and protections for all citizens; the other explicitly annulling all racially discriminatory laws. Stevens believed that the Declaration of Independence and Organic Acts already bound the federal government to these principles, but that an amendment was necessary to allow enforcement against discrimination at the State level. The resolution providing for {{what would become the}} Fourteenth Amendment was watered down in Congress; during the closing debate, Stevens said these changes had shattered his lifelong dream in equality for all Americans. [...] Nevertheless, stating that he lived among men, not angels, he supported the passage of the <b>compromise</b> <b>amendment.</b> Still, Stevens told the House: [...] "Forty acres of land and a hut would be more valuable to [...] than the immediate right to vote." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{constitutional}} convention {{took up the}} <b>compromise</b> <b>amendment</b> {{approved in}} 2004. It failed on a vote of 157-39 on September 14, after many moderate legislators who had initially supported it refused to and most legislators opposed to same-sex marriage abandoned its compromise language. State Senator Brian Lees, a Republican who co-sponsored the amendment in the previous convention, explained why he withdrew his support: [...] "Gay marriage has begun, and life has not changed for {{the citizens of the}} commonwealth, with the exception of those who can now marry. This amendment which was an appropriate measure or compromise a year ago, is no longer, I feel, a compromise today." [...] Opponents turned instead to an alternative method of amending the constitution that they thought would allow them to present an uncompromising ban on same-sex marriage to the voters. This method would require the collection of thousands of signatures on petitions but would need the support of only a quarter of the legislators to become a referendum. The process of gathering signatures was already underway when the legislators voted to reject the 2004 compromise.

In June 2005, Romney endorsed a petition effort led by the Coalition for Marriage & Family that would ban gay marriage and make no provisions for civil unions. [...] Backed by the signatures of 170,000 Massachusetts residents the new amendment was certified as a valid referendum on September 7, 2005 by Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly. The measure needs the approval of fifty legislators in two consecutive sessions of the Massachusetts General Court to be placed on the ballot. [...] The Massachusetts legislature however declined to vote on the initiative in two consecutive sessions held on July 12, 2006 and November 9, 2006. Romney responded by joining former Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and eight others to file a complaint with the state's Supreme Judicial Court to force the legislature to vote on the proposed amendment. The petition also asked the court to instruct the Massachusetts Secretary of State to place the referendum on the 2008 ballot if the legislature failed to vote on the amendment by January 2, 2007.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, {{the debate}} and vote on the Quebec issue lasted {{about an hour and}} a half. The Resolutions Committee's motion was tabled by {{leadership}} contender, David Lewis. He led the charge against the Waffle, speaking from the floor, and surrounded by approximately 600 supporters, stated: [...] "You would be doing an immense disservice to the party and this great country if this convention binds itself to any resolution that questions the desire of the people to live in one united Canada." [...] Another leadership hopeful, Ed Broadbent, tried to bridge the two polarized factions, by attempting to introduce a <b>compromise</b> <b>amendment</b> to Lewis' motion that said: [...] "There should be no questioning of the fundamental right of Quebeckers to leave Confederation if the decision is democratically arrived by the people of Quebec." [...] His amendment garnered little support, and was rejected outright by a wide majority. In the end, the vast majority of the 1700 convention delegates supported the Lewis motion, with a show of hands. The motion backed a one-Canada stand, and really gave the party's establishment a free-hand on how to prepare a more detailed position for the up-coming federal election, since the motion also made the party's−establishment controlled−Federal Council responsible for producing that policy. After the Quebec wing's defeat on the Quebec motion, Laliberté refused to state whether they would leave the party, only suggesting that it would be dealt with at their June provincial convention.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{conflict}} and fierce resistance, the Bill continued its passage through Parliament. It moved to its second reading on 9 June, and the Committee stage on 11 June, where it became fraught in controversy after a young Liberal named Thomas Agar-Robartes proposed an amendment excluding four of the Ulster counties (Londonderry, Down, Antrim & Armagh) from the Irish Parliament. This put Law in a delicate situation, since he had previously {{said that he would}} support a system allowing each county to remain [...] "outside the Irish Parliament", at the same time saying that he would not support any amendment that didn't have Ulster's full co-operation. If he accepted the amendment, he would be seen as abandoning the Irish Unionists, {{but on the other hand}} if the amendment was carried it might disrupt the government by causing a split between the Liberals and Irish Nationalists, bringing down the government and thus forcing an election. If the Unionists wished to win the ensuing election they would have to show that they were willing to compromise. In the end the amendment failed, but with the Liberal majority reduced by 40, and when a <b>compromise</b> <b>amendment</b> was proposed by another Liberal MP the government Whips were forced to trawl for votes. Law saw this as a victory, as it highlighted the split in the government. Edward Carson tabled another amendment on 1 January 1913 which would exclude all nine Ulster counties, more to test government resolve than anything else. While it failed, it allowed the Unionists to portray themselves as the party of compromise and the Liberals as stubborn and recalcitrant.|$|E

Accordingly, the courts have repeatedly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the burden of demonstrating, “from the text of law and from actual fact” that substantial overbreadth exists. Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113 (2003). Similarly, “there must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly <b>compromise</b> recognized First <b>Amendment</b> protections of parties not before the Court {{for it to be}} facially challenged on overbreadth grounds”. Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 801 (1984). In Hoffman Estates v.

As criminal justice “administrative” costs have skyrocketed, the burden to fund the system has fallen largely on the system’s users—primarily poor or indigent—who often cannot pay their burden.

40|$|Two centuries {{after its}} formulation, the American {{doctrine}} {{of the separation of}} Church and State yet remains a continuing source of controversy and confusion for many. For the interpretation of that idea [...] as embodied in the First Amendment to the Constitution [...] has been frequently beset by two historical myths or misunderstandings. From early in our history on, for example, there has been an attempt to cast our national beginnings in explicitly Christian terms, exemplified by such notions as "redeemer nation" and the belief in ours as a Christian republic. A clearer reading of the evidence suggests, however, that such an interpretation is not warranted by the facts, nor has it ever been. Yet likewise, neither true is the suggestion that has frequently been advanced by the other historical misunderstanding, namely, that the Founding Fathers set out to create an intentionally "secular" state, wishing to completely deny any significant role for religion within the affairs of public life. For {{the reality is that the}} First Amendment was the finely balanced product of compromise, reflecting not simply the more well-known elements of Jeffersonian rationalism and Enlightenment political theory, but an equally significant theological pedigree, as well. One may see within even its few words, in fact, the reflections of such Christian thinkers as Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Edwards, and particularly perhaps, Roger Williams. Taken together with the insights of Locke, Jefferson, and Madison, American separationism thus emerged as a synthesis of sorts between those two visions, as well as a practical solution to the very real problem of vastly different religious experiences between the American states. As a <b>compromise,</b> therefore, the <b>Amendment</b> (and the subsequent American understanding of Church and State), should not be "pushed" too far in either direction. Rather, the key to understanding its continuing relevance for today is to both recognize the complex and varied context out of which the notion of separationism was adopted two hundred years ago, and the truly revolutionary changes which the American experiment was to represent...|$|R
40|$|In this digital age, {{individuals}} and {{society as a}} whole struggle to balance the advantages of digital connectivity against the reality that this very connectivity inevitably gives others access, licitly or illicitly, to private information. Youth, in particular, bring a new dimension to this issue with their concept of privacy. While risks to privacy are certainly not limited to youth, an argument can be made that conceptualizations of privacy for those who have grown up with this technology are unique. One could further argue that as a group, youth possibly demonstrate distinct expectations of privacy when compared with older generations. This article concerns the intersection of youth, technology, expectations of privacy, and the Fourth Amendment. More specifically, the article examines whether this norm of conditioned increased information disclosure, combined with decreased privacy rights for students, effectively strips or <b>compromises</b> the Fourth <b>Amendment</b> protections of a class of people - youth. This article seeks to explore a Fourth Amendment issue never before faced. What is society to do when a large subset of citizens, as a result of social or technological conditioning and not government action, demonstrates an arguably lesser expectation of privacy? Part I of this article examines data regarding digital natives and their interaction with current technologies. Part II reviews current law regarding expectations of privacy in general, under the Katz test and more specifically, for public school students, under New Jersey v. T. L. O. and Safford Unified School District v. Redding. The article further reviews what guidance the Court has offered in situations where the familiar two-pronged Katz test is not useful. Part III reviews possible solutions to this problem, calling into question the utility of the Katz test. The article explores whether a more value-laden approach outlined by Justice Harlan in his dissent in United States v. White may offer a more promising solution than the traditional Katz analysis. Because the jurisprudence addressing searches of public school students in a school setting is developing, Part IV applies the different approaches offered by the Court to a hypothetical modification of the facts in Redding. Suppose instead of the virtual strip search, school officials had seized her cell phone and examined its digital contents. This article explores that scenario and concludes that, for several reasons, the Supreme Court‘s current approach to applying the Fourth Amendment is inadequate to sufficiently address the issues presented in this all-too-common scenario. It further argues that the proposal of Justice Harlan in his White dissent offers the most promise...|$|R
