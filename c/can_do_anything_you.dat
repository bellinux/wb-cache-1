[...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?"

6000|$|Maxwell {{lay back}} in his chair with a laugh. [...] "Not the least in the world." [...] The {{realization}} of the fact amused him more and more. [...] "I was just thinking how everything he ever got me to do to it," [...] {{he looked down at the}} manuscript, [...] "was false and wrong. They talk about a knowledge of the stage as if the stage were a difficult science, instead of a very simple piece of mechanism whose limitations and possibilities any one can seize at a glance. All that their knowledge of it comes to is clap-trap, pure and simple. They brag of its resources, and tell you the carpenter <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want nowadays, but if you attempt anything outside of their tradition they are frightened. They think that their exits and their entrances are great matters, and that they must come on with such a speech, and go off with such another; but it is not of the least consequence how they come or go if they have something interesting to say or do." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} they {{got the idea that}} what the public wanted was not {{anything}} instructive but something light and amusing. Mullins said that people loved to laugh. He said that if {{you get a lot of}} people all together and get them laughing you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> like with them. Once they start to laugh they are lost. So they got Mr. Dreery, the English Literature teacher at the high school, to give an evening of readings from the Great Humorists from Chaucer to Adam Smith. They came mighty near to making a barrel of money out of that. If the people had once started laughing it would have been all over with them. As it was I heard a lot of them say that they simply wanted to scream with laughter: they said they just felt like bursting into peals of laughter all the time. Even when, in the more subtle parts, they didn't feel like bursting out laughing, they said they had all they could do to keep from smiling. They said they never had such a hard struggle in their lives not to smile.|$|E

Armadale's vexation on finding me resolved not to interfere expressed itself in the form of all others that is most personally offensive to me. He declined to believe my reiterated assurances that I possessed no influence to exert in his favor. 'If I was married to Neelie,' he said, 'she could do anything she liked with me; and I am sure, when you choose, you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> like with Midwinter.' If the infatuated fool had actually tried to stifle the last faint struggles of remorse and pity left stirring in my heart, he could have said nothing more fatally to the purpose than this! I gave him a look which effectually silenced him, so far as I was concerned. He went out of the room grumbling and growling to himself. 'It's all very well to talk about manning the yacht. I don't speak a word of their gibberish here; and the interpreter thinks a fisherman and a sailor means the same thing. Hang me if I {{know what to do with}} the vessel, now I have got her!' ...|$|E

Once he did her great service by changing the date on an invitation-card for a big dance which Mrs. Hauksbee wished to attend, but couldn't because she had quarrelled with the A.-D.-C., who took care, being a mean man, to invite her to a small dance on the 6th instead of the big Ball of the 26th. It was a very clever piece of forgery; and when Mrs. Hauksbee showed the A.-D.-C. her invitation-card, and chaffed him mildly for not better managing his vendettas, he really thought he had made a mistake; and--which was wise--realized that it was no use to fight with Mrs. Hauksbee. She was grateful to Tarrion and asked what she could do for him. He said simply: [...] "I'm a Freelance up here on leave, and on the lookout for what I can loot. I haven't a square inch of interest in all Simla. My name isn't known to any man with an appointment in his gift, and I want an appointment--a good, sound, pukka one.

But that's just the way it has happened. She's so undisciplined, that she couldn't get any good out of her misfortunes; she's only got harm: they've made her selfish, {{and there seems to be}} nothing left of what she was two years ago but her devotion to that miserable wretch. You mustn't let it turn you against her, Ben; you mustn't forget what she might have been. She had a rich nature; but how it's been wasted, and turned back upon itself! Poor, untrained, impulsive, innocent creature,--my heart aches for her! It's been hard to bear with her at times, terribly hard, and you'll find it so, Ben. But you must bear with her. The awfulest thing about people in trouble is that they are such bores; they tire you to death. But you'll only have to stand her praises of what Bartley was, and we had to stand them, and her hopes of what you would be if you were only at home, besides. I don't know what all she expects of you; but you must try not to disappoint her; she worships the ground you tread on, and I really think she believes you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> will, just because you're good." ...|$|E

'At {{last the}} tide flowed, {{silencing}} the plaint and {{the cries of}} pain, and the dawn was near when Brown, sitting with his chin {{in the palm of}} his hand before Patusan, as one might stare at the unscalable side of a mountain, heard the brief ringing bark of a brass 6-pounder far away in town somewhere. [...] "What's this?" [...] he asked of Cornelius, who hung about him. Cornelius listened. A muffled roaring shout rolled down-river over the town; a big drum began to throb, and others responded, pulsating and droning. Tiny scattered lights began to twinkle in the dark half of the town, while the part lighted by the loom of fires hummed with a deep and prolonged murmur. [...] "He has come," [...] said Cornelius. [...] "What? Already? Are you sure?" [...] Brown asked. [...] "Yes! yes! Sure. Listen to the noise." [...] "What are they making that row about?" [...] pursued Brown. [...] "For joy," [...] snorted Cornelius; [...] "he is a very great man, but all the same, he knows no more than a child, and so they make a great noise to please him, because they know no better." [...] "Look here," [...] said Brown, [...] "how is one to get at him?" [...] "He shall come to talk to you," [...] Cornelius declared. [...] "What do you mean? Come down here strolling as it were?" [...] Cornelius nodded vigorously in the dark. [...] "Yes. He will come straight here and talk to you. He is just like a fool. You shall see what a fool he is." [...] Brown was incredulous. [...] "You shall see; you shall see," [...] repeated Cornelius. [...] "He is not afraid--not afraid of anything. He will come and order you to leave his people alone. Everybody must leave his people alone. He is like a little child. He will come to you straight." [...] Alas! he knew Jim well--that [...] "mean little skunk," [...] as Brown called him to me. [...] "Yes, certainly," [...] he pursued with ardour, [...] "and then, captain, you tell that tall man with a gun to shoot him. Just you kill him, and you will frighten everybody so much that you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> like with them afterwards--get what you like--go away when you like. Ha! ha! ha! Fine [...] ."

60|$|As to what actual {{marriage}} is, {{one would}} like evidence instead of guesses; but as all departures from the ideal {{are regarded as}} disgraceful, evidence cannot be obtained; for when the whole community is indicted, nobody will go into the witness-box for the prosecution. Some guesses we can make with some confidence. For example, if it be objected to any change that our bachelors and widowers {{would no longer be}} Galahads, we may without extravagance or cynicism reply that many of them are not Galahads now, and that the only change would be that hypocrisy would no longer be compulsory. Indeed, this can hardly be called guessing: the evidence is in the streets. But when we attempt to find out the truth about our marriages, we cannot even guess with any confidence. Speaking for myself, I can say that I know the inside history of perhaps half a dozen marriages. Any family solicitor knows more than this; but even a family solicitor, however large his practice, knows nothing of the million households which have no solicitors, and which nevertheless make marriage what it really is. And all he can say comes to no more than I can say: to wit, that no marriage of which I have any knowledge is in the least like the ideal marriage. I do not mean that it is worse: I mean simply that it is different. Also, far from society being organized in a defence of its ideal so jealous and implacable that the least step from the straight path means exposure and ruin, it is almost impossible by any extravagance of misconduct to provoke society to relax its steady pretence of blindness, unless you do one or both of two fatal things. One is to get into the newspapers; and the other is to confess. If you confess misconduct to respectable men or women, they must either disown you or become virtually your accomplices: that is why they are so angry with you for confessing. If you get into the papers, the pretence of not knowing becomes impossible. But it is hardly too much to say that if you avoid these two perils, you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> like, as far as your neighbors are concerned. And since we can hardly flatter ourselves that this is the effect of charity, it is difficult not to suspect that our extraordinary forbearance in the matter of stone throwing is that suggested in the well-known parable of the women taken in adultery which some early free- thinker slipped into the Gospel of St John: namely, that we all live in glass houses. We may take it, then, that the ideal husband and the ideal wife are no more real human beings than the cherubim. Possibly the great majority keeps its marriage vows in the technical divorce court sense. No husband or wife yet born keeps them or ever can keep them in the ideal sense.|$|E
