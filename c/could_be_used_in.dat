5|$|As of 2009, {{graphene}} {{appears to}} be the strongest material ever tested. The process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes. If successful, graphene <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the construction of a space elevator.

5|$|Currently, curium is {{not used}} as a nuclear fuel owing to its low {{availability}} and high price. 245Cm and 247Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> portable nuclear weapons, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat. Curium-247 would be highly suitable, having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E

5|$|The Schwere Heeres Panzer Abteilung 501 (s.H.Pz.Abt. 501) {{arrived on}} the Eastern Front with only eight out of 45 tanks operational; these faults were mostly due to {{drive-train}} failures.

2500|$|IBM also {{produced}} computer terminals {{based on the}} Selectric mechanism, some of which (all models of the IBM 1050 series, and IBM 2741 models using [...] "PTTC/BCD" [...] code) used a different encoding. Though the elements were physically interchangeable, the characters were differently arranged, so that standard Selectric elements <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> them, and their elements <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> standard Selectrics. On the other hand, IBM 2741s using [...] "correspondence coding" [...] used standard office Selectric elements. [...] The IBM 1130 computer used a Selectric mechanism as the console printer.|$|R
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|After the Spartans' first {{successful}} operation, John-117 is {{briefed on the}} threat posed by the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship. In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E
5|$|Although in most {{countries}} English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. In {{the countries of the}} EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> conversation by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E

5|$|Auchinleck, now Commander-in-Chief, India, {{strongly}} opposed {{such a move}} preferring to retain the division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived 81st (West Africa) Division <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> its place. Despite his arguments {{and the end of}} the division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied Ramree Island, he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate. On 6September, the division began reorganising for long-range penetration. It had been estimated that 10 percent of the men would be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the scene}} where Ray's stolen minivan is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E
30|$|The term “mild pain” <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> Swedish {{since that}} easily <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{misunderstood}} for something positive and therefore in the Swedish version we instead {{used the term}} “just a little pain”.|$|R

5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that non-metallic vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry {{addressed}} a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates {{other than those}} normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining {{those who did not}} attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> what type of case.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.|$|E
