40|$|Two {{seats and}} a small sofa all facing forwards. The three piece suite of the {{conventionally}} designed car. A little living room. It is supplied with a stereo for playing music and a radio. More commonly now, DVD players for the occupants of the sofa. No curtains. No coffee table. Not {{much in the way}} of shelves. No room to walk around; sitting is all there is on offer. A lot of windows though, and a lot of doors. The view from the windows changes pretty much <b>constantly</b> <b>as</b> <b>does</b> where you will alight if you leave by one of the doors. It is hard to write there and conversation can be difficult when traffic noise intrudes. The neighbours are always changing, sometimes they’re teenagers, sometimes they’re families, sometimes lone men and sometimes buses. They can be nuisances at times and almost never come round for a cup of sugar. A little living room that is hardly like a living room at all. The car interior. Its chairs and windows have been a constant feature of my life as I’m sure they have been for most of us here today. Early memories of staring at the windscreen wipers creating their distinctive asymmetrical shapes on the windscreen. The clunk of car doors. The smell of vinyl seating. Teenage kicks in a rusty runaround. Near misses and accidents. Conversations about love, death and insurance. Beloved offspring kicking the backs of the seats. Old age arriving in the persistent urge to drive well below the speed limit on the motorway. So much of life is there in that second smallest room, sitting side by side, with a road ahead...|$|E
50|$|Beau Bokan formed Take the Crown {{in early}} 2004 with Tony Gonzalez. The {{original}} lineup was constantly changing and was more reminiscent of pop punk {{acts of the}} likes of Blink 182 or Pennywise {{than any of the}} bands recorded works. The early line-up, including the likes of Martine Stewart (Donnybrook, Terror), changed <b>constantly</b> <b>as</b> <b>did</b> the band's sound. During the early stages of Take the Crown, the band occasionally performed in the Los Angeles area at venues such as Skateland and The Knitting Factory. Take the Crown eventually added Nick Coffey, Ryan Wilson, James Campbell, and Aaron Birdsall to the permanent lineup and began to move in a more Post-Hardcore direction. Take the Crown quickly gained local notoriety in the Southern California music scene, playing with such acts as The Aquabats, Eighteen Visions, and performing to packed crowds at their home venue Chain Reaction.|$|R
5000|$|Active tablets: Active tablets {{differ in}} that the stylus used {{contains}} self-powered electronics that generate and transmit {{a signal to the}} tablet. These styluses rely on an internal battery rather than the tablet for their power, resulting in a bulkier stylus. Eliminating the need to power the pen means that such tablets may listen for pen signals <b>constantly,</b> <b>as</b> they <b>do</b> not have to alternate between transmit and receive modes, which can result in less jitter.|$|R
5000|$|The Yao history: The {{history of}} the Yao people, dates back to {{as far as the}} 5th century BC. There are about 63 kinds of ways the Yao people call {{themselves}} including Men, Mian, Min etc., They have been collectively known as Yao ethnicity after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. Records show that since past 2000 years, the Yao people lived in the surrounding mountains of Tibet. They moved <b>constantly</b> <b>as</b> they <b>did</b> not like the dominating Han rulers.|$|R
5000|$|Delirium, {{known to}} the Greek culture as Maniae, is the {{youngest}} of the Endless, yet still older than the rest of existence. She is usually quite short, and thin, and looks no older than a fourteen-year-old human girl. One of her eyes is silver-flecked blue, and the other is green. [...] Her hair changes style and color <b>constantly,</b> <b>as</b> <b>do</b> her clothes. Her shadow never reflects her shape, and is tangible, like velvet. She is said to smell of sweat, late nights, sour wine, and old leather. Her sigil in the galleries of the other Endless is a multicolored, abstract swirl. Her realm is a chaotic, constantly changing mass of colors and strange objects and shapes, and contains a sundial with the inscription tempus frangit (Latin for [...] "time breaks," [...] a twist on the traditional saying tempus fugit, [...] "time flees"). Delirium travels with a [...] "guardian" [...] of sorts, a dog named Barnabas, on indefinite loan from her brother Destruction. At one point Delirium briefly appears as hundreds of colorful fish.|$|R

The blues, for example, whose lyrics often {{consist of}} an {{endlessly}} suggestive stream of imaginative metaphors, {{are defined by}} circumlocutory poetic logic, as Ben Sidran makes clear in his book Black Talk: [...] "The direct statement is considered crude and unimaginative; the veiling of all contents in everchanging paraphrase is...the criterion of intelligence".|$|R

5000|$|Initially, the {{instability}} of the early Colorplexers caused many operational problems as no two Colorplexers were adjusted alike, and these had to be <b>constantly</b> [...] "tweaked", <b>as</b> <b>did</b> the video sources themselves. Eventually, Colorplexer stability improved, <b>as</b> <b>did</b> {{the stability of the}} video sources, and NTSC color would go on to provide consistently good color, and it did so until 2009, nearly 56 years, a remarkable technological achievement, as, compared with [...] "Three-Strip" [...] Technicolor, perhaps the [...] "exemplar" [...] for color motion pictures, which lasted only 19 years (from 1936 to 1955).|$|R
40|$|Europe, {{the number}} of Safer Nightlife {{projects}} managed by NGOs or by local administrations increases every year. These projects have been contributing largely {{to the evolution of}} the Risk Reduction strategies and tools and continue {{to be a source of}} creativity to enlarge partnerships and to face new issues. The spaces of intervention as well as the different types of public being reached during fieldwork as well as through the use of ICT tools, are evolving <b>constantly,</b> <b>as</b> <b>do</b> the patterns of consumptions, the substances available (Research Chemicals, Legal Highs) and the ways these substances are being purchased. Risk Reduction, Community empowerment (including peer work) and Health promotion strategies are the basis of numerous Safer Nightlife projects. There is an increasing recognition and diffusion of these strategies but various specific programmes still need to be defined and evaluated with more precision. Safer Nightlife projects often share a lack of financial resources to fully develop their programmes and to maintain a continuous evaluation process. Evaluation is necessary at many levels from proving efficiency or re-orientating programmes, to justifying fundings. Evaluation will also allow field workers to communicate about their work and to fill the gap between them and the scientific community. The research and/or evaluation topics covered by the scientific community often differ from the needs of the front line projects and the partygoers. Field workers want to share the results obtained within their projects and need to evaluate them to ensure that they are evidence based before being disseminated. The DC&DII Safer Nightlife partners have chosen to elaborate this guideline to share information, knowledge and tools to promote the evaluation of Safer Nightlife programmes, to improve the existing ones and to help new projects include these evaluation issues from the start. This guideline is linked with the Digital Library of the DC&D Safer Nightlife project (www. democitydrug. org/safernightlife) where a variety of documents, tools and reports from the DC&D partners are available on-line to illustrate and complement the topics and examples proposed in this document...|$|R
60|$|As for my poem (far below Penini's), I work on {{steadily}} {{and have}} put in order and transcribed five books, containing in all above six thousand lines ready for the press. I have another book to put together and transcribe, and then must begin the composition part {{of one or two}} more books, I suppose. I must be ready for printing by the time we go to England, in June. Robert too is much occupied with 'Sordello,'[49] and we neither of us receive anybody till past four o'clock. I mean that when you have read my new book, you put away all my other poems or most of them, and know me only by the new. Oh, I am so anxious to make it good. I have put much of myself in it--I mean to say, of my soul, my thoughts, emotions, opinions; in other respects, there is not a personal line, of course. It's a sort of poetic art-novel. If it's a failure, there will be the comfort of having made a worthy effort, of having <b>done</b> it <b>as</b> well as I could. Write soon to me, and love us both <b>constantly,</b> <b>as</b> we <b>do</b> you.|$|R
60|$|The {{reason of}} this is quite obvious in some cases; the male hybrids, {{although}} possessing all the external appearances and characteristics of perfect animals, are physiologically imperfect and deficient in the structural parts of the reproductive elements necessary to generation. It {{is said to be}} invariably the case with the male mule, the cross between the Ass and the Mare; and hence it is, that, although crossing the Horse with the Ass is easy enough, and is <b>constantly</b> <b>done,</b> <b>as</b> far as I am aware, if you take two mules, a male and a female, and endeavour to breed from them, you get no offspring whatever; no generation will take place. This is what is called the sterility of the hybrids between two distinct species.|$|R

60|$|And I will say, here, that I {{would rather}} travel with an {{excursion}} party of Methuselahs than {{have to be}} changing ships and comrades <b>constantly,</b> <b>as</b> people <b>do</b> who travel in the ordinary way. Those latter are always grieving over some other ship they have known and lost, and over other comrades whom diverging routes have separated from them. They learn to love a ship {{just in time to}} change it for another, and they become attached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him. They have that most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel, among strange people who care nothing about them, and of undergoing the customary bullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange servants, repeated over and over again within the compass of every month. They have also that other misery of packing and unpacking trunks--of running the distressing gauntlet of custom-houses--of the anxieties attendant upon getting a mass of baggage from point to point on land in safety. I had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs than suffer so. We never packed our trunks but twice--when we sailed from New York, and when we returned to it. Whenever we made a land journey, we estimated how many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing we should need, figured it down to a mathematical nicety, packed a valise or two accordingly, and left the trunks on board. We chose our comrades from among our old, tried friends, and started. We were never dependent upon strangers for companionship. We often had occasion to pity Americans whom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no friends to exchange pains and pleasures with. Whenever we were coming back from a land journey, our eyes sought one thing in the distance first--the ship --and when we saw it riding at anchor with the flag apeak, we felt as a returning wanderer feels when he sees his home. When we stepped on board, our cares vanished, our troubles were at an end--for the ship was home to us. We always had the same familiar old state-room to go to, and feel safe and at peace and comfortable again.|$|R

6000|$|For this idle {{story the}} poor woman {{actually}} suffered death. Yet, notwithstanding the fervent arguments thus liberally {{used by the}} orthodox, the common people, though they dreaded even to think or speak about the Fairies, by no means unanimously acquiesced in the doctrine, which consigned them to eternal perdition. The inhabitants of the Isle of Man call them the [...] "good people, and say they live in wilds, and forests, and on mountains, and shun great cities, because of the wickedness acted therein: all the houses are blessed where they visit, for they fly vice. A person would be thought impudently prophane who should suffer his family to go to bed, without having first set a tub, or pail, full of clean water, for those guests to bathe themselves in, which the natives aver they <b>constantly</b> <b>do,</b> <b>as</b> soon as ever {{the eyes of the}} family are closed, wherever they vouchsafe to come."--WALDREN's Works, p. 126. There are some curious, and perhaps anomalous facts, concerning the history of Fairies, in a sort of Cock-lane narrative, contained in a letter from Moses Pitt, to Dr Edward Fowler, Lord Bishop of Gloucester, printed at London in 1696, and preserved in Morgan's Phoenix Britannicus, 4to, London 1732.|$|R
