40|$|Background/purpose: Automatic {{quantitative}} {{characterization of}} border irregularity generating useful descriptors {{is a highly}} important task for computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. This paper proposes a novel approach to describe the border irregularity of melanomas aiming at achieving higher recognition rates. Methods: By introducing a boundary characteristic description, which we call a <b>centroid</b> <b>distance</b> diagram (CDD), a compact-supported mapping, called the <b>centroid</b> <b>distance</b> curve, can be extracted from this diagram. The <b>centroid</b> <b>distance</b> curve establishes the projection from angular orientations to {{the sum of the}} lengths of those line segments connecting the lesion centroid and border points. Border irregularity descriptors generated from CDDs include the non-centroid-convexity index, the maximum–minimum distance indicator, the standard deviation of <b>centroid</b> <b>distance</b> curves and the maximum magnitude of non-zero frequency elements of <b>centroid</b> <b>distance</b> curves after discrete Fourier transforms. Upper limits of the error boundaries involved in these descriptors are estimated. Results: Experimental studies are based on 60 melanoma and 107 benign lesion images collected from local pigmented lesion clinics. By applying the proposed descriptors, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are constructed by projecting the features into a linear space learned from samples. The optimal sensitivity and specificity for the proposed method are 74. 2...|$|E

In this paper, the use of <b>centroid</b> <b>distance</b> Fourier descriptors as hand shape descriptor in sign language recognition from visually captured hand gesture is considered. The sign language adopts the American Sign Language finger spelling. Only static gestures in the sign language are used. To obtain hand images, depth imager is used in this research. Hand image is extracted from depth image by applying threshold operation. <b>Centroid</b> <b>distance</b> signature is constructed from the segmented hand contours as a shape signature.

The fourier descriptors of hand gesture are then compared with the gesture dictionary to perform gesture recognition. The performance of the gesture recognition using different distance metrics as classifiers is investigated.
