(ii) Rainfalls between areas were compared within the same <b>climatic</b> <b>type,</b> one area forested and the other without natural vegetation. The annual rainfall trends were spatially distinct between the valley floor and the adjoining highlands (Muluneh et al. 2017), so the relationship between forest depletion and rainfall pattern were determined separately for the valley floor and the escarpments/highlands.|$|E
40|$|The {{region of}} Southeast Srem {{is rich in}} ground waters, which is of great {{significance}} to agricultural production. The objective {{of this paper was}} to designate the zones of different groundwater types from the aspect of recharge, based on the analysis of groundwater regimes in the study area. A very complex groundwater regime in Southeast Srem, which depends on a great number of natural and some anthropogenic factors, makes it difficult to designate clearly the zones of the three main types of groundwater regime. Still, the boundaries of the zones of groundwater regime types were defined {{based on the results of}} correlation analysis of the basic factors affecting the groundwater regime. Zone I includes the <b>climatic</b> <b>type</b> of groundwater. Its fluctuation corresponds to the vertical factors of water balance (precipitation and evaporation) and it is not affected by the river water level. This zone extends North and East of the line Putinci, Golubinci, Stara Pazova, Batajnica, Dobanovci, mainly in the area of the loess plateau. Within the zone, groundwater is at a relatively great depth. Only exceptionally, in the valleys, it appears almost on the surface. Zone II includes the climatic-hydrological groundwater type, which is the transition between the <b>climatic</b> <b>type</b> and the hydrological type. The fluctuation of groundwater regime is affected both by the effect of vertical balance factors, and by the effect of watercourses. Climatic-hydrological groundwater type covers the central and the lowest part of the study area and the South part of the middle terrace. Zone III is classified as the hydrological groundwater type and it covers the riparian areas along the Sava and the Danube. The aquifer is hydraulically connected with the river Sava...|$|E

Due to just three months being above [...] in mean temperatures and winter lows being so mild, climate classification of the islands is difficult and therefore both subarctic and humid continental could be applied in the absence of alternatives.|$|R
40|$|Climatic classifications {{systems are}} {{important}} to analyze and define the <b>climatic</b> <b>types</b> of regions. The Koppen-Geiger and Thornthwaite system are widely applied on different topics related to climate research and climate change. The first is based on seasonal and annual and monthly average values of air temperature and precipitation, but is very laborious and complex. On the other hand, the second is based on concepts of potential evapotranspiration by water balance, but presents problems for classifying regions of polar and cold climates. The use of geographic information systems (GIS) {{for the study of}} complex situations has shown effective results especially in the modeling of climate prediction. In this context, the objective {{of this study was to}} compare the climatic classification of Thornthwaite with the Koppen-Geiger both applied to the boundaries of Brazil using GIS in order to observe the correlation between climate classes for the two systems. The evaluation of comparing the two climatic classifications were developed through the use of two maps representing each of the systems of climatic classification, through the process of overlapping and intersecting verifying the occurrence between the two classes of systems by developing a matrix of confusion. The overlap of the two maps showed that, even though both are generated by different methodologies, showed consistency in the representation of <b>climatic</b> <b>types</b> in a region, and the arid and semi-arid climate classes showed the most significant.

40|$|Urbanization, by {{creating}} extended impervious areas, {{to the detriment}} of vegetated ones, may have an undesirable influence on the water and energy balances of urban environments. The storage and infiltration capacity of the drainage system lessens the negative influence of urbanization, and vegetated areas help to re-establish pre-development environmental conditions. Resource limitation, climate, leading to increasing water scarcity, demographic and socio-institutional shifts promote more integrated water management. Storm-water harvesting for landscape irrigation mitigates possible water restrictions for the urban population in drought scenarios. A new probabilistic model for sustainable rainfall drainage, storage and re-use systems was implemented in this study. Risk analysis of multipurpose storage capacities was generalized by the use of only a few dimensionless parameters and applied to a case study in a Mediterranean-type climate, although the applicability of the model is not restricted to any particular <b>climatic</b> <b>type...</b>|$|E

The seeds of these strains were collected and their contents of mannose and galactose were analyzed. Mannose contents in the seeds were variable in the range between the highest 10. 351 mg/g (Ganghwa) and the lowest 5. 962 mg/g (Yeongyang).

40|$|The {{following}} the average and extreme values of climatic elements, specific climatic indices and field research, we can select three climatic types in Kosovo and Metohija - the altered Mediterranean, continental and mountainous type.

It affects parts of northern Metohija, Drenica and the entire Kosovo valley along with smaller sidelong dells - Malo Kosovo and Kosovsko Pomoravlje. Because of their exquisite heights, the mountains that complete the Kosovo Metohija Valley have a specific <b>climatic</b> <b>type,</b> at their lower slopes it is sub - mountainous and at the higher ones it is typically mountainous.
