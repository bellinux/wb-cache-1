40|$|Objective(s) To {{determine}} the potential toxic effects of manual soldering flux <b>cored</b> <b>solder</b> wire on lung {{of the rat}} as an experimental model. Materials and MethodsA total number of 48 adult male rats were divided into experimental (n= 30) and control (n= 18) groups. Based on exposure time to solder fume, each group was further subdivided into 2, 4 and 6 week subgroups. Rats of experimental groups were exposed to fume in exposure chamber for 1 hour/day (Research Center of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, 12 Apr 2005 to 14 May 2005). The amount of fumes were measured daily by standard methods. At the end of experiment, lung specimens were collected from each experimental and control subgroups. Tissue samples were processed routinely and thickness of epithelium in bronchioles and interalveolar septas were measured in stained microscopic slides. Obtained data were analyzed by SPSS. ResultsStatistical analysis of data for thickness of epithelium in bronchioles showed {{that there was only}} a significant difference between 4 week experimental and control subgroups (P< 0. 001). Analysis of data for thickness of interalveolar septa showed statistically significant differences between experimental and control subgroups of 4 and 6 weeks (P< 0. 001). Histological examination was also revealed an inflammatory process in bronchioles and disorganized architecture in alveoli of lung in experimental subgroups. ConclusionThe result showed that solder fume can change the normal architectures of epithelium in bronchioles and alveoli of the lung and it seems that the severities of changes were dependent on the exposure time...|$|E

40|$|A {{very compact}} and rugged 2. 5 -D {{integrated}} data logger {{has been built}} and tested. The data logger is capable of measuring accelerations exceeding 70 000 g. Microcontroller and flash memory as bare dies have been mounted onto a silicon interposer with through silicon vias using anisotropic conductive film and Au stud bump bonding. A microelectromechanical system accelerometer is mounted onto the interposer, using a robust customized flip-chip mounting approach. The interposer is mounted into a 16 -pin leadless chip carrier package using isotropic conductive adhesive, where the conductive part is made of metallized polymer spheres. The ceramic package was mounted onto an application printed circuit board (PCB) with filters, power management, and an interface contact, using <b>soldered</b> plastic <b>core</b> <b>solder</b> balls (PCSBs). The diameter of the data logger is less than 9 mm, and the height is approximately 5 mm. The data logger fits within 12. 7 -mm (0. 50 cal.) projectile, and acceleration measurements have been performed during firing, flight, and recovery. The measured accelerations have been verified by comparing the calculated projectile muzzle velocities with Doppler radar measurements...|$|R
40|$|Hand <b>soldering</b> using rosin <b>core</b> <b>solder</b> wire {{is common}} in the {{electronics}} industry and several studies have implicated the aerosol produced when rosin flux is heated in causing respiratory sensitisation. Control of solder fume is generally achieved using local exhaust hoods, simple blowers with a filter or low-volume high-velocity (LVHV) ventilation systems. None of these provide an ideal control system and so a push-pull ventilation design was developed as an alternative. Laboratory tests of the system's capture efficiency were carried out using nitrous oxide tracer gas. Capture efficiency was generally greater than 90 % with the push airflow operating. However, without the push airflow, capture efficiency decreased sharply with increasing distance from the exhaust hood (between 38 and 58 % at 420 mm {{from the front of}} the exhaust hood with the same exhaust airflow used by the push-pull system). The push-pull system was found to be relatively insensitive to obstructions placed in the path of the air flow or the influence of cross draughts. The system was tested in five electronics factories and the effectiveness was compared to their existing ventilation systems. Where only a small amount of soldering was carried out both the in-house and push-pull systems seemed to provide adequate control of inhalatio...|$|R
40|$|The cryoEDM neutron {{electric}} dipole moment experiment requires a SQUID magnetometry system with pick-up loops inside a magnetically shielded volume connected to SQUID sensors by long (up to 2 m) twisted-wire pairs (TWPs). These wires run outside the main shield, and therefore must run through superconducting capillaries to screen unwanted magnetic pick-up. We show that the average measured transverse magnetic pick-up {{of a set of}} lengths of TWPs is equivalent to a loop area of 5. 0 × 10 - 6 m 2 /m, or 14 twists per metre. From this we set the requirement that the magnetic shielding factor of the superconducting capillaries used in the cryoEDM system must be greater than 8. 0 × 104. The shielding factor - the ratio of the signal picked-up by an unshielded TWP to that induced in a shielded TWP - was measured for a selection of superconducting capillaries made from solder wire. We conclude the transverse shielding factor of a uniform capillary is greater than 107. The measured pick-up was equal to, or less than that due to direct coupling to the SQUID sensor (measured without any TWP attached). We show that discontinuities in the capillaries substantially impair the magnetic shielding, yet if suitably repaired, this can be restored to the shielding factor of an unbroken capillary. We have constructed shielding assemblies for cryoEDM made from lengths of single core and triple <b>core</b> <b>solder</b> capillaries, joined by a shielded Pb cylinder, incorporating a heater to heat the wires above the superconducting transition as required. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract Low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) based system-in-package (SiP) is an {{emerging}} multilayer module technology for wireless communication applications, mainly {{due to its}} excellent high-frequency material properties. LTCC-SiP modules are typically soldered onto an organic motherboard, but the lifetime of the 2 nd-level solder joints is often poor due to the high stress level of the joints in test/field conditions. Moreover, using lead-free solders in the interconnections of LTCC modules raised new questions about the feasibility and reliability of the solder joints in LTCC applications. Therefore, the characteristic features of the 2 nd-level solder joint configuration were determined in this thesis work. It was proved that collapsible Sn 4 Ag 0. 5 Cu spheres are not a feasible option in LTCC/PWB assemblies with a large global thermal mismatch; a non-collapsible ball grid array (BGA) joint with a plastic <b>core</b> <b>solder</b> balls (PCSBs) was required to attain an adequate lifetime for such assemblies. To enhance the thermal fatigue endurance of the non-collapsible lead-free joints, a novel BGA joint consisting of Sn 7 In 4. 1 Ag 0. 5 Cu solder and PCSBs was developed. Moreover, this work proved {{that there is a}} relationship between the primary failure mechanisms of various Sn-based lead-free solders and thermomechanically induced stress level in the present non-collapsible BGA joint configuration. The effect of the plating material of the solder lands on the failure mechanism of the BGA joints in the LTCC/PWB assemblies was studied. The results showed that the adverse phenomena related to the sintered Ag-based metallization materials can be avoided using electroless nickel with immersion gold (ENIG) as a deposit material. On the other hand, this study also demonstrated that the inadequate adhesion strength of the commercial base metallization in the ENIG-plated modules resulted in the disadvantageous failure mechanism of the test assemblies. Therefore, the criteria for material selection and the design aspects of reliable 2 nd-level interconnections are discussed thoroughly in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Samples {{from the}} In-Space Soldering Investigation (ISSI), {{conducted}} aboard the International Space Station (ISS), are being examined for post-solidification microstructural development and porosity distribution. In this preliminary study, the internal structures of two ISSI processed samples are compared. In one case 10 cm of rosin-core solder was {{wrapped around a}} coupon wire and melted by conduction, whereas, in the other a comparable length of solder was melted directly onto the hot wire; {{in both cases the}} molten solder formed ellipsoidal blobs, a shape that was maintained during subsequent solidification. In the former case, there is clear evidence of porosity throughout the sample, and an accumulation of larger pores near the hot end that implies thermocapillary induced migration and eventual coalescence of the flux vapor bubbles. In the second context, when solder was fed onto the wire. a part of the flux constituting the <b>solder</b> <b>core</b> is introduced into and remains within the liquid solder ball, becoming entombed upon solidification. In both cases the consequential porosity, particularly at a solder/contact interface, is very undesirable. In addition to compromising the desired electrical and thermal conductivity, it promotes mechanical failure...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{substrate}} is {{a composite}} panel consists of several materials such as BT <b>core,</b> copper, dielectric, <b>solder</b> resist and plugging material. As different material has different material property, when the organic substrate is exposed to thermal excursion in the manufacturing process, the substrate warps. In this project, both experimental and simulation study were carried out {{in order to have}} a better understanding on the substrate warpage behaviour during the solder reflow process. In the experimental analysis, substrate warpage throughout the solder reflow process was measured by using shadow moirÃ©. Besides that, the thermally induced warpage due to the temperature rise was obtained by subtracting the measured warpage from the initial warpage. Finite element analysis was performed to predict the thermally induced warpage during the solder reflow process. Both results from the experiment and simulation were compared in order to validate the finite element models. A parametric study of the impact of design parameters and material properties on substrate warpage during the solder reflow process was performed. A total of 6 parameters have been investigated including material properties, copper volume, copper distribution, plated through hole (PTH) number, PTH array and substrate thickness. The results of these analyses have produced general guidelines which can be refer when designing the substrate and also selecting the substrate materials. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a bump for flip chip assembly, said bump {{consisting of a}} core with a high amount of soft, electrically highly conductive metal, in particular gold, and a diffusion barrier layer deposited on the bump core. The diffusion carrier layer serves, as is well-known, to prevent intermetallic compounds between the gold of the bump <b>core</b> and the <b>solder</b> material, in particular tin-lead solder, since the latter would otherwise reduce the mechanical stability of the solder joint. To ensure that the diffusion barrier layer, mostly of nickel, adheres well to the bump core, a pretreatment was previously required either using a cleaning solution or involving placement in a nucleation bath. This pretreatment process step is no longer required according to the invention, since a material is added in small amounts to the bump core, said material acting as a nucleation material for the diffusion barrer layer. Such bump cores are, for example, very simple to produce mechanically at l ow-cost as ball bumps (consisting of about 98 % gold and 2 % palladium). The invention permits the production of flip chip bonds using gold bumps with high throughput for industrial purposes. The bumps according to the invention based on gold ball bumps as bump cores rqeuire less space and open up, for example, new fields of application {{in the production of}} miniature components, for example in microsurger...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of silver chain {{is a high}} volume business. Traditionally Silver chain is produced using two methods of production. In the USA a solid wire with a <b>solder</b> <b>core</b> is used. In this process a large billet is cast and then drilled down its centre. A solder is then melted into the centre hole before the billet is reduced by rolling and drawing to the final size required for the chain. After the links of the chain have been formed it is passed through a furnace to melt the <b>solder</b> in the <b>core,</b> which then flows out and joins the links. A method called “powder packing” is used in most other jewellery production centres in the world. In this method a solid wire is first drawn and then formed on a chain-making machine. To join the chain a zinc powder is packed between each link and the complete chain is then passed through a furnace. Both of the standard production methods for silver chain are time consuming and expensive for different reasons. Gold chain by contrast is generally joined using lasers. The lasers are mounted directly on the chain-making machine and as each link is formed, the laser fires a single shot to the join link. Up to four hundred links a minute can be joined and when the chain leaves the chain-making machine, no further work is required. Standard sterling silver because of high conductivity and reflectivity has not proved to be suitable for laser joining. It does not produce welds with sufficient strength. EP 1699581 describes a method of making chain more efficiently with silver copper germanium alloys, using a laser to join the links. Silver is the most conductive of all metals {{and this is one}} reason it is difficult to weld. The addition of germanium to sterling silver increases the thermal and heat resistivity of the alloy. A resistive alloy traps the energy and welds more efficiently. Steel {{is a good example of}} a resistive metal that welds easily The infrared spectrum of the germanium also aids the laser light to couple with the silver. Sterling silver normally will reflect the majority of the laser power away from its surface...|$|R
