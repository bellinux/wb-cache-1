5000|$|The Dortmund freight bypass railway (Güterumgehungsbahn Dortmund) is {{a railway}} {{line in the}} north of the city of Dortmund in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

50|$|After the Second World War, class 65 steam {{locomotive}} were used on almost all trains. They were used because their technical characteristics (tensile strength) was very {{suitable for the}} Odenwald line. Passengers trains were mostly composed of three-axle carriages rebuilt from compartmentised <b>carriages.</b> <b>Freight</b> trains were often hauled by class 50 locomotives; in some cases freight traffic was carried between Hanau and Wiebelbach in railbus sets. All locomotives were based in Darmstadt. In 1970, steam operations ended on the Odenwald line and train services were hauled by diesel locomotives of class 212. At {{the beginning of the}} 1990s, class 628 diesel multiple units were increasingly operated on the line, while the remaining locomotive-hauled trains, which had been hauled by class 212 diesel locomotives, was gradually replaced by class 216 hauled trains. In the late nineties, these were replaced first by class 215 locomotives, which after a short time were transferred to other regions, and then by class 218 locomotives. The locomotive-hauled trains often ran as push-pull trains.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of growing}} {{competition}} from road transport for freight, profitability fell {{significantly in the}} 1960s, so that the dual gauge freight line between Heidelberg and Schriesheim was closed in 1970 and in 1971 the <b>carriage</b> of <b>freight</b> was abandoned. An exception was the annual sugar beet harvest, which was transported using Rollbocks, which operated until 1983. Otherwise, the OEG operated freight traffic until the early 1990s using road transport.|$|R
50|$|On 29 March 1847 the RCG {{entered into}} a {{contract}} with the CME to connect the lines of both companies and for the transport of passenger <b>carriages</b> and <b>freight</b> wagons across the Rhine. In May 1847, the RCG began construction of its line from Viersen via Krefeld to Homberg, which was opened on 15 October 1849. The CME completed its branch line from Oberhausen to Ruhrort on 14 October 1848.|$|R
