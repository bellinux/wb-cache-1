40|$|Within EU {{marketing}} <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> {{of human}} and veterinary medicinal products (HMP and VMP), an environmental risk assessment (ERA) has to be performed. In the event that an unacceptable environmental risk is identified, risk mitigation measures (RMM) shall be applied {{in order to reduce}} environmental exposure to the pharmaceutical. Within the <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> of HMP, no RMM have been applied so far, except for specific precautions for the disposal of the unused medicinal product or waste materials. For VMP, a limited number of RMM do exist. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop consistent and efficient RMM. Therefore, existing RMM were compiled from a summary of product characteristics of authorized pharmaceuticals, and new RMM were developed and evaluated. Based on the results, appropriate RMM were applied within the <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> of medicinal products. For HMP, except for the existing precautions for disposal, no further reasonable measures could be developed. For VMP, two specific precautions for disposal and 17 specific precautions for use in animals were proposed as RMM...|$|R

40|$|A {{programmable}} authorization {{mechanism for}} an engineering document database is described. The database stores documents and their versions {{in a commercial}} relational database. Documents and other objects contain user-defined attributes. Release and approval procedures of the documents are described by means of state graphs that specify the possible states of a document and the transitions between them. The system consists of centralized server and client programs, which communicate with the server using a specific protocol. The database administrator {{must be able to}} formulate rules that tell who is allowed to do particular database operations; rules that tell which operations are allowed in particular document states; and rules that describe consistency invariants between attributes. These rules are expressed by means of <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> written in a special language. Whenever the server receives an operation request, it executes the corresponding <b>authorization</b> <b>procedure.</b> The s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Problems in {{organizational}} authorization result in productivity impacts and in security risks, for example, from over-entitlements and non-compliance. Many {{of the problems}} originate from organizational dynamics in combination with problematic <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> for permission changes. To mitigate these problems and to improve the processes or craft supporting tools, a solid understanding of the processes and interactions between stakeholders is required. However, little prior empirical research covers <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper presents an exploratory study of the procedures {{in organizational}} contexts. To enable a systematic analysis, an authorization process model is introduced {{that focuses on the}} interrelation of stakeholders and activities. The study discusses process characteristics, including the degree of centralization and the formality of interactions. Beyond this study, the model should serve as a basis for further research and support process designers to identify potentials of improvements.

40|$|The {{centralized}} <b>authorization</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is governed}} by Regulation (EC) no. 726 / 2004 of the European Parliament and the European Council laying down <b>Community</b> <b>procedures</b> for the <b>authorization</b> and supervision of medicinal products (pharmaceuticals and immunological). The centralised procedure allows applicants to obtain a marketing authorisation that is valid throughout the EU. It is compulsory for medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes, for orphan medicinal products and for human products containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the Community before 20 May 2004 and which are intended {{for the treatment of}} AIDS, cancer,neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes. The centralized procedure is also mandatory for veterinary medicinal products intended primarily for use as performance enhancers in order to promote growth of treated animals or to increase yields from treated animals. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the Community before 20 May 2004 or for products which constitute a significant therapeutic,scientific or technical innovation or for which a <b>Community</b> <b>authorization</b> is in the interests of patients or animalhealth at Community level. When a company wishes to place on the market a medicinal product that is eligible for the centralizedprocedure, it sends an application directly to the European Medicines Agency, to be assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) or the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP). The procedure results in a Commission decision, which is binding on all EU Member States, to authorise the product...|$|R

30|$|This {{might in}} fact be true {{in the case of}} a formal {{administrative}} <b>authorization</b> <b>procedure</b> that has to conform to certain legal constraints. Another definition of citizenship should, however, be possible in the context of technology assessment as policy consultation.

In this case, the rationality of political decision making should be more comprehensive than scientific risk assessment.|$|R

This asks regulatory authorities to consider these monitoring data while re-evaluating pesticide approval and setting appropriate risk mitigation measures. During the years 2005 – 2012, the cantons in Switzerland performed 345, 000 pesticide measurements in surface waters. Overall, 203 approved pesticides were examined. For 60 of these substances, regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) were published, which were determined from ecotoxicological data {{in accordance with}} international test methods {{within the framework of}} the <b>authorization</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|R
