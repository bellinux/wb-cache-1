40|$|Prior {{technology}} for machinery data acquisition used slip <b>rings,</b> FM radio <b>communication,</b> or non-real-time <b>digital</b> <b>communication.</b> Slip <b>rings</b> are often noisy, require much space {{that may not}} be available, and require access to the shaft, which may not be possible. FM radio is not accurate or stable, and is limited in the number of channels, often with channel crosstalk, and intermittent as the shaft rotates. Non-real-time <b>digital</b> <b>communication</b> is very popular, but complex, with long development time, and objections from users who need continuous waveforms from many channels. This innovation extends the amount of information conveyed from a rotating machine to a data acquisition system while keeping the development time short and keeping the rotating electronics simple, compact, stable, and rugged. The data are all real time. The product of the number of channels, times the bit resolution, times the update rate, gives a data rate higher than available by older methods. The telemetry system consists of a data-receiving rack that supplies magnetically coupled power to a rotating instrument amplifier ring in the machine being monitored. The ring digitizes the data and magnetically couples the data back to the rack, where it is made available. The transformer is generally a ring positioned around the axis of rotation with one side of the transformer free to rotate and the other side held stationary. The windings are laid in the ring; this gives the data immunity to any rotation that may occur. A medium-frequency sine-wave power source in a rack supplies power through a cable to a rotating ring transformer that passes the power on to a rotating set of electronics. The electronics power a set of up to 40 sensors and provides instrument amplifiers for the sensors. The outputs from the amplifiers are filtered and multiplexed into a serial ADC. The output from the ADC is connected to another rotating ring transformer that conveys the serial data from the rotating section to the stationary section. From there, a cable conveys the serial data to the remote rack, where it is reconditioned to logic level specifications, de-serialized, and converted back to analog. In the rotating electronics are code generators to indicate the beginning of files for data synchronization...|$|R

After quickly revising the main paradigms of mass communication studies, the paper deals with the main issues of a new research field: the study of <b>digital</b> <b>communication</b> processes. When describing the transformations that the appearance of digital technology has generated in communication processes, we follow a classic outline of production/product/consumption. We analyse the new ways of producing communication, the characteristics of <b>digital</b> <b>communication</b> products and the consumption processes that they activate. Finally, we analyse the fields of knowledge that are fundamental for constructing a Theory of <b>Digital</b> <b>Communication</b> (TDC). The paper concludes with a research agenda of the main issues that a Theory of <b>Digital</b> <b>Communication</b> should resolve, from defining the study aims and the most pertinent methodologies up to constructing a map with the closest fields o...|$|R
