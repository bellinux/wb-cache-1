40|$|This paper {{presents}} quantitative {{evidence for}} <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> (frost redeposition) at the Viking Lander 2 site. This evidence {{consists of the}} frost surface coverage and color transition, {{the timing of this}} transition, and the limited vertical mixing and horizontal water transport.

40|$|A {{new model}} for the basal {{pressure}} of Io's atmosphere is developed. This model {{takes into account the}} previously ignored fact that much of Io's surface has very high porosity, typically about 90 pct. Such porosity allows efficient subsurface <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> of atmospheric gases which tends to keep ambient surface pressures very low. SO 2 is the only gas identified on Io, and the basal pressures for atmospheric models are usually pegged to local surface temperature via the SO 2 vapor pressure equilibrium curve. Near Io's subsolar point the pressure in equilibrium with a surface SO 2 frost deposit is about 1 / 10, 000, 000 th bar. Porous surface models of the type developed invoke equilibrium with the colder, subsurface permafrost (at about 3 -cm depth) and yield pressures of about 1 / 10 to the 12 th bar. The subsurface <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> model explains many but not all observations relevant to Io's atmosphere. The new subsurface <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> model and the earlier surface frost equilibrium model, when taken together, provide lower and upper limits, respectively, on the basal SO 2 pressure of Io's atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 A <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> is {{a device}} used to remove certain {{impurities}} from a liquid metal by controlled precipitation of such impurities. An {{investigation of the}} thermal characteristics of laminar flow in two air-cooled <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> was made. This investigation showed that the sodium heat transfer rate {{is a function of}} the Peclet number. Generally accepted methods of calculating heat transfer to air produce satisfactory results when used to predict <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> heat rejection rates. A computer code for mathematical simulation of <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> performance was written and tested. Simulation of <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> operation was excellent, but prediction of economizer performance was disappointing. The bases f o r constant trapping temperature and constant impurity removal trapping rates were developed. The constant impurity removal trapping rate, a linear function, is used most often in <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> operation...|$|R
50|$|Care {{should be}} taken when using a <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> not to {{condense}} liquid oxygen (a light blue liquid) into the <b>cold</b> <b>trap.</b> Liquid oxygen is potentially explosive, and {{this is especially true}} if the trap has been used to trap solvent. Liquid oxygen can be condensed into a <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> if a pump has sucked air through the trap when the <b>trap</b> is very <b>cold,</b> e.g. when cooled with liquid nitrogen.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>traps</b> {{are some}} of the {{important}} places on the lunar south pole in terms of possible water and iced deposits. <b>Cold</b> <b>traps</b> can contain water and ice that were originally from comets, meteorites and solar wind induced iron reduction. From experiments and sample readings scientists were able to confirm that <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> do contain ice. Hydroxyl has also been found in these <b>cold</b> <b>traps.</b> The discovery of these two compounds has led to the founding of missions focusing primarily on the lunar poles using global scale infrared detection. The ice stays in these traps only because of the thermal behavior of the moon. These thermal behaviors are controlled by thermophysical properties, scattered sunlight, thermal re-radiation, internal heat and light given off by the earth. With the cold temperatures in the <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> delivering ice could be a possibility in the near future, since it would not melt.|$|R
40|$|The paper Is {{dealing with}} the design and {{evaluation}} of a simple versatile system for sample introduction In capillary GC columns, with internal diameters below 100 mum. The system is principally based upon <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> and successive high speed thermal desorption (2 ̆ 6 gt; 4000 degrees C/s) of the trapped components. The system can be applied for complex samples {{with a wide range}} of concentrations, volatilities and polarities of the analytes as is illustrated by various applications...|$|E
30|$|However, solid samples do {{not have}} direct {{pathways}} down to a cold trap which can have a temperature as much as 150 K less than the actively sublimating surface. Thus, <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> of HDO is an attractive possibility for producing an overabundance of the light isotope in the headspace gas. In light of the large temperature gradients {{that exist in the}} samples under consideration and the corresponding high fractionating factors predicted by the kinetic isotope effect, this mechanism for enriching the headspace gas in the light isotope must be examined.|$|E
40|$|The present {{modification}} of the Ingersoll et al. (1985) hydrodynamic model of the SO 2 gas sublimation-driven flow from the day to the night side of Io includes the effects of nonuniform surface properties noted in observational studies. Calculations are conducted for atmospheric pressures, horizontal winds, sublimation rates, and condensation rates for such surface conditions as patchy and continuous frost cover, volcanic venting, surface temperature discontinuities, subsurface <b>cold</b> <b>trapping,</b> and the propagation of insolation into the frost. While pressure is found to follow local vapor pressure away from the plumes, it becomes higher inside them...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} acting at the <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> that {{can alter the}} inventory of volatiles there. Primarily, the lunar surface is bombarded by meteoroids which impact, melt, process, and redistribute the regolith. Further, solar wind and magnetospheric ion fluxes are allowed limited access onto the regions in permanent shadow. Also, although <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> are in the permanent shadow of the Sun, {{there is a small}} flux of radiation incident on the regions from interstellar sources. We investigate the effects of these space weathering processes on a deposit of volatiles in a lunar <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> through simulations. We simulate the development of a column of material near the surface of the Moon resulting from space weathering. This simulation treats a column of material at a lunar <b>cold</b> <b>trap</b> and focuses on the hydrogen content of the column. We model space weathering processes on several time and spatial scales to simulate the constant rain of micrometeoroids as well as sporadic larger impactors occurring near the <b>cold</b> <b>traps</b> to determine the retention efficiency of the <b>cold</b> <b>traps.</b> We perform the Monte Carlo simulation over many columns of material to determine the expectation value for hydrogen content of the top few meters of soil for comparison with Lunar Prospector neutron data...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{emphasis}} on energy management has helped sites reduce system cost through {{the diagnosis and}} repair of ?Leaking? or ?Blowing? steam traps (?Leakage Failures?). Timely maintenance response is a significant action to lower energy use and GHG emissions generated by steam production. But, what action should be taken with <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps?</b> In every steam trap survey to determine the steam trap population?s current state of health, there are usually {{a significant amount of}} steam traps determined to be ?Cold? or ?Low Temp? (?Drainage Failures? or ?<b>Cold</b> <b>Traps?).</b> It seems that site personnel commonly assign a lower response priority to these Drainage Failures traps, and sometimes actually implement a practice to intentionally convert Leaking <b>traps</b> into <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> by closing the inlet stop valve to immediately stop energy leakage. Subsequently, they may label those traps as ?Valved- Out? or ?Out of Service,? but those trap stations were originally designed as needed to drain retained condensate from the system. So, the correct designation for such a <b>trap</b> station is ?<b>Cold,?</b> regardless of the current intention. If the trap station does not drain condensate and is not hot, it is ?Cold. ? It can be astounding that many sites are not convinced of what actions or priority to take to repair <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps,</b> even while intrinsically understanding that {{there is something wrong with}} having <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> that cannot drain condensate from a steam system. It often is simply because sites may not be fully aware of the potential dangers of uncorrected <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> or the significant safety, reliability, and energy benefits of addressing them. Although safety is always the main priority, it cannot be overstated that there are huge reliability and energy benefits to prioritized repair of <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps.</b> Unfortunately, proactive response to repair <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> in a steam system is not always achieved, often because the real benefits of such a response are not understood. Therefore, further review of ?WHAT TO DO ABOUT COLD TRAPS?AND WHY?? is warranted for safe, reliable, and energy-efficient management of the condensate discharge locations (CDLs). Several tables are provided to help sites valuate the cost impact of <b>Cold</b> <b>Traps</b> in their steam systems by using readily available historical data...|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods for}} tritium {{recovery}} from liquid lithium, Li-Pb eutectic alloy, aqueous salt solution or fluoride salt (Flibe) of the breeding materials of a fusion reactor were comparatively investigated based on engineering designs. The methods of a permeation window, an yttrium particle bed and molten salt extraction were promising for liquid lithium. The methods of a permeation window, counter-current extraction in a packed bed and <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> in a Na or NaK loop were hopeful for tritium recovery from Li 17 Pb 83 eutectic.

The FSP-PTC provides a test circuit for the development of fission surface power technology. This system operates at temperatures that would be similar to those found in a reactor (500 - 800 K). By dropping the operating temperature of a specified percentage of NaK flow through a bypass containing a forced circulation <b>cold</b> <b>trap,</b> the NaK purity level can be increased by precipitating oxides from the NaK and capturing them within the <b>cold</b> <b>trap.</b> This would prevent recirculation of these oxides back through the system, which may help prevent corrosion...|$|R

The mechanism by which Io's surface and/or atmosphere supplies neutral and ionic species to the region around the satellite and ultimately to the Jovian magnetosphere is also discussed. A model is suggested in which the global SO 2 gas abundance is primarily controlled by buffering in the brightest, coldest regions. The net SO 2 flux across the disk is limited by regional <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> on high albedo regions and possibly by the resistance of a tenuous non-SO 2 residual atmosphere.

As well, the temperatures simulated in the lab were analogous to surface temperatures seen on comets, with back-pressures of about a Pa or less. The major differences between the experiment and reality are twofold. First the typical temperature gradient of 30 K cm- 1 is likely far higher than what can be expected on comets. This means that, in contrast to our results, it is possible that there could be significant <b>cold</b> <b>trapping</b> if vapor is able to penetrate to depth within the comet.
