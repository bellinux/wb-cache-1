50|$|<b>Candoxatril</b> is {{the first}} drug of its kind to be {{released}} for clinical trials regarding heart failure. This is because <b>Candoxatril</b> produces favorable haemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure. It has been demonstrated that <b>Candoxatril</b> {{is associated with a}} beneficial hemodynamic effect that is useful both in rest and exercise. In several different studies, <b>candoxatril</b> has been shown to improve performance in people with heart failure. In one study, 12 different patients were selected, all with moderately severe heart failure. On day one of this study, the <b>candoxatril</b> had increased plasma ANP levels, suppressed aldosterone and decreased right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. After treatment for 10 days, patients health had improved with an increase of basal ANP and a decrease of aldosterone, along with a reduced body weight that could be a reflection of chronic natriuretic, diuretic effects, or both. It was decided that on day 10 of the study, the effects of <b>candoxatril</b> were similar to that on day one.|$|E
50|$|In a {{separate}} study, patients were gathered throughout the United Kingdom from 16 different centers. Over a four-week bind, {{the patients were}} either given <b>candoxatril</b> or placebo for the 84 days and every 28 days, patients were reassessed. Out of the 110 patients, 56 received <b>candoxatril</b> and 54 received the placebo. Over {{the time of the}} study, the patients who were taking <b>candoxatril</b> had an overall improvement in exercise time compared to the patients taking the placebo.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe study {{aimed to}} assess the hemodynamic and neuroendocrine effects of <b>candoxatril</b> and frusemide {{compared}} with placebo in patients with mild chronic heart failure. BACKGROUNDCandoxatril is an atriopeptidase inhibitor. It increases circulating levels of atrial natriuretic peptide leading to natriuresis and diuresis, which alleviate the symptoms of a failing heart. METHODSThis was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. Forty-seven patients with mild stable chronic heart failure received <b>candoxatril</b> 400 mg/day, frusemide 40 mg/day or placebo {{for up to six}} weeks. Cardiac indices were determined at rest and during exercise, and blood samples were taken for laboratory analysis. Assessments were performed at baseline (day 0) and after six weeks (day 42). RESULTSIn comparison with placebo, both drugs significantly reduced mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure following the first dose administration. Only <b>candoxatril</b> significantly reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise on day 0, while both drugs significantly reduced this parameter on day 42. Changes in the remaining hemodynamic parameters were comparable for both drugs relative to placebo. Frusemide significantly increased mean plasma renin activity (days 0 and 42), and the mean aldosterone concentration (day 42) in comparison with placebo, whereas <b>candoxatril</b> caused no significant changes in any of the hormonal parameters assessed. CONCLUSIONSThese results show that <b>candoxatril,</b> 400 mg/day, has a similar hemodynamic profile to frusemide, 40 mg/day, but it does not induce adverse neuroendocrine effects. <b>Candoxatril</b> therefore appears to offer a clinically significant advantage over frusemide, providing an alternative therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients with mild stable chronic heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} effects on {{exercise}} capacity of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor <b>candoxatril,</b> and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.

40|$|Introduction We {{examined}} the acute effects of neutral endopeptidase inhibitor on the hemodynamics and electrical properties of dogs subjected to rapid atrial pacing. Methods Ten beagle dogs were used and {{divided into two}} groups with and without <b>candoxatril,</b> a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor preadministration. Before and after the 6 hours rapid atrial pacing from the right atrial appendage, the hemodynamics, atrial effective refractory period, and monophasic action potential duration of the right atrial appendage were measured and blood samples were collected. Atrial tissue was also excised after the experiment. Results <b>Candoxatril</b> significantly increased plasma ANP levels (Control: 88. 4 ± 50. 25 vs. Candoxatril: 197. 1 ± 32. 09 pg/ml, p = 0. 004) and prevented reductions in atrial effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration. We further demonstrated that the treated animals exhibited significantly higher levels of atrial tissue cyclic GMP (Control: 28. 1 ± 1. 60 fmol/mg vs. Candoxatril: 44. 5 ± 12. 28 fmol/mg, p = 0. 034) {{as well as that of}} plasma cyclic GMP (Control: 32 ± 5. 5 vs. Candoxatril: 42 ± 7. 1 pg/ml, p = 0. 028). Conclusion <b>Candoxatril</b> suppressed the shortening of atrial effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration in the rapid atrial pacing model. As plasma ANP and the atrial tissue levels of cyclic GMP were higher in the <b>Candoxatril</b> group than the control, this effect was considered to appear through the reduction of calcium overload caused by ANP and cyclic GMP...|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that treating diet-induced obese (DIO) mice with the vasopeptidase inhibitor ilepatril improved neural function. Vasopeptidase inhibitors block angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity. We propose that increased activity of ACE and NEP contributes to pathophysiology of DIO. To address this issue C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice or mice deficient in NEP were fed a high-fat diet and treated with ilepatril, enalapril, ACE inhibitor, or <b>candoxatril,</b> NEP inhibitor, using both prevention and intervention protocols. Endpoints included glucose utilization and neural function determination. In the prevention study glucose tolerance was impaired in DIO C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice and improved with ilepatril or enalapril.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{possible}} physiological role of {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP) the effects of an increase of endogenous ANP within the physiological range induced by the neutral endopeptidase 24. 11 (NEP) inhibitor <b>candoxatril</b> were examined. In a single masked placebo controlled trial, seven patients were studied with normal IOP (six male, one female; average age 50 (range 37 - 62 years). Intraocular pressure in each eye was measured after 2 weeks of placebo, after 4 weeks of <b>candoxatril</b> 200 mg twice daily, and during the first 3 days of placebo washout. With 4 weeks of <b>candoxatril,</b> endogenous plasma ANP levels increased from 4. 2 (SEM 1. 5) to 6. 0 (1. 5) pmol/l (p < 0. 04) {{and there was a}} significant decrease in mean arterial pressure from 119 (4) to 110 (3) mm Hg (p < 0. 02; 12 hours after treatment). There was a significant reduction in IOP after 4 weeks' treatment with <b>candoxatril</b> (right eye 2. 1 (0. 8) mm Hg, p < 0. 05 paired t test, left eye 2. 8 (0. 8) mm Hg, p < 0. 02). The mean fall in IOP was 11 % (4 %) in the right eye and 16 % (3 %) in the left eye and the fall in IOP was greater the higher the initial IOP. The reduction in IOP with chronic NEP inhibition was positively correlated with the increase in ANP levels but not with changes in blood pressure. These findings suggest that ANP may play a physiological role in the regulation of IOP. As the fall in IOP was greater in subjects with higher initial IOP, NEP inhibitors may be of therapeutic value in the management of glaucoma...|$|E

40|$|Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) {{there is}} a {{pandemic}} of obesity with approximately 300 million people being obese. Typically, human obesity has a polygenetic causation. Neutral endopeptidase (NEP), also known as neprilysin, {{is considered to be}} one of the key enzymes in the metabolism of many active peptide hormones. Methodology/Principal Findings: An incidental observation in NEP-deficient mice was a late-onset excessive gain in body weight exclusively from a ubiquitous accumulation of fat tissue. In accord with polygenetic human obesity, mice were characterized by deregulation of lipid metabolism, higher blood glucose levels, with impaired glucose tolerance. The key role of NEP in determining body mass was confirmed by the use of the NEP inhibitor <b>candoxatril</b> in wild-type mice that increased body weight due to increased food intake. This is a peripheral and not a central NEP action on the switch for appetite control, since <b>candoxatril</b> cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of NEP in mice with cachexia delayed rapid body weight loss. Thus, lack in NEP activity, genetically or pharmacologically, leads to a gain in body fat. Conclusions/Significance: In the present study, we have identified NEP to be a crucial player in the development of obesity. NEP-deficient mice start to become obese under a normocaloric diet in an age of 6 – 7 months and thus are an ideal model for the typical human late-onset obesity. Therefore, the described obesity model is an ideal tool for research o...|$|E
40|$|Aims/hypothesis In humans, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) {{is rapidly}} {{degraded}} by dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 {{to a relatively}} stable metabolite, GLP- 1 (9 - 36) NH 2, which allows measurement of GLP- 1 secretion. However, {{little is known about}} the kinetics of the GLP- 1 metabolite in mice. We hypothesised that the GLP- 1 metabolite is rapidly degraded in this species by neutral endopeptidase(s) (NEP[s]). Methods We administered glucose, mixed meal or water orally to 256 mice, and took blood samples before and 2, 6, 10, 20, 30, 60 or 90 min after stimulation. To study the metabolism of the GLP- 1 metabolite, i. v. GLP- 1 (9 - 36) NH 2 (800 fmol) or saline (154 mmol/l NaCl) was administered to 160 mice, some of which had a prior injection of a selective NEP 24. 11 +/- inhibitor (<b>candoxatril,</b> 5 mg/kg) or saline. Blood was collected before and 1, 2, 4 and 12 min after GLP- 1 /saline injection. Plasma GLP- 1 levels were analysed using a customised single-site C-terminal ELISA, two different two-site ELISAs and MS. Results GLP- 1 secretion profiles after oral glucose administration differed markedly when assayed by C-terminal ELISA compared with sandwich ELISAs, with the former showing a far higher peak value and AUC. In mice injected with GLP 1 (9 - 36) NH 2, immunoreactive GLP- 1 plasma levels peaked at approximately 75 pmol/l at 1 min when measured with sandwich ELISAs, returning to baseline (similar to 20 pmol/l) after 12 min, but remained elevated using the C-terminal ELISA (similar to 90 pmol/l at 12 min). NEP 24. 11 inhibition by <b>candoxatril</b> significantly attenuated GLP- 1 (9 - 36) NH 2 degradation in vivo and in vitro. MS identified GLP- 1 fragments consistent with NEP 24. 11 degradation. Conclusions/interpretation In mice, the GLP- 1 metabolite is eliminated within a few minutes owing to endoproteolytic cleavage by NEP 24. 11. Therefore, accurate measurement of GLP- 1 secretion in mice requires assays for NEP 24. 11 meta-bolites. Conventional sandwich ELISAs are inadequate because of endoproteolytic cleavage of the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 -generated metabolite...|$|E
40|$|Jagdeep SS Singh, Chim C Lang Division of Cardiovascular and Diabetes Medicine, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK Abstract: Heart failure {{remains a}} major concern across the globe as life expectancies and {{delivery}} of health care continue to improve. There has been a dearth of new developments in heart failure therapies {{in the last decade}} until last year, with the release of the results from the PARADIGM-HF Trial heralding the arrival of a promising new class of drug, ie, the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor. In this review, we discuss the evolution of our incremental understanding of the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure, which has led to our success in modulating its various pathways. We start by examining the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, followed by the challenges of modulating the natriuretic peptide system. We then delve deeper into the pharmacology and mechanisms by which angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors achieve their significant cardiovascular benefits. Finally, we also consider the potential application of this new class of drug in other areas, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, patients with renal impairment, and following myocardial infarction.

40|$|Natriuretic and antialdosterone {{actions of}} chronic oral NEP {{inhibition}} during progressive congestive heart failure. BackgroundNeutral endopeptidase (NEP) degrades {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) that via cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is natriuretic and aldosterone-inhibiting. We hypothesized that chronic oral NEP inhibition (NEPI), initiated in early experimental congestive heart failure (CHF), would delay onset of decreases in sodium excretion during the progression of CHF and, in the severe phase, suppress aldosterone activation and reduce the magnitude of sodium retention. We also hypothesized that chronic NEPI during progressive CHF (PCHF) would improve the natriuretic response to acute volume expansion. MethodsIn a novel canine model that progresses over 38 days from early to moderate and finally severe CHF, we defined the actions of chronic NEPI (<b>candoxatril,</b> 10 mg/kg, orally, twice a day) upon cardiorenal and neurohumoral function {{as well as the}} clinical well being of treated and untreated dogs in CHF. ResultsFrom baseline through the moderate phase of CHF, NEPI maintained sodium excretion. In contrast, in moderate CHF, sodium excretion was reduced compared to the early phase in the controls. In severe CHF, sodium excretion was higher with NEPI compared to control. Chronic NEPI also resulted in lower plasma aldosterone as compared to controls. In severe CHF, the natriuretic response to acute saline volume expansion was enhanced with oral NEPI as compared to control. ConclusionThis study supports the conclusion that chronic oral NEPI delays the onset of reduction in sodium excretion during the transition from early to severe CHF in this model of PCHF. This therapeutic strategy also improved the natriuretic response to acute volume expansion in severe CHF while enhancing ANP and suppressing aldosterone activation. Thus, these studies demonstrated a selective renal and adrenal action of chronic NEPI in heart failure indicating a therapeutic potential...|$|E
