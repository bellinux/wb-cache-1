5|$|Besides his episcopal appointments, Hugh {{was rewarded}} with two manors in Somerset, {{including}} the Treasurer's House in Martock which he made his primary residence, {{and the right to}} collect taxes and fines in two hundreds in Somerset. He also served as the royal <b>custodian</b> of the diocese of Lincoln while the see was vacant between 1200 and 1203, collecting the revenues of the see, most of which went to the king while a see was without a bishop. In 1205 and 1206, Hugh was royal <b>custodian</b> for the diocese of Bath, which was similarly vacant.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the current market {{infrastructure}} systemically prevents investors, both shareholders and bondholders, from exercising their rights against issuers. Equity and debt securities are now normally held through a chain of <b>custodians.</b> These <b>custodians</b> are connected with each other through contract law. There also exists legislation determining the relationship between <b>custodians</b> and their clients. It will be shown {{in the paper that}} custody chains have become independent from investors and issuers. Neither issuers nor investors are able to control the length of the chain or the content of the legal arrangements that governs the custody chain. <b>Custodians</b> are connected through a series of bilateral links that are independent of each other. This erodes the rights of investors. The paper will illustrate this by reference to the liability of <b>custodians</b> for their services and by reference to the ability of <b>custodians</b> to contract with sub-custodians on terms that are independent from the terms that they have entered into with their customers...|$|R

50|$|The risks {{organizations}} face in e-discovery often correlate {{directly with}} their litigation hold practices. Today, most sanctions result from flawed preservation {{processes that are}} rooted in the failure to identify all <b>custodians,</b> locate all data sources, or monitor compliance with a litigation hold. Some of the most critical yet most challenging steps in these processes are tracking <b>custodians,</b> the litigation hold notices issued, and the responses received from <b>custodians.</b> When <b>custodians</b> number into the hundreds or thousands, {{it can be difficult to}} determine whether they have responded to the initial hold, completed required questionnaires, or reconfirmed their compliance with subsequent hold reminders. Moreover, when companies still rely on manual methods, they may not follow up with <b>custodians</b> once sending out an initial notice, opening their preservation strategy to scrutiny from opposing counsel or the court.|$|R
5|$|During Becket's exile Foliot {{collected}} {{and sent to}} Rome Peter's Pence, the annual payment from England to the papacy. Foliot observed during the conflict {{that it was not}} a theological or moral dispute, merely one over church government. During Becket's exile, the king confiscated the archbishop's estates, and also confiscated the benefices of the clerks who had followed Becket into exile. Foliot was made <b>custodian</b> of those benefices in the diocese of Canterbury. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the confiscations, but evidence appears to show that the confiscations were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious <b>custodian</b> who made sure that little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went to religious purposes.|$|E

5|$|Weir {{was born}} in Norwood, South Australia, on 23 April 1866, a son of Alfred Weir and Susannah Mary (née Price). His father was a carpenter, who had emigrated to South Australia from Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1839, {{two years after the}} colony was founded. Weir {{attended}} Moore's School, the Norwood Public School, and Pulteney Street Grammar School. In 1879, at the age of 13, he joined the Surveyor General's Department as an office assistant. He assisted the surveyor who pegged out the land at the rear of Government House, Adelaide, for the Torrens Parade Ground, and was later promoted to clerk. On 14 May 1890, he married Rosa Wadham at the Christian Chapel, Norwood. He rose through the department to be appointed Survey Storekeeper, <b>Custodian</b> of Plans and <b>Custodian</b> of Government Motor Cars, on 1 July 1911. He was appointed a justice of the peace on 10 September 1914.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Cabinet War Rooms became {{redundant}} {{and were}} abandoned. Their maintenance became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works. In March 1948 the question of public access to the War Rooms was raised in Parliament and the Minister responsible, Charles Key MP, considered that 'it would not be practicable to throw open for inspection by the general public accommodation which forms part of an office where confidential work is carried on'. Even so, a tour was organised for journalists on 17 March, with members of the press being welcomed by Lord Ismay and shown around the Rooms by their <b>custodian,</b> Mr. George Rance.|$|E

King William went north in the spring or summer of 1069, {{relieved}} the siege of Malet, and restored the castle, placing William fitz Osbern in charge. The leaders of the revolt were Edgar the Ætheling (claimant to the English throne), Gospatric of Northumbria, and, among others, Mærle-Sveinn, former sheriff of Lincoln, and many senior Northumbria nobles.|$|E

5|$|For 19 years, {{the castle}} {{served as a}} prison for John I, Duke of Bourbon after he was taken at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. His <b>custodian</b> was a Nicholas Montgomery the Younger. Nineteenth-century local {{historian}} John Joseph Briggs claimed that during the Wars of the Roses, the castle was partially dismantled by the Lancastrian forces of Margaret of Anjou, but since her campaign was {{along the line of}} the Great North Road, it was Melbourn, Cambridgeshire she sacked, not its Derbyshire namesake.|$|E

Thus, even when one parent is the primary <b>custodian,</b> joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E
