50|$|In 1832, the Neptune Mill was {{constructed}} beside a dam just North of the Salmon River Cove. The Card Company, {{as it was}} then known also made stocking yarn and <b>carpet</b> <b>warp.</b> New cord wrapping machines filled these mills and twine was produced on a massive scale. Over the years, the Neptune Mill expanded until it reached its 100x100 ft dimensions. Three stories tall, it was a massive edifice, architecturally resembling a church with its steeple and bell that would call workers into the factory each morning.|$|E
25|$|Tabriz is {{the market}} {{center for the}} Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the {{symmetric}} knot. Heriz is a local center of production for mainly room-size <b>carpets.</b> <b>Warps</b> and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of Sarab produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. Bakshaish carpets with a shield-shaped large medaillon, less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of Bakhshayesh. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.|$|R
50|$|Tabriz {{is one of}} {{the main}} centers of carpet weaving in Iran. At present 40% of Iranian carpet exports are {{originated}} from Tabriz. These carpets are generally known as Tabriz rugs. Another carpet weaving center is Ardebil, which, despite being overshadowed by Tabriz in recent years, has produced the finest carpets in past. Two most famous Iranian rugs in the world had been woven in Ardebil in 1540. One is hung in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the other is in the Los Angeles County Museum of Arts. These <b>carpets</b> have silk <b>warps</b> and contain over thirty million knots.|$|R
2500|$|On a knotted {{pile carpet}} (formally, a [...] "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" [...] carpet), the {{structural}} weft threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises {{at right angles}} {{to the surface of the}} weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the warp by one of three knot types (see below), such as shag carpet which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or nap of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in oriental rugs and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental <b>carpets.</b> The <b>warp</b> threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The <b>warp</b> in woven <b>carpet</b> is usually cotton and the weft is jute.|$|R
2500|$|The city of Sanandij, {{formerly}} known as Senneh, is the capital of Persian Kurdistan. The rugs produced here are still known, also in the Iran of today, under their trade name [...] "Senneh". They belong to the most finely woven Persian rugs, with knot counts up to 400 per square inch (6200/dm2). The pile is closely clipped, and the foundation is cotton, also silk was used in antique carpets. Some fine <b>carpets</b> have silk <b>warps</b> dyed in different colours which create fringes in different colours known as [...] "rainbow warps" [...] in the rug trade. Mostly blue colours {{are used in the}} field, or a pale red. The predominant pattern used to be the Herati pattern, with a lozenge-shaped central medallion also filled with repeating Herati patterns on a different background colour. More realistic floral patterns are also seen, probably in rugs woven for export to Europe.|$|R
