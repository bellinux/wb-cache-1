5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a <b>chemical</b> <b>substance,</b> an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not.

When Ed arrives, Scully tells him that they found blood in his neighbor's apartment and that it was likely his. She thinks that the chemical came from the tattoo ink and wants them both to head to the hospital to be tested. Ed tells Scully about the voice he has been hearing from his tattoo.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} rocks {{which make}} {{up some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain are unusual in that they have an acid-neutralizing <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> like typical ocean-island basalts but a low percentage of strontium as found at mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, the strontium-bearing volcanic rocks comprising Bowie Seamount also contain lead. Therefore, the magma mixtures that formed Bowie Seamount seem to have originated from varying degrees of partial melting of a depleted source in the Earth's mantle and basalts which had distinctly high lead isotopic ratios. Estimates during geological studies indicate that the abundance of the depleted-source component ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the erupted material.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E

5|$|Water is a <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> that is {{composed}} of hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% {{in the air as}} vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The council never materialized, since Pope Hormisdas and Anastasius {{continued}} to be at loggerheads over the Acacian Schism. Neither were the deposed bishops returned to their sees. Seeing Anastasius failing to honour his promises, in late 515 Vitalian mobilized his army and marched again towards Constantinople. Vitalian's army captured the suburb of Sycae (modern Galata) across the Golden Horn {{from the city and}} encamped there. The two magistri militum praesentalis, Patricius and John, were unwilling to engage their old friend Vitalian, thus Anastasius gave command of his forces to the former praetorian prefect of the East, Marinus, a trusted and influential aide. Despite his lack of military experience, Marinus defeated the rebel fleet in a battle at the entrance of the Golden Horn; according to the report of John Malalas, this was achieved {{through the use of a}} sulphur-based <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> invented by the philosopher Proclus of Athens, similar to the later Greek fire. Marinus then landed with his men on the shore of Sycae and defeated the rebels he found there. Disheartened by the losses suffered, Vitalian and his army fled north under cover of night. As a sign of his victory, Anastasius led a procession to the village of Sosthenion, where Vitalian had established his headquarters, and attended a service of thanks at the famed local church dedicated to the Archangel Michael.|$|E

Synthetic resins {{are composed of}} assorted <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> derived from fossil resources. Utilization of such resins {{will almost certainly be}} restricted in the future, due to decreases in the reserves of fossil resources. Hence, the development of natural adhesive using bioresources [7] (i.e., lignin, tannin, proteins, polysaccharides, and ligno-cellulose nanofiber (LCNF) [8]), has been investigated. Nevertheless, the use of <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> derived from fossil resources and toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> was needed to obtain good bondability [9 – 12] with such natural adhesives. Therefore, further research is urgently needed to obtain excellent bonding performance with natural adhesives that do not rely on either fossil resources or toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>substances.</b>|$|R
