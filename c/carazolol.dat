The electrostatic potential surface was applied to a model with atom positions determined by crystallography (PDB code 2RH1); the electrostatic surface was computed using Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) freeware. It is again shaded blue for electropositive areas to red for electronegative areas. Somewhat apparent, in stick representation in yellow, red and blue, in a groove {{at the top of}} the receptor, is a small molecule ligand bound to it, the agent <b>carazolol,</b> a partial inverse agonist which, through this binding, antagonizes binding of the normal ligand, the neurotransmitter/hormone epinephrine. In response to binding epinephrine, this receptor, in conjunction with an L-type calcium channel, mediates physiologic responses such as smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. All of such binding interactions and the function of the receptor in signal transduction are mediated by electrostatic effects, and in modern structure work they are often studied using similar space filling models.|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{follicular}} cysts (FCs) are {{a common}} cause of economic loss in modern dairy herds. Their aetiopathogenesis is not completely understood, even though an inadequate hypothalamic release of GnRH {{at the time of}} ovulation is considered to be their main cause. Much evidence, however, suggests a role for adrenergic innervation in ovarian functions, such as follicular development, steroid hormone secretion, and follicular contractility, the latter being an event important for ovulation. Moreover, in humans, polycystic ovary syndrome, a disease very similar to bovine follicular cysts, is characterised by increased density of adrenergic nerves. Given these premises, the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness and mode of action of a novel strategy for the treatment of bovine follicular cysts. In the in vivo experiment, 170 Friesian cows diagnosed with follicular cysts were assigned to four groups (groups A, B, C, and D) to assess the effects of epidural administration of a β-adrenergic antagonist (<b>carazolol)</b> alone or in combination with a GnRH analogue (lecirelin). The four groups underwent the following treatments: Group A was administered lecirelin in combination with carazolol; Group B was administered carazolol; Group C was administered lecirelin; and Group D was administered only normal saline solution. In the in vitro experiment, strips of the walls of cystic follicles recovered post-mortem were suspended in an organ bath, connected to an isometric force transducer and exposed to increasing doses of epinephrine or to the same treatment after exposure to <b>carazolol</b> for 15 min (n = 10). The amplitude and frequency of the contractile activity were recorded. None of the control cows was observed in oestrus or was submitted to AI. The combination of lecirelin and <b>carazolol</b> induced {{a significant increase in the}} number of cows in oestrus (88 %) compared to lecirelin alone or to <b>carazolol</b> alone (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 01, respectively). The combination of lecirelin and <b>carazolol</b> and lecirelin alone were significantly more efficacious than <b>carazolol</b> alone (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively). In the in vitro experiment, epinephrine increased the amplitude of the contractions of the strips in a dose-dependent manner. This response was significantly enhanced in strips pre-treated with <b>carazolol.</b> The treatments had no effect on the frequency of contractions. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that the epidural administration of a GnRH analogue and a β-adrenergic blocker is an effective means of treating cows with cystic ovarian disease. Moreover, it confirms, from a clinical point of view, that alterations of the adrenergic system and of the contractility of the follicular wall can be considered aetiopathogenic factors involved in the development of FCs. The results of this study lay the basis for a new therapeutic approach to FCs...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{molecular}} details of ligand activation of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCRs), emphasis {{has been placed}} on structure determination of these receptors with stabilizing ligands. Here we present the methodology for receptor dynamics characterization of the GPCR human β 2 adrenergic receptor bound to the inverse agonist <b>carazolol</b> using the technique of amide hydrogen/ deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX MS). The HDX MS profile of receptor bound to <b>carazolol</b> is consistent with thermal parameter observations in the crystal structure and provides additional information in highly dynamic regions of the receptor and chemical modifications demonstrating the highly complementary nature of the techniques. Following optimization of HDX experimental conditions for this membrane protein, better than 89 % sequence coverage was obtained for the receptor. The methodology presented paves the way for future analysis of β 2 AR bound to pharmacologically distinct ligands as well as analysis of other GPCR family members.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{recovery}} of receptor binding and of isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP responses after chronic (2 - 5 days) exposure of tissue-cultured living rat heart cells to several beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Most experiments were performed with [3 H]- (+/-) -carazolol and [3 H]-(+/-) -CGP 12177, as prototypes of high affinity lipophilic and hydrophilic ligands respectively. Chronic antagonist treatment did not alter {{the total number of}} receptors nor did it cause intracellular accumulation of the ligands. At the end of the treatment, radiolabelled antagonists were displaced either by 'infinite' dilution of the incubation medium or by competitive displacement with the non-labelled ligand (-) -timolol. In dilution assays dissociation of <b>carazolol</b> from specific sites was biphasic with t 1 / 2 values of 41 +/- 14 and 219 +/- 15 min. Dissociation of CGP 12177 was monophasic with t 1 / 2 of 102 +/- 2 min. Timolol enhanced the dissociation rates of both radioligands and suppressed the slow phase of <b>carazolol</b> dissociation. Isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP formation did not recover in parallel with the release of the two antagonists from receptor binding sites. To reach about 80 % of control values for receptor availability or cyclic AMP response required 3 h and 24 h washout periods, respectively, after <b>carazolol</b> (0. 2 nM) treatment, or 1. 5 and 12 h washout periods after CGP 12177 (4 nM) treatment. Such a 'decoupling' effect was not observed during recovery from chronic exposure to the antagonists, timolol and propranolol. We conclude that some antagonists cause a novel form of desensitization that is not linked to their partial agonistic potency. Moreover, carazolol-type drugs seem to induce an additional isomeric form of the beta-receptor that is not recognized by other antagonists. These observations could explain the well known discrepancy between long duration of action and rapid removal from the circulation of several antagonists in current therapeutic use...|$|E
40|$|A {{protocol}} {{to validate the}} rejection of organic chemicals of potential health risk by low pressure reverse osmosis (LPRO) membranes was developed for decision making support regarding the monitoring level required for potable water reuse. Ten organic chemicals were selected for evaluation, based on their recorded usage, the scarcity of rejection data, and difficulty in analytical determination at concentrations relevant to their potential impact on human-health. An analytical method was developed for these organic chemicals. The target rejections of 90 and 99 % for neutral and charged chemicals respectively were successfully achieved under the standard operating condition with only two exceptions (i. e. bisoprolol and <b>carazolol</b> rejections by the TFC-HR membrane). These lower rejections by the TFC-HR {{can be attributed to}} its highestwater permeability amongst the three membranes while both bisoprolol and <b>carazolol</b> are positively charged. Changes in operating conditions including permeate flux, feed temperature and chemical cleaning can exert a considerable impact on conductivity rejection by the three LPRO membranes investigated here. Feed temperature showed an apparent impact on the rejection of the selected organic chemicals. However, their rejections were still higher than the target validation values.

40|$|A {{series of}} eight chiral {{beta-blocker}} drugs, acebutolol, atenolol, <b>carazolol,</b> carteolol, carvedilol, propranolol, sotalol, and talinolol, have been enantioseparated using two single-component anionic beta-CD derivatives, namely heptakis (2, 3 -di-O-methyl- 6 -sulfo) -beta-CD (HDMS-beta-CD) and heptakis (2, 3 -di-O-acetyl- 6 -sulfo) -beta-CD (HDAS-beta-CD), in aqueous CE and NACE. The {{influence of the}} nature of substituents (methyl or acetyl) in positions 2 and 3 on the CD derivatives and of the electrophoretic medium (water or methanol) on the enantioselectivity and enantiomer affinity pattern (EAP) of these structurally related compounds was systematically studied. All eight beta-blockers could be enantioseparated at least partially in the four CE systems, except sotalol with HDMS-beta-CD in NACE. In general, lower affinity and enantioselectivity were obtained in the presence of HDMS-beta-CD compared to HDAS-beta-CD. Reversals of EAPs were observed for all compounds. EAPs toward these two CDs were found to be opposite to each other in NACE for all compounds except carvedilol and in aqueous CE for atenolol, carteolol, talinolol, and sotalol. It is particularly noteworthy that opposite EAPs were also observed using the same CD derivative when the aqueous BGE was replaced with the methanolic one: for <b>carazolol,</b> carvedilol, and propranolol in the presence of HDMS-beta-CD and for acebutolol and carvedilol with HDAS-beta-CD.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Crystal {{structures}} of engineered human β 2 -adrenergic receptors (ARs) in complex with an inverse agonist ligand, <b>carazolol,</b> provide three-dimensional snapshots of {{the disposition of}} seven transmembrane helices and the ligand-binding site of an important G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). As expected, β 2 -AR shares substantial structural similarities with rhodopsin, the dim-light photoreceptor of the rod cell. However, although <b>carazolol</b> and the 11 -cis-retinylidene moiety of rhodopsin are situated in the same general binding pocket, the second extracellular (E 2) loop structures are quite distinct. E 2 in rhodopsin shows β-sheet structure and forms part of the chromophore-binding site. In the β 2 -AR, E 2 is R-helical {{and seems to be}} distinct from the receptor’s active site, allowing a potential entry pathway for diffusible ligands. The structures, together with extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) data from earlier studies, provide insight about possible structural determinants of ligand specificity and how the binding of agonist ligands might alter receptor conformation. We review key features of the new β 2 -AR structures in the context of recent complementary work on the conformational dynamics of GPCRs. We also report 600 ns molecular dynamics simulations that quantified β 2 -AR receptor mobility in a membrane bilayer environment and show how the binding of an agonist ligand, adrenaline (epinephrine), causes conformational changes to the ligand-binding pocket and neighboring helices...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} the long intracellular loop 3 (ICL 3) on the intrinsic dynamics of human beta(2) -adrenergic receptor, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on two different models, both of which were based on the inactive crystal structure in complex with <b>carazolol</b> (after removal of <b>carazolol</b> and T 4 -lysozyme). In the so-called loop model, the ICL 3 region that is missing in available crystal structures was modeled as an unstructured loop of 32 -residues length, whereas in the clipped model, the two open ends were covalently bonded to each other. The latter model without ICL 3 was taken as a reference, which has also been commonly used in recent computational studies. Each model was embedded into POPC bilayer membrane with explicit water and subjected to a 1 mu s molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at 310 K. Results: After around 600 ns, the loop model started a transition to a "very inactive" conformation, which is characterized by a further movement of the intracellular half of transmembrane helix 6 (TM 6) towards the receptor core, and a close packing of ICL 3 underneath the membrane completely blocking the G-protein's binding site. Concurrently, the binding site at the extracellular part of the receptor expanded slightly with the Ser 207 -Asp 113 distance increasing to 18 angstrom from 11 angstrom, which was further elaborated by docking studies. Conclusions: The essential dynamics analysis indicated a strong coupling between the extracellular and intracellular parts of the intact receptor, implicating a functional relevance for allosteric regulation. In contrast, no such transition to the "very inactive" state, nor any structural correlation, was observed in the clipped model without ICL 3. Furthermore, elastic network analysis using different conformers for the loop model indicated a consistent picture on the specific ICL 3 conformational change being driven by global modes...|$|E

Ca(2 +) -chelator treatment obliterated 1 -NP-induced CXCL 8 (IL- 8) responses. 1 -NP at 10 μM (but not 1 μM) induced a rapid and sustained increase in intracellular Ca(2 +) -levels ([Ca(2 +) ]i).

In this study, 126 pigs (25. 1 +/- 4. 4 kg BW) were allocated {{to one of the}} six following treatments: 1) negative control (no supplementation); 2) positive control (i. m. injection with 0. 5 mg of carazolol/ 20 kg BW 12 h before vibration, beta-blocker); 3) Trp (additional amount of 6 g/kg of feed for 5 d, as-fed basis); 4) Mg (3 g/L drinking water for 2 d); 5) vit E (additional amount of 150 mg/kg of feed for 21 d, as-fed basis); 6) or vit C (additional amount of 300 mg/kg of feed for 21 d, as-fed basis). Pigs were treated in groups of three, and each treatment was replicated seven times. Feed and water intake were not different among treatments. Heart rate variables (mean, peak, and minimum heart rate, ventricular ectopic beats, and ST elevation of Channels A and B) and heart rate variability were registered from the night before vibration. Pigs were subjected to vibration in a transport simulator (8 Hz, 3 m/s) for 2 h and allowed to recover for 2 h. Generally, the positive control pigs had the lowest heart rate values (mean, peak, minimum heart rate, ST elevation of Channel A; P < 0. 05), whereas Mg and Trp decreased ventricular ectopic beats and ST elevation of Channel B, respectively. The effect of vit C and E as vagal stimulators was clearly visible, whereas <b>carazolol</b> and Mg clearly blocked the sympathetic pathways of the autonomic nervous system. During vibration, the negative control pigs lay the least, and Mg pigs the most (P < 0. 05). Salivary cortisol concentrations (taken before and after vibration and after recovery) showed that vit E pigs produced the least cortisol during stress periods. Intermediary metabolites (glucose, lactate, creatine kinase, and NEFA) were analyzed in plasma from blood taken before and after vibration. At the two sampling points, the vit E and Mg pigs had the lowest NEFA concentrations (P < 0. 05), and the vit E pigs also had the lowest lactate concentrations before vibration. Urine samples were collected before and after vibration to determine catecholamine concentrations; only negative control pigs had an increase (P = 0. 04) in epinephrine concentration, despite large individual variation.

To the authors’ knowledge {{this is the first}} time an enantiomeric method including such a high number of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites has been reported. Some of the pharmaceuticals have never been studied before in environmental matrices. Among them are: timolol, betaxolol, <b>carazolol</b> and clenbuterol.

Trifluoperazine, an inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent enzymes, was utilized {{in the present study}} to clarify the role in vivo of calcium-calmodulin regulation of phosphorylase kinase. Twenty-minute preperfusion of isolated rat ventricles with 10 ~ 5 M trifluoperazine had no effect on basal levels of phosphorylase a but significantly attenuated phosphorylase activation induced by either calcium (3. 75 HIM) or isoproterenol (3 X 10 " 9 M, 3 X 1 CT 8 M). The positive inotropic effect of both agents and cyclic adenosine 3 ', 5 '-monophosphate (cAMP) levels were not altered by trifluoperazine in the perfused hearts. In addition, no effects of 10 ~ 5 M trifluoperazine were noted on /S-adrenergic receptor binding of [3 H](±) <b>carazolol</b> or on adenylate cyclase activity. In vitro studies with partially purified rat cardiac phosphorylase kinase demonstrated 1. 5 - to 3 -fold stimulation by exogenous calmodulin.

Analytical methods suited for their multianalyte detection are thus necessary. In this perspective, receptor assays were developed.

Its potential to detect the presence of beta-agonists or beta-blockers in biological samples was evaluated. The solubilised beta(2) -adrenergic receptor retained its binding affinity in a radio-receptor assay based on the competition for the binding to receptors between a ligand (beta-agonist or antagonist) and the radioligand [I- 125]iodocyanopindolol. The IC 50 values ranged from 5 +/- x 10 (- 8) M (clenbuterol) to 8 +/- 2 x 10 (- 6) M (isoxsuprine) for the beta-agonists tested and from 1. 5 +/- 0. 2 x 10 (- 10) M (<b>carazolol)</b> to 1. 2 +/- 0. 2 x 10 (- 5) M (metoprolol) for the beta-blockers tested. It was shown to have a lower limit of detection than a radio-receptor assay using the solubilised beta(2) -adrenoceptor expressed in a mammalian cell line. The solubilised recombinant human beta(2) -adrenoreceptor expressed in E. coli would be a useful tool to develop non radioactive multianalyte screening methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The 2. 4 Å crystal {{structure}} of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) in complex with the high-affinity inverse agonist (-) -carazolol provides a detailed structural framework {{for the analysis of}} ligand recognition by adrenergic receptors. Insights into agonist binding and the corresponding conformational changes triggering GPCR activation mechanism are of special interest. Here we show that while the <b>carazolol</b> pocket captured in the β 2 AR {{crystal structure}} accommodates (-) -isoproterenol and other agonists without steric clashes, a finite movement of the flexible extracellular part of TM-V helix (TM-Ve) obtained by receptor optimization in the presence of docked ligand can further improve the calculated binding affinities for agonist compounds. Tilting of TM-Ve towards the receptor axis provides a more complete description of polar receptor/ligand interactions for full and partial agonists, by enabling optimal engagement of agonists with two experimentally identified anchor sites, formed by Asp 113 /Asn 312 and Ser 203 /Ser 204 /Ser 207 side chains. Further, receptor models incorporating a flexible TM-V backbone allow reliable prediction of binding affinities for a set of diverse ligands, suggesting potential utility of this approach to design of effective and subtype-specific agonists for adrenergic receptors. Systematic differences in capacity of partial, full and inverse agonists to induce TM-V helix tilt in the β 2 AR model suggest potential role of TM-V as a conformational “rheostat ” involved in the whole spectrum of β 2 AR responses to small molecule signals...|$|E
40|$|Building {{reliable}} structural {{models of}} G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{is a difficult}} task because of the paucity of suitable templates, low sequence identity, and {{the wide variety of}} ligand specificities within the superfamily. Template-based modeling is known to be the most successful method for protein structure prediction. However, refinement of homology models within 1 – 3 Å CΑ RMSD of the native structure remains a major challenge. Here, we address this problem by developing a novel protocol (foldGPCR) for modeling the transmembrane (TM) region of GPCRs in complex with a ligand, aimed to accurately model the structural divergence between the template and target in the TM helices. The protocol is based on predicted conserved inter-residue contacts between the template and target, and exploits an all-atom implicit membrane force field. The placement of the ligand in the binding pocket is guided by biochemical data. The foldGPCR protocol is implemented by a stepwise hierarchical approach, in which the TM helical bundle and the ligand are assembled by simulated annealing trials in the first step, and the receptor-ligand complex is refined with replica exchange sampling in the second step. The protocol is applied to model the human Β 2 -adrenergic receptor (Β 2 AR) bound to <b>carazolol,</b> using contacts derived from the template structure of bovine rhodopsin. Comparison with the X-ray crystal structure of the Β 2 AR shows that our protocol is particularly successful in accurately capturing helix backbone irregularities and helix-helix packing interactions that distinguish rhodopsin from Β 2 AR.

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{regulate}} a {{wide range}} of physiological functions and hold great pharmaceutical interest. Using the β 2 - adrenergic receptor as a case study, this article explores the applicability of docking-based virtual screening to the discovery of GPCR ligands and defines methods intended to improve the screening performance. Our controlled computational experiments were performed on a compound dataset containing known agonists and blockers of the receptor as well as a large number of decoys. The screening based on the structure of the receptor crystallized in complex with its inverse agonist <b>carazolol</b> yielded excellent results, with a clearly delineated prioritization of ligands over decoys. Blockers generally were preferred over agonists; however, agonists were also well distinguished from decoys. A method was devised to increase the screening yields by generating an ensemble of alternative conformations of the receptor that accounts for its flexibility. Moreover, a method was devised to improve the retrieval of agonists, based on the optimization of the receptor around a known agonist. Finally, the applicability of docking-based virtual screening also to homology models endowed with different levels of accuracy was proved. This last point is of uttermost importance, since crystal structures are available only for a limited number of GPCRs, and extends our conclusions to the entire superfamily. The outcome of this analysis definitely supports the application of computer-aided techniques to the discovery of novel GPCR ligands, {{especially in light of the}} fact that, in the near future, experimental structures are expected to be solved and become available for an ever increasing number of GPCRs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{catecholamine}} epinephrine {{is known}} to repress expression of hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochromes P- 450. The present {{study was designed to}} determine whether epinephrine may also target expression of main hepatic drug transporters, that {{play a major role in}} liver detoxification and are commonly coordinately regulated with drug detoxifying enzymes. Treatment of primary human hepatocytes with 10 mu M epinephrine for 24 h repressed mRNA expression of various transporters, such as the sinusoidal influx transporters NTCP, OATP 1 B 1, OATP 2 B 1, OAT 2, OAT 7 and OCT 1 and the efflux transporters MRP 2, MRP 3 and BSEP, whereas it induced that of MDR 1, but failed to alter that of BCRP. Most of these changes in transporter mRNA levels were also found in epinephrine-exposed human highly-differentiated hepatoma HepaRG cells, which additionally exhibited reduced protein expression of OATP 2 B 1 and MRP 3, increased expression of P-glycoprotein and decreased transport activity of NTCP, OATPs and OCT 1. Epinephrine effects towards transporter mRNA expression in human hepatocytes were next shown to be correlated to those of the selective beta 2 -adrenoreceptor (ADR) agonist fenoterol, of the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and of the cAMP analogue 8 -bromo-cAMP. In addition, the non-selective beta-ADR antagonist <b>carazolol</b> and the selective beta 2 -ADR antagonist ICI- 118, 551, unlike the alpha-ADR antagonist phentolamine, suppressed epinephrine -mediated repressions of transporter mRNA expression. Taken together, these data indicate that epinephrine regulates in vitro expression of main hepatic drug transporters in a beta 2 -ADR/adenylate cyclase/cAMP-dependent manner. Hepatic drug transport appears therefore as a target of the beta 2 -adrenergic system, which may have to deserve attention for drugs interacting with beta 2 -ADRs...|$|E
40|$|For {{cardiovascular}} {{diseases such as}} high blood pressure, angina pectoris, and left ventricle hypertrophy; long-term activation of beta-adrenergic receptors is strongly linked to the progression of these diseases. A class of antagonistic drugs that target betaadrenergic receptors are collectively called beta-blockers. These drugs are commonly used to reduce the inotropic and chronotropic effects of beta-adrenergic receptor activation. This past decade has revealed that beta-blockers and other ligands are capable of functional selectivity at receptors. Functional selectivity describes the ability of ligands acting at 0 protein-coupled receptors (OPCRs) to preferentially activate or inhibit different signal transduction pathways. The studies on beta-adrenergic 2 receptors that explored functional selectivity showed that beta-blockers can be functionally selective by inhibiting the cAMP pathway while simultaneously activating ERK. The 0 protein coupled to beta-adrenergic receptors are the primary regulators of the cAMP, however {{there are a variety}} of pathways that can regulate ERK activity and few studies have tried to determine which pathway(s) the beta-blockers are targeting to cause this ERK activation. This is especially important for beta-adrenergic 2 receptors because they can activate ERK through multiple pathways (0 protein switching from G, to Oi/oprotein, beta-arrestin assisted or EOFR transactivation). ERK activation is linked to reversing cell damage caused by apoptosis signaling that results from G, activation by beta-adrenergic receptors. Understanding the specific pathways these beta-blockers can target for ERK activation would lead to better understanding of their therapeutic benefits. In this study we plan to elucidate the pathways several beta-blockers are targeting to activate ERK. In particular, we will investigate the role of clathrin-mediated receptor internalization and EGFR transactivation in beta-blocker-dependent ERK phosphorylation. In HEK 293 cells transfected with beta-adrenergic 2 receptors, we measured the changes in cAMP and ERK phosphorylation in response to the following beta-blockers labetalol, alprenolol, bucindolol, carvedilol, <b>carazolol,</b> leI 118, 551 and propanolol. All of the beta-blockers studied inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation but stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK to varying degrees. Beta-blocker-mediated ERK phosphorylation was shown to be dependent on clathrin-dependent internalization and EGFR transactivation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of a multi-residue chiral liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry method for simultaneous enantiomeric profiling of 18 chiral pharmaceuticals and their active metabolites (belonging to several therapeutic classes including analgesics, psychiatric drugs, antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs and β-agonists) in surface water and wastewater. To the authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first}} time an enantiomeric method including such a high number of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites has been reported. Some of the pharmaceuticals have never been studied before in environmental matrices. Among them are timolol, betaxolol, <b>carazolol</b> and clenbuterol. A monitoring programme of the Guadalquivir River basin (South Spain), including 24 sampling sites and five wastewater treatment plants along the basin, revealed that enantiomeric composition of studied pharmaceuticals is dependent on compound and sampling site. Several compounds such as ibuprofen, atenolol, sotalol and metoprolol were frequently found as racemic mixtures. On the other hand, fluoxetine, propranolol and albuterol were found to be enriched with one enantiomer. Such an outcome might be of significant environmental relevance as two enantiomers of the same chiral compound might reveal different ecotoxicity. For example, propranolol was enriched with S(−) -enantiomer, which is known to be more toxic to Pimephales promelas than R(+) -propranolol. Fluoxetine was found to be enriched with S(+) -enantiomer, which is more toxic to P. promelas than R(−) -fluoxetine.
