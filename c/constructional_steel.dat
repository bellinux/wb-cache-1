The major parameters used in the research are the depth of cut and spindle speed. The depth of cut is varied while the spindle speed is kept constant for every gear material. The depth of cut used in this experiment are (0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00) mm. The cutting tool vibrations are measured by using measured using Piezoelectric Accelerometer model KB 12 and recorded for the four spindle speeds (360, 720, 1080, 1440) rev/min for the various gear materials of the feed box. The graphs are plotted between the cutting tool vibrations along y-coordinate and spindle speed along x-coordinate for different gear materials along with <b>constructional</b> <b>steel</b> gear as a reference.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the structure and chemical composition changes of gas metal arc welded joints of wear resistant plate with <b>constructional</b> <b>steel</b> plate with possible application as replacing material for reservoirs and chute in cement industry. Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with <b>constructional</b> <b>steel</b> is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Design/methodology/approach: Wear resistant plates can be used for elements working in intensive abrasion resistance conditions to obtain considerable material and economical savings based on the manufacturing costs reducing and decreasing turnaround time for replacing worn parts. During the welding process of two materials, when one is wear plate and the other is steel plate significant structure changes and mixing of alloying components in weld area are observed. Findings: Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of wear resistant plate with <b>constructional</b> <b>steel</b> is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root, most of important changes during welding of wear resistant material are connected with melting, mixing and carbides passage into weld area, non uniform chemical composition of the welded joint creates different microstructures with different hardness. Practical implications: Welding of wear resistant plate with <b>constructional</b> <b>steel</b> is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Root weld must be free of cracks and possibly free of intermixing with wear resistant plate material. Applying welding parameters described in the paper is possible to achieve free of cracks root, presence of crack in face weld is not important in term of wear resistance abilities of chute.

Duplex surface treatment combining pulse plasma nitriding and PVD coating can provide solution for excellent wear and corrosion resistance for low alloy and <b>constructional</b> <b>steels.</b> In this work three different pulse plasma nitriding processes were carried out prior to the CrN/NbN PVD coating to attain high surface hardness and enhanced load bearing behaviour for S 154 high strength construction steel. The phase composition of the compound layer, formed in the nitriding process, was found to greatly affect the tribological properties of the duplex system. The compound layer with high amount of epsilon-phase contributed to superior corrosion and wear resistance, whereas the ductile gamma'-phase compound layer provided better impact resistance and enhanced. The best duplex treated S 154 samples had wear resistance comparable to that of similarly coated HSS. The corrosion resistance was also improved by duplex process. If anodic current at + 500 mV vs. SCE is considered as criteria, the best system has almost 3 orders of magnitude lower corrosion current than with the PVD coating alone. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
