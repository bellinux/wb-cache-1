40|$|Purpose: To report corneal {{findings}} in a familial {{case of the}} crystalline subtype of pre- Descemetic corneal dystrophy. Case Report: A 19 -year-old girl and her 44 -year-old mother {{were found to have}} asymptomatic, bilateral, punctiform and multi-colored <b>crystalline</b> <b>opacities</b> across the whole posterior layer of the corneas. Endothelial specular microscopy revealed the presence of white round flecks located at different levels anterior to the endothelium. No systemic abnormalities or medications could be related to account for these findings. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the third familial report of this rare corneal disorder. Differential diagnosis may include Schnyder corneal dystrophy, cystinosis, Bietti΄s dystrophy and monoclonal gammopathy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM—Hereditary hyperferritinaemia {{cataract}} syndrome (HHCS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterised by elevated serum L-ferritin and bilateral cataracts. The ocular manifestations of this disorder are poorly studied. This study therefore {{sought to determine}} the origin of cataracts in HHCS.  METHODS—L-ferritin ELISA, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis of a lens nucleus from an HHCS individual.  RESULTS—The HHCS lens L-ferritin content was 147  µg/g dry weight of lens compared with < 16 µg/g for a non-HHCS control cataract lens. The cataract comprised discrete crystalline inclusions with positive staining with anti-L-ferritin but not anti-H-ferritin.  CONCLUSIONS—This unusual finding of <b>crystalline</b> <b>opacities</b> in the lens may be unique to HHCS {{and is likely to}} result from disturbed metabolism of L-ferritin within the lens or an abnormal interaction between L-ferritin and lens proteins. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of corneal opacities associated with dacryoadenitis and lacrimal gland destruction has led investigators to consider MRL/Mp mice {{as models for}} band keratopathy and Sjögren syndrome. In this study, the authors examined {{the time course of}} the corneal opacification and investigated whether the opacities were associated with altered serum levels of parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus, as well as quantitative and qualitative differences in tear production. Corneas were analyzed microscopically and tear fluid production was measured by a modified Schirmer test. Corneal lesions were observed as early as the fifth week after birth. The lesions consisted of calcium phosphate and appeared as punctate, <b>crystalline</b> <b>opacities</b> located subeithelially. Lesions were present in 72 % (56 of 78) of the MRL/Mp mice, with no significant difference in incidence between MRL/Mp +/+ and MRL/Mp lpr/lpr mice. Corneal calcification was occasionally associated with a self-limiting keratitis and neovascularization. In control mice, corneal opacities were not observed before the animals were 6 months of age. Levels of circulating parathyroid hormone decreased significantly during the first 16 weeks of age in MRL/Mp mice. In addition, MRL/Mp mice of both sexes had a significantly lower tear fluid production as compared to BALB/c mice of the same age. Because corneal lesions start to develop in 5 -week-old MRL/Mp mice, thereby preceding the clinical signs of systemic autoimmune disease, and may develop in 6 -month-old nonautoimmune-prone mice, it is suggested that calcification develops independent of the systemic autoimmune disease and might be restricted to the corne...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Two {{hundred and}} sixty seven workers {{employed}} {{in the manufacture of}} silicon carbide (SiC) were examined {{to determine the effects of}} exposure to contaminants (SiC, quartz, and SO 2) in the workplace on pulmonary function. No exposure concentrations exceeded the current permissible limits. Ten subjects (3. 7 %) showed rounded opacities (profusion greater-than-or-equal-to 1 / 0). Two subjects employed only in the final stages of the production process and not exposed to <b>crystalline</b> silica showed <b>opacities</b> (profusion q 1 / 0 and q 2 / 1) on x ray film suggesting a role of SiC in the genesis of interstitial lung disease. Chest abnormalities on x ray film were correlated with cumulative exposure to dust and pulmonary function was affected by cumulative dust exposure, profusion of opacities, and smoking. It is concluded that the current standards do not provide adequate protection against pneumoconiosis and chronic pulmonary disease in this industry...|$|R
30|$|This little {{experiment}} - considering {{also the}} further ray path through a <b>crystalline</b> lens with <b>opacities</b> and astigmatism - casts {{doubt on the}} specific need for a “high end” geometry fundus lens. An aspheric lens design in order to correct for spherical aberrations is particularly required for the more peripheral parts of the examination lens. Near the optic axis, however, spherical aberration plays a minor role (Atchinson & Smith 2002). Fundus examination at the slit lamp mostly happens at slit dimensions less than 5  mm wide and 10  mm high. This fits easily in {{the diameter of the}} small + 90 D lens (approx. 20  mm) which questions the need to introduce “super field “or” ultra wide field” fundus lenses for the slit lamp. Furthermore larger diameters hamper the handling of the lenses close to the patient’s eye (Volk 1986). Also from our experience in clinical work we did not find any advantages of additional features like “digital lenses” specifically designed for digital imaging (Gellrich 2014 a).|$|R

This case report describes the evolution of an infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by Cladosporium sp., which developed after tectonic keratoplasty in a patient {{with a history of}} ocular trauma. Case presentation: A 40 -year-old Brazilian male was the victim of firework-induced trauma to the left eye, which resulted in a corneal laceration that could not be sutured as well as a severe traumatic cataract. The patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty and phacoemulsification. During postoperative follow-up, another therapeutic keratoplasty was required because unresponsive infectious keratitis was observed. The infiltrate’s characteristics were suggestive of infectious crystalline keratopathy; in particular, the infiltrate was insidious and progressive, and grayish-white branches appeared in the anterior corneal stroma. As different therapies were administered, inflammatory reactions ranging from mild to severe were observed. The infection was unresponsive to typical antifungal drugs. This lack of response most likely occurred due to steroid treatment and the diffuse corneal spread of an atypical microorganism, which was subsequently identified in culture as Cladosporium sp. After the second therapeutic keratoplasty, the patient’s eye integrity was successfully reestablished. Conclusion: This study likely provides the first report describing a case of infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by Cladosporium sp. This case emphasizes the clinical characteristics and outcome of this type of keratitis. Keywords: cornea, keratitis, Cladosporium, penetrating keratoplasty, corneal ulce...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Fuchs&#x 2032; uveitis {{is often}} {{diagnosed}} with substantial delay at {{the origin of}} deleterious consequences such as unnecessary treatment. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse the type and frequency of posterior inflammatory and fluorescein angiographic signs in Fuchs&#x 2032; uveitis in conjunction with the other clinical signs and evaluate their respective importance in the diagnosis of the disease. In particular, diagnostic delay and erroneous diagnoses were investigated. Patients and Methods: Patients seen in our centers between 1995 and 2008 with the diagnosis of Fuchs&#x 2032; uveitis were analysed. The data collected included age, initial and final visual acuities, clinical findings at presentation, mean diagnostic delay, erroneous diagnoses, laser flare photometry values, fundus and fluorescein angiography manifestations and ocular complications. Results: One hundred and five patients were included. The mean age at diagnosis was 34 years. Twelve patients (11. 4 &#x 0025;) had bilateral involvement. The mean diagnostic delay was 3. 04 &# 177; 4. 30 years. The most frequent clinical signs were vitreous infiltration (97. 40 &#x 0025;), typical Fuchs&#x 2032; keratic precipitates (94. 90 &#x 0025;), <b>crystalline</b> lens <b>opacities</b> or cataract (47 &#x 0025;), heterochromia (42. 60 &#x 0025;), ocular hypertension or glaucoma (12. 80 &#x 0025;). The mean laser flare photometry value at presentation was 9. 85 &# 177; 6. 28 ph/ms. Thirty-nine patients (37. 14 &#x 0025;) had undergone fluorescein angiography showing disc hyperfluorescence in 97. 7 &#x 0025; and peripheral retinal vascular leakage in 13. 6 &#x 0025;. Conclusions: Fuchs&#x 2032; uveitis is significantly underdiagnosed likely because vitreous involvement was previously described but not commonly recognized as an association with Fuchs&#x 2032; uveitis in the clinician&#x 2032;s mind and therefore has often been given a different diagnostic label. Moreover, the very frequent inflammatory signs on fluorescein angiography such as disc hyperfluorescence and more rarely peripheral retinal vascular leakage, which has not been typically associated with Fuchs&#x 2032; uveitis, appear to represent an additional factor leading to misdiagnosis. Such clinical findings need to be publicised in order to reduce misdiagnosis, and diagnostic delay...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} a blue light spectrum filter (BLSF), similar in light spectrum transmittance to the intraocular lens Acrysof NaturalTM, on standard automated perimetry (SAP) and short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP). METHODS: Twenty young individuals (< 30 y. o.), without any systemic or ocular alterations (twenty eyes) underwent a random sequence of four Humphrey visual field tests: standard automated perimetry (SAP) and short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) with and without a blue light spectrum filter. All patients had intraocular pressure lower than 21 mmHg, normal fundus biomicroscopy, and no <b>crystalline</b> lens <b>opacity.</b> Foveal threshold (FT), mean deviation (MD), and pattern standard deviation (PSD) indexes obtained from the visual field tests and the difference caused by eccentricity in short-wavelength automated perimetry examinations were analyzed using paired t test. Interindividual variability (standard deviation) was calculated using Pitman's test for correlated samples. RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in the mean deviation (p< 0. 001) and in the foveal threshold (p< 0. 001) measured by short-wavelength automated perimetry {{with the use of the}} blue light spectrum filter in comparison to short-wavelength automated perimetry without the use of the blue light spectrum filter were observed, but not in standard automated perimetry exams. No other parameters showed statistically significant differences in the short-wavelength automated perimetry and standard automated perimetry tests. Interindividual standard deviation of the test points in the short-wavelength automated perimetry exams increased with eccentricity both with and without the use of the blue light spectrum filter, as sensitivity for inferior and superior hemifields (inferior hemifield minus superior hemifield), but no statistically significant difference in the variability when comparing the use or not of the blue light spectrum filter was noted. When comparing only the four most inferior points and the four most superior points, the inferior-superior difference increases in both situations - without and with the use of the blue light spectrum filter. The difference between without and with the use of the blue light spectrum filter was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Statistically significant reductions in mean deviation and foveal threshold in the short-wavelength automated perimetry with the use of the blue light spectrum filter were observed, but not in standard automated perimetry examinations. Additional studies are necessary to determine the influence of intraocular lenses with short-wavelength light filter after cataract extraction on short-wavelength automated perimetry...|$|R
