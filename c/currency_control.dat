25|$|In {{the first}} few years of Chavez's office, his newly created social {{programs}} required large payments in order to make the desired changes. On February 5, 2003, the government created CADIVI, a <b>currency</b> <b>control</b> board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control capital flight by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency. The Chávez administration also enacted agricultural measures that caused food imports to rise dramatically, and such agricultural mainstays, such as beef, rice, and milk, slowing in domestic production. With Venezuela's reliance on imports and its lack of having dollars to pay for such imports, shortages resulted.|$|E
