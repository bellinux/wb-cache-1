On February 5, 2003, the government created CADIVI, a <b>currency</b> <b>control</b> board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control capital flight by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency. The Ch√°vez administration also enacted agricultural measures that caused food imports to rise dramatically, and such agricultural mainstays, such as beef, rice, and milk, slowing in domestic production.
