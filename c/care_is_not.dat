5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{seen as the}} true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E

25|$|Paul {{says that}} {{contrary}} to what most Americans believe, access to health <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a right, but a good whose value should {{be determined by the}} free market. In his view, government has no business in the delivery of health care. When government becomes involved, he says, costs rise and quality of care falls.|$|E
25|$|Pseudosciences such as homeopathy, even if {{generally}} benign, {{are used}} by charlatans. This poses a serious issue because it enables incompetent practitioners to administer health care. True-believing zealots may pose a more serious threat than typical con men because of their affection to homeopathy's ideology. Irrational health <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> harmless, and it is careless to create patient confidence in pseudomedicine.|$|E
25|$|If {{hospital}} <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> possible, the World Health Organization has {{guidelines for}} care {{at home that}} have been relatively successful.

25|$|Further {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} ‘early discharge’, which is defended by the Fundación Canguro, in Bogota, Colombia, and reported in evidence from a Cochrane review.

25|$|Medications and {{treatments}} {{are said to}} have a palliative effect if they relieve symptoms without having a curative effect on the underlying disease or cause. This can include treating nausea related to chemotherapy or something as simple as morphine to treat the pain of broken leg or ibuprofen to treat aching related to an influenza (flu) infection.

25|$|Pygmy goats are precocial and polyestrous breeders; bearing one to {{four young}} every nine to 12 months after a five-month {{gestation}} period.

Breeding under age does often results in c-sections. Newborn kids will nurse almost immediately, begin eating grain and roughage within a week, and are weaned by ten weeks of age.|$|E
25|$|In Georgescu's flow-fund {{model of}} production, a 'fund' factor is either labour power, farm land or {{man-made}} capital providing a useful service {{at any point}} in time; a 'stock' factor is a material or energy input that can be decumulated at will; and a 'flow' factor is a stock spread out over a period of time. The fund factors constitute the agents of the economic process, and the flow factors are used or acted upon by these agents. Unlike a stock factor, a fund factor cannot be utilised (decumulated) at will, as its rate of utilisation depends on the distinct physical properties of the fund (labour power and farm land, for instance, may run the risk of overutilisation and exhaustion if proper <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> taken).|$|E
25|$|The {{duty of care}} owed by {{trustees}} and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by courts of equity. Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like ordinary negligence actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for breach of duty is of compensation for losses rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a fiduciary position, like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its client had no second mortgage was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss.|$|E

The finding indicate that families sought the health services as soon as they perceived symptoms and had access to medical care, however such <b>care</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> decisive in resolving their health issues.

25|$|By {{department}} procedure, response requests {{are assigned}} to LMEMS resources based on their proximity to the incident and the skill level anticipated by using information gathered from the caller. When a BLS unit is closer to an incident believed to require advanced care an additional ambulance (or, if available, a chase-car) containing a paramedic is also dispatched. Using information gathered from the call, assigned resources are also instructed response with red lights and siren (termed Code-3) or without lights and siren (termed Code-1). If the BLS ambulance crew first arrives and determines that advanced <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> needed the ALS resource may be canceled and ready to respond elsewhere. Patients are transported {{to any of the}} area hospitals either Code-1 or Code-3. The decision to use, or not to use, lights and siren en route to the hospital is at the sole discretion of the crew.|$|E
25|$|The small, thick-skin berries of Mourvèdre {{are high}} in {{phenolic}} compounds that {{have the potential to}} produce a deeply colored, very tannic wine with significant alcohol levels if harvested at high sugar levels. However, the variety is rarely harvested at sugar levels below 13% alcohol (approx 23 Brix) because the flavors at those lower levels are often very weak and herbaceous. In winemaking, wines made from Mourvèdre are prone to both oxidation and reductive flavors (such as hydrogen sulfide) if <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> taken at the winery. While in Bandol, it is common to ferment Mourvèdre with the stems, the grapes usually go through a crusher/destemmer in New World regions such as a California due to the harsher, green tannins that are more typical of the stems in those regions. While the wine can be stored in oak barrels, it often does not absorb oak flavors as well as other varieties (such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) so it is often stored in neutral oak or large format barrels.|$|E
25|$|High costs {{may also}} be a factor and {{research}} by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claimed a much lower cost methodology (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which may be suitable for some fertility treatment. At the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, the prevention and treatment of infertility was accepted into the program of action for reproductive healthcare. Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control, but also on a social level as well. Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations, and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues. Currently, fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little-to-no treatment is available through public health sectors. The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible. Additionally, counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment, and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well. While quality fertility <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> readily available in developing nations (such as sub-Saharan African countries), a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention. The lack of fertility treatment is problematic, and high birth and population rates are every reason to implement treatment options rather than reject them.|$|E

500|$|As a tree grows, {{only the}} {{outermost}} tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment, so the age measured for a wood sample {{depends on where}} the sample is taken from. [...] This means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled. [...] In addition, if {{a piece of wood}} is used for multiple purposes, there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the final use in the context in which it is found. [...] This {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "old wood" [...] problem. [...] One example is the Bronze Age trackway at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway. [...] Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material. [...] It is not always possible to recognize re-use. [...] Other materials can present the same problem: for example, bitumen is known to have been used by some Neolithic communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age of the context, so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> taken. [...] A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition. [...] For example, a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than the actual age of the context in which it is deposited.|$|E
