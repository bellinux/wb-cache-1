5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis.

5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} holding in captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only polar bear.

When zoo officials {{announced plans to}} <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> attraction, citing their responsibility to ensure {{the survival of the}} species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who choked on a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, moving her to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a young male polar bear named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E

5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting {{to hold back the}} shingle or breaching the spit to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
