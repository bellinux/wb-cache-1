25|$|Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 27(f), respondent-appellee Commander S.L. Wright respectfully moves this Court to remand {{this case}} to the {{district}} court with instructions to dismiss it for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> subject matter <b>jurisdiction.</b> Respondent-appellee has conferred with counsel for petitioner-appellant, and they agree with the briefing schedule proposed below. As explained below, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), Pub. L. No. 109-366 (see Attachment1), which took effect on October 17, 2006, removes federal court jurisdiction over pending and future habeas corpus actions and any other actions filed by or on behalf of detained aliens determined by the United States to be enemy combatants, such as petitioner-appellant al- Marri, except as provided in Section1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA). In plain terms, the MCA removes this Court's jurisdiction (as well as the district court's) over al-Marri's habeas action. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss this appeal for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and remand {{the case to the}} district court with instructions to dismiss the petition for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|R
