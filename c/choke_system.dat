40|$|The world {{energy demand}} is ever {{increasing}} with every year. Oil and gas make up approximately 55 % of energy sources {{to meet the}} demand. However, hydrocarbons reserves are limited and according to peak oil theory, the peak oil has already reached/surpassed. Hence, it is a vital challenge {{to meet the demand}} by innovative and technically advance solutions to add to existing reserves. One of the main solutions is to drill more wells in the fields and environments that were deemed to be undrillable originally. Managed Pressure Drilling is a technique that allows to drill wells in very difficult scenarios such as narrow pressure window, depleted fields, extreme loss circulations etc. The hydrocarbon production from Norwegian Continental Shelf is on a decline. Hence it is even more incentive to add to the existing reserves as even 1 % increase could be equivalent to 300 billion NOK. North Sea is considered as one of the harsh environments to drill wells in. This is mainly because low temperatures and large waves. Large waves induce large heave which results in large surge and swab pressures when drill-pipe is in slips for making connections. This project deals with concept of keeping the bottom-hole pressure to almost constant value for Managed Pressure Drilling in such scenario. A lab scaled model is prepared during the previous work for this project. The model consists of bottom-hole assembly, copper tubing representing a well, <b>choke</b> <b>system</b> and pump. The work presented in this report describes various experiments conducted to determine the control valve characteristic for the <b>choke</b> <b>system.</b> This is done so that the established characteristics can be integrated to set up the fully automated system.

This can be implemented in the model to calculate the pressure drop for any given flow rate in the copper tubing. The choke characteristics and pressure drop equation were established successfully to be integrated in model and ultimately achieve the goal of maintaining almost constant bottom-hole pressure. </p...|$|E

40|$|Drilling {{performed}} from floating {{drilling rigs}} subjected to heave motion may be challenging. As the drillstring is suspended in slips during connection, the entire drillstring follows {{the motion of}} the floating rig. In harsh environment with heavy waves, drillsting heave induces severe surge and swab effects down hole. In a narrow pressure window reservoir, this effect might be crucial and worst case scenario is to lose the well. MPD on floating rigs is an approach to solve issues regarding surge and swab effects. A scaled MPD rig subjected to heave motion has been constructed at NTNU. The objective of the scaled rig is to design an automatic operated <b>choke</b> <b>system</b> to reduce pressure fluctuation due to surge and swab effects on a lab scale. A precise hydraulic model is crucial for a successful experiment. This thesis presents two different hydraulic models for the MPD heave lab. A simplified empirical model is developed based on curve matching from fixed choke experiments, this non-linear model is fairly simple and may be implemented as a controller in the heave lab. CBHP simulations based on the empirical model are performed in this thesis, but the controller has not been tested in the lab. A linear controller has been implemented in the heave lab, which reduced BHP fluctuation up to 64 % (Albert, A. 2013). A sophisticated numerical model has also been developed to analyse hydraulics in the heave lab. The numerical model simulates both flow and pressure throughout the entire heave lab. This model deviates slightly from observed data which is caused by unsteady laminar flow effects and unsteady wall shear stress due to fluid acceleration. The hydraulic analysis address important factors for a real case MPD heave compensation operation, such as; fluid acceleration effect on hydraulic friction factor and flow delay caused by fluid inertia. There is a significant uncertainty associated with along wellbore parameters, especially the unsteady hydraulic friction factor which depends on properties as wellbore geometry and formation properties. Sufficient downhole pressure sampling is crucial for a MPD heave compensation operation, wired drillpipe is therefore advisable, transmitting up to 57600 bits per second. </p...|$|E

So far transient growth analysis {{has tended to}} focus on thermoacoustic systems with acoustically compact heat sources, even though many systems are associated with distributed mean heat input, such as a premixed flame. In this work, transient growth analysis of both choked and open-ended thermoacoustic systems {{in the presence of a}} mean flow and a spatially distributed mean heat input is conducted. Unsteady heat release is modeled within the classical time-lag ℵℵ–τ formulation. Both uniform and triangular distributions for the rate of mean heat input are considered. The generation of entropy disturbances with such distributed heat input is studied first. It is shown that the entropy waves generated by the uniform and triangular distributed heat input are increased first and then decreased with increased frequency. This is different from the conventional concentrated heat input, of which the entropy waves produced is frequency-independent. In addition, the entropy eigenmodes are shown to be non-orthogonal. To quantify transient growth of flow disturbances, two energy measures are defined, calculated and compared. One is associated with the conventional acoustical energy. The other is associated with both acoustic and entropy disturbances. It is shown that the maximum transient growth View the MathML sourceGacmax of acoustical energy is in the range of 102 – 103 in the <b>choked</b> <b>system,</b> while 100 ⩽ View the MathML sourceGacmax ⩽ 101 in the open-ended system. Furthermore, the longer of the uniform distributed heat input, the larger View the MathML sourceGacmax. However, such finding is not observed for the triangular heat input. Further insights are obtained by examining the contribution of eigenmodes in different frequency ranges. It is found that the lower frequency eigenmodes play a dominant role. Finally, the effect of the interaction index ℵℵ on transient growth is examined. It is found that the maximum transient growth of acoustical energy View the MathML sourceGacmax and total energy View the MathML sourceGtotmax are decreased with increased ℵℵ. It is also found that the longer of the uniform distributed heat input, the lower View the MathML sourceGtotmax.
