40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability</b> of {{supplementary}} (occupational) pension rights for ED workers and self-employed {{has been discussed}} for more than fifteen years. The free movement of persons {{is one of the}} fundamental goals of the ED. Currently labour mobility is impeded by the lack of a clear framework protecting supplementary pension entitlements for workers and self-employed persons who move across different Member States for employment purposes. The challenge of providing enhanced social security and adequate pensions, in the light of demographic changes, further puts emphasis on the need for the ED working population {{to be able to move}} to different Member States for employment without being penalised, through reduced pension entitlements. The aim of this study is to identify the legal framework on portability of supplementary occupational pension rights for ED workers and self-employed persons who move or seek to move between the Member States for employment purposes. The examination of this framework is not limited to the analysis of actual legislative measures adopted at ED level, on safeguarding supplementary occupational pension rights for migrant workers and self-employed persons, but further tries to assess how this framework, and consequently <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability</b> of supplementary occupational pension rights, is being formed and could be further developed, and how, consequently, <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability</b> of relevant rights could be enhanced.

40|$|The EU is {{committed}} to making the Single Market fit for the digital age, by enhancing {{the protection of consumers}} and data subjects, while providing businesses with the legal certainty they need to invest in this field and support growth and innovation. In this context, European Contract Law and the Digital Single Market addresses the impact of digital technology on European Contract Law in light of the latest legislative developments including the EU Regulation of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on free movement of such data, as well as the European Commission’s proposals of 9 December 2015 for a Directive on the supply of digital content, for a Directive on online and other distance sale of goods and for a Regulation on the <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability</b> of online content services in the internal market. The book analyses new and urgent issues in the field of contract, data protection, copyright and private international law: namely the EU approach to personal information as a tradeable commodity and as the object of a fundamental right of the individuals concerned, the protection of consumers’ and users’ rights in contracts for the supply of digital content and on online and other distance sales of goods, the <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability</b> of online content services, the new features of standard contracts in the digital market and the issues surrounding the emergence of the so called platform economy. This edited collection aims to provide clear answers to the challenges posed by the digital revolution and to act as a basis for further developments of EU law...|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} the law {{applicable}} to copyright infringement on the Internet. In order to do {{so we need to}} look first of all at the rules concerning the applicable law for copyright infringement in general. Here the starting point is the Berne Convention. Its provisions give an indication of the direction in which this debate is going, but we will see that they merely provide starting points. We then move on to the approach in Europe under the Rome II Regulation and here more details become clear. Essentially, the existing rule boils down to a lex loci protectionis approach, which is in conformity with the starting point that is found in the Berne Convention. It is however doubtful whether such a country by country approach can work well in an Internet context and suggestions are made to improve the legal framework by adding a rule for ubiquitous infringement and a de minimis rule. Finally, we also briefly look at the issues surrounding the <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability</b> of online content services and the impact that the current focus on these may have in terms of the choice of law...|$|E
40|$|Although geography—and {{the need}} to {{establish}} new and distant markets—has influenced the development of international intellectual property law and policy from the very beginning, 1 the linkage between intellectual property and geography has not received much attention from policy makers and academic commentators. Nevertheless, geographically related issues abound in today’ s intellectual property field. These issues include the protection of geographical indications, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions; the discussions on intellectual property and climate change; the development of high-technology innovation clusters; the negotiation of regional trade agreements; the challenges posed by cloud-based platforms and transnational distribution; the use of geolocation tools and the mining of data involved in Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation. As an introduction to this special issue, this article will outline three sets of mismatches that demonstrate the vitality, utility and richness of analysing intellectual property developments through a geographical lens. The article begins by examining economic geography, focusing on the tensions and conflicts between territorial borders and sub-national innovation. It then examines the oft-found mismatch between political geography and cultural geography. Illustrating this mismatch is the challenge of protecting traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions. This article concludes by exploring the growing mismatch between legal geography and human geography. It discusses issues ranging from the region codes deployed to protect DVDs to the increasing consumer demand for <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability</b> of media content...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{vertical}} restraints {{in the distribution}} of audiovisual copyrighted goods (meant to version and promote the works to the targeted audience), licencing agreements are concluded on a territorial basis. Territoriality is therefore crucial in Europe, where the media market is a mosaic of 28 countries, all specific by their culture, language, industry structure and regulatory system. However, because of consumers ’ increasing mobility, the question today arises of standardising the market by introducing portable audiovisual services that subscribers could access whatever their location. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to help understanding how originates a cross-border demand for such services, and to present alternative means to respond to it. We find that tolerating a form of grey market can appear efficient, as long as the market is not yet mature (as it is the case for video on-demand services). In this situation, nomadic consumers are not impeded to have access to their service from a territory where the distributor is not authorised to exploit the licenced works. However, as the market expands, the distributor may decide to offer a legal portable service to internalise the benefits of nomadic consumption. The shift toward portability induces an additional fixed cost, linked to the adaptation of the service and of copyright enforcement techniques to international distribution on the one hand, and to supplementary private copying levies on the other hand. The legislator should therefore estimate the impact of this additional cost before regulating the specific matter of <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|In their {{research}} in the field of international education, the editors found that the university admission function of terminating school assessment has largely eclipsed the school-leaving-certification aspect in systems where the two go together. But it is not only students from education systems which have curriculum-based external examinations at the culmination of schooling who aspire to enter university. Once the privilege of the well-heeled classes, university education has become to today’s middle-class youngster what a high school certificate was to preceding generations at the same stage of life. Be it the demands of the ‘knowledge society’ or merely credential inflation, a great many young people now regard tertiary education as the means by which to realise their ambitions. Schooling has become a stepping-stone to post-school education and training (e. g., university). This edited volume accordingly focuses on the transition from school to university. In broad terms, {{there are two kinds of}} university admission systems: first, those in which upper secondary school qualifications explicitly confer the right to enrol at university, and second, those in which they do not. Some systems exhibit an additional layer of testing between those leading to school certification and the attainment of university entrance status. Securing the general right to enter university may only be a first step. Individual universities may impose their own entrance requirements, particularly in the case of competitive-entry programmes. These may involve selection procedures not associated with examinations or tests. In some systems, a student may be able to enrol in selective faculties directly upon making the transition from school; in others, there may be a significant lapse of time separating general university admission and enrolment in a desired field via ‘pre-’ courses or even first degrees in other fields. ‘Massification’, university autonomy, and student competition for places in highly esteemed programmes leading to the need for comparability mechanisms among entry qualifications are identified as three sets of factors that exert powerful influences on university admission policies and practices. University education represents a major public and private investment in human capital formation and is also a prominent ideological arena; access to university has come to be regarded as a right rather than a privilege in many societies. University entrance policies may be seen as constantly shifting pivots between the two opposing forces favouring the limiting of access and the freeing up of access. Given the importance of securing the ‘right’ tertiary education, students are becoming more choosy about which university they attend. This can present problems for federal entities with a multiplicity of education systems within their borders, especially when divergence in end-of-school assessment procedures has occurred to the point where the establishment of comparability among the constituent entities is less than straightforward. The <b>cross-border</b> <b>portability</b> of university admission credentials is addressed through the inclusion of several such national systems. Whereas comparability is a ubiquitous issue permeating the transition to university, convergence and congruence are harder to find. But, the editors argue, they are necessary in an increasingly globalising world of higher education. The question, though, is how they will come to fruition. The final chapter, ‘Synthesis’, discusses the merits and demerits of conducting university entrance examinations or tests separate from terminating assessments leading to school certification. In accordance with the unifying theme of the two volumes, the editors come down in favour of systems in which external end-of-school examinations obviate the need for an additional layer of standardised testing between school and university, which strengthens the upper secondary school tier through its focus on secondary-tertiary alignment.
