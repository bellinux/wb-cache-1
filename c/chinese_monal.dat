50|$|The <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> (Lophophorus lhuysii) is a pheasant. This monal is {{restricted}} to mountains of central China. The plumage is highly iridescent. The male has a large drooping purple crest, a metallic green head, blue bare skin around the eyes, a reddish gold mantle, bluish green feathers and black underparts. The female is dark brown with white on its throat.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{distribution}} {{and the extent of}} suitable habitats is crucial for wildlife conservation and management. Knowledge is limited regarding the natural habitats of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> (Lophophorus lhuysii), which is a vulnerable Galliform species endemic to the high-montane areas of southwest China and a good candidate for being an umbrella species in the Qionglai Mountains. Using ecological niche modeling, we predicted current potential suitable habitats for the <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> in the Qionglai Mountains with 64 presence points collected between 2005 and 2015. Suitable habitats of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> were associated with about 31 mm precipitation of the driest quarter, about 15  °C of maximum temperature of the warmest month, and far from the nearest human residential locations (> 5, 000 m). The predicted suitable habitats of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>monal</b> covered an area of 2, 490 km 2, approximately 9. 48 % of the Qionglai Mountains, and was highly fragmented. 54. 78 % of the suitable habitats were under the protection of existing nature reserves and two conservation gaps were found. Based on these results, we provide four suggestions for the conservation management of the Chinese monal: (1) ad hoc surveys targeting potential suitable habitats to determine species occurrence, (2) more ecological studies regarding its dispersal capacity, (3) establishment of more corridors and green bridges across roads for facilitating species movement or dispersal, and (4) minimization of local disturbances...|$|E
