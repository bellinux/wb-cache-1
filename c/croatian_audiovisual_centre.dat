40|$|School {{libraries}} {{developed during}} the 20 th century. Because of the great technological and cultural strides made especially in the west, the term "school library " {{has taken on a}} new and wider meaning, and does not simply denote a place used for filing and storing books. The development of contemporary school libraries keeps abreast with introducing new, radically different views about educational systems and the relationship between teachers and pupils. The influence and importance of libraries for young people has been extensively discussed, from public figures like Franklin Roosevelt, who remarked that, "after the church and the school, the library has the most positive effect on young people " (Big Pedagogic Encyclopaedia 1968), to scholars such as Stathopoulos (1960), who wrote that "the library is rendered essential for every intellectual institution, it is really essential and necessary for the primary school, since it constitutes a big and rare treasure, " and who quotes Jean Mace as saying that the "supplement of the primary school is the constitution of libraries. The first one is the key but the second one is the residence. " Haralampopoulos (1963) states that that "the library is a basic element that leads to the education and to the spiritual culture of students. " Nevertheless, even in the late 20 th century, the school library is still sometimes a metal cupboard with books, locked {{in the office of the}} school director, seldom updated. It may also coexist with an <b>audiovisual</b> <b>centre,</b> a collection films...|$|R

5000|$|In 1964, Correa, {{together}} with Mehta and Patel, proposed {{a plan for}} New Bombay (now known as Navi Mumbai), which {{was different from the}} earlier plans prepared to extend the city limits upstream of the peninsula. Their vision has been compared to that in the popular Bollywood film Shre 420, a film set in Bombay, the theme of which was hope. In this effort under the influence of MARG, CIDCO gave them [...] "key decision-making positions" [...] which enabled them to prepare the Draft Development Plan of October 1973. This plan was approved for implementation in August 1979. The plan proposed government initiatives which included building new roads, bridges and industrial zoning. Mehta and her husband were also involved in dance, and she tried to blend the rhythm of the dance form in the planning of her buildings. A fine example of her blending the two forms is reflected in the <b>audiovisual</b> recording <b>centre</b> at Arehi, where in a limited space of 600 sq ft, she maintained an aesthetic presentation of folklore and traditional colours.|$|R

5000|$|Some authors {{describe}} {{the first part}} of his career as a sequence of trilogies. His first feature film, The White Ship (1941) was sponsored by the <b>audiovisual</b> propaganda <b>centre</b> of Navy Department and is the first work in Rossellini's [...] "Fascist Trilogy", together with A Pilot Returns (1942) and The Man with a Cross (1943). To this period belongs his friendship and cooperation with Federico Fellini and Aldo Fabrizi. The Fascist regime collapsed in 1943 and just two months after the liberation of Rome (4 June 1944), Rossellini was already preparing the anti-fascist Roma città aperta (Rome, Open City 1945). Fellini assisted on the script and Fabrizi played the role of the priest, while Rossellini self-produced. Most of the money came from credits and loans, and film had to be found on the black market. This dramatic film was an immediate success. Rossellini had started now his so-called Neorealistic Trilogy, the second title of which was Paisà (1946), produced with non-professional actors, and the third, Germany, Year Zero (1948), sponsored by a French producer and filmed in Berlin's French sector. In Berlin also, Rossellini preferred non-actors, but he was unable to find a face he found [...] "interesting"; he placed his camera {{in the center of a}} town square, as he did for Paisà, but was surprised when nobody came to watch.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the acquisition {{and content of}} a new multi-modal database. Some tools for making use of the data streams are also presented. The Computational Audio- Visual Analysis (CAVA) database is a unique collection of three synchronised data streams obtained from a binaural microphone pair, a stereoscopic camera pair and a head tracking device. All recordings are made {{from the perspective of}} a person; i. e. what would a human with natural head movements see and hear in a given environment. The database is intended to facilitate research into humans' ability to optimise their multi-modal sensory input and fills a gap by providing data that enables human <b>centred</b> <b>audiovisual</b> scene analysis. It also enables 3 D localisation using either audio, visual, or audio-visual cues. A total of 50 sessions, with varying degrees of visual and auditory complexity, were recorded. These range from seeing and hearing a single speaker moving in and out of field of view, to moving around a 'cocktail party' style situation, mingling and joining different small groups of people chatting...|$|R
40|$|This {{video is}} a re-presentation of a {{generative}} <b>audiovisual</b> installation, the <b>centre</b> {{piece of the}} exhibition Exposure: Living in Extreme Environments created in collaboration with geoarcheologist Dr Paul Adderley (University of Stirling, Scotland). The broad theme is the co-evolutionary, mutually dependent relationship between human populations and their environment. Our work focuses on Adderley's scientific research undertaken in Greenland, looking at the historical record (revealed by excavations and soils analysis) of population behaviour over that last 1000 years. The soil itself is taken as an artefact of past human habitation, land use and cultural activity. Image work and data analysis obtained from processed soil samples are re-appropriated in this installation and presented alongside with location-specific and historically-referenced sound recordings. The chronology of the images and data structure the piece: data guide a generative system that selects images, sound materials and live audio and visual processing techniques. Implementation is in Max/MSP/Jitter. In this short experimental video, 1000 years of data are cycled once. This work was undertaken with support of the Research Councils UK...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the lenses}} of {{contemporary}} cultural geography, this research develops {{an understanding of}} pilgrimage as a relational and reciprocal process that co-produces self and world. Drawing on the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, I argue that through the performances and experiences of contemporary pilgrimage in Ireland, participants and locations emerge as pilgrims and pilgrimage places. This approach unites different strands of cultural geography, including the mobilities field, more-than representational concerns, discussions of embodiment and practice, emotional and affective geographies, and religious and spiritual geographies. I explore how pilgrimage is an active process in which self and world, belief and practice, and the numinous and material entwine and merge. An autoethnographic methodology is enacted as an embodied, intersubjective, and reflexive research approach that incorporates the motivations, experiences, and beliefs of research participants, alongside my own descriptions and reflections. The methodology is focused on encountering and documenting pilgrimage practices as they occur in place and relating these embodied spatial practices to the accounts of pilgrims. The insights generated by engagements with research participants and through my own pilgrimages, offer new appreciations of the enduring appeal of pilgrimage in Ireland as a religious-spiritual and cultural activity that allows people to express personal intentions, to develop their faith, and to seek numinous encounters. Through the pilgrimages at Lough Derg, Croagh Patrick, and three holy wells, I produce a layered account of the empirical circumstances of the practices. The presentation of these places and events is enhanced {{by the use of}} evocative images and <b>audiovisual</b> recordings. By <b>centring</b> my study on the practices and experiences of different pilgrimages in present-day Ireland, and critically deploying strands of cultural geography and pilgrimage studies, this research produces new qualitative understandings of pilgrimage and contributes to discussions concerned with the relationships between self and world...|$|R
