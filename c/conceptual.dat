5|$|Far Side Virtual was {{met with}} {{polarizing}} but generally positive reviews, with most critics commending its <b>conceptual</b> underpinnings and noting its ambiguous relationship to its subject. It was named {{album of the year}} by UK magazine The Wire, a decision which {{was met with}} contention from some journalists and readers. The album has since been cited as one of the original releases and catalysts of vaporwave, an Internet-based electronic music microgenre that covers much of the same sonic and <b>conceptual</b> territory.|$|E

5|$|Marion Little {{examines}} theoretical frameworks {{related to}} NVC. The influential interest-based model for conflict resolution, negotiation, and mediation developed by Fisher, Ury, and Patton at the Harvard Negotiation Project in the 1980s {{appears to have}} some <b>conceptual</b> overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other. Little suggests The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on <b>conceptual</b> similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection. Like Rosenberg, Gordon had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.|$|E

25|$|Haiman {{describes}} iconic {{expression and}} <b>conceptual</b> distance and how two concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect {{each other and}} cannot be separated from one another. Joseph Greenberg hypothesizes that {{the distance between the}} possessor and possessee in a sentence with alienable possession will be greater than it will be in sentences inalienable constructions. Because the possessor and the possessee have a close <b>conceptual</b> relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect this and {{there will not be a}} lot of distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would in turn increase their <b>conceptual</b> independence.|$|E
