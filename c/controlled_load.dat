40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model of}} {{distributed}} power system with power electronic <b>controlled</b> <b>loads.</b> Distribution networks transport the electrical energy from the transmission substations to the various loads. There are so many power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> that are connected in the distribution power system. Due to intensive use of power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> in an industry and other consumers in general, the harmonics produces a distortion in distribution network. Therefore, to protect the power system from the power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads,</b> {{it is very important}} to identify the types and number of all the working power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads.</b> The result of this paper shows that the method of calculating the number and also the types of all working power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> in any distribution system. A Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) Spectrum technique is used to identify the power electronics <b>controlled</b> <b>loads</b> in distribution power system.

5000|$|Demand {{response}} {{places the}} [...] "on-off switch" [...] {{in the hands}} of the consumer using devices such as a smart grid <b>controlled</b> <b>load</b> control switch. While many residential consumers pay a flat rate for electricity year-round, the utility's costs actually vary constantly, depending on demand, the distribution network, and composition of the company's electricity generation portfolio. In a free market, the wholesale price of energy varies widely throughout the day. Demand response programs such as those enabled by smart grids attempt to incentivize the consumer to limit usage based upon cost concerns. As costs rise during the day (as the system reaches peak capacity and more expensive peaking power plants are used), a free market economy should allow the price to rise. A corresponding drop in demand for the commodity should meet a fall in price. While this works for predictable shortages, many crises develop within seconds due to unforeseen equipment failures. They must be resolved in the same time-frame in order to avoid a power blackout. Many utilities who are interested in demand response have also expressed an interest in load control capability so that they might be able to operate the [...] "on-off switch" [...] before price updates could be published to the consumers.|$|E

The methodology is known as network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> for the IN.

We also provide analytical proofs of these results on the CL(#) scheduler.

40|$|Safety {{control of}} {{concrete}} dams is required {{due to the}} potential great loss of life and property in case of dam failure. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to feed back the operational <b>control</b> <b>loads</b> for concrete dam displacement using the maximum entropy method. The proposed method is not aimed at a judgement about the safety conditions of the dam. When a strong trend-line effect is evident, the method should be carefully applied. In these cases, the hydrostatic and temperature effects are added to the irreversible displacements, thus maximum operational loads should be accordingly reduced. The probability density function for the extreme load effect component of dam displacement can be selected by employing the principle of maximum entropy, which is effective to construct the least subjective probability density distribution merely given the moments information from the stated data. The critical load effect component in the warning criterion can be determined through the corresponding cumulative distribution function obtained by the maximum entropy method. Then the <b>control</b> <b>loads</b> feedback of concrete dam displacement is realized by the proposed warning criterion. The proposed method is applied to a concrete dam. A comparison of the results shows that the maximum entropy method can feed back rational <b>control</b> <b>loads</b> for the dam displacement. The <b>control</b> <b>loads</b> diagram obtained can be a straightforward and visual tool to the operation and management department of the concrete dam. The result from the proposed method is recommended to be used due to minimal subjectivity...|$|R
