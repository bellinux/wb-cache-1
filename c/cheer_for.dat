5|$|In five Summer League games, {{while playing}} both guard positions, Lin {{averaged}} 9.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.2 steals in 18.6 minutes {{per game and}} shot a team-leading 54.5% from the floor. He outplayed first overall pick John Wall. Lin scored 13 points to Wall's 21, but did so on 6-for-12 shooting in 28 minutes; Wall was 4-for-19 in 33 minutes. While Wall received the biggest <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> any player during introductions, the crowd turned on Wall and was cheering for Lin {{by the end of}} the game.|$|E

5|$|Since their {{inception}} in 1960, Maribor {{have developed a}} loyal, passionate and dedicated fanbase. After Slovenia declared independence in 1991, most of the town's industry perished and over 25% {{of the population was}} unemployed. Still, the people remained loyal to the club. Besides the city of Maribor and the surrounding area, the club also has a large fan base in the regions of Styria and Carinthia. A small number of supporters are also present in Ilirska Bistrica in the Slovenian Littoral. Soon after the foundation of Maribor, the club was branded as the citizens club, while their city rivals Železničar Maribor has always been branded as the club of the working class. This was mainly because Maribor was seen, by the fans, as the successor of Branik Maribor, a club that folded in 1960. Many fans of Branik then started to <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> Maribor, a club that was founded only couple of months later.|$|E
5|$|The National League {{got things}} {{started in the}} bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and {{proceeded}} to steal second. He scored on an RBI single by Ken Griffey, Jr. to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> {{in the bottom of}} the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what became the first and only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.|$|E

25|$|The {{newspaper}} editorials {{on the eve}} of the election held little <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> either party. The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Telegraph had each endorsed Labor at the 2003 election. Though each newspaper expressed misgivings about Debnam's campaigning ability and called the result in Labor's favour, they were unanimous in their attack on Iemma's record.|$|E
25|$|Since {{many of the}} Gauls and Germans joined Caesar's army {{after his}} victory over Gaul, their war chants {{were added to the}} Roman oeuvre of army songs: When 2000 {{soldiers}} from the Gallic cavalry defected to Octavian before the battle of Actium, they didn't only <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> Caesar but presented genuine Gallic war songs. Probably the most popular vocal performers were the Celtic bards, whose national heroic songs were known in Rome throughout antiquity.|$|E

25|$|Michigan {{seemed to}} be {{fighting}} for a hopeless cause and the hand crawled around the clock {{toward the end of}} the game. In that moment of despair for all those who <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> Michigan, Harmon came out of nowhere to dominate the field. When the Yale line braced on its own goal, Harmon gambled by waiting patiently with the ball in his hand until John Nicholson could get free to catch the pass that meant defeat for Yale.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} their 12–0 victory, Mönchengladbach missed out on the league title since 1. FC Köln beat FC St. Pauli 5–0 in Hamburg and became champions thanks to their {{slightly}} better goal difference. The supporters of St. Pauli had become skeptical when the intermediate results from Mönchengladbach had been announced and started to <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> the team from Cologne. After the game they celebrated the championship with the guests, and a long-lasting friendship between the supporters of both teams started.|$|E

25|$|There was <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> England fans on {{the third}} day, as the England regular Flintoff was back to his belligerent best, scoring 83 from 101 balls. Stuart Law also made 83, but was slower, taking 152 balls. With support from Dominic Cork (57), Lancashire were able to set a fair target. Their 377 left Worcestershire 268 to win. They lost Peters first ball, and Moore also fell, but with Lancashire {{pitching}} short to Hick, it was 58 for 2 at close.|$|E
25|$|These {{nationwide}} tournaments enjoy widespread popularity, arguably {{equal to}} or greater than professional baseball. Qualifying tournaments are often televised locally and each game of the final stage at Kōshien is televised nationally on NHK. The tournaments have become a national tradition, and large numbers of frenzied students and parents travel from hometowns to <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> their local team. It is a common sight to see players walking off the field in tears after being eliminated from the tournament by a loss.|$|E

25|$|When the {{conventions}} of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views {{in a speech to}} the Republican convention in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as she was telling the convention that women did not want to vote, a crowd of suffragists burst into the hall and filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.|$|E
25|$|The Dos Leyendas show {{featured}} a new entrance {{set up by}} CMLL, featuring three large video screens and separate staircases for the rudos and tecnicos to come down during their introductions. The crowd {{was estimated to be}} over 14,000 spectators in total, which was a significant improvement compared to the attendance of the Super Viernes shows of the previous weeks, which had drawn less than half those numbers. In the opening match La Dinastía Casas ("The Casas Dynasty") of El Felino and his sons Puma and Tiger shows their team unity with their black and white ring gear as well as Puma and Tiger both wearing masks that combined their own mask design with that of their brother. While the team of Delta, Guerrero Maya Jr. and Tritón came ready to fight El Felino was fired up and motivated by teaming with his sons, which showed in his performance in the match. Puma and Tiger had been at odds at times before the show, but there was no signs of dissension during the match as La Dinastía Casas won both the second and third fall, taking the final fall with Tiger and Puma pinning their opponents. The second match clearly demonstrated that Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Mephisto and Ephesto) work as a well functioning team due to their many years of experience from teaming together, the three managed to win the first fall over La Máscara, Máscara Dorada and Valiente in convincing fashion, {{so much so that the}} Arena Mexico crowd were cheering for the team despite them being the rudos in the match. During the second fall the high flying moves and skills of Máscara Dorada was the only time the crowd would <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> the tecnico side, supporting them as they won the second fall. In the third and deciding fall Averno got the pinfall victory for his team, giving Los Hijos del Averno a very appreciated victory.|$|E

After an introduction by MC Hugh Cherry, who encouraged the prisoners to [...] "respond" [...] to Cash's performance, Carl Perkins took the stage and performed his hit song [...] "Blue Suede Shoes". Following this song, the Statler Brothers sang their hit [...] "Flowers on the Wall" [...] and the country standard [...] "This Old House". Cherry returned to the stage and instructed the inmates not to <b>cheer</b> <b>for</b> Cash until he introduced himself; they obliged.|$|E
