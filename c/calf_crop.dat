Second generation breed groups included cows sired by HB {{and out of}} HB dams (F 2 HB) and BH dams (HBxBH); and cows sired by BH and out of HB dams (BHxHB) and BH dams (F 2 BH). Least squares means were calculated for <b>calf</b> <b>crop</b> born, <b>calf</b> <b>crop</b> weaned, and calf birth and weaning weights, using numerous different models, where the trait was the dependent variable.

40|$|A {{selection}} {{experiment was}} established in 1981 to increase twinning rate in cattle. Results reported are through 1993 <b>calf</b> <b>crops.</b> Estimates of genetic parameters for a two-trait twinning and ovulation rate model with genetic groups were as follows: heritabilities of. 03 for twinning and. 07 for ovulation rates with a genetic correlation of nearly 1. 00 and fractional permanent environmental variances of. 06 for twinning and. 05 for ovulation rate. Corresponding estimates when group effects were ignored were as follows: heritabilities of. 08 and. 08 and fractional permanent environmental variances of. 02 and. 04 for twinning and ovulation rates, respectively. Twinning rate (percentage) in the project at the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center has increased in all cows born in the project by year of calving from 3. 4...|$|R
40|$|Which of the {{following}} herds is more profitable: herd A that weans a 90 % <b>calf</b> <b>crop</b> of 450 lb. calves that go on to grade 60 % Choice or herd B that weans a 95 % <b>calf</b> <b>crop</b> of 600 lb. calves that go on to grade 80 % Choice? Obviously the question can not be answered with the information at hand. We have only the output side of the profitability equation {{and none of the}} inputs. It is likely that herd B will generate more revenue, but without knowing the costs of producing that revenue we can never know which herd is more profitable. Unfortunately, measuring costs to track true profitability in cow herds has been a difficult task. Therefore, identifying production factors that are correlated to profitability could possibly help producers make management changes to improve the financial standing of their cow-calf enterprise...|$|E

40|$|It {{has always}} been the mindset of ranchers to produce a <b>calf</b> <b>crop</b> as cheap as possible, pass it off to the next phase of production, and then focus on doing the same thing to the next year’s production. Asking them to do {{something}} that adds value down the production chain that does not add value or saleable pounds at the ranch of origin generally falls on deaf ears. However, in recent years market signals are being sent to not only heighten their awareness of things they can do at the ranch to create value, but in many cases make it a financial incentive to do so. First, ranches need to know how their <b>calf</b> <b>crop</b> fits the needs of the beef industry and learn what creates value in the post-weaning phase of beef production, and only then, can they determine whether or not their genetics and management systems are competitive in the beef marketing system...|$|E
40|$|Breed {{differences}} in performance characteristics {{are an important}} genetic resource for improving efficiency of beef production. Diverse breeds are required to exploit heterosis and complementarity through crossbreeding and to match genetic potential with diverse market requirements and climatic zone-feed resource situations [...] Genetic variation among breeds {{can be used to}} provide an array of beef products that differ widely in fat and caloric content. Diverse feed resources will continue to be used for cow herds among and within different geographical regions of the U. S. Thus, it is important to characterize breeds of cattle representing different biological types for a wide spectrum of bioeconomic traits contributing to beef production. This report presents preliminary results from the first two of five <b>calf</b> <b>crops</b> to be produced in the fourth cycle of the Germ Plasm Evaluation Program (GPE) at U. S.

40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} the proper selection, nutrition, breeding, {{and management of}} replacement beef heifers from weaning to breeding. Proper selection and development of replacement heifers {{is one of the}} most important management programs in beef production. Replacement heifers should be selected and managed so they will conceive and calve early in the calving season, provide adequate milk production, and rebreed and calve every 365 days. Heifers bred as yearlings to calve as two-year-olds will produce an extra calf in their lifetime compared to heifers calving as three-year-olds, without detrimental effects on mature size, milk production, or calf weaning weights. The type of management heifers receive from birth to breeding has a great influence on their lifetime calf production. Therefore, it is imperative that heifers be selected and developed properly for efficient and optimum production over eight to ten <b>calf</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R
40|$|Over the 4 <b>calf</b> <b>crops,</b> highgrade Simmental calves were heavier at birth, 50, 126 and 205 (weaning) days of age (41, 83, 166, 220 kg, respectively) than Belmont Red (33, 72, 141, 191 kg) and Hereford (36, 71, 138, 184 kg) calves. Belmont Red calves were {{significantly}} heavier than Hereford calves at 205 days {{but not at}} other ages, while Hereford calves were heavier than Belmont Red at birth. The advantage to highgrade Simmental calves was greatest during above average seasonal conditions and under these conditions Hereford calves were similar to Belmont Red calves. Conversely, under adverse seasonal conditions Belmont Red calves were heavier than Hereford calves. The 4 -year average May liveweight of highgrade Simmental cows (519 kg) was heavier than Belmont Red (481 kg) which was heavier than Hereford (465 kg). Highgrade Simmental breeders were always heavier than Hereford and Belmont Red. Production of weaner liveweight per breeder was 125, 132 and 155 kg for Hereford, highgrade Simmental and Belmont Red, respectively. These weights represented 27, 25 and 32 kg weaner production respectively per 100 kg breeder liveweight supported...|$|R
