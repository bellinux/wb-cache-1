40|$|Abstract. Muscholl and Petersen showed that, in {{the case}} <b>of</b> {{transitive}} dependencies, <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> star-free lexicographic languages are star-free or non-regular. It implies that, in the same case <b>of</b> transitive dependencies, <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> star-free lexicographic languages are star-free. In this paper, it is shown to be true also {{in the case}} of transitive independencies. Main result is even more general, but the general question, if <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> star-free lexicographic languages are star-free in any case, remains open. ...|$|R
