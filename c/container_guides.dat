5000|$|Numerous {{systems are}} used to secure {{containers}} aboard ships, depending on {{factors such as the}} type of ship, the type of container, and the location of the container. [...] Stowage inside the holds of fully cellular (FC) ships is simplest, typically using simple metal forms called <b>container</b> <b>guides,</b> locating cones, and anti-rack spacers to lock the containers together. [...] Above-decks, without the extra support of the cell guides, more complicated equipment is used. [...] Three types of systems are currently in wide use: lashing systems, locking systems, and buttress systems. [...] Lashing systems secure containers to the ship using devices made from wire rope, rigid rods, or chains and devices to tension the lashings, such as turnbuckles. [...] The effectiveness of lashings is increased by securing containers to each other, either by simple metal forms (such as stacking cones) or more complicated devices such as twist-lock stackers. [...] A typical twist-lock is inserted into the casting hole of one container and rotated to hold it in place, then another container is lowered on top of it. [...] The two containers are locked together by twisting the device's handle. [...] A typical twist-lock is constructed of forged steel and ductile iron and has a shear strength of 48 metric tons.|$|E

50|$|Canister shot, {{also known}} as case shot, was {{packaged}} in a tin or brass <b>container,</b> possibly <b>guided</b> by a wooden sabot. Canister balls {{did not have to}} punch through the wooden hull of a ship, so they were smaller and more numerous. The later shrapnel shell was similar, but with a much greater range.|$|R

40|$|In this {{communication}} {{we describe}} a new pico-nanoliter scale chemical encapsulation and delivery {{system in the}} form of 3 D metallic containers with controlled surface porosity. The advantageous attributes of the containers are a parallel fabrication process with versatility in size and shape, precise and monodisperse surface porosity, and the ability for remote guidance using magnetic fields. We demonstrate the isotropic and anisotropic release of reagents from the <b>containers,</b> remotely <b>guided</b> chemical release, and spatially controlled chemical reactions in microwells. The arbitrary chemical patterns that can be generated are not limited by flow profiles in conventional microfluidics that must often be formed downstream from a channel inlet. These containers suggest a new strategy for precisely engineering spatially localized chemical reactions with subnanoliter scale control. In the past decade, microtechnology has greatly impacted th...|$|R
50|$|On 20 November 1904, {{the first}} Police Training Centre {{was formed by}} Captain Graham, the Malay States <b>Guides</b> <b>container</b> officer. It was located at Bluff Road which was later renamed as Bukit Aman Street. It is now the {{location}} of Bukit Aman's Police Headquarters which used VB to be called Malay States Guides Command Headquarters of Kuala Lumpur. The area consists of 249.5 acres or 41.6 hectare. In 1905, the centre admitted its first intake with 207 Malay and 219 Indian recruits.|$|R
5000|$|Another key {{component}} of dedicated container-ship design {{is the use of}} cell guides. [...] Cell guides are strong vertical structures constructed of metal installed into a ship's cargo holds. [...] These structures <b>guide</b> <b>containers</b> into well-defined rows during the loading process and provide some support for containers against the ship's rolling at sea. [...] So fundamental to container ship design are cell guides that organizations such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development use their presence to distinguish dedicated container ships from general break-bulk cargo ships.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel container-centric memory {{allocation}} scheme. In this scheme, the <b>container’s</b> semantics <b>guide</b> the memory allocation, {{which results in}} data locality improvement and execution time reduction. The container-centric allocation provides the benefits of custom memory allocation, with the portability advantage. Applications need not change a single line of code, but rather change the underlying container library. Container-centric memory allocation increases data locality and reduces execution time, at no cost. At compile time, the container’s semantics provide knowledge which is evaluated at run-time, and then used for more efficient memory clustering. Our approach enables an application to use different allocation policies for different types of containers, or even different instantiations of {{the same type of}} container. We have integrated our memory allocator, named Defero, with the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers for automatic usage. We have used Defero in applications such as compiler infrastructure, molecular dynamics, network simulation, as well as on micro-kernels. ...|$|R
2500|$|Understanding of others' {{intentions}} {{is another}} critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality, or [...] "aboutness", {{is a fundamental}} feature of mental states and events. The [...] "intentional stance" [...] has been defined by Daniel Dennett as an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires. Both 2- and 3-year-old children could discriminate when an experimenter intentionally vs. accidentally marked a box with stickers as baited. Even earlier in ontogeny, Andrew N. Meltzoff found that 18-month-old infants could perform target manipulations that adult experimenters attempted and failed, suggesting the infants could represent the object-manipulating behavior of adults as involving goals and intentions. While attribution of intention (the box-marking) and knowledge (false-belief tasks) is investigated in young humans and nonhuman animals to detect precursors to a theory of mind, Gagliardi et al. {{have pointed out that}} even adult humans do not always act in a way consistent with an attributional perspective. In the experiment, adult human subjects made choices about baited <b>containers</b> when <b>guided</b> by confederates who could not see (and therefore, not know) which container was baited.|$|R
25|$|Using {{the damage}} to {{adjacent}} <b>container</b> AVN7511 to <b>guide</b> them, the investigators concluded that the explosion had occurred about 13inches (330mm) {{from the floor of}} AVE4041 and about 25inches (640mm) from the skin of the fuselage. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigators then conducted a series of tests in the United States, at which Alan Feraday of Britain's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) is understood to have been present. The tests involved using metal containers loaded with luggage, and detonating plastic explosive within Toshiba radio cassette players in garment-filled suitcases, so as to replicate the sooting and pitting pattern of AVE4041. The tests were said to have proved AAIB investigators' theory concerning both the position of the bomb and the quantity of explosive involved.|$|R
40|$|Container {{transport}} operations have been extending inland, providing more comprehensive service across the shipping network. Accordingly, container transport operators are making extensive capital investments in deploying inland container depot (ICD) networks. Optimizing {{the location of}} such facilities financially is vital for both capital and operating efficiencies. Currently, there are no models at the regional network level to <b>guide</b> <b>container</b> operators in locating ICDs on their networks. This research studies the ICD location problem and develops a comprehensive ICD location model. Based on comprehensive analysis of the container transport industry, focusing on ICD operations, this thesis developed a useful formulation of the ICD location problem. It recognizes and emphasizes the need to embody the endogenous demand and market competitiveness in the container transport business. The formulation combines the multinomial logit model of discrete choice analysis to quantitatively describe the shipper’s behaviors and preferences, addressing both the endogenous demand and market competitiveness. Fixed charge facility location problems are considered or proven to be NP complete...|$|R

John Bedford, one of Pan Am's loader-drivers at Heathrow, was able to give evidence about the precise location within PA 103 of the baggage container, as well as the location of suitcases inside it, all of which helped investigators piece together how the bomb suitcase came to be there. Bedford particularly remembered handling container AVE4041, he told investigators, because he was born in 1940, and his wife in 1941.|$|R
