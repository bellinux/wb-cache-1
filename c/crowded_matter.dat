40|$|Abstract: This article {{examines}} the effects of competitive crowding on social action. Our contributions are twofold. First, we clarify a structural determinant of conduct in a sharply defined hierarchy. Although empirical studies in different areas of sociology have demonstrated the multifaceted consequences of crowding around social positions, much of the existing work has addressed lateral rather than hierarchical differentiation. Here, we specify the unique effect of crowding by those positioned behind a focal actor in a hierarchical ordering, net {{of the opportunity to}} surpass others located above that actor. Our results show that <b>crowding</b> <b>matters</b> more than opportunity. Second, we document a contingent effect of crowding {{as a function of the}} time it takes for the hierarchy in which actors are embedded to stabilize. We posit that hierarchies exert sway only after their constitutive elements lock into place and appear reasonably stable among those competing for positions within them. The empirical context we examine is the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR). Using panel data on NASCAR’s Winston Cup Series, we model the probability that a driver will crash his car in a given race. We find that (a) drivers crash with greater frequency when thei...|$|R

A multimodal social welfare maximisation model with spatially disaggregated demand is developed, in which users choose between travelling by bus, car or walking in a transport corridor. Optimisation variables are bus fare, congestion toll, bus frequency, bus size, fare collection system, bus boarding policy and the number of seats inside buses. We find that optimal bus frequency results from a trade-off between the level of congestion inside buses, i. e., passengers’ crowding, and the level of congestion outside buses, i. e., the effect of frequency on slowing down both buses and cars in mixed-traffic roads. A numerical application shows that optimal frequency is quite sensitive to the assumptions on crowding costs, impact of buses on traffic congestion, and overall congestion level. If <b>crowding</b> <b>matters</b> to users, buses should have as many seats as possible, up to a minimum area that must be left free of seats. If for any other reason planners decide to have buses with fewer seats than optimal (e. g., to increase bus capacity), frequency should be increased to compensate for the discomfort imposed on public transport users. Finally, the consideration of crowding externalities (on both seating and standing) imposes a sizeable increase in the optimal bus fare, and consequently, a reduction of the optimal bus subsidy...|$|R

For example, in home furnishing industry, although the world leader - IKEA strived to implement its differentiation and cost leadership strategies that had brought tremendous success in the other markets worldwide, the company’s performance in this distinctive developing country had not progressed much, unlike other parts of the world. Thus, there must be some factors that foreign companies ignored, which led to this situation. That how Chinese think, what exactly trigger them to buy? There is little research on home furnishing industry regarding those questions inside Chinese market. In this article, through observation of the consumer behavior of Chinese people in the home furnishing industry, and focusing on the “mianzi” factor in Chinese consumer behavior, with a quantitative research method, to examine possible correlations with “mianzi” gaining. After a detailed linear regression through SPSS with data collected from 309 candidates both online and offline, the result shows that price and noticeability of home furnishing are key factors that let the Chinese consumer gain “mianzi”; further, lead to competitive consumption and conspicuous consumption, rather than the brand of the furniture. ...|$|R

40|$|Visual {{perception}} is dramatically impaired when a peripheral target is embedded within clutter, a {{phenomenon known as}} visual crowding. Despite decades of study, the mechanisms underlying <b>crowding</b> remain a <b>matter</b> of debate. Feature pooling models assert that crowding results from a compulsory pooling (e. g., averaging) of target and distractor features. This view has been extraordinarily influential in recent years, {{so much so that}} crowding is typically regarded as synonymous with pooling. However, many demonstrations of feature pooling can also be accommodated by a probabilistic substitution model where observers occasionally report a distractor as the target. Here, we directly compared pooling and substitution using an analytical approach sensitive to both alternatives. In four experiments, we asked observers to report the precise orientation of a target stimulus flanked by two irrelevant distractors. In all cases, the observed data were well described by a quantitative model that assumes probabilistic substitution, and poorly described by a quantitative model that assumes that targets and distractors are averaged. These results challenge the widely held assumption that crowding can be wholly explained by compulsory pooling...|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} is {{reported in a}} History of Western North Carolina, condensed from Wheeler's 'Historical Sketches: Joseph Pearson's father was Richmond Pearson, born in Dinwiddie county, Va., who {{at the age of}} nineteen years came to North Carolina and settled in the forks of the Yadkin river, late of Davie county when a part of Rowan county. When the war of the Revolution broke out he was a Lieutenant in Captain Samuel Bryan's company. After the Declaration of Independence, at the first muster which occurred, he requested some one whom he could rely to load their guns. When Captain Bryan came on the ground he ordered all the men into ranks. Pearson refused, and tendered his commission to Bryan, whereupon he ordered him under arrest. This was resisted, and he was told that the men had their guns loaded. They then came to a parley, and it was agreed by the <b>crowd,</b> as <b>matters</b> stood, that Bryan and Pearson, on a fixed day, should settle this national affair by a fair fist fight, and whichever whipped, the company should belong {{to the side of the}} conqueror, whether Whig or Tory. At the appointed time and place the parties met, and the Lieutenant proved to be the victor. From this time the Fork company was for liberty, and Bryan's crowd, on Dutchman's creek, were Loyalists. The anecdote illustrates by what slight circumstances events of this period were affected. When Cornwallis came south, Pearson, with his company, endeavored to harass his advance. He was present at Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, where General William Lee Davidson fell in attempting to resist the passage of the British. Captain Pearson was a successful merchant and an enterprising planter. He died in 1819, leaving three sons and one daughter: 1st, Jesse A.; 2d, Joseph (the subject of this entry); 3d, Richmond; and 4th, Elizabeth Pearson.|$|R
40|$|Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) -based tractography of the {{brainstem}} is {{a useful}} presurgical planning tool for resection of focal lesions of the brainstem, due to the tight <b>crowding</b> of gray <b>matter</b> nuclei, and white matter pathways in a narrow space. Previous DTI-based atlases of brainstem connections identified a few major tracts, with limited spatial resolution. Objective: To create high-resolution, wide-population based, comprehensive atlas of the single white matter tracts of the brainstem, and present a tractography-based review of the traditional approaches to the brainstem. Methods: We applied advanced deterministic fiber tractography to a template of 488 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP- 488). Five formalin fixed brains were studied for surgical landmarks. Then, Luxol Fast Blue stained histological sections were used to validate the results of tractography. Results: The tractographic anatomy of single white matter tracts is described, including: the cerebellar peduncles, the corticospinal tract (CST), the corticopontine tracts (CPTs), the medial lemniscus (ML), the lateral lemniscus (LL), the spinothalamic tract (STT), the rubrospinal tract (RST), the central tegmental tract (CTT), the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus (DLF). Then, the reconstructed 3 -dimensional brainstem model was sectioned {{at the level of}} classical surgical approaches, namely: the supracollicular approach, the infraclollucular approach, the lateral mesencephalic sulcus approach, the perioculomotor approach, the supracollicular approach, the infracollicular approach, the paratrigeminal approach, the antrolateral approach to the medulla, the retro-oivary sulcus approach. The tractographic sections were successfully validated by comparison with histological sections. Finally, the practical application of our advanced tractography method is presented in two clinical cases. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the successful use of advanced deterministic fiber tractography as a tool for improving the knowledge of basic neuroanatomy of the brainstem, for a better understanding of traditional surgical approaches, and for presurgical planning of focal lesion resections...|$|R
