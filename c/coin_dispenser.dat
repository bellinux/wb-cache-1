50|$|A {{money changer}} (or coin changer or <b>coin</b> <b>dispenser)</b> is {{a device that}} changes or {{dispenses}} coins. It can take various forms. One type is a portable <b>coin</b> <b>dispenser,</b> invented by Jacques L. Galef, often worn on a belt, used by conductors and other professions for manual fare collection. It dispenses a single coin when a lever is depressed.|$|E
50|$|Another type is a fixed <b>coin</b> <b>dispenser</b> that {{dispenses}} several coins at once, such as four quarters or five nickels, {{for making}} change at {{a venue for}} coin-operated devices, such as a penny arcade, pinball parlor, or Automat. It is typically mounted in a manned booth or counter.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{development}} in manual fare collection is the <b>coin</b> <b>dispenser,</b> distributed by Jacques L. Galef. Mounted {{either in a}} driver's cab or on the belt of a conductor, the <b>coin</b> <b>dispenser</b> usually {{takes the form of}} a number of tubes fitted in a line together. Each tube holds a different denomination and tends to have some sort of trigger which will release the coin from the bottom. In Britain, the Quick-Change and Pendamatic units, for example, has labelled plastic funnels at the top, which filter the coins into the tube. A trigger on the front of the machine then releases the coin by pushing a kicker, which holds the coin, forward in a pivotal motion. Other models in Britain, the Cambist and Metro Coin Dispensers, works on a similar principle but also have the option to be attached to the fare collection table allowing the operator (usually the bus driver) to simply slide the coins into the respective tubes. Generally, coin dispensers in the UK are configured with the Â£1 coin to the left (as the machine faces you), then the 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, 1p. However, some operators have customised their dispensers to better suit their individual needs.|$|E

50|$|Of {{particular}} {{concern to the}} police are crimes associated with modernization. Increased wealth and technological sophistication has brought new white collar crimes, such as computer and credit card fraud, larceny involving <b>coin</b> <b>dispensers,</b> and insurance fraud. Incidence of drug abuse is minuscule, compared with other industrialized nations and limited mainly to stimulants. Japanese law enforcement authorities endeavor to control this problem by extensive coordination with international investigative organizations and stringent punishment of Japanese and foreign offenders. Traffic accidents and fatalities consume substantial law enforcement resources. There is also evidence of foreign criminals travelling from overseas {{to take advantage of}} Japan's lax security. In his autobiography Undesirables, British criminal Colin Blaney stated that English thieves have targeted the nation due to the low crime rate and because Japanese people are unprepared for crime. Pakistani, Russian, Sri Lankan, and Burmese car theft gangs have also been known to target the nation.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the game}} {{there are many}} forms of objects to collectSecrets: Are note hidden on trees and fences with tips for the gameRecipe Rocks: Provide recipe's for the Kitchen {{at the back of}} the barn and the Mocktail bar within the bar (Only {{available}} at night.) Recipe's can be guessed but require a lot of resources to do so as there are many recipes and ingredients.Gold Rush Tokens: Gold Rush Tokens can be collected and placed in <b>coin</b> <b>dispensers</b> so that they can get Gopher Bucks for the Gopher Underground Shop.Royal Jelly: In the game, there is a secret object that some players don't know about called Royal Jelly. It can be obtained SOMETIMES by getting every bit of honey out of all 3 bee hives in the Walnut Woods area. You will know if you're going to get the Royal Jelly if the usual yellow circle displayed on the top of the screen begins flashing red. Even then, you may not get it because It's such a rare item. It can be eaten or sold at the Gopher Underground Shop.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the purpose of developing a Solar Powered Reverse Trash Vendo Machine that aims to encourage people to engage in recycling and to diminish the practice of improper waste disposal in thePhilippines. The device used a Gizduino X ATMega 1281 as its main processing module along with a Gizduino 644 microcontroller board, anda GSM Shield module for communication. Arduino 1. 6 IDE is used to program the Gizduinoboards. The device is powered by a 15 V rechargeable battery, which is charged by a solar panel retrofitted at the roof of the device, this is to promote energy conservation, and green engineering principles {{in the development of the}} study. The device can process empty plastic bottles (500 ml. max) with a base diameter of 3. 5 inches, and aluminium cans. These recyclable materials are placed inside the machine and is scanned, then crushed and placed in a bin. An inductive sensor is used to detect either the material is a plastic bottle or an aluminium can. To compensate the user for recycling, an equivalent monetary value will be dispensed. The owner of the device can check the status of the <b>coin</b> <b>dispenser</b> and bins through an Android messaging application developed using the Eclipse IDE and the Java programming language, and when a certain limit is reached by the <b>coin</b> <b>dispenser</b> or the trash bins, an automatic text message notification will be sent to the owner...|$|E
