30|$|The {{greater the}} angulation, {{the greater the}} {{off-axis}} force that generates more stress and strain in implant components specially the screw [30] When off-axis loading is applied to an implant, {{the magnitude of the}} stress will be increased three times or more [28]. There was a statistically significant increase in stress and strain when abutment angulation increased. This supports the concept of eliminating unnecessary occlusal and off-axial forces on implant-supported restorations [4]. With clinical loading of implants restored using angled abutments, lateral occlusal forces may increase <b>creating</b> <b>torsional</b> force which increases screw loosening [12, 29]. Any direction of load that is not in the long axis of the implant will magnify the crestal stresses to the implant–bone interface and to the abutment screws in the restoration [8].|$|R
5000|$|Electromagnetic torque, {{which can}} be {{calculated}} as the average value of the Maxwell stress tensor along the airgap, is one consequence of electromagnetic forces in electric machines. As a static force, it does not create vibrations nor acoustic noise. However torque ripple (also called cogging torque for permanent magnet synchronous machines in open circuit), which represents the harmonic variations of electromagnetic torque, is a dynamic force <b>creating</b> <b>torsional</b> vibrations of both rotor and stator. The torsional deflection of a simple cylinder cannot radiate efficiently acoustic noise, but with particular boundary conditions the stator can radiate acoustic noise under torque ripple excitation [...] Structure-borne noise can also be generated by torque ripple when rotor shaft line vibrations propagate to the frame [...]|$|R

Preface: The environment problem {{has been the focus}} of the world. “Green machinery ” is a word nothing new in the field of production. As a new driving mechanism, the electromagnetic gear is characterized by: 1). Non-touching driving without lubricating. Therefore, when the gear is running, the vibration is small and the gear is clean without any abrasion consumption. 2). The system is easy to be produced without any special gears. 3). The startup torque is small and can prevent overloading. In addition, the system can adapt itself to the asymmetry without any special maintenance. Therefore, such system has a bright perspective in the field of medical machinery, instrument and apparatus, food processing...|$|R
5000|$|String {{vibrations}} cause minute length variations, or stretching. With {{varying degrees}} of stretching, the tension varies. This {{can be thought of}} as longitudinal vibration. The strings are anchored to the bridge and the pull of the strings is directed to the side of the anchoring point. This <b>creates</b> a <b>torsional</b> force deforming the soundboard. When tension increases, it will create a belly below the bridge (away from the strings) and a dip above the bridge (under the strings). This deformation creates more complex sound waves than the push/pull action.|$|R

50|$|The {{length of}} the helical fiber is at a minimum when the fiber angle equals 54°44′ and is at maximum length when the fiber angle {{approaches}} 0° and 90°. Summed up, this means that helically arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle greater than 54°44′ will create force for both torsion and elongation while helically arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle less than 54°44′ will create force for both torsion and shortening. The fiber angle of the oblique or helical muscle layers must increase during shortening and decrease during lengthening. In addition to <b>creating</b> a <b>torsional</b> force, the oblique muscle layers will therefore create a force for elongation that may aid the transverse musculature in resisting longitudinal compression.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the torsional behaviour of buildings subjected to blast loading. The scope of the investigation involves a 10 -storey symmetrical reinforced concrete frame structure designed in accordance with CSA Standard A 23. 3 (2004), and the provisions of the National Building Code of Canada (2005). The building was analyzed under different magnitudes of explosions, triggered at different distances and location such that the building would be subjected to lateral impulsive forces causing torsion. Elastic dynamic time-history analyses were conducted using software ETABS under impulsive forcing functions caused by the detonations of 100 kg, 200 kg, 300 kg, 500 kg, and 1000 kg TNT at distances of 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m from the building, at three different eccentricities within the plane of building floor to <b>create</b> <b>torsional</b> eccentricities relative to the centre of rigidity. The performance of structure was evaluated by considering interstorey drift, floor rotations, lateral displacements, and P-M capacity/demand ratios for columns. The results indicate that the perimeter columns, especially the corner columns are affected most when the building is subjected to blast loadings. The torsional building response increases with the amount of TNT. It is related to the location of the explosion relative to the building, and increases with torsional eccentricity. On the other hand, the torsional response decreases with distance from explosion to building. Maximum interstorey drifts are closely related to the eccentricity of blast loads. This effect can be neglected in practical applications for small size charges and distant explosions. For example, an explosion caused by less than 500 kg TNT at distances of 20 m and longer would produce very small interstorey drifts and the effects of the eccentricity of blast loads could be neglected in such buildings...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} has been {{the development of an}} effective design tool for torsional analysis. In the hopes of achieving this goal the computer program, Torsion 1, has been <b>created.</b> This <b>torsional</b> transfer matrix program provides the user with the ability to easily model multi-rotor systems using a simple user-interface. The program is capable of modeling such components or system characteristics as continuously distributed mass, viscous and structural damping, vibration absorbers, and gear meshes with gear tooth flexibility. The analysis capabilities of the program include forcedresponse and free-vibration analyses. The forced-response analysis module is capable of determining a system’s response to a static or harmonic torsional load. The free-vibration analysis module allows is capable of determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for damped and undamped systems. This thesis includes an explanation of the multi-rotor transfer matrix technique employed in Torsion 1. The derivation of transfer matrices for visco-elastic vibration absorbers, pendulum absorbers, flexible gear meshes, and planetary gear trains are included in this work. Finally, the validity of the program results is verified with a set of benchmark examples. Acknowledgement...|$|R
40|$|It {{is evident}} that {{torsional}} resistance of a reinforced concrete (RC) member is attributed to both concrete and steel reinforcement. However, recent structural design codes neglect the contribution of concrete because of cracking. This paper reports {{on the results of}} an experimental and numerical investigation into the torsional capacity of concrete beams reinforced only by longitudinal rebars without transverse reinforcement. The experimental investigation involves six specimens tested under pure torsion. Each specimen was made using a cast-in-place concrete with different amounts of longitudinal reinforcements. To <b>create</b> the <b>torsional</b> moment, an eccentric load was applied {{at the end of the}} beam whereas the other end was fixed against twist, vertical, and transverse displacement. The experimental results were also compared with the results obtained from the nonlinear finite element analysis performed in ANSYS. The outcomes showed a good agreement between experimental and numerical investigation, indicating the capability of numerical analysis in predicting the torsional capacity of RC beams. Both experimental and numerical results showed a considerable torsional post-cracking resistance in high twist angle in test specimen. This post-cracking resistance is neglected in torsional design of RC members. This strength could be considered in the design of RC members subjected to torsion forces, leading to a more economical and precise design. Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} dynamic model of a {{harmonic}} drive. It includes a theoretical study aimed at the analysis of the harmonic drive gearing principle and its nonlinear properties. The first part of the practical section {{deals with the}} analytical calculation of the nondeformed geometry of the Flexspline. Based on these results, several simulations in ANSYS are <b>created</b> to identify <b>torsional</b> characteristics of a harmonic drive. These simulation models are further enhanced by the analysis of clearance, backlash and inaccuracies and their impact on torsional properties. By using MATLAB /Simulink, several dynamic submodels are created representing the individual characteristics of nonlinearities in harmonic drives. Furthermore, a comprehensive dynamic model is created of the mechatronic system which is describing all nonlinearities and kinematic error of the transmission. The dynamic model is also experimentally verified based on its damping properties...|$|R
40|$|DNA bending and {{torsional}} deformations {{that often}} occur during its functioning inside the cell can cause local disruptions {{of the regular}} helical structure. The disruptions <b>created</b> by negative <b>torsional</b> stress have been studied in detail, but those caused by bending stress have only been analyzed theoretically. By probing the structure of very small DNA circles, we determined that bending stress disrupts the regular helical structure when the radius of DNA curvature is smaller than 3. 5 nm. First, we developed an efficient method to obtain covalently closed DNA minicircles. To detect structural disruptions in the minicircles we treated them by single-strand-specific endonucleases. The data showed that the regular DNA structure is disrupted by bending deformation in the 64 – 65 -bp minicircles, {{but not in the}} 85 – 86 -bp minicircles. Our results suggest that strong DNA bending initiates kink formation while preserving base pairing...|$|R
40|$|Many quasars {{and active}} galactic nuclei (AGN) appear in radio, optical, and X-ray maps, as a bright nuclear sources from which emerge single or double long, thin jets (Thomson et al., 1993). When {{observed}} with high angular resolution these jets show structure with bright knots separated by relatively dark regions. High percentages of polarization, sometimes more then 50 % in some objects, indicates the nonthermal {{nature of the}} radiation which is well explained as the synchrotron radiation of the relativistic electrons in an ordered magnetic field. A strong collimation of jets is most probably connected with ordered magnetic fields. The mechanism of magnetic collimation, first suggested by Bisnovatyi-Kogan et al. (1969), {{was based on the}} initial charge separation, leading to creation of oscillating electrical current, which produces azimuthal magnetic field, preventing jet expansion and disappearance. Here we consider magnetic collimation, connected with torsional oscillations of a cylinder with elongated magnetic field. Instead of initial blobs with charge separation, we consider a cylinder with a periodically distributed initial rotation around the cylinder axis. The stabilizing azimuthal magnetic field is <b>created</b> here by <b>torsional</b> oscillations, where charge separation is not necessary. Approximate simplified model is developed. Ordinary differential equation is derived, and solved numerically, what gives a possibility to estimate quantitatively the range of parameters where jets may be stabilized by torsional oscillations.
