Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical <b>care</b> <b>and</b> evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health <b>care</b> <b>and</b> may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share of the settlement totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed {{that half of the}} settlement be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops. One-fourth of the money would support health <b>care</b> <b>and</b> anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education, a cause important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E

40|$|Background: Even though caring {{remains the}} essence of nursing it is still an {{ambiguous}} concept as the lens through which each nurse perceives caring differs. The differences are due to multiple factors including the setting in which the nurse works. Nurses experience high levels of anxiety when caring for patients in acute settings. Despite an abundance of published studies on caring there is a dearth of research available {{that focuses on the}} relationship between <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> anxiety. Aim: The aim of this research study was to investigate <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> anxiety in a sample of registered nurses working in an acute hospital and to determine the relationship between these and other variables. Method: A quantitative descriptive study using a correlational design was employed, with a sample of 280 registered nurses. The Caring Behaviours Inventory- 24 was used to measure <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> the State Trait Anxiety Inventory to measure Anxiety. The study was guided by the Theory of Human Caring (Watson 2008). Findings: Nurses reported high levels of <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> low levels of anxiety. A statistical significant relationship was found between <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> anxiety <b>and</b> between <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> supportive work environment and job satisfaction. A statistical significant relationship was found between anxiety and work environment, job satisfaction gender, age, relationship status and education. Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate the relationship between <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> anxiety in an acute hospital setting. This research contributes to advancing nursing knowledge by providing evidence of the relationship between <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> anxiety among nurses in an acute hospital setting. Despite nurses reporting high levels of <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> low levels of anxiety, it is important to further enhance <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> reduce anxiety levels among all nurses. Thus, educators and managers need to explore strategies for the alleviation of anxiety among nurses, practising in acute care settings...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} how caring science {{can be a}} helpful foundation for <b>caring</b> practice <b>and</b> what kind of learning support that can enable the transformation of caring science into practice. The lifeworld approach is fundamental for both <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> learning. This will be illustrated in two examples from research that show the potential for promoting health and well-being {{as well as the}} learning process. One example is from a <b>caring</b> context <b>and</b> the other is from a learning context. In this article, learning <b>and</b> <b>caring</b> are understood as parallel processes. We emphasize that learning cannot be separated from life <b>and</b> thus <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> education is intertwined with <b>caring</b> science <b>and</b> life. The examples illustrate how an understanding of the intertwining can be fruitful in different contexts. The challenge is to implant a lifeworld-based approach on <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> learning that can lead to strategies that in a more profound way have the potential to strengthen the person&#x 0027;s health and learning processes...|$|R

40|$|What does ‘care’ mean in {{contemporary}} society? How are caring relationships practised in different contexts? What resources do individuals and collectives draw upon {{in order to}} care for, <b>care</b> with <b>and</b> <b>care</b> about themselves <b>and</b> others? How do such relationships and practices relate to broader social processes? Care shapes people’s everyday lives <b>and</b> relationships <b>and</b> <b>caring</b> relations <b>and</b> practices influence the economies of different societies. This interdisciplinary book takes a nuanced and context-sensitive approach to exploring <b>caring</b> relationships, identities <b>and</b> practices within and {{across a variety of}} cultural, familial, geographical and institutional arenas. Grounded in rich empirical research and discussing key theoretical, policy and practice debates, it provides important, yet often neglected, international and cross-cultural perspectives. It is divided into four sections covering: caring within educational institutions; <b>caring</b> amongst communities <b>and</b> networks; <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> families; <b>and</b> <b>caring</b> across the life-course. Contributing to broader theoretical, philosophical and moral debates associated with the ethics of care, citizenship, justice, relationality and entanglements of power, Critical Approaches to Care is an important work for students <b>and</b> academics studying <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> <b>care</b> work in the fields of health <b>and</b> social <b>care,</b> sociology, social policy, anthropology, education, human geography and politics...|$|R
