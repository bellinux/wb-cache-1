40|$|A <b>country-by-country</b> <b>review</b> of seabird {{mortality}} from {{longline fishing}} in the Mediterranean Sea and in Macaronesian waters shows a paucity of data. Of 12 Mediterranean countries known to undertake longlining, seabird mortality is only reported for six: France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Spain and Tunisia. Seabird mortality from longlining has been reported from the Azores (Portugal) but not from the other Macaronesian Islands. Only for one country, Spain, is information on the levels of mortality available, suggesting that 4 - 6 % of the local breeding population of Cory´s shearwater Calonectris diomedea may be killed annually, a level considered unsustainable for the long-term persistence of colonies. Cory´s shearwater is the most commonly affected species, although a number of Larus gull species are also being caught. There is insufficient knowledge to conclude whether any seabird species is at conservation risk within the region, but concern is expressed for Cory´s shearwater. It is recommended that Mediterranean and Macaronesian countries conduct assessments of their longline fisheries and seabird mortality {{in terms of the}} Food and Agriculture Organization´s International Plan of Action - Seabirds. Regional fishery organisations, such as ICCAT and GFCM, should commence the collection of seabird mortality data. A longline action plan for the affected seabird species should be produced...|$|E
40|$|WHO and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) {{annually}} review data on immunization {{coverage to}} estimate national coverage with routine service {{delivery of the}} following vaccines: bacille Calmette-Guérin; diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis, first and third doses; either oral polio vaccine or inactivated polio vaccine, third dose of either; hepatitis B, third dose; Haemophilus influenzae type b, third dose; and a measles virus-containing vaccine, either for measles alone or {{in the form of}} a combination vaccine, one dose. The estimates are based on government reports submitted to WHO and UNICEF and are supplemented by survey results from the published and grey literature. Local experts, primarily national immunization system managers and WHO/UNICEF regional and national staff, are consulted for additional information on the performance of specific immunization systems. Estimates are derived through a <b>country-by-country</b> <b>review</b> of available data informed and constrained by a set of heuristics; no statistical or mathematical models are used. Draft estimates are made, sent to national authorities for review and comment and modified in light of their feedback. While the final estimates may not differ from reported data, they constitute an independent technical assessment by WHO and UNICEF of the performance of national immunization systems. These country-specific estimates, available from 1980 onward, are updated annually...|$|E
40|$|Routine {{surveillance}} of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection and AIDS {{has been established}} {{over the past decade}} in many countries around the world. HIV estimates derived from empirical data are essential to the assessment of the HIV situation {{in different parts of the}} world and trends are used in tracking the development of regional epidemics, thereby keeping intervention activities focused on realities. As of the end of 1995, and following an extensive <b>country-by-country</b> <b>review</b> of HIV/AIDS data, a cumulative total of 6 million AIDS cases were estimated to have occurred in adults and children worldwide and currently 20. 1 million adults are estimated to be alive and infected with HIV or have AIDS. Of the total prevalent HIV infections, the majority remain concentrated in eastern, central and southern Africa, but the epidemic is evolving with spread of infection from urban to rural areas, as well as to West and South Africa, India and South-east Asia, and to a lesser extent [...] with proportional shifts to heterosexual infections [...] in North America, western Europe and Latin America. While the longer-term dimensions of the HIV epidemic at global level cannot be forecast with confidence, WHO currently projects a cumulative total of close to 40 million HIV infections in men, women and children by the year 2000. By that time, the male:female ratio of new infections will be close to 1 : 1. Recent trends indicate that HIV prevalence levels may be stabilizing or even decreasing among pregnant women in southern Zaire and parts of Uganda, among military recruits aged 21 in Thailand, and in some populations of northern Europe and the USA. While these changes may take place as part of the intrinsic dynamic of the epidemic, there is some evidence that declines in HIV prevalence are related to declines in HIV incidence which are, at least partly, due to prevention efforts. The challenge of surveillance and evaluation methods is now to identify the ingredients of success which may reveal a glimmer of hope...|$|E
