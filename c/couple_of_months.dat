50|$|Although this a {{very recent}} {{cutting-edge}} technique, it {{has seen a}} <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> variations upon the basic algorithm in the last <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>month,</b> most notably JSON driven resolution methods. the basic idea is that instead of supplying the algorithm with n records, it is more useful to provide the algorithm with emotional meta-data to guide its search and improve its complexity beyond the usual logarithmic bounds and this {{by a factor of}} log(n)/2. It allows to select intermediate m values for the search index and skew them towards the wanted emotional value in the initial records.|$|R

5|$|Symptoms {{may also}} occur during a gradual dosage reduction, but are {{typically}} less severe and may persist {{as part of}} a protracted withdrawal syndrome for months after cessation of benzodiazepines. Approximately 10% of patients experience a notable protracted withdrawal syndrome, which can persist for many months or in some cases a year or longer. Protracted symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> of withdrawal but usually are of a sub-acute level of severity.

5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple.

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{generalization}} {{of the theory of}} quantales and prequantales provides a noncommutative and nonassociative abstract ideal theoretic setting for the theories of star operations, semistar operations, semiprime operations, ideal systems, and module systems, and conversely the latter theories motivate new results in the theory of quantales and prequantales. Applications include representation theorems for precoherent prequantales and multiplicative semilattices; characterizations of simple commutative quantales and simple multiplicative lattices; a construction of the largest finitary nucleus smaller than a given nucleus on a precoherent prequantale; a construction of the smallest semistar operation extending a given star operation on an integral domain; and two potentially useful definitions of tight closure for non-Noetherian commutative rings of prime characteristic.

40|$|Spam {{pages are}} {{designed}} to maliciously appear among the top search results by excessive usage of popular terms. Therefore, spam pages should be removed using an effective and efficient spam detection system. Previous methods for web spam classification used several features from various information sources (page contents, web graph, access logs, etc.) to detect web spam. In this paper, we follow page-level classification approach to build fast and scalable spam filters. We show that each web page can be classified with satisfiable accuracy using only its own HTML content. In order to design a multi-view classification system, we used state-of-the-art spam classification methods with distinct feature sets (views) as the base classifiers. Then, a fusion model is learned to combine {{the output of the}} base classifiers and make final prediction. Results show that multi-view learning significantly improves the classification performance, namely AUC by 22 %, while providing linear speedup for parallel execution.
