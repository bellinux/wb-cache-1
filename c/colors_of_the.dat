5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited the <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding Latin graphemes {{as soon as the}} Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E

5|$|None of {{them knew}} {{the color of the}} sky. Their eyes glanced level, and were {{fastened}} upon the waves that swept toward them.

The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{athletic}} teams had no official colors and often used gray or maroon and gray for their uniforms. Senior classes would sometimes select colors {{of their own}} choosing. In modern times, the uniforms {{have been based on}} some combination of the four <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maryland flag: red, white, black, and gold. The dominant colors have occasionally changed back and forth with changes of the head coach. In 1904, Maryland adopted a state flag based on the heraldry of Lord Calvert: the Calvert family arms (black and gold) quartered with his mother's Crossland family arms (red and white). From the early 1920s until 1942, the black and gold were adopted as the official school colors.|$|E
5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the <b>colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{forewings}} is 14.5-16 mm {{for males}} and 16-17.5 mm for females. <b>The</b> ground <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forewings is chocolate brown, while <b>the</b> ground <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hindwings is creamy white.|$|R
50|$|The {{specular}} highlight often reflects <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light source, not <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reflecting object. This {{is because}} many materials have {{a thin layer}} of clear material above <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pigmented material. For example, plastic is made up of tiny beads <b>of</b> <b>color</b> suspended in a clear polymer and human skin often has {{a thin layer of}} oil or sweat above the pigmented cells. Such materials will show specular highlights in which all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> spectrum are reflected equally. On metallic materials such as gold <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specular highlight will reflect <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material.|$|R
