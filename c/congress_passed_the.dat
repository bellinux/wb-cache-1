She helped to draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose {{legislation}} intended to severely restrict the right of consumers to file for bankruptcy.

5|$|After McKinley's inauguration, {{increases}} in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods {{led to a}} considerable increase in the money supply. Even so, in 1900, <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Gold Standard Act, formally placing the United States on that standard. Although Bryan ran again on a silver platform in the 1900 presidential election, the issue failed to produce the same resonance with the voters.

5|$|As the 11th New York Regiment had {{experienced}} first hand, the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 {{had taken a}} heavy toll on Union forces, including those from New York City.

In 1883, a bipartisan majority in <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1787, the Second Continental <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Ordinance, {{creating}} the Northwest Territory which included Michigan. In 1805, the U.S. Congress created the Michigan Territory, with Detroit as its territorial capital. Michigan first applied for statehood {{as early as}} 1832, though it was rebuffed due to a dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip, a 468-square mile (1,210km²) area that included the important port city of Toledo. By 1835, Michigan had formed a state government without receiving authorization from Congress to do so. The state's boundaries included the contested area.|$|E

This ultimately allowed the U.S. airline industry to operate competitively in the international market.|$|R
