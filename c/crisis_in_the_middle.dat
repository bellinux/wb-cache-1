50|$|Despite his {{unhappiness}} with President Richard Nixon {{over the}} Vietnam War, Javits {{was slow to}} join the anti-Nixon forces during the Watergate scandal of 1973-1974.

His position was unpopular among his constituency, and his re-election in Watergate-tainted 1974 elections over Ramsey Clark was by fewer than 400,000 votes, a third of his 1968 margin of victory. During his last term Javits shifted his interests more and more to world affairs, especially <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East.

40|$|Due {{to their}} efficiency, revitalized {{traditional}} techniques for irrigation management of scarce water resources {{have been suggested}} {{as a way to}} at least partially cope with <b>the</b> present water <b>crises</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East. A better irrigation management includes re-using treated wastewater in agriculture. Treated wastewater should also be used in industrial processes, thus contributing to a more efficient overall water management. However, the most important change leading to better water management is improving water efficiency in agricultural irrigation. Traditional water management techniques have an important role in many Middle East and North African (MENA) countries. Besides bringing more water to a thirsty population, they can also contribute to the societal awareness, and recognition of the great diversity of cultural and social values water has to human civilization...|$|R
