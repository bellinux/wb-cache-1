40|$|When a {{chemical}} accident occurs, the release {{depends on the}} status of the substance(s) in either the damaged process unit or carrier, i. e. the accident dynamics differs in presence of a compressed gas, a refrigerated liquefied gas, a <b>compressed</b> <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas,</b> or a subcooled liquid. In addition, the release properties (e. g., flow rate, liquid and vapor fractions, temperature, and momentum) may vary dynamically due to the modification of the conditions inside the damaged process unit and/or to the intervention of either the operator or the control system. This manuscript describes the features that an accident simulator should implement to account for the release variability. In particular, the paper focuses on the release of liquids, their spreading, and the formation of pools and pool-fires. The recommended features include the capability to simulate the automatic switch of the liquid pool from spreading to shrinking, its vanishing, the release in a bund, its ignition, the evaluation of the pool-fire geometrical dimensions and the heat flux radiated to the surrounding equipment and field operators. By implementing these features in an accident simulator, it is possible to get a more realistic picture of the accident dynamics, and of its magnitude and consequences. An accident simulator having the aforementioned features can be linked to a dynamic process simulator to evaluate the dynamics of the plant operating conditions during the accident unfolding, for both risk assessment and operators' training purposes. These features have been implemented in a simulator program, which is based on CPU-efficient models and algorithms, with the scope of demonstrating the feasibility of the discussed approach and its advantages. The importance of the aforementioned features is illustrated by means of some dedicated case-studies. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The next important question was how to render the gas portable.

For the supercritical extractions, the influence of pressure and temperature on the extraction yield was evaluated from 150 to 250  bar and from 40 to 80  °C, whereas for compressed LPG extractions were performed at 5 – 25  bar and 20 – 40  °C. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was assayed by DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging method and the chemical composition by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The highest yields were 12. 68 and 12. 07  wt%, whereas the maximum antioxidant activities were 71. 67 and 67. 49 % for extraction using SC-CO 2 and compressed LPG, respectively. The chemical profile of fatty acids was similar for both solvents. The antioxidant compound found in both processes was the β-sitosterol, {{which is one of}} the components of γ-oryzanol. From kinetics analysis it was demonstrated that using LPG it is possible to decrease the solvent/feed mass by a factor of approximately 30, and extraction time by a factor of 15.

The model, developed in a spreadsheet format, estimates the full fuel- cycle emissions and energy use associated with various transportation fuels for light-duty vehicles. The model calculates fuel-cycle emissions of five criteria pollutants (volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulate matter measuring 10 microns or less) and three greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide). The model also calculates the total fuel-cycle energy consumption, fossil fuel consumption, and petroleum consumption using various transportation fuels.

40|$|Because of its {{abundance}} {{and because it}} offers significant energy and evironmental advantages, natural gas has been promoted for use in motor vehicles. A number of transportation fuels are produced from natural gas; each is distinct in terms of upstream production activities and vehicle usage. In this study, the authors avaluate eight fuels produced from natural gas - <b>compressed</b> natural <b>gas,</b> <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas,</b> methanol, hydrogen, dimethyl ether, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and electricity [...] for use in five types of motor vehicles [...] spark-ignition vehicles, compression-ignition vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, battery-powered electric vehicles, and fuel-cell vehicles. Because of great uncertainties associated with advances both in fuel production and vehicle technologies, they evaluate near-term and long-term fuels and vehicle technologies separately. Furthermore, for long-term options, they establish both an incremental technology scenario and a leap-forward technology scenario to address potential technology improvements. The study reveals that, in general, the use of natural gas-based fuels reduces energy use and emissions relative to use of petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuel, although different natural gas-based fuels in different vehicle technologies can have significantly different energy and emissions impacts...|$|R
