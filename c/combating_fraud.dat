5000|$|The {{show has}} been criticized for overestimating law enforcement's {{interest}} and involvement in <b>combating</b> <b>fraud,</b> as many frauds are discovered only after a number of people have already been victimized; i.e., the largest fraud, Bernie Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme, ended only after he confessed. In civil fraud claims, courts require that the fraud be pleaded with specificity and the proponent provide documentation corroborating the claim. [...] In the Madoff case, an early administrative complaint was dismissed for lack of evidence, with the claim of a Ponzi scheme deemed speculative and unsubstantiated using essentially the same standard federal courts employ in evaluating civil fraud claims.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{services}} {{offer to}} check telephone numbers alongside other personal details, gained from various public sources e.g. the Electoral roll {{and from the}} imprints left on by their activities, for examples from transactions made using credit cards. The advantage of a database check is that the lookup can be very quick (sub 1s), however no databases exist to cover all telephone subscriber lines internationally, with mobile telephones being particularly problematic to trace - especially Pay as you go (phone) (non contract) arrangements which often have no registered owner. Some databases are very detailed and can correlate telephone numbers with physical addresses, e-mail addresses, ownership and sometimes even personal details. Such detail can help with <b>combating</b> <b>fraud</b> as well as allowing greater understanding of a customer base.|$|E

5000|$|The False Claims Act, {{also called}} the [...] "Lincoln Law") is an American federal law that imposes {{liability}} on persons and companies (typically federal contractors) who defraud governmental programs. It is the federal Government's primary litigation tool in <b>combating</b> <b>fraud</b> against the Government. [...] The law includes a qui tam provision that allows {{people who are not}} affiliated with the government, called [...] "relators" [...] under the law, to file actions on behalf of the government (informally called [...] "whistleblowing" [...] especially when the relator is employed by the organization accused in the suit). Persons filing under the Act stand to receive a portion (usually about 15-25 percent) of any recovered damages. As of 2012, over 70 percent of all federal Government FCA actions were initiated by whistleblowers. Claims under the law have typically involved health care, military, or other government spending programs, and dominate the list of largest pharmaceutical settlements. The government recovered $38.9 billion under the False Claims Act between 1987 and 2013 and of this amount, $27.2 billion or 70% was from qui tam cases brought by relators.|$|E
5000|$|The 2005-06 merger {{proposals}} had {{not included}} Greater London. This {{was due to}} two separate reviews of policing in the capital - {{the first was a}} review by the Department of Transport into the future role and function of the British Transport Police. The second was a review by the Attorney-General into national measures for <b>combating</b> <b>fraud</b> (the City of London Police {{is one of the major}} organisations for combating economic crime). Both the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, and the Mayor, Ken Livingstone, stated that they would like to see a single police force in London, with the Metropolitan Police also absorbing the functions of the British Transport Police in London. However, the proposal to merge both the BTP and City forces with the Met caused significant criticism from several areas; the House of Commons Transport Select Committee severely criticised the idea of the Metropolitan Police taking over policing of the rail network in a report published on 16 May 2006, while the City of London Corporation and several major financial institutions in The City made public their opposition to the City Police merging with the Met. In a statement on 20 July 2006, the Transport Secretary announced that there would be no structural or operational changes to the British Transport Police, effectively ruling out any merger The interim report by the Attorney General's fraud review recognised the role taken by the City Police as the lead force in London and the South-East for tackling fraud, and made a recommendation that, should a national lead force be required, the City Police, with its expertise, would be an ideal candidate to take this role. This view was confirmed on the publication of the final report, which recommended that the City of London Police's Fraud Squad should be the national lead force in combatting fraud, to [...] "act as a centre of excellence, disseminate best practice, give advice on complex inquiries in other regions, and assist with or direct the most complex of such investigations" ...|$|E

50|$|Part of how {{banks are}} <b>combating</b> cheque <b>fraud</b> {{is to offer}} their clients fraud {{protection}} services.

These systems allow customers to upload their cheque files to the bank including the cheque number, the amount of money, and in some cases, the payee name. Now, when a cheque is presented for payment, the bank scrubs it against the information on file. If one of the variables does not match, then the cheque would be flagged as a potentially fraudulent item.|$|R
