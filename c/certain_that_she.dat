Consider, for example, a woman who decides that her negative self-views have led her to tolerate abusive relationship partners.

She {{was the daughter}} of Paul Gusty, a famous theater director (the similarity in surnames makes it likely, but not <b>certain,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was related to Gusti himself). Also that year, having lectured for a while at Sabin Manuilă's School of Social Work, Herseni was appointed by Gusti's {{an assistant professor in the}} University of Bucharest department of sociology, ethics and politics. Stahl claims to have been Gusti's first choice, but to have declined the position in order to suit Herseni, who, as a married man, needed a steady flow of income. As a result, Herseni was slightly better off financially than other intellectuals of his generation.|$|E
25|$|Sir Roger’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Ackroyd, her daughter, Flora, his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond and Major Blunt, a guest, are {{relaxing}} in the hall. Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora live there {{due to their}} financial circumstances. They are utterly reliant on Sir Roger who tightly controls their money and consequently they are in some debt. They discuss {{a report in the}} newspaper of the suicide of a local woman, Mrs. Ashley Ferrars, during the previous night. She had a close relationship with Sir Roger and her death has greatly affected him. They further discuss the impending announcement of the engagement between Flora and Sir Roger’s stepson, Ralph Paton and the difference that this marriage will make. A young woman who is a neighbour, Caryl Sheppard, arrives to play bridge and Flora teases her over her fascination for a recent arrival in the village – a foreigner who Caryl thinks is called M. Porrott, but Flora reveals that her uncle has told her that he in fact is M. Hercule Poirot, the famous French detective. Poirot arrives and meets everyone. He is especially taken with Caryl. During the conversation, Caryl tells Flora that she thought she saw Ralph Paton in the village that morning but Flora is surprised – as far as she knew Ralph has been in London for the previous six months ever since he had an argument with his uncle. As Caryl's brother, Dr. James Sheppard, is dining at Fernley that evening, she will be alone and she invites Poirot to dine with her. They leave together. As the others go off to change for dinner, a maid, Ursula Bourne, tidies the room and meets Ralph when he comes in from the terrace. It is obvious that the two have a secret relationship but their conversation is interrupted as Bourne sees Dr. Sheppard approaching the house. Ralph quickly hides in the adjoining library and Dr. Sheppard enters to be greeted by Parker, the butler. Dr. Sheppard may have to rush out to a confinement case later and consequently he has his doctor's bag with him which Parker looks after. Sheppard is left to his own devices for a moment and Ralph comes out of hiding and tells the doctor, an old friend, that he is in a mess with his stepfather and that he is staying at a local inn, the White Horse. Ralph leaves the house and soon Sir Roger himself comes down into the hall. He too unburdens himself on Sheppard: Mrs. Ferrars was going to be his fiancée after the year’s mourning for the late Mr. Ferrars came to an end but, when the requisite time was up, she hesitated for three more months and then confessed that she poisoned her brutal husband. She was driven to suicide by an unknown blackmailer who knew of her actions and has been draining her of funds all this time. Sir Roger is <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would have left him a letter detailing who her persecutor was. At that moment, Parker comes in with a letter for Sir Roger – it is from the late Mrs. Ferrars but he has no time to open it as the others come down for dinner.|$|E

Silverman said that ever since her best friend's death at Shogo Makishima's hands, Akane underwent major character development as she [...] "further distances herself from the bright-eyed rookie she began as, recognizing the flaws in the system while not being entirely <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can be the force for change in it". Silverman also praised the impact Akane brought to the climax and her relationship with Shinya Kogami.

[...] She was able {{to work in a}} bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act. [...] During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA's review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750million in increased spending for the agency.

500|$|Wulfhere {{was the son}} of Penda of Mercia. Penda's queen, Cynewise, {{is named}} by Bede, who does not mention her children; no other wives of Penda are known and so it is likely but not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was Wulfhere's mother. [...] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gives Penda's age as fifty in 626, and credits him with a thirty-year reign, but this would put Penda at eighty {{years old at the time}} of his death, which is {{generally}} thought unlikely as two of his sons (Wulfhere and Æthelred) are recorded as being young when he was killed. It is thought at least as likely that Penda was 50 years old at his death, rather than at his accession. [...] Wulfhere's date of birth is unknown, but Bede describes him as a youth at the time of his accession in 658, so it is likely he was in his middle teens at that time; Penda would then have been in his thirties at the time Wulfhere was born.|$|E

She was raised {{with her two}} {{siblings}} {{in the village of}} Hastings-on-Hudson, New York by their mother Patricia Mitzman, who had previously had a career in art. Newt Mitzman, their father, directed [...] television specials and commercials for a living. Gaven went to Hackley Elementary School in Tarrytown, New York when she was young. At that time she was <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted to work in show business. As the result of a lie, she was able to study at the High School of Performing Arts even though the school was only open to inhabitants of New York City. She then became a drama major at the State University of New York at Purchase, though she did not get a degree. She said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times that [...] "they kicked me out because I missed a major rehearsal", and she never applied for readmission since she had already made her first appearance on Broadway in Grease by then. While at Purchase, Gaven performed in student productions such as The Taming of the Shrew and Trumpets and Drums.|$|E
500|$|Police visited Hindley, {{then being}} held in Cookham Wood, Kent, {{a few days after}} she had {{received}} the letter, and although she refused to admit any involvement in the killings, she agreed to help by looking at photographs and maps to try to identify spots that she had visited with Brady. She showed particular interest in photographs of the area around Hollin Brown Knoll and Shiny Brook, but said {{that it was impossible to}} be sure of the locations without visiting the moor. The security considerations for such a visit were significant; there were threats made against her should she visit the moors, but Home Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with Topping that it would be worth the risk. Writing in 1989, Topping said that he felt [...] "quite cynical" [...] about Hindley's motivation in helping the police. Although the letter from Winnie Johnson may have played a part, he believed that Hindley's real concern was that, knowing of Brady's [...] "precarious" [...] mental state, she was afraid that he might decide to co-operate with the police, and wanted to make <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> and not Brady, was the one to gain whatever benefit there may have been in terms of public approval.|$|E
500|$|James Roosevelt's lackluster {{campaign}} led Douglas backers {{to state}} {{that he was not}} only failing to help Douglas, he was not even helping himself. With polls showing the two major Democratic candidates in dire straits, Roosevelt wrote to President Truman, proposing that Truman campaign in the state in the final days before the election. Truman refused to do so. He also declined Douglas's pleas for a letter of support (privately calling her [...] "one of the worst nuisances"), and even refused to allow her to be photographed with him at a signing ceremony for a water bill which would benefit California. When Truman flew to Wake Island in early October to confer with General Douglas MacArthur regarding the Korean situation, he returned via San Francisco, but told the press he had no political appointments scheduled. He spoke at an event at the War Memorial Opera House during his stopover, but both Roosevelt and Douglas were relegated to orchestra-level seats, far from the presidential box. Vice President Alben Barkley did visit the state to campaign for the Democrats. However, Time magazine wrote that he {{did not appear to be}} helpful to Douglas's campaign. The Vice President stated that while he was not familiar with Douglas's votes, he was <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had voted the way she did out of sincere conviction and urged Californians to give the Senate a [...] "dose of brains and beauty".

500|$|Aside from {{experts and}} {{security}} personnel, several eyewitnesses gave {{evidence to the}} inquest. Three witnessed parts of the shootings, and gave accounts which supported the official version of events—in particular, they did not witness the SAS shooting any of the suspects while {{they were on the}} floor. Witnesses uncovered by the journalists making [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] also appeared: Stephen Bullock repeated his account of seeing McCann and Savage raise their hands before the SAS shot them; Josie Celecia repeated her account of seeing a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground. Hucker pointed out that parts of Celecia's testimony had changed since she spoke to [...] "Death on the Rock", and suggested that the gunfire she heard was from the shooting of Savage rather than sustained shooting of McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, a suggestion Celecia rejected; the SAS's lawyer further observed that she was unable to identify the military personnel in photographs her husband had taken. Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car the Proettas saw was the one being driven by Inspector Revagliatte, carrying four uniformed police officers rather than plain-clothed soldiers, but Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' version did not make sense. His wife gave evidence the following day. Contrary to her statement to [...] "Death on the Rock", Carmen Proetta was no longer <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had seen McCann and Farrell shot while on the ground. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police.

Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to [...] "Death on the Rock"; she was no longer <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons.

She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown. Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after [...] "pestering" [...] from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was [...] "a bit confused". The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.|$|E

As the country drifted into war during 1642, the ecclesiastical situation became polarised, with clergy forced to take sides, a situation intensified in Shropshire by Francis Ottley's royalist coup in Shrewsbury, which led to the arrival of the Charles I's army on 20 September. Puritan clergy who were committed to Parliament, even those in the rural parishes, like Samuel Fisher of Upton Magna were forced to flee. When the king's army headed south, Richard Baxter was displaced from Kidderminster and fled east, taking refuge at Coventry, after witnessing the aftermath of the Battle of Edgehill.
