In this work, we have evaluated the effects of anti-reflective <b>coating,</b> <b>front</b> glass thickness, polyvinyl butyral ultraviolet+ encapsulant, and light harvesting strings on the module performance individually and in combination. The individual and combined contributions were quantified by spectrally resolved optical measurements on the module components and simulations as well as electrical measurements on 1 -cell and 54 -cell modules. Optical gains {{and their impact on}} short circuit current are discussed in relation to a maximum current obtained from the solar cells internal quantum efficiency. The results of the electrical characterization are in good agreement with the optical analysis substantiating our approach.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} project is to explore designs and {{technologies}} for achieving high efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells with potentially low cost. The work {{is based on the}} use of thin silicon films deposited on electronically inactive, heavily doped (1 x 1019 cm- 3), p++-type, Czochralski-grown (CZ), low quality silicon substrates. The research was divided into three stages. In the first stage, a world record energyconversion efficiency of 15. 6 % has been achieved for a liquid-phase epitaxial (LPE) silicon thin-film solar cell using a passivated emitter solar cell (PESC) structure. In the second stage, a second world best efficiency of 16. 4 % has been achieved by creating a drift-field LPE thinfilm as a base layer and using simplified microgrooved PESC processing. In the third stage, another world best efficiency of 17. 6 % has been achieved with a multi-layer silicon thin-film deposited using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and the inverted pyramid PESC structure. The multi-layer CVD cells exhibit an open-circuit voltage of 664. 2 mV, a short-circuit current density of 33. 54 mNcm 2 and a fill-factor of 82. 5 %, which are the highest parameters ever achieved up to now for any thin-film silicon solar cell on an inert substrate.
