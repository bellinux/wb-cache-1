40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value of symptom duration and purulent rhinorrhea in adults {{suspected of having}} acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. REVIEW METHODS: We performed a comprehensive systematic search on March 28, 2013. We included studies on the diagnostic value of duration of symptoms and purulent rhinorrhea in patients suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. We assessed study design of included articles for directness of evidence and risk of bias. We extracted prevalence and positive and negative predictive values. RESULTS: Of 4173 unique publications, we included 1 study with high directness of evidence and moderate risk of bias. The prior probability of bacterial rhinosinusitis was 0. 29 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 24 - 0. 35); we could not extract posterior probabilities. Odds ratios (95 % CI) from univariate analysis were 1. 03 (0. 78 - 1. 36) for duration of symptoms and 2. 69 (1. 39 - 5. 18) for <b>colored</b> <b>discharge</b> {{on the floor of}} the nasal cavity. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: We included 1 study with moderate risk of bias, reporting data in such a manner that we could not assess the value of symptom duration and purulent rhinorrhea in adults suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Recommendations to distinguish between a viral and a bacterial source based on purulent rhinorrhea are not supported by evidence, and the decision to prescribe antibiotic treatment should not depend on its presence. Based on judgment driven by theory and subsidiary evidence of a greater likelihood of bacterial rhinosinusitis after 10 days, antibiotic therapy may seem a reasonable empirical option...|$|E

Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was completed by 429 prosthetic eye wearers who used visual analog scales to self-measure their discharge experience for four discharge characteristics: frequency, color, volume, and viscosity. These characteristics were analyzed with age, ethnicity, years wearing a prosthesis, eye loss cause, removal and cleaning regimes, hand-washing behavior, age of current prosthesis, and professional repolishing regimes as explanatory variables. Eighteen ocularists&rsquo; Web sites containing comments on the cause and treatment of discharge were surveyed. Results: Associations were found between discharge frequency and cleaning regimes with more frequent cleaning accompanying more frequent discharge. Color was associated with years of wearing and age, with more years of wearing and older people having less <b>colored</b> <b>discharge.</b> Volume was associated with cleaning regimes with more frequent cleaners having more volume. Viscosity was associated with cleaning regimes and years of wearing with more frequent cleaning and shorter wearing time accompanying more viscous discharge. No associations were found between discharge characteristics and ethnicity, eye loss cause, hand washing, age of current prosthesis, or repolishing regimes. Forty-seven percent of ocularists&rsquo; Web sites advised that discharge was caused by surface deposits on the prosthesis, 29 % by excessive handling of the prosthesis, and 24 % by other causes. Conclusions: A standardized treatment protocol for managing discharge is lacking. More frequent prosthesis removal and cleaning was associated with more severe discharge, but the direction of cause and effect has not been established. Professional repolishing regimes had limited impact on discharge experience. Further research into the socket&rsquo;s response to prosthetic eye wear, including the physical, chemical, and biological elements of the conjunctiva, the socket fluids, and the deposits that cover the prosthetic eye is recommended.

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical findings of candidiasis and trichomoniasis in women supported by selected health centers of Tabriz, Iran. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, in which 1000 women who had the study criteria were selected by random sampling. In addition, 12 health centers of Tabriz were selected for this study. A questionnaire was used to obtain their personal and reproductive information, checklist for clinical observations, and culture methods (sabouraud dextrose agar and diamond) for diagnose vaginal infections. Results: The prevalence of candidiasis and trichomoniasis were 25. 2 and 9. 2 %, respectively. Findings showed that candidiasis infection, history of diseases, vaginal pH, number of coitus, number of delivery, and number of vaginal delivery, breast feeding status, method of last delivery, and contraceptive methods are risk factors for candidacies. Moreover, age at marriage, personal health, sexual hygiene, and vaginal pH are risk factors for trichomoniasis. A statistically significant relationship was observed between candidiasis and clinical findings, such as pruritus, pruritus during coitus, burning sensation with coitus, dysuria in woman and her husband, dyspareunia, low abdominal pain, urinal symptoms, vaginal status, amount of discharge, consistency appearance, and <b>color</b> of <b>discharges.</b> Furthermore, a significant relationship was observed between trichomoniasis and dysuria, and appearance and <b>color</b> of vaginal <b>discharge.</b> Conclusion: Due to the high prevalence of candidiasis, trichomoniasis infections, and infected women as asymptomatic carriers, it seems necessary to pay more attention to these infections and make efforts for their prevention...|$|R

40|$|The {{waste water}} from the dyeing of cotton and poly-cotton blends is {{characterized}} by high levels of salts and <b>color.</b> The <b>discharged</b> salts are felt to contribute to effluent toxicity and the color is aesthetically unacceptable in the receiving streams. The system of selective membrane filtration offers a method to address both of these problems. By treating only the waste water having the most color and salt concentration, the expensive membrane equipment can be considerably downsized. The volume of the color to be removed is drastically reduced as filtrate material. At these low volumes of color more economical means of removal can be employed. The membranes are designed so that the color and other pollutant materials are rejected but the salt solution is allowed {{to pass through the}} membrane. This produces clean water containing the recovered salt suitable for reuse, greatly reducing the salt content of the effluent.

50|$|The gas in {{the tube}} {{has to be kept}} pure to {{maintain}} the desired properties; even small amount of impurities can dramatically change the tube values; presence of non-inert gases generally increases the breakdown and burning voltages. The presence of impurities can be observed by changes in the glow color of the gas. Air leaking into the tube introduces oxygen, which is highly electronegative and inhibits the production of electron avalanches. This makes the discharge look pale, milky, or reddish. Traces of mercury vapors glow bluish, obscuring the original gas color. Magnesium vapor <b>colors</b> the <b>discharge</b> green. To prevent outgassing of the tube components during operation, a bake-out is required before filling with gas and sealing. Thorough degassing is required for high-quality tubes; even as little as 10−8 torr (≈1 μPa) of oxygen is sufficient for covering the electrodes with monomolecular oxide layer in few hours. Non-inert gases can be removed by suitable getters. for mercury-containing tubes, getters that do not form amalgams with mercury (e.g. zirconium, but not barium) have to be used. Cathode sputtering may be used intentionally for gettering non-inert gases; some reference tubes use molybdenum cathodes for this purpose.|$|R
40|$|A {{screening}} for dye-decolorizing alkali-thermophilic microorganisms {{resulted in a}} Bacillus sp. strain isolated out of the wastewater drain of a textile finishing company. An NADH-dependent azoreductase of this strain, Bacillus sp. strain SF, {{was found to be}} responsible for the decolorization of azo dyes. This enzyme was purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion-exchange and affinity chromatography and had a molecular mass of 61. 6 kDa and an isoelectric point at pH 5. 3. The pH optimum of the azoreductase depended on the substrate and was within the range of pHs 8 to 9, while the temperature maximum was reached at 80 °C. Decolorization only took place in the absence of oxygen and was enhanced by FAD, which was not consumed during the reaction. A 26 % similarity of this azoreductase to chaperonin Cpn 60 from a Bacillus sp. was found by peptide mass mapping experiments. Substrate specificities of the azoreductase were studied by using synthesized model substrates based on di-sodium-(R) -benzyl-azo- 2, 7 -dihydroxy- 3, 6 -disulfonyl-naphthaline.

In this study we examined spatial variation of land cover at a 10 � 10 m resolution by developing a mass balance, maximum likelihood model of lake iron (Fe) concentrations in 93 watersheds. The model estimated lake iron concentrations based on loading, within-lake processes and losses. Two models were developed. One considered loading from eight land cover types, whereas the second model included the distance of each grid cell to account for Fe losses along flow paths to the lake. In-lake production and losses were accounted for {{as a function of}} lake area, water <b>color,</b> and <b>discharge.</b> If we treated watersheds as homogeneous source areas, export was estimated as 450 mg Fe m� 2 yr� 1; however, in spatial models export varied from negligible to 5, 400 mg Fe m� 2 yr� 1 based on differential loadings from eight cover types. Accounting for losses of Fe based on distance from the lake did not improve the model. Although areal export of Fe was greater from wetlands, upland forests dominate the landscape and thus accounted for on average 75 % of the total Fe load. Fe losses from lakes were primarily regulated by discharge; however, water color and lake depth were also important. Overall, the analysis revealed that lake Fe concentrations are related to land cover based on strong differential Fe loadings...|$|R

The Asia-Pacific Burden of Respiratory Diseases study examined the disease and economic burden of AR, asthma, COPD, and rhinosinusitis across the Asia-Pacific and more specifically India. Objectives: To estimate the proportion of adults receiving care for asthma, AR, COPD, and rhinosinusitis and assess the economic burden, both direct and indirect of these chronic respiratory disease. Subjects and Methods: Consecutive participants aged ≥ 18 years with a primary diagnosis of asthma, AR, COPD, or rhinosinusitis were enrolled. Surveys comprising questions about respiratory disease symptoms, healthcare resource utilization, work productivity, and activity impairment were completed by treating physicians and participants during one study visit.

In our experiments on A 1, Ta, and Zr anodes in the glycol borate electrolyte the same characteristic neon flashes were observed. On each of these metals, {{as well as on}} Si (7), copious gas evolution accompanied spark-ing. This suggests that sparking may be the electrical discharge through gas generated at the anode surface.

40|$|Synthetic organic dyes {{comprise}} {{a significant part}} of industrial water effluents, as they are discharged in abundance by many manufacturing industries (e. g. textile industries). The potential carcinogenic properties of these dyes render their safe disposal a major environmental concern. The colored wastewater {{in the presence of the}} aforementioned dyes is a major cause of eutrophication and production of hazardous byproducts through processes such as oxidation, hydrolysis, or other chemical reactions taking place in the wastewater phase. The colored wastewater release in the ecosystem may also block both sunlight penetration and oxygen dissolution, which are essential for energy intake and the preservation of aquatic life. Thus there is a dire need to treat these <b>colored</b> effluents before <b>discharging</b> them into various water bodies. For the safe removal of dye pollutants, traditional physical techniques (adsorption on activated carbon, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, coagulation by chemical agents, ion exchange on synthetic adsorbent resins, etc.) can generally be used efficiently. Nevertheless, they are non-destructive for the pollutant, since they merely transfer the organic compounds from liquid to another phase, thus causing secondary pollution. Consequently, costly regeneration of adsorbent materials and post-treatment of solid-wastes, which are expensive operations, are mandated. Due to the large degree of aromatics present in dye molecules and the stability of modern dyes, conventional biological treatment methods (Cyclic Activated Sludge System) are ineffective for decolorization and degradation. Lately, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), such as photochemical processes, Fenton, photo-Fenton, Fenton-like, ozonation and photocatalysis, are being applied to treat dye effluents with encouraging results. AOPs were based on the generation of very reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), that oxidize a broad range of pollutants quickly and non-selectively. Among AOPs, heterogeneous photocatalysis appears as the most promising pollutant destructive technology. Heterogeneous photocatalytic processes involve irradiation–usually UV-A (λ= 320 – 400 nm) or solar irradiation, in the presence of a semiconductor acting as a catalyst for the production of free hydroxyl radicals. The basic mechanism for generating •ΟΗ involves the adsorption of a photon, the generation of an electron-hole pair (e_cb^-+ h_vb^+) and subsequently the production of •ΟΗ. The photo-generation of a hole-electron pair is a reversible process and it can therefore correspondingly diminish the rate of •ΟΗ production. The generated electrons react with adsorbed oxygen and this inhibits the recombination step. In the absence of a surface e- acceptor species recombination of the hole-electron pair proceeds very fast. The photogenerated holes can oxidize the organic molecule to form R+, or react with OH− or H 2 O, thus oxidizing them into •OH radicals. Together with other highly oxidant species (peroxide radicals) they are reported in the literature to be responsible for the heterogeneous photodecomposition of organic substrates as dyes. Considering efficient photocatalysts, nanometric commercial Titania (Degussa P 25), is one of the most promising materials due to its potent photocatalytic properties. However, it strongly suffers from a low photocatalytic activity when employed under visible light, while also exhibiting a positive correlation with the appearance of human lung cancer, attributed to the presence of respirable, nano-sized particles. To overcome these problems, new materials need to be produced and tested for their photocatalytic properties. Utilizing high energy ultrasounds (US), in order to modify the surface of a ceramic substrate with metallic nanoparticles, is considered an easy, fast and effective approach for synthesizing photocatalysts and increase their photocatalytic potential in the visible range. In the present thesis, a sonochemical procedure exploiting high energy ultrasounds was used in order to obtain decoration (10 % W/W) of Ag metallic nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of commercial micrometric Titania Kronos 1077 (100 % anatase, average crystallite size: 110 nm, Eg= 3. 2 eV). To investigate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared sample the molecule of Methylene Blue dye was used. A parametric study of the photocatalytic oxidation was carried out, accounting for variable pH and amount of employed catalyst. Tests were conducted both under UV-A light and artificial visible light. To ensure the decoration of silver NPs on the titanium dioxide substrate two different solutions were prepared. The first solution (A) contains the silver precursor AgNO 3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %), PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %), TiO 2 Kronos 1077 and dist. H 2 O. The second solution (B) contains NaBH 4 (Sigma Aldrich, 99. 0 %) and dist. H 2 O. First, solution A was treated by US generated using a VCX 750 by SONICS®, utilizing a 200 W US generator and a sonication extension horn (US frequency: 20 kHz) of 13 mm diameter and maintaining the temperature at 30 ◦C using a heating circulator for 10 minutes with 33. 0 % amplitude and an intensity of 30 Wcm− 2. Without stopping sonication, solution B was then mixed with solution A and sonication continued for one hour. The presence of NaBH 4 acts as a reducing agent on the silver precursor molecules while PVP, which acts as a surfactant, plays a crucial role on the morphology and size of the final product. Ultrasound is fundamental for both the formation of NPs from the precursor and for their optimal distribution on the TiO 2 support surface. Indeed, ultrasonic irradiation speeds up the diffusion of solute in the reaction system, as well as influences the selective adsorption of the surfactant on silver, thus inducing elongation or compression in defined directions, affecting the particles morphology. Moreover, the use of US allows working in conditions that do not require high temperatures and thus they are not energy intensive. Finally, the sonicated mixture is centrifuged in order to remove the solvent and it is then washed with dist. water. After centrifugation, the obtained slurry mixture was put in an oven for two hours at 400 ◦C. XRD analysis of the modified sample showed that surface decoration does not affect the structural properties of Kronos 1077. The XRD pattern exhibits the peaks characteristic of the anatase phase [ICDD anatase file no. 21 - 1272]. The TEM analysis of bare Kronos 1077 shows that it is characterized by an average crystallites dimensions lying in the 100 – 150 nm range. Respectively, the decorated sample exhibits the main morphological features typical of the parent Kronos system, with an average Ag nanoparticle size on the Kronos surface lying in the 10 – 30 nm range. In order to test the photocalytic properties of the prepared sample, compared to the bare one, and examine certain parameters that effect the degradation of Methylene Blue molecule (pH, catalyst loading), a photocalytic apparatus was designed and build in the lab. The experiments were carried out in a glass vessel of 120 ml, transparent to UV-A irradiation. A total of 6 lamps, 11 W each, were placed above the vessel either for UV-A (PL-S 11 W/ 10 / 2 P 1 CT, λmax= 365 nm) or for VL, (PL-S 11 W/ 865 / 2 P 1 CT, λmax= 545 nm) irradiation. Since dyes are colored in nature, it is straightforward to monitor their color change during the course of the experiment. In photocatalytic studies, the sample is typically exposed to UV or VL irradiation for a given time period and the changes in solution property (such as color) are observed by a spectrophotometer. To monitor the photodegradation of the dye a sample of the solution after irradiation is transferred to a cuvette and subjected to absorption studies on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (U- 5100 Hitachi). The degree of decoloration (τ) is then calculated from the decrease of absorbance of the dye solution at its maximum absorption wavelength as follows: τ=[1 -A_i/A_ 0]× 100 where, A 0 and Ai are the absorbance values of the dye solution, before and after irradiation respectively. After each measurement the sample is returned back to the glass vessel. The MB removal was studied by monitoring the degradation of the MB dye in an aqueous solution (100 ml, 2 × 10 - 5 M), under continuous stirring and exposure to UV-A light irradiation or visible light (VL). The characteristic absorption at 663 nm was used to determine the MB concentration. In the experiments regarding the photodegradation efficiency of MB, as affected by the initial pH of the solution, the catalyst loading was kept constant at 2 mg and pH varied from the natural pH at 5. 8 to 4 and 2. Respectively, the experiments regarding the catalyst loading, the pH of the suspension was fixed and kept constant at pH value 4 and the catalyst loading varied between 1, 2 and 3 mg [...] Before starting each experiment the prepared suspension was put in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes under dark conditions to ensure the best possible distribution of the catalysts particles in the solution and a maximum absorption of the dye molecules onto the catalyst surface. A benchmark absorption spectrum, before irradiation, was obtained. Subsequently, the lamps were turned on and the experiments lasted for one hour of illumination, taking measurements of the absorption spectra at specific time intervals during the illumination process. The photocatalytic studies under different pH solutions showed that at lower pH values the photocatalytic oxidation is enhanced. The variation in solution pH changes the surface charge of TiO 2 particles and shifts the potentials of the catalytic reactions taking place. The surface of Titania will remain positively charged in an acidic medium and negatively charged in an alkaline medium because of protonation or deprotonation respectively. Therefore as the pH|$|R
