50|$|The <b>Cyprus</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia melanothorax) is {{a typical}} warbler which breeds only on Cyprus. This small {{passerine}} bird is a short-distance migrant, and winters in Israel, Jordan and Egypt.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the genus}} Sylvia {{it is highly}} distinctive; the barred {{underside}} is shared only with the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>warbler,</b> which has black barring and an entirely different overall colour pattern. The barred warbler seems to represent an ancient lineage of Sylvia warblers on its own and {{does not appear to}} have any particularly close relatives in the genus.|$|E
50|$|Cyprus {{also has}} over 380 {{identified}} species of bird due to being on migration routes between Africa to Europe and western Asia including Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae), flamingo and the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca). There are two endemic species of songbirds, the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia melanothorax) and the Cyprus wheatear (Oenanthe cypriaca). Both only breed {{on the island}} of Cyprus and migrate south to overwinter.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} <b>Cyprus</b> <b>warbler</b> {{it forms a}} {{superspecies}} with dark throats, white malar streaks and light remiges fringes. This in turn {{is related to the}} species of Mediterranean and Middle East Sylvia warblers that have a naked eye-ring, namely the subalpine warbler, Sardinian warbler and Ménétries's warbler. Both groups have a white malar area, but this may not form a clear streak in the latter group; above the white, the heads of males are uniformly dark.|$|E
50|$|Together with Menetries' warbler the Sardinian warbler forms a superspecies. Both have white malar {{areas and}} light throats, and {{otherwise}} black heads in adult males, {{as well as}} a naked ring around the eye. The subalpine warbler, which seems the superspecies' closest relative, has a dark throat and breast and a dark gray upper head in males, but otherwise shares these characters. These three species are related to a dark-throated superspecies consisting of Rüppell's warbler and the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>warbler,</b> which also share the white malar area with blackish above.|$|E
5000|$|This bird {{seems to}} be related to the Sardinian warbler-Menetries' warbler {{superspecies}}. They all have white malar areas, the heads being dark above in adult males, and naked eye-rings. These three species are related to a superspecies consisting of Rüppell's warbler and the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>warbler,</b> which also share the white malar area with blackish above.(Shirihai et al. 2001, Jønsson & Fjeldså 2006 [...] )The subalpine warbler is divided into two distinct subspecies groups, which may possibly be sufficiently diverged to qualify as two separate species (Shirihai et al. 2001). The two groups have differing male plumages, distinctive calls, and are allopatric; further study is needed.|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic habitat {{change and}} {{assisted}} colonization are promoting range expansions of some widespread species with potential consequences for endemic fauna. The recent colonization of Cyprus by breeding Sardinian Warblers Sylvia melanocephala has raised concerns {{that it might}} be displacing the closely related and endemic <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Warbler</b> Sylvia melanothorax. Habitat associations of both species were examined using models of abundance within the 95 % density kernel of the Sardinian Warbler's range and also outside this range for <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Warbler.</b> Within the Sardinian Warbler's range, the two species were associated with subtly different scrub habitats. Outside the Sardinian Warbler's range, the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Warbler</b> differed again in its habitat association, but this probably resulted from marked differences in habitat extent and availability {{in different parts of the}} island rather than from competitive displacement, as none of the habitat or land-use elements differentially associated with Cyprus Warblers was positively associated with Sardinian Warbler occurrence. This suggests that the Sardinian Warbler has exploited a different niche, rather than displacing the endemic species, and has perhaps benefitted from changing land-use patterns, particularly recent fallows and abandoned agriculture, in contrast to the stronger association of Cyprus Warblers with semi-natural scrub. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|Land-use {{change and}} {{associated}} habitat loss and species invasions {{are two of}} the greatest threats to global biodiversity. In Europe, changes in farmland management practices driven in part by the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have caused dramatic declines in associated biodiversity. This thesis studied avian land-use associations to understand the relative importance of different habitat and landscape elements to the farmland bird community, with particular emphasis on priority species for conservation, in Cyprus, a recently acceded EU Member State, as a case study for the eastern Mediterranean. Results provide the first evidence base to inform CAP agri-environment measures in the region. A wide range of habitats and land-uses were important for bird species and assemblages and local habitat diversity was of key value. Farmland habitats, particularly viticulture and groves, and remnant scrub were the most important, demonstrating the high value of heterogeneous farmland mosaics to breeding and wintering avian biodiversity in Cyprus. The area of land under agriculture in Cyprus has substantially decreased, with much of this attributable to declines in marginal low-intensity crops on which much avian biodiversity depends. Building development appears to be one important driver behind these trends. Changes observed in the distributions of Sardinian Warbler Sylvia melanocephala, a recently established breeder in Cyprus, and the endemic <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Warbler</b> Sylvia melanothorax are more likely mediated by changing land-use patterns relating to grazing intensity of scrub, as {{there was no evidence of}} competitive displacement. The complex Mediterranean farmland mosaic was created by traditional farming practices that are usually economically marginal. Agri-environment mechanisms to support this heterogeneity are necessary for effective conservation of priority species and bird biodiversity in the eastern Mediterranean...|$|E
