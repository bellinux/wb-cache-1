The polar (002) {{surface of}} ZnO nanorods, {{which could be}} either negatively charge (O-terminated) or positively charged (Zn-terminated), {{was responsible for the}} formation of twin-rod structure.

In fact, the presence of Cu retarded the growth of ZnO nanorods in its preferred growth direction, i. e. (0001). The XPS analysis indicates that Cu ions were oxidized (Cu 2 +) and substituted into the ZnO lattice at the Zn 2 + site. The presence of Cu reduced the optical bandgap of ZnO from 3. 34 eV (undoped ZnO nanorods) to 3. 31 eV (20 mol% Cu doped ZnO).

Methods: The CuO NPs were synthesized via a facile and cost-effective precipitation method using <b>cupric</b> <b>acetate</b> (<b>monohydrate)</b> (CuAc 2. 2 H 2 O), sodium hydroxide, and glacial acetic acid. By varying the pH of the precursor solution, the morphology, particle size, and reaction rate of the NPs could be well tailored.

Results: The results revealed a well crystalline structure with leaf-like morphology. By controlling the pH of the solution, particle size and morphology of the NPs are altered. The synthesized CuO NPs have been screened for its antibacterial potency against Gram-positive (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Salmonella Paratyphi, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter aerogenes) bacterial strains.
