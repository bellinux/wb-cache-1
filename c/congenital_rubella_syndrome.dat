25|$|Rubella, {{also known}} as German measles or three-day measles, is an {{infection}} caused by the rubella virus. This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are sick. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads {{to the rest of}} the body. The rash is not as bright as that of measles and is sometimes itchy. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.|$|E

Subsequently, ophthalmologist Norman McAllister Gregg found 78 cases of congenital cataracts in infants and 68 of them were born to mothers who had caught rubella in early pregnancy. Gregg published an account, Congenital Cataract Following German Measles in the Mother, in 1941.

40|$|On 1 January 2005, rubella {{infection}} {{during pregnancy}} and <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> syndrome/infection (CRS/CRI) were made statutorily notifiable in Italy, {{as recommended by}} the national plan {{for the elimination of}} measles and <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> [1]. This plan set a goal in 2003, to eliminate measles and reduce the incidence of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> cases to under 1 / 100 000 live births by the year 2007. In Italy, rubella has been a statutorily notifiable disease since 1970, but reporting of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> (CR) was mandatory only between 1987 and 1991 and no specific surveillance of rubella in pregnancy has ever previously been conducted. All suspected cases of rubella during pregnancy and <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> must now be reported by physicians to the local health authorities. A suspected case of rubella during pregnancy can be in any woman in whom a physician suspects rubella, even if the signs and symptoms do not meet the clinical case definition (that is, acute onset of generalised maculopapular rash and arthralgia/arthritis, lymphadenopathy or conjunctivitis) [2] Between January and December 2005, nine cases of suspected rubella infection during pregnancy were reported. Follow up has so far been completed for seven of these cases, and they are described in this report. The other two cases are still being evaluated. These cases reveal that rubella during pregnancy and <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> infection do occur in Italy. Only one case of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella</b> was identified, indicating an incidence of CR well below the elimination threshold of less than 1 case per 100 000 live births, which in Italy would be equivalent to 5 CR cases. These data, however, probably represent marked underreporting. All cases were notified by the same hospital centre in Rome, and so we assume that many more unreported cases occur across Italy. This indicates a need for improved training of physicians regarding the necessity of reporting cases of suspected rubella in pregnancy and of <b>congenital</b> <b>rubella...</b>|$|R
