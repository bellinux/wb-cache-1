5000|$|... ==Bulgaria== Bulgarian weapon law is {{maintained}} on a yearly basis. It is called ZOBVVPI (Bulgarian: „Закон за оръжията, боеприпасите, взривните вещества и пиротехническите изделия") and it covers ONLY the possession and usage of firearms (including gas and signal ones), and pellet or BB (Bulgarian: „сачми") pneumatic guns. A state regulation on melee weapons {{of any kind}} does not exist, whether knives, swords, bats or electric devices. Neither there is a juridical definition on the terms [...] "melee weapon" [...] or [...] "cold weapon" [...] in any Bulgarian law. Hence it is absolutely legal to possess and carry a knife in Bulgaria without having to procure any reason for doing so. Concealed knife carry is OK, anywhere and anytime. Although there are no restrictions on the possession or carrying of any type of knives or swords, it is not widely accepted or considered appropriate to carry a knife openly in public places such as streets or public buildings, stores or restaurants. In urban areas, expect an instant check and hassle if a policeman sees you to openly carry a larger knife, {{even if you have}} legal right to do it. From a society point of view, the open carry of knives in Bulgaria is justified only on rural areas, when fishing or hunting, or when the knife serves as a tool in work activities, such as gardening. Some places like courts, banks, clubs, bars, etc. will deny you the access with any type of weapon (knives included) and most of them don't offer a safekeeping option. It is urban legend in Bulgaria that knives above 10 cm. are illegal to carry on person, so expect the police to try and convince you give up the knife voluntarily, even if such measure is illegal. You should not give up your knife, instead state the purpose of [...] "daily needs", [...] "utility usage" [...] or even [...] "self-defense" [...] for carrying and be clear that you haven't committed any crime. Insist the policeman to cite a law against you carrying a knife in public. Since there isn't any such law in Bulgaria, police most likely will let you keep your knife and send you on your way with a [...] "warning". If they insinst or are further misbehaving, ask to contact their superior officer prior to giving up your knife or else you won't see it again. Actually, there are some random city councils which try to limit knife lengths above 10 centimeters (4 inches) with issuing acts, but these acts are all illegal and have no <b>compliance</b> <b>force,</b> because the councils serve only administrative functions and they don't have the jurisdiction to invent or impose laws of any kind. Remember that although very liberal in terms of knives (weapons) possession and carry, compared to many European countries, Bulgaria isn't the place where you can defend yourself with deadly force. If the need for self-defense with a knife ever arises, consider it very carefully. Bulgaria has strong restrictive self-defense laws and a [...] "duty to retreat" [...] is always obligatory. Usually, courts often consider the armed self-defense as [...] "unjustified" [...] based on the Penal Code and the defending side ends up with an effective jail verdict, even if the cause (treat) for initiating self-defense is proven.|$|E

Effects of clearance magnitude {{and the relationship between}} a mechanism with clearance and without clearance are studied.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} in an elastase-induced emphysema rabbit model the effects of increasing resection volumes during lung volume reduction surgery on pulmonary <b>compliance,</b> <b>forced</b> expiratory air flow, and diffusing capacity to assess factors limiting optimal resection. Methods: Emphysema was induced in 68 New Zealand White rabbits with 15, 000 units of aerosolized elastase. Static respiratory system <b>compliance,</b> <b>forced</b> expiratory flow, and single-breath diffusing capacity were measured before the induction of emphysema, after the induction of emphysema, and 1 week after a bilateral upper and middle lobe lung volume reduction operation. Results: Static respiratory system compliance with 60 mL insufflation above functional residual capacity increased with emphysema induction and then decreased progressively with resection of larger volumes of lung tissue (P =. 001 by analysis of variance). Expiratory flow improved after lung resection in the rabbits with large resection volumes. In contrast, diffusing capacity tended to deteriorate with larger resection volumes (P =. 18). Conclusion: Improvements in respiratory system <b>compliance</b> and <b>forced</b> expiratory flow after lung volume reduction operations may account for the improvements seen clinically. Declines in diffusing capacity with extensive lung reduction may limit the clinical benefits associated with greater tissue resection volumes. Future investigations with animal models may reveal other physiologic parameters that may further guide optimal lung volume reduction procedures. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 728 - 35...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{was developed for}} studying the mechanical behavior of thin films on substrate applications for micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS). The test structure was designed on novel "paddle" cantilever beam coated thin film specimens with dimensions {{of a few hundred}} to 50 nm. This beam has a triangle shape that provides a uniform plane strain distribution. Standard clean room processing was used to prepare the paddle sample. The experiment can be operated using the electrostatic force to deflect the "paddle" cantilever beam and measure the mechanical response of the sample with surface deposited thin film. A capacitance measurement is used to observe the deflection of the cantilever plate {{on the other side of}} the sample with respect to the electrostatic force on the one side. The measured strain was then converted through this capacitance measurement to conduct mechanical behavior studies on the coated thin film. Both system performance experiments and calculations were studied to verify the design concepts. The residual thin film stress measurements were performed and compared with the calculated results from three different forces exerted on the "paddle" cantilever beam, including the force due to the film, <b>compliance</b> <b>force,</b> and electrostatic force...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{work is to}} develop a controller that combines the position and indirect force control for the gemstone polishing process. The polished gemstones are attached to the end of drop-stick of the Chula Automatic Faceting Machine. The Chula Automatic Faceting Machine has 4 -axis high precision motion control and the other 2 -axis for spindle and crank motion. Many gemstones (number of gemstones will depends {{on the size of the}} gemstone) can be grinded and polished simultaneously with the result of uniform size and quality. In this {{research work}}, the controller is developed based on PID motion control. The reference position of the controller for the grinding process is obtained based on the <b>compliance</b> <b>force</b> control technique with known compliance model. This reference position will specified the pressing force for the grinding process indirectly. The controller developed in-house is used for testing with Cubic Zirconia gemstone which the hardness is 8. 5 Mohs. The compliance model and appropriate parameters including the minimum and maximum boundary of polishing process can be obtained experimentally. Then all parameters obtained from the experiment can be used in the controller. The uniform size and quality of the multi-stone grinding and polishing process can be obtained with this controller...|$|E

The test microstructure was designed the triangular cantilever beam and fabricated by the standard C-MOS processes, which can improve stress distribution non-uniform problem and the thickness regime of deposited metal thin film on its surface could reduce to several nanometers. In {{order to reduce the}} measure error and calculation complex due to the contact force (like indenter), the driving system was used electrostatic force to making the paddle cantilever beam bend and the deflection of paddle cantilever beam due to the electrostatic force was measured by a capacitance change (Fig. 1). The deflection of the paddle beam can be measured from the capacitance value. A force equilibrium calculate method (include sample <b>compliance</b> <b>force,</b> force due to the film, force due to the gravity and electrostatic force) could determine the stress and strain of the deposited films easily. The anelastic behavior and internal friction study of 200 ~ 500 nm Ag & Al thin film were studied using the dynamic frequency response of the paddle structure generated by electrostatic force under vacuum pressure.

40|$|Psychophysical {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} investigate the haptic perception of objects with varying compliance over their surfaces. Perception of compliance contrast is important in interaction with soft environments, as in teleoperative surgery. Simulated surfaces were presented using a haptic interface in virtual environments. An adaptive 2 [...] down, 1 [...] up procedure {{was used to determine}} thresholds for compliance contrast detection at a range of spatial frequencies. The maximum effective temporal frequencies of compliance change, due to the subjects' action of scanning the surfaces, were calculated. Force contrast detection thresholds were determined at a range of temporal frequencies to investigate the reliance of compliance contrast detection on <b>force</b> cues. <b>Compliance</b> and <b>force</b> discrimination thresholds were determined in order to compare with low frequency contrast thresholds. <b>Compliance</b> and <b>force</b> contrast detection thresholds were found to be 2 % and 1 % above 1 / 2 cyc/cm and 20 Hz, respectively. Both were significantly smaller than respective <b>compliance</b> and <b>force</b> discrimination thresholds and low frequency contrast detection thresholds. It appears that the improvement in compliance contrast detection sensitivity is due to subjects being more sensitive to force contrast at higher temporal frequencies. By changing environment exploration strategies or limb impedance, subjects may be able to change their sensitivity to object compliance contrast...|$|R

40|$|The use of robots {{in health}} care has {{increased}} dramatically over the last decade. One area of research has been to use robots to conduct ultrasound examinations, either controlled by a physician or autonomously. This paper examines {{the possibility of using}} the commercial robot UR 5 from Universal Robots to make a tele-operated robotic ultrasound system. Physicians diagnosing patients using ultrasound probes are prone to repetitive strain injuries, as they are required to hold the probe in uncomfortable positions and exert significant static force. The main application for the system is to relieve the physician of this strain by letting the them control a robot that holds the probe. A set of requirements for the system is derived from the state-of-the-art systems found in the research literature. The system is developed through a low-level interface for the robot, effectively building a new software framework for controlling it. <b>Compliance</b> <b>force</b> control and forward flow haptic control of the robot was implemented. Experiments are conducted to quantify the performance of the two control schemes. The force control is estimated to have a bandwidth of 16. 6 Hz, while the haptic control is estimated to have a bandwidth of 65. 4 Hz for the position control of the slave and 13. 4 Hz for the force control of the master. Overall, the system meets the derived requirements and the main conclusion is that it is feasible to use the UR 5 robot for robotic ultrasound applications...|$|E

40|$|This study {{looks at}} one of the many tools to promote {{environmental}} sustainability, namely environmental taxation. This research identifies the gaps between current Malaysian tax laws and practices in the countries reviewed, as well as the desires of Malaysian taxpayers which are not practiced in other countries. A mixedmethod approach was used in this study. In the qualitative method focus groups and interviews involving 30 experts from various disciplines thoroughly explored what taxpayers want from environmental taxation laws. The quantitative approach entailed emailing a set of questionnaires to more than 700 respondents. The researcher developed and tested the environmental taxation acceptance model and its variables. In the model, the taxpayer engages in voluntary <b>compliance,</b> <b>forced</b> <b>compliance</b> or non-compliance with environmental tax laws. Environmental taxation does play a role in encouraging good environmental behaviour; however, it only performing a supporting role in encouraging environmental preservation. Public education about good environmental behaviour, enforcement of environmental laws and supporting services should be practised along with environmental taxation laws. The Life of Pi Theorem is introduced. The theorem proposes that environmental taxation (or any other eco-friendly policy) will never restore nature to its original glory.

40|$|There {{are high}} {{mechanical}} demands placed on skeletal muscles in movements requiring rapid {{acceleration of the}} body or its limbs. Tendons are responsible for transmitting muscle forces, but, due to their elasticity, can manipulate {{the mechanics of the}} internal contractile apparatus. Shortening of the contractile apparatus against the stretch of tendon affects force generation according to known mechanical properties, however, the extent to which differences in tendon <b>compliance</b> alter <b>force</b> development in response to a burst of electrical impulses is unclear. To establish the influence of series <b>compliance</b> on <b>force</b> summation, we studied electrically evoked doublet contractions in the cane toad peroneus muscle in the presence and absence of a compliant artificial tendon. Additional series <b>compliance</b> reduced tetanic <b>force</b> by two-thirds, a finding predicted based on the force-length property of skeletal muscle. Doublet force and force-time integral expressed relative to the twitch were also reduced by additional series compliance. Active shortening over a larger range of the ascending limb of the force-length curve and at a higher velocity, leading to a progressive reduction in force-generating potential, could be responsible. Muscle-tendon interaction may also explain the accelerated time course of force relaxation in the presence of additional compliance. Our findings suggest that a compliant tendon limits force summation under constant-length conditions. However, high series compliance can be mechanically advantageous when a muscle-tendon unit is actively stretched, permitting muscle fibres to generate force almost isometrically, as shown during stretch-shorten cycles in locomotor activities. Restricting active shortening would likely favour rapid force development...|$|R

After completing a set of basic psychophysical experiments on compliance resolution (Experiment 1), we performed further experiments to investigate whether work and/or terminal-force cues played a role in compliance discrimination.
