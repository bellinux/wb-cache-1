None of the patients showed deletions of the telomeric gene; however, the deletion frequency of the centromeric gene was 27 %. In a multiplex family, the mildly affected sibling, who is ambulant, had a preserved centromeric copy of the SMN gene, whereas in the severely affected sibling the copy was missing. The centromeric copy of the SMN gene may have a contributing role in the phenotype of patients with CMD, {{as well as other}} modifying genes or environmental factors.

40|$|Within {{the group}} of <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophies,</b> dystroglycanopathies {{represent}} an important subgroup of recessively inherited disorders. Their severity varies from the relatively mild forms of adult-onset limb-girdle <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophy</b> (LGMD), to the severe <b>congenital</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophies</b> (CMD) with cerebral and ocular involvement. We describe 2 consanguineous children of Pakistani origin, carrying a new homozygous missense mutation c. 367 G>A (p. Gly 123 Arg) in the ISPD gene. Mutations in this gene have been recently reported as a common cause of <b>congenital</b> and limb-girdle <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophy.</b> Patient 1 is an 8 -year-old female with an intermediate phenotype between CMD and early LGMD; patient 2 is a 20 -month-old male and second cousin of patient 1, showing a CMD phenotype.

50|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophies</b> (CMD) such as muscle-eye-brain {{disease are}} caused by {{defective}} glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) exhibit defective photoreceptor synaptic function. Pikachurin plays {{an essential role in}} CMD. Precise interactions between the photoreceptor ribbon synapse and the bipolar dendrites which are realized due to Pikachurin may advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the retinal electrophysiological abnormalities observed in <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophy</b> patients. The muscle-eye-brain dystrophy is caused by mutations in POMGnT1 or LARGE. These two genes mediated a post-translational modification on O-mannose, which is essential for pikachurin binding to dystroglycan, so people who suffer muscle-eye-disease have an hypoglycosylation of pikachurin-α-dystroglycan interactions.|$|R
5000|$|BFPP is a cobblestone-like {{cortical}} malformation of the brain. Disruptions of cerebral cortical development due to abnormal neuronal {{migration and}} positioning usually lead to cortical disorders, which includes cobblestone lissencephaly. Cobblestone lissencephaly is typically seen {{in three different}} human <b>congenital</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophy</b> syndromes: Fukuyama <b>congenital</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophy,</b> Walker-Warburg syndrome, and muscle-eye-brain disease. [...] In cobblestone lissencephaly, the brain surface actually has a bumpy contour caused {{by the presence of}} collections of misplaced neurons and glial cells that have migrated beyond the normal surface boundaries of the brain. Sometimes regions populated by these misplaced cells have caused a radiologic misdiagnosis of polymicrogyria. However, the presence of other abnormalities in these cobblestone lissencephaly syndromes, including ocular anomalies, <b>congenital</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophy,</b> ventriculomegaly, and cerebellar dysplasia, usually distinguishes these disorders from polymicrogyria. There are no anatomopathologic studies that have characterized the pattern of cortical laminar alterations in patients with GPR56 gene mutations, but {{it has been suggested that}} the imaging characteristics of BFPP, including myelination defects and cerebellar cortical dysplasia, are reminiscent of those of the so-called cobblestone malformations (muscle-eye-brain disease and Fukuyama <b>congenital</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophy)</b> that are also associated with N-glycosylation defects in the developing brain.|$|E

40|$|Sequencing {{individual}} genes by Sanger sequencing is a {{time-consuming and}} costly approach to resolve clinically heterogeneous genetic disorders. Panel testing offers {{the ability to}} efficiently and cost-effectively screen all of the genes for a particular genetic disorder. We assessed the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two different enrichment technologies, solution-based hybridization and microdroplet-based PCR target enrichment, in conjunction with next-generation sequencing (NGS), to identify mutations in 321 exons representing 12 different genes involved with <b>congenital</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophies.</b> <b>Congenital</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>dystrophies</b> present diagnostic challenges due to phenotypic variability, lack of standard access to and inherent difficulties with muscle immunohistochemical stains, and {{a general lack of}} clinician awareness. NGS results were analyzed across several parameters, including sequencing metrics and genotype concordance with Sanger sequencing. Genotyping data showed that both enrichment technologies produced suitable calls for use in clinical laboratories. However, microdroplet-based PCR target enrichment is more appropriate for a clinical laboratory, due to excellent sequence specificity and uniformity, reproducibility, high coverage of the target exons, and the ability to distinguish the active gene versus known pseudogenes. Regardless of the method, exons with highly repetitive and high GC regions are not well enriched and require Sanger sequencing for completeness. Our study demonstrates the successful application of targeted sequencing in conjunction with NGS to screen for mutations in hundreds of exons in a genetically heterogeneous human disorder...|$|R
