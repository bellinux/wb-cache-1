40|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} forest fires smoke using SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of View Sensor) images is developed in this paper. The <b>colour</b> <b>masking</b> technique is proposed {{to extract the}} maximum fires smoke pixels from the SeaStar/SeaWiFS satellite images by using Fusion by Arithmetic Combination (FAC) of the spectral bands method. Each image used is converted from RGB (Red, Green, Blue) to HIS (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) system. The resulting smoke plumes pixels are obtained visually in the Intensity and Saturation images. Then the values of intensity and saturation are analyzed to be potentially applied in other images. In this research, we applied our detecting forest fires smoke algorithm in seven different scenes, and {{in a variety of}} conditions, including different regions of the planet, and different dates. Next, Smoke Pixel Reference Ratio (SPRR) was used to test the proposed method. We found that the method can detect maximum pixels of smoke plumes in spite of some limitations...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigated}} {{how human}} vision processes colour and luminance information to enable perception of our environment. I first tested how colour {{can alter the}} perception of depth from shading. A luminance variation {{can be interpreted as}} either variation of reflectance (patterning) or variation of shape. The process of shape-from-shading interprets luminance variation as changes {{in the shape of the}} object (e. g. the shading on an object might elicit the perception of curvature). The addition of colour variation is known to modify this shape-from-shading processing. In the experiments presented here I tested how luminance driven percepts can be modified by colour. My first series of experiments confirmed that depth is modulated by colour. I explored a larger number of participants than previously tested. Contrary to previous studies, a wide repertoire of behaviour was found; participants experienced variously more depth, or less depth, or no difference. I hypothesised that the colour modulation effect might be due to a low-level contrast modulation of luminance by colour, rather than a higher-level depth effect. In a second series of experiments, I therefore tested how the perceived contrast of a luminance target can be affected by the presence of an orthogonal mask. I found that colour had a range of effects on the perception of luminance, again dependant on the participants. Luminance also had a similar wide range of effects on the perceived contrast of luminance targets. This showed that, at supra-threshold levels, a luminance target’s contrast can be modulated by a component of another orientation (colour or luminance defined). The effects of luminance and colour were not following a particular rule. In a third series of experiments, I explored this interaction at detection levels of contrast. I showed cross-interaction between luminance target and mask but no effects of a <b>colour</b> <b>mask...</b>|$|R

According to the parasite-mediated sexual selection hypothesis, organism health, parasite resistance and the expression of ornaments are linked. While some studies have analysed the expression of male carotenoid-based ornaments in relation to para- sites and immune system capacities, few studies have focused on carotenoid-derived colour patches expressed in both sexes.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{different}} colours, one {{presented to}} {{one eye and}} the other presented to the other eye, often create {{the impression of a}} third colour. This percept is known as binocular colour mixture. Here we use coloured stereograms to study binocular colour appearance. Vivid pastel colours are induced in monocular, achromatic patches, if these are placed in stereograms whose left and right images differ in colour. The build-up of the colours is slow and takes tens of seconds or even minutes in certain individuals. The induced colours remain visible during monocular viewing of the patch and decay gradually. The same colours are induced irrespective of whether the patches are placed in fusible or rivalrous stereograms. We show that these colour effects cannot be induced by monocular colour mechanisms, either alone or in combination with binocular colour mixing. We suggest that the colours are induced by a binocular feedback mechanism, which reduces colour differences between the colour appearances of two monocular images. Induced colours are not observed if the achromatic patches are binocular. However, induced colours are apparent if one switches to monocular viewing after prolonged binocular viewing of the binocular patches. This aftereffect suggests that binocular colour induction acts on the monocular representations of binocular images. We suggest that during binocular viewing the fast process of binocular <b>colour</b> mixing <b>masks</b> the changes in colour appearance produced by the much slower process of binocular colour induction...|$|R
40|$|Green-coloured {{results on}} guaiac-based faecal occult blood testing The {{information}} we have available {{from both sides of}} the Atlantic strongly supports the ¢ndings reported by Gordon et al. 1 Although no formal publica-tions exist to date, the observation of green colour on guaiac-based faecal occult blood tests (FOBT) has been reported and discussed anecdotally. The most likely origin of the colour has been considered to be the presence of bile. Since bile does not react with the guaiac, such green colours are observed to migrate away from the faecal specimen to the periphery of guaiac-impregnated paper when the developer is applied. Our concern was that, on occasion, such green <b>colours</b> could <b>mask</b> the true presence of occult blood and could result in misinterpretation of the test result. In-house tests with blood dilutions or with spiked samples using our Hema-screen product have always displayed spreading of colour away from the area where the sample was applied, but this was never washed away entirely towards the periphery. Based on the report of Gordon et al. 1 and the above observations, we concur with the recommenda-tions that a test result should be considered positive if the green colour did not wash out entirely to the periphery of the guaiac paper. Conversely, if such colour does wash out, the result should be inter-preted as negative. The correct interpretation of FOBT results as described by Gordon et al. 1 could potentially result in the saving of lives, while avoiding unnecessary, uncomfortable and expensive colonoscopies for those with no blood, but bile, in their faeces. We have changed the instruction sheets of our guaiac-based FOBT products accordingly...|$|R
50|$|A plant of C. prolifera {{consists}} {{of a number of}} blades or laminae linked by underground stolons which are fixed to the sandy substrate by rhizoids.

Even when derived from the same source, individual plants of C. prolifera show great variability of form and it has been shown that this is in part related to the level of light.

40|$|The rocky shore {{habitats}} of the African Great Lakes support high {{densities of}} cichlid fishes, including many closely-related/ecologically similar species. Aggressive behaviours between conspecifics, and perhaps heterospecifics, influences this unusually {{high level of}} species coexistence. In dichotomous choice aggression trials, male Maylandia thapsinogen were presented simultaneously with two heterospecific intruders (Maylandia emmiltos and Maylandia zebra). M. thapsinogen were significantly more aggressive towards intruders from an allopatric species (similar orange dorsal fin colour - M. emmiltos), than towards a different allopatric species (blue dorsal fin - M. zebra).

An interesting point (and often a point of confusion) is that while the coat color of those with black pigmented skin (nose, lips, pads, also referred to as [...] "leather") is determined by the color of the coat itself; the coat color on dogs with either liver or blue pigment is categorized by the color of the pigment. Thus, a parti colored (white and another shade) Shih Tzu with blue pigment is a [...] "blue and white" [...] regardless of the tint of the hair which might very well appear similar to a gold and white or other colors. The same principle applies to solid blue, silver, and silver and white. Sometimes you might see dark brown pigments near the shoulders and between the armpits.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that sympatric speciation can be driven by sexual selection on male mating traits alone. However, a fundamental problem for this process is the lack of ecological differentiation that would stabilize the coexistence of incipient species through frequency-dependent selection. Such selection can also occur if male aggression is primarily directed towards similar rather than towards dissimilar phenotypes, so that rare male phenotypes would enjoy a negatively frequency-dependent fitness advantage. We experimentally tested such an aggression bias in two recently diverged, ecologically and anatomically similar sympatric cichlid species pairs of the genus Pundamilia from Lake Victoria. Territorial males of a pair of partially reproductively isolated species with red and blue nuptial coloration, respectively, studied in the laboratory were confronted simultaneously with both colour types enclosed in transparent tubes. Red males were more aggressive to red stimuli under white light but not when <b>colour</b> differences were <b>masked</b> under green light. Blue males were equally aggressive to both stimuli in both light conditions. Males of two apparently fully reproductively isolated species, again one with red and one with blue nuptial coloration, studied in the field, both directed more aggressive behaviour towards conspecific than towards heterospecific stimulus males. The differential allocation of aggression would create an advantage for males of the less abundant phenotype or species, thereby potentially supporting stable coexistence of the phenotypes. The finding that this effect was less clear in the partially reproductively isolated species pair than in the fully isolated species pair is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of male {{coloration}} on interspeciÆc female mate choice in two closely related species of haplochromine cichlids from Lake Victoria. The species differ primarily in male coloration. Males of one species are red, {{those of the other}} are blue. We re- corded the behavioral responses of females to males of both species in paired male trials under white light and under monochromatic light, under which the interspecific differences in coloration were masked. Females of both species exhibited species-assortative mate choice when colour differences were visible, but chose non-assortatively when <b>colour</b> differences were <b>masked</b> by light conditions. Neither male behaviour nor overall female response frequencies differed between light treatments. That female preferences could be altered by manipulating the perceived colour pattern implies that the colour itself is used in interspecific mate choice, rather than other characters. Hence, male coloration in haplochromine cichlids does underlie sexual selection by direct mate choice, involving the capacity for individual assessment of potential mates by the female. Females of both species responded more frequently to blue males under monochromatic light. Blue males were larger and displayed more than red males. This implies a hierarchy of choice criteria. Females may use male display rates, size, or both when colour is unavailable. Where available, colour has gained dominance over other criteria. This may explain rapid speciation by sexual selection on male coloration, as proposed in a recent mathematical model...|$|R

40|$|Schlieren {{photography}} {{is a common}} name given to the optical technique of capturing changes in density of transparent media. It is possible that, {{with the aid of}} modern numerical solutions, schlieren techniques are able to produce quantitative results. Modern image processing algorithms and techniques allow for a more complex and comprehensive analysis of the flow phenomenon while still remaining non-intrusive. This dissertation describes the potential of a 2 -dimensional colour schlieren system for producing quantitative data on the density field within the test section of a shock tube. Density gradient components, magnitude and direction, form the basis of the quantitative evaluation. These are encoded onto an imaging plane by means of a <b>colour</b> coded source <b>mask</b> placed along the optical axis of the schlieren system. Direction is indicated by the relative ratios of the 3 primary colours, Red, Green and Blue (RGB). Magnitude is indicated by the relative intensities of the RGB values. Sensitivity of the system is adjusted by an iris diaphragm placed at {{the focal point of the}} second parabolic mirror in the cut-off plane. The schlieren method described is applied to a two-dimensional focusing parabolic model subjected to a shock traveling at between Mach 1. 3 and Mach 1. 4. The experimental results of the schlieren technique are compared to computational simulations with synthetic two-dimensional colour and magnitude coding applied to the results. Image processing methods are used to determine the density gradients within the experimental images and allow comparisons to computational results. The source masks designed and used herein proved to require a greater intensity light source and thus the design of an LED light was developed. A number of existing circuits are used as building blocks and as a comparison tool in the development of the light source. In-house Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been developed with emphasis on 2 -Dimensional solutions. The CFD solutions did not yield colour schlieren data thus a computational script was designed to convert the results into an image format directly comparable to the photographic images obtained by experimentation. Image processing techniques have been employed to deconstruct photographs to allow for quantitative comparisons with a calibration lens. Density gradient direction has been conclusive, however density gradient magnitude is not yet accurately determined due to light source constraints...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tissue counter {{analysis}} {{is an image}} analysis tool designed {{for the detection of}} structures in complex images at the macroscopic or microscopic scale. As a basic principle, small square or circular measuring masks are randomly placed across the image and image analysis parameters are obtained for each mask. Based on learning sets, statistical classification procedures are generated which facilitate an automated classification of new data sets. Objective: To evaluate the influence of {{the size and shape of}} the measuring masks as well as the importance of feature selection, statistical procedures and technical preparation of slides on the performance of tissue counter analysis in microscopic images. As main quality measure of the final classification procedure, the percentage of elements that were correctly classified was used. Study design: H&E‐stained slides of 25 primary cutaneous melanomas were evaluated by tissue counter analysis for the recognition of melanoma elements (section area occupied by tumour cells) in contrast to other tissue elements and background elements. Circular and square measuring masks, various subsets of image analysis features and classification and regression trees compared with linear discriminant analysis as statistical alternatives were used. The percentage of elements that were correctly classified by the various classification procedures was assessed. In order to evaluate the applicability to slides obtained from different laboratories, the best procedure was automatically applied in a test set of another 50 cases of primary melanoma derived from the same laboratory as the learning set and two test sets of 20 cases each derived from two different laboratories, and the measurements of melanoma area in these cases were compared with conventional assessment of vertical tumour thickness. Results: Square measuring masks were slightly superior to circular masks, and larger masks (64 or 128 pixels in diameter) were superior to smaller masks (8 to 32 pixels in diameter). As far as the subsets of image analysis features were concerned, colour features were superior to densitometric and Haralick texture features. Statistical moments of the grey level distribution were of least significance. CART (classification and regression tree) analysis turned out to be superior to linear discriminant analysis. In the best setting, 95 % of melanoma tissue elements were correctly recognized. Automated measurement of melanoma area in the independent test sets yielded a correlation of r= 0. 846 with vertical tumour thickness (p < 0. 001), similar to the relationship reported for manual measurements. The test sets obtained from different laboratories yielded comparable results. Conclusions: Large, square measuring <b>masks,</b> <b>colour</b> features and CART analysis provide a useful setting for the automated measurement of melanoma tissue in tissue counter analysis, which can also be used for slides derived from different laboratories...|$|R
5000|$|The three {{recognised}} colours of Labrador Retrievers {{result from}} differences in two genetic loci that affect pigment expression. The {{first of these}} affects the colour of the dark pigment, eumelanin, and {{is referred to as}} the B (brown) locus. The variation displayed by this locus is observed in many mammals, reflecting a so-called 'dilution', a lightening, of black eumelanin to a brown colour. Initial genetic research excluded a role for the melanocortin 1 receptor and the Agouti locus as being the cause of the black dilution trait in dogs. Instead, TYRP1 (tyrosine related protein 1) was found to be responsible. This enzyme is localised to melanosomes, the cellular organelles that produce and store pigments, and serves to catalyze oxidation of eumelanin precursors. [...] In dogs, three mutations in this gene have been identified, one resulting in a truncation of the protein, the other two leading to an amino acid deletion or a single amino acid substitution in the sequence of the protein. All of these mutations are found across the range of dogs, and hence are thought to have preceded the divergence of distinct breeds, and all three are found within Labrador Retrievers. [...] Each of the mutations appears to eliminate or significantly reduce enzymatic activity, and the colouration phenotypes (the visible traits) produced by the three mutations are indistinguishable. [...] These represent recessive mutations in the TYRP1 gene, and since mammals have two copies of each gene, one from each parent, an animal with at least one copy of the fully functioning TYRP1 protein (represented as 'B') will display the dominant trait, black pigmentation, while to display brown pigmentation, both copies of this gene must be mutant alleles (collectively represented as 'b'). Thus a dog with the genotypes BB or Bb will express black eumelanin, while brown eumelanin will be seen in dogs with the bb genotype.A second gene affects whether these eumelanin pigments will be expressed in the fur or solely in the skin. Called the 'extension' (E) trait, this is directed by the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). This receptor signals the pigment-producing cell in response to melanocortins and results in deposition of eumelanin into the hair. Mutations in this protein have been shown to be involved in pale or red colour phenotypes in a range of species, including humans, horses, pigs, cattle, mice, fur seals, mammoths and the Kermode bear, as well as colouration in whiptail lizards. [...] In most dogs, activity of MC1R is modulated by two signaling molecules, a repressor that is a product of the Agouti gene (A locus), and an activator, β-Defensin 103 (CBD103), recently named the K locus. In Labradors a highly-active mutated version of the K gene, (KB) is invariant, producing uniform eumelanin distribution independent of the Agouti genotype and leaving differences in MC1R to mediate the sole variability of this signaling pathway. [...] A recessive mutation in this E gene that truncates the protein, producing a non-functional receptor incapable of directing eumelanin deposition in the fur. Among dogs, this mutation is unique to yellow Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers and is thought to have arisen in the retriever population before these individual breeds became distinct. The exact mutation has also been found to underlie the colouration of white coyotes found around Newfoundland, having apparently passed into that population through interbreeding with a Golden Retriever. [...] As with the B locus, presence of a single copy of the functional receptor gene ('E') will result in the dominant phenotype: presence of eumelanin in the fur. If both copies of this gene are the recessive mutated variant ('e'), the dog will have no eumelanin in its fur. Such a dog will appear yellow, with eumelanin evident only in the skin of the nose, lips, eye rims and foot pads, of a colour determined by the B locus. A variant of the functional MC1R allele that produces a facial 'mask' in other breeds of dogs (Em) is also present in Labradors, but since the <b>colour</b> of the <b>mask</b> is determined by the B locus, in Labradors the mask this gene produces is indistinguishable from the overall coat colour.|$|R
