40|$|Background: Fundus images contain visual {{information}} that can help an ophthalmologist diagnose several diseases, including glaucoma. The latter can be easily detected by measuring the optic disc cup in fundus images. The optic disc cup {{is defined as a}} C/D ratio, a ratio between the cup diameter and the optic disc diameter. Methods: In this paper we present a system for an automatic optic disc detection and an automatic C/D measurement which facilitates glaucoma diagnosis made by the ophthalmologist. We have used standard computer vision methods and modified some of them to obtain better results. Results and conclusions: Described methods were tested on a set of 39 fundus images.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this study}} we present an {{efficient}} image categorization and retrieval system applied to medical image databases, in particular large radiograph archives. The methodology is based on local patch representation of the image content, using a “bag of visual words ” approach. We explore the effects of various parameters on system performance, and show best results using dense sampling of simple features with spatial content, and a non-linear kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In a recent international competition the system was ranked first in discriminating orientation and body regions in x-ray images. In addition to organ-level discrimination, we show an application to pathology-level categorization of chest x-ray data, the most popular examination in radiology. The system discriminates between healthy and pathological cases, and is also shown to successfully identify specific pathologies {{in a set of}} chest radiographs taken from a routine hospital examination. This is a first step towards similarity-based categorization, which has a major clinical implications for <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> Index Terms—Image categorization, x-ray, chest radiography, visual words, image retrieval, image patches, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), disease labeling.

40|$|In this work, we {{describe}} the extension of Ripley's K-function to allow for overlapping events at very high event densities. We show that problematic edge effects introduce significant bias to the function at very high densities and small radii, and propose a simple correction method that successfully restores the function's centralization. Using simulations of homogeneous Poisson distributions of events, as well as simulations of event clustering under different conditions, we investigate {{various aspects of the}} function, including its shape-dependence and correspondence between true cluster radius and radius at which the K-function is maximized. Furthermore, we validate the utility of the function in quantifying clustering in 2 -D grayscale images using three modalities: (i) Simulations of particle clustering; (ii) Experimental co-expression of soluble and diffuse protein at varying ratios; (iii) Quantifying chromatin clustering in the nuclei of wt and crwn 1 crwn 2 mutant Arabidopsis plant cells, using a previously-published image dataset. Overall, our work shows that Ripley's K-function is a valid abstract statistical measure whose utility extends beyond the quantification of clustering of non-overlapping events. Potential benefits of this work include the quantification of protein and chromatin aggregation in fluorescent microscopic images. Furthermore, this function has the potential to become one of various abstract texture descriptors that are utilized in <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostics</b> in anatomic pathology and diagnostic radiology...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To analyze <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostics</b> {{and virtual}} implant {{planning}} and {{to evaluate the}} indication for template-guided flapless surgery and immediate loading in the rehabilitation of the edentulous maxilla. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with an edentulous maxilla were selected for this study. The three-dimensional analysis and virtual implant planning was performed with the NobelGuide software program (Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden). Prior to the computer tomography aesthetics and functional aspects were checked clinically. Either a well-fitting denture or an optimized prosthetic setup was used and then converted to a radiographic template. This allowed for a computer-guided analysis of the jaw together with the prosthesis. Accordingly, the best implant position was determined {{in relation to the}} bone structure and prospective tooth position. For all jaws, the hypothetical indication for (1) four implants with a bar overdenture and (2) six implants with a simple fixed prosthesis were planned. The planning of the optimized implant position was then analyzed as follows: the number of implants was calculated that could be placed in sufficient quantity of bone. Additional surgical procedures (guided bone regeneration, sinus floor elevation) that would be necessary due the reduced bone quality and quantity were identified. The indication of template-guided, flapless surgery or an immediate loaded protocol was evaluated. RESULTS: Model (a) - bar overdentures: for 28 patients (70 %), all four implants could be placed in sufficient bone (total 112 implants). Thus, a full, flapless procedure could be suggested. For six patients (15 %), sufficient bone was not available for any of their planned implants. The remaining six patients had exhibited a combination of sufficient or insufficient bone. Model (b) - simple fixed prosthesis: for 12 patients (30 %), all six implants could be placed in sufficient bone (total 72 implants). Thus, a full, flapless procedure could be suggested. For seven patients (17 %), sufficient bone was not available for any of their planned implants. The remaining 21 patients had exhibited a combination of sufficient or insufficient bone. DISCUSSION: In the maxilla, advanced atrophy is often observed, and implant placement becomes difficult or impossible. Thus, flapless surgery or an immediate loading protocol can be performed just in a selected number of patients. Nevertheless, the use of a computer program for prosthetically driven implant planning is highly efficient and safe. The three-dimensional view of the maxilla allows the determination of the best implant position, the optimization of the implant axis, and the definition of the best surgical and prosthetic solution for the patient. Thus, a protocol that combines a computer-guided technique with conventional surgical procedures becomes a promising option, which needs to be further evaluated and improved...|$|E

Methods: Two prospective analyses were conducted on fundus images from diabetic patients. Automated detection of microaneurysms and exudates was applied to two small image databases on which these lesions were manually marked. A <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostic</b> system for the detection and grading of DR and the risk of ME was then developed and evaluated, using a large database containing both normal and pathological images, and compared with manual grading. Results: The algorithm for the automated detection of microaneurysms demonstrated a sensitivity of 88. 5 %, with an average number of 2. 13 false positives per image. The pixel-based evaluation of the algorithm for automated detection of exudates had a sensitivity of 92. 8 % and a positive predictive value of 92. 4 %. Combined automated grading of DR and risk of ME was performed on 761 images from a large database. For DR detection, the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were 83. 9 % and 72. 7 %, respectively, and, for detection of the risk of ME, the sensitivity and specificity were 72. 8 % and 70. 8 %, respectively. Conclusion: This study shows that previously published algorithms for computer-aided diagnosis is a reliable alternative to time-consuming manual analysis of fundus photographs when screening for DR.

40|$|Abstract-Today {{ultrasound}} {{and magnetic}} resonance imaging are essential tools for noninvasive medical diagnosis. One of the fundamental problems in this field is speckle noise, which is a major limitation on image quality especially in ultrasound imaging. The presence of the speckle noise affects image interpretation by human and the accuracy of <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostic</b> techniques. Low image quality is an obstacle for effective feature extraction, analysis, recognition and quantitative measurements. Image variances or speckle is a granular noise that inherently exists in and degrades {{the quality of the}} medical images.

Most of speckle reduction techniques have been studied by researchers; however, there is no comprehensive method that takes all the constraints into consideration. Filtering is one of the common methods which is used to reduce the speckle noises. This paper compares five different speckle reduction filters quantitatively using simulated imageries. The results have been presented by filtered images, statistical tables and diagrams. Finally, the best filter has been recommended based on the statistical and experimental results...|$|R

To model the interactions between CT data voxels, we employed a higher-order spatial model, which adds the triple and quad clique families to the traditional pairwise clique family. The kidney shape prior model is built using a set of training CT data and is updated during segmentation using not only region labels but also voxels’ appearances in neighboring spatial voxel locations. Our framework performance has been evaluated on in vivo dynamic CT data collected from 20 subjects and comprises multiple 3 D scans acquired before and after contrast medium administration.

However, there has been no study attempting to simultaneously discriminate among Healthy Controls (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI (cMCI) and stable AD, using features derived from a single modality, namely MRI. New method Based on preprocessed MRI images from the organizers of a neuroimaging challenge, 3 we attempted to quantify the prediction accuracy of multiple morphological MRI features to simultaneously discriminate among HC, MCI, cMCI and AD. We explored the efficacy of a novel scheme that includes multiple feature selections via Random Forest from subsets of the whole set of features (e. g. whole set, left/right hemisphere etc.), Random Forest classification using a fusion approach and ensemble classification via majority voting.

The following introductory comments provide brief historical and clinical perspectives on the primary objective of this research: {{the availability of a}} suite of <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostic</b> markers that clinicians and clinical researchers can use to classify six etiological subtypes of child speech-sound disorders.

The former classificatory term, functional articulation disorder, which reflected poor understanding of the origin of the disorder, was replaced by developmental phonological disorder, which claimed explanatory ties to universal grammar. The theoretical shift from articulation to phonology during the past 25 years has yielded a number of useful descriptive linguistic typologies that have been widely used by clinicians to select and sequence linguistic targets for treatment (cf.

40|$|The term medical {{knowledge}} is a superimposed concept for {{the relationships between}} symptoms and diagnoses a physician may find in books, journals, monographs, but also in practical experience. In {{the second half of}} the 20 th century {{medical knowledge}} was also stored in computer systems. To assist physicians in medical decision-making and attendance medical expert systems have been constructed that use the theory of fuzzy sets, which was founded in 1965 by Lotfi A. Zadeh. The present article delineates two specific pathways resulting from a bifurcation in the history of applied fuzzy expert systems in medicine. This bifurcation occurred in the 1970 s in the history of the theory of fuzzy systems, when Zadeh published the rule of max-min composition and other researchers applied this rule in different areas. This was the origin of two research areas: fuzzy control, initiated by Sedrak Assilian and Ebrahim Mamdani in London, and fuzzy relations, introduced by Elie Sanchez in Marseille. Later on both concepts were used to construct medical knowledge-based systems in medicine.

40|$|The most {{difficult}} part of system maintenance is diagnosing failures. System expertise is needed, but manuals cannot cover all the unique situations and in-house experts are difficult to retain because of today’s budgets. The resulting “expertise gap” has {{led to the development of}} “intelligent” diagnostic aids to compensate for the missing expertise. The first <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostic</b> aids attempted to capture and emulate the reasoning process of experts by encoding heuristics they used for diagnosis. Despite some early successes, capturing expertise is a high-risk process. An alternative approach to system maintenance uses a model of the system as a foundation for its knowledge base. This model-based approach differs from the rule-based approach in the way it incorporates and processes knowledge about the system. A particular type of model, the information flow model, is very useful for diagnosing problems. This approach, however, suffers from a complex model building process that is labor-intensive. Recently, the model building process has been automated by a tool that enables both top-down and bottom-up modeling. As discussed in this paper, this type of tool has the potential to enable widespread usage of the information modeling approach to system maintenance.

All patients were diagnosed through the Internet by a pulmonologist. The Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection method was used to build the decision tree.

It was hypothesized that the accuracy of detection of proximal caries with the unaided eye would be reduced in sub-optimal viewing conditions; furthermore, the use of <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostic</b> software (Logicon Caries Detector) would improve the overall accuracy of observers. Methods: Eighteen radiographs with 214 surfaces were evaluated by 12 observers (general dental practitioners acting as attending faculty from University of Louisville School of Dentistry). Each observer viewed the designated surfaces in each of the viewing conditions, both with and without LCD software. The viewing conditions included: 1) brightly lit room 2) dark room, and 3) brightly lit room with plastic infection control bags on the monitors. The sensitivity and specificity of each evaluator were calculated and compared for each of the conditions using ANOVA at the significance level of p= 0. 05. Results: Sensitivity was significantly worse in the protective barrier condition than in the dark and bright rooms. With sharpening alone, diagnostic ability increased up to 8. 59 %, and LCD increased accuracy up to 17. 22 %. The data for specificity was slightly scattered due to a small sample size of caries-free surfaces. Conclusions: In such conditions when poor lighting and barriers can take away from diagnostic ability, computer assisted software can be a useful tool to help dentists perform as well, or better than in optimal conditions...|$|R
40|$|Objective Multiparametric {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (mp-MRI) combines morphological and functional information and is being increasingly used to detect prostate cancer (PCa). Computer aided detection (CAD) systems {{have the potential to}} support the radiologist by indicating suspicious regions and reducing oversight and perception errors. Our objective is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostic</b> system (Watson Elementary®), in comparison to human readers, in identifying and localizing potentially malignant lesions within the prostate gland, based on the analysis of MR images. We also investigated the relationship between apparent diffusion coefficient (calculated from diffusion-weighted MR images), Malignancy Attention Index (calculated from Watson Elementary®) and Gleason score. Materials and Methods 22 patients with suspected prostate gland malignancy were studied mp-MRI (using T 2 ‐weighted, T 1 ‐weighted dynamic contrast enhanced and diffusion‐weighted sequences). A fully automated analysis tool was used to perform a retrospective analysis on sets of mp-MR images. The resulting malignancy predictions were compared to the original pathologic assessments of a combination of cognitive and fusion targeted biopsies, performed with TRUS/MRI‐fusion based image guided biopsy equipment. The diagnostic performance of the automated malignancy prediction algorithm was then compared to results reported in human reader studies. Results The automated analysis yielded diagnostic accuracies that were comparable to those of human readers. With a sensitivity of 94, 4 % and a specificity of 100 % in detecting Gleason score ≥ 6 PCa, the automated analysis results correspond well within the reported confidence intervals with diagnostic accuracies reported in literature. Conclusions Our preliminary data reveal comparable diagnostic accuracies of an MAI based automated analysis and a PI‐RADS scoring based expert human reader analysis of multiparametric MRI data for the detection of PCa. This study also suggests a possible correlation between MAI maps and ADC values. Further large scale studies are certainly needed to confirm our initial results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Breast cancers that overexpress {{the human}} {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) are eligible for effective biologically targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab. However, accurately determining HER 2 overexpression, especially in immunohistochemically equivocal cases, remains a challenge. Manual analysis of HER 2 expression {{is dependent on the}} assessment of membrane staining as well as comparisons with positive controls. In spite of the strides that have been made to standardize the assessment process, intra- and inter-observer discrepancies in scoring is not uncommon. In this manuscript we describe a pathologist assisted, computer-based continuous scoring approach for increasing the precision and reproducibility of assessing imaged breast tissue specimens. Methods Computer-assisted analysis on HER 2 IHC is compared with manual scoring and fluorescence in situ hybridization results on a test set of 99 digitally imaged breast cancer cases enriched with equivocally scored (2 +) cases. Image features are generated based on the staining profile of the positive control tissue and pixels delineated by a newly developed Membrane Isolation Algorithm. Evaluation of results was performed using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results A computer-aided diagnostic approach has been developed using a membrane isolation algorithm and quantitative use of positive immunostaining controls. By incorporating internal positive controls into feature analysis a greater Area Under the Curve (AUC) in ROC analysis was achieved than feature analysis without positive controls. Evaluation of HER 2 immunostaining that utilized membrane pixels, controls, and percent area stained showed significantly greater AUC than manual scoring, and significantly less false positive rate when used to evaluate immunohistochemically equivocal cases. Conclusion It has been shown that by incorporating both a membrane isolation algorithm and analysis of known positive controls a <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>diagnostic</b> algorithm was developed that can reproducibly score HER 2 status in IHC stained clinical breast cancer specimens. For equivocal scoring cases, this approach performed better than standard manual evaluation as assessed by ROC analysis in our test samples. Finally, there exists potential for utilizing image-analysis techniques for improving HER 2 scoring at the immunohistochemically equivocal range. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One {{out of four}} dogs {{will develop}} cancer in their {{lifetime}} and 20 % of those will be lymphoma cases. PetScreen developed a lymphoma blood test using serum samples collected from several veterinary practices. The samples were fractionated and analysed by mass spectrometry. Two protein peaks, with the highest diagnostic power, were selected and further identified as acute phase proteins, C-Reactive Protein and Haptoglobin. Data mining methods were then applied to the collected data {{for the development of}} an online <b>computer-assisted</b> veterinary <b>diagnostic</b> tool. The generated software {{can be used as a}} diagnostic, monitoring and screening tool. Initially, the diagnosis of lymphoma was formulated as a classification problem and then later refined as a lymphoma risk estimation. Three methods, decision trees, kNN and probability density evaluation, were used for classification and risk estimation and several pre-processing approaches were implemented to create the diagnostic system. For the differential diagnosis the best solution gave a sensitivity and specificity of 83. 5 % and 77 %, respectively (using three input features, CRP, Haptoglobin and standard clinical symptom). For the screening task, the decision tree method provided the best result, with sensitivity and specificity of 81. 4 % and> 99 %, respectively (using the same input features). Furthermore, the development and application of new techniques for the generation of risk maps allowed their user-friendly visualization. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background. As {{part of a}} {{longitudinal}} study, prevalence findings of DSM-IV disorders are presented for {{a random sample of}} 3021 respondents aged 14 to 24, with response rate 71 %. Method. Assessment included various subtypes of disorders, subthreshold conditions and disorders that have only rarely been studied in other epidemiological surveys. The <b>computer-assisted</b> Munich-Composite International <b>Diagnostic</b> Interview (M-CIDI) was used to derive DSM-IV diagnoses. Results. Substance disorders were the most frequent (lifetime 17 · 7 %; 12 -month 11 · 4 %), with abuse being considerably more frequent than dependence. Other mental disorders had a lifetime prevalence of 27 · 5 % (12 -month, 17 · 5 %) with depressive disorders (16 · 8 %) being more frequent than anxiety disorders (14 · 4 %). Eating disorders (3 · 0 %) and threshold somatoform disorders (1 · 2 %) were rare disorders. Subthreshold anxiety and somatoform disorders, however, were more frequent than threshold disorders. Prevalence of disorders was equally high for males and females, although specific disorder prevalence varied significantly by gender. The co-occurrence of disorders (co-morbidity) was substantial and was significantly related to greater reductions in work productivity and increased rates of professional helpseeking behaviour. Conclusions. Findings underline that mental disorders in young adults are frequent and impairing, limiting work and education ability and social interaction. Given the fact that adolescents and young adults are in a key phase of socialization in terms of professional career and interpersonal relationships, our findings indicate a considerable risk potential for an accumulation of complicating factors and future chronicity. This paper is the first report of this ongoing longitudinal study about early developmental conditions of mental disorders...|$|R
