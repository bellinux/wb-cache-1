5000|$|WKT can {{describe}} <b>coordinate</b> <b>reference</b> <b>systems.</b> This WKT format was initially {{defined by the}} Open Geospatial Consortium in 1999, then extended in 2001.

Later, evolution of the Coordinate Reference System conceptual model, new requirements and inconsistencies in implementation of WKT 1 format between different software have encouraged the revision of that format. The updated [...] "Well-known text representation of coordinate reference systems" [...] standard, sometime known as [...] "WKT 2", {{was adopted by the}} Open Geospatial Consortium in 2015.

5000|$|A {{software}} capable to read <b>coordinate</b> <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> in WKT 2 format {{can also}} read many (but not all) equivalent systems in WKT 1 format. Some caveats exist, notably {{the removal of}} the [...] element [...] which is replaced by the [...] element. Another caveat is about the units of measurement. Some of them were unspecified in oldest WKT 1 specifications (for example the [...] unit), which has led to different interpretations by different software. Those units of measurement have been clarified in the 2001 update and the WKT 2 specification is consistent with that clarification. But not all software have followed the 2001 clarification.|$|E

50|$|KML, made popular by Google, {{complements}} GML. Whereas GML is {{a language}} to encode geographic content for any application, by describing {{a spectrum of}} application objects and their properties (e.g. bridges, roads, buoys, vehicles etc.), KML is a language for the visualization of geographic information tailored for Google Earth. KML {{can be used to}} render GML content, and GML content can be “styled” using KML for the purposes of presentation. KML is first and foremost a 3D portrayal transport, not a data exchange transport. As a result of this significant difference in purpose, encoding GML content for portrayal using KML results in significant and unrecoverable loss of structure and identity in the resulting KML. Over 90% of GML's structures (such as, to name a few, metadata, <b>coordinate</b> <b>reference</b> <b>systems,</b> horizontal and vertical datums, geometric integrity of circles, ellipses, arcs, etc.) cannot be transformed to KML without loss or non-standard encoding. Similarly, due to KML's design as a portrayal transport, encoding KML content in GML will result in significant loss of KML portrayal structures such as regions, level of detail rules, viewing and animation information, as well as styling information and multiscale representation. The ability to portray placemarks at multiple levels of details distinguishes KML from GML, since portrayal is outside the scope of GML.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Coordinate transformations {{refer to}} {{mathematical}} processing that enables overlay of maps that use different <b>coordinate</b> <b>reference</b> <b>systems,</b> that is, map projections. The conversion from geographical to plane coordinates is the normal practice in cartography, {{which is called}} forward transformation. The inverse transformation, which yields geographical coordinates from map coordinates, is a more recent development, due {{to the need for}} transformation between different map projections especially in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). For the projections that have complex functions for forward transformation defining the invers projection is not easy. This paper describes a general iteration algorithm to derive the inverse equations of map projections using Jacobian matrices. The algorithm is applied to three cartographic projections, namely Aitoff-Hammer, Winkel-Tripel and Mollweide, which are commonly used for world maps...|$|E
