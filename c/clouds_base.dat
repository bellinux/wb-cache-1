40|$|There {{has been}} a shift in {{research}} towards the convergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud com- puting paradigm, highly motivated by the need for IoT applications to leverage the unique characteristics of the cloud. IoT acts as an enabler to interconnect intelligent and self-configurable nodes (things) to establish an efficient and dynamic platform for communication and collaboration. It is becoming {{a major source of}} big data, contributing huge amounts of streamed information from a large number of interconnected nodes, which have to be stored, processed, and presented in an efficient, and easy interpretable form. Cloud com- puting can enable IoT to have the privilege of a virtual resources utilization infrastructure, which integrates storage devices, visualization platforms, resource monitoring, analytical tools, and client delivery. Given the number of things connected and the amount of data generated, a key challenge is the energy efficient compo- sition and interoperability of heterogeneous things integrated with cloud resources and scattered across the globe, in order to create an on-demand energy efficient cloud based IoT application. In many cases, when a single service is not enough to complete the business requirement; composition of web services is carried out. These composed web services are expected to collaborate towards a common goal with large amount of data exchange and various other operations. Massive data sets have to be exchanged between several geographically distributed and scattered services. The movement of mass data between services influences the whole application process in terms of energy consumption. One way to significantly reduce this massive data exchange is to choose fewer services for a composition, which has to be created to complete a business requirement. By integrating fewer services means reduction in data interchange, which in return helps in reducing the carbon footprint. This paper develops a novel multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm called (E 2 C 2) that aims at creating an energy-aware composition plan by searching for and integrating the least possible number of IoT services, in order to fulfil user requirements. A formal user requirements translation and transformation modelling and analysis is adopted for the proposed algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated against four established service composition algorithms in multiple cloud environments (All <b>clouds,</b> <b>Base</b> cloud, Smart cloud, and COM 2), with the results demonstrating the performance of our approach...|$|E

40|$|Stratiform clouds acquire {{charge at}} their {{upper and lower}} {{horizontal}} boundaries due to vertical current flow in the global electric circuit. Cloud charge is expected to influence microphysical processes, but understanding is restricted by the infrequent in situ measurements available. For stratiform <b>cloud</b> <b>bases</b> below 1 km in altitude, the <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> charge modifies the surface electric field beneath, allowing a new method of remote determination. Combining continuous cloud height data during 2015 – 2016 from a laser ceilometer with electric field mill data, <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> charge is derived using a horizontal charged disk model. The median daily <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> charge density found was 0. 86 nC m 2 from 43 days’ data. This {{is consistent with a}} uniformly charged region ~ 40 m thick at the <b>cloud</b> <b>base,</b> now confirming that negative <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> charge is a common feature of terrestrial layer clouds. This technique can also be applied to planetary atmospheres and volcanic plumes...|$|R
30|$|The KH billow train {{observed}} {{inside the}} mid-level cloud but {{just above the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> {{was associated with a}} MCT layer immediately below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> In fact, the upper edge of the MCT was deeply indented due to the billows above. During another ShUREX campaign in 2016, we observed a very similar event under very similar conditions, with occurrence again of a train of high-amplitude KH billows just above a mid-level <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> and a MCT layer underneath the <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> These were the only two instances during the three ShUREX campaigns (2015, 2016 and 2017) spanning over a total of 9  weeks, when we observed such spectacular, high-amplitude billows inside the mid-level cloud. In both cases, there was a MCT immediately below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> We do not know if the simultaneous presence of KH billows inside the cloud and MCT below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> in these two instances is a mere happenstance. If it is not, then the dynamical mechanism responsible for simultaneous occurrence of shear instability above and convective instability below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> needs to be explored. It is worth noting that MCT arises due to rapid sublimation in the dry air layer below the <b>cloud</b> <b>base,</b> of ice particles falling down from the cloud into the dry layer. These particles might have originated from condensation of ice nuclei inside the cloud immediately above the <b>cloud</b> <b>base.</b> Are the two events dynamically related? If so, how? We do not know the answer to these questions.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} current {{situation}} of adoption of <b>Cloud</b> <b>based</b> services by Indian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). <b>Cloud</b> <b>based</b> services are a set of services that provide software, infrastructure and a platform for internet media and storage using a third party server. <b>Cloud</b> <b>based</b> services provides many benefits as it saves costs associated with investing in hardware and software, provides anytime accessibility, is flexible, and provides scalability.

40|$|Despite of the {{promising}} benefits of cloud computing in enabling efficient, sustainable and agile Supply Chain Collaborations (SCCs), this service does not eliminate governance challenges in SCCs. <b>Cloud</b> <b>based</b> SCCs may flounder without {{a proper understanding}} of how to govern inter-organizational relations and insight into how the cloud service will affect it.

40|$|The {{degree to}} which cloud {{immersion}} provides water in addition to rainfall, suppresses transpiration, and sustains tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) during rainless periods is not well understood. Climate and land use changes represent a threat to these forests if <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> altitude rises {{as a result of}} regional warming or deforestation. To establish a baseline for quantifying future changes in <b>cloud</b> <b>base,</b> we installed a ceilometer at 100  m altitude in the forest upwind of the TMCF that occupies an altitude range from ∼[*] 600  m to the peaks at 1100  m in the Luquillo Mountains of eastern Puerto Rico. Airport Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) ceilometer data, radiosonde data, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite data were obtained to investigate seasonal <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> dynamics, altitude of the trade-wind inversion (TWI), and typical cloud thickness for the surrounding Caribbean region. <b>Cloud</b> <b>base</b> is rarely quantified near mountains, so these results represent a first look at seasonal and diurnal <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> dynamics for the TMCF. From May  2013 to August  2016, <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> was lowest during the midsummer dry season, and <b>cloud</b> <b>bases</b> were lower than the mountaintops as often in the winter dry season as in the wet seasons. The lowest <b>cloud</b> <b>bases</b> most frequently occurred at higher elevation than 600  m, from 740 to 964  m. The Luquillo forest low <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> altitudes were higher than six other sites in the Caribbean by ∼[*] 200 – 600  m, highlighting the importance of site selection to measure topographic influence on cloud height. Proximity to the oceanic cloud system where shallow cumulus clouds are seasonally invariant in altitude and cover, along with local trade-wind orographic lifting and cloud formation, may explain the dry season low clouds. The results indicate that climate change threats to low-elevation TMCFs are not limited to the dry season; changes in synoptic-scale weather patterns that increase frequency of drought periods during the wet seasons (periods of higher <b>cloud</b> <b>base)</b> may also impact ecosystem health...|$|R

Charging at horizontal layer cloud edges has been observed {{to be consistent with}} global circuit vertical current flow through the cloud, which can modify the properties of small and pure water droplets. Studies have been hampered by the absence of cloud edge observations, hence <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height information is investigated here. <b>Cloud</b> <b>base</b> height measured at the Lerwick Observatory, Shetland, UK, is analysed using threshold tests and spectral analysis. The <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height distributions for low <b>cloud</b> (<b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> less than 800 [*]m) are found to vary with cosmic ray conditions. Further, 27 day and 1. 68 year periodicities characteristic of cosmic ray variations are present, weakly, in the <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height data of stratiform clouds, when such periodicities are present in neutron monitor cosmic ray data. These features support the idea of propagation of heliospheric variability into layer clouds, through the global atmospheric electric circuit...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis study {{focuses on the}} evaluation of <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height {{from a pair of}} space-based remote sensing systems. The first satellite, CloudSat, is a 94 -GHz cloud profiling radar (CPR) utilizing a wavelength capable of penetrating thick hydrometeor layers. The second satellite, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite, is an active lidar designed to detect optically thin hydrometeor layers. The 2 BGEOPROF- Lidar product combines data from these two synergistic observing platforms to provide a complete profile of the vertical structure of clouds in the atmosphere. For this research, 2 B-GEOPROF-Lidar <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height measurements were validated against <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height measurements from a combined suite of ground-based sensors at four Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. <b>Cloud</b> <b>base</b> height measurements validated within 480 meters, the vertical resolution of the CPR, were deemed accurate assessments. Differences in <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> height exceeding 720 meters were labeled as significant outliers. Significant outliers were further investigated to find trends in radar reflectivity and cloud mask data from CloudSat and total attenuated backscatter from CALIPSO. The combined CloudSat / CALIPSO <b>cloud</b> <b>base</b> assessment proved accurate in 73 % of the cases studied. US Air Force (USAF) author...|$|R
