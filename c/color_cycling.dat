50|$|On {{the first}} day of the 1982 Tour de France, Italian cyclist JuJu Peppi (Orlando Bloom) accidentally causes a pileup after {{attempting}} to grope a female spectator, which causes a massive brawl to break out between all the other cyclists, postponing the race until further notice. Police find evidence of narcotics being used by the cyclists and it is revealed that UCI president Ditmer Klerken (Kevin Bacon) accepted bribes of $50,000 each from a majority of the competitors to forego preliminary drug testing. Although all the cyclists are suspected of doping, the UCI allows the Tour to continue with the five competitors who didn't pay off Klerken: Peppi, American-born Nigerian cyclist Marty Hass (Andy Samberg), who is resented by Nigeria for being the one to represent the country, French cyclist Adrian Baton (Freddie Highmore), who is secretly a woman named Adrianna Baton disguised as a man so she can compete, African-American cyclist Slim Robinson (Daveed Diggs), nephew of Jackie Robinson who wants to break the <b>color</b> barrier in <b>cycling</b> like Jackie did in baseball, and Austrian cyclist Gustav Ditters (John Cena), who had gained a considerable amount of muscle mass from the previous year due to steroids.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Current Thermal cycling units fail to {{simulate}} the drinking behaviors, and oral balancing temperature. They cannot also simulate other oral conditions such as drink coloring, and chemicals like tea, coffee, carbonated and noncarbonated, citrus juices as well as alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks and also saliva and milk itself.  The main objective {{of this study is}} to introduce the designing and manufacturing the first Drinking Simulator Unit (DSU) that reproduces the thermal, color and chemicalcycling as well as the drinking behavior and oral temperature in lab conditions uniquely. Methods: The invented system generally has two parts: the hardware and the software parts. The hardware consists of the mechanical and electronic parts. The software part is responsible for controlling the heating and cooling systems, electric valves, the pumps, and automatic filling systems of tanks as well as the sensors of the machine. Results: DSU is the first unit can reproduce the thermal, <b>color</b> and chemical <b>cycling</b> as well as the drinking behavior and oral temperature in lab conditions. Different kinds of colored and acidic drinks and also other chemical materials such as bleaching substances as well as detergents and antiseptics used for dentistry, industrial and medical purposes can be tested by DSU. DSU has also to be considered as an appliance performing in-vitro researches on dental structures. Conclusion: The invented system can greatly improve and validate the results of such researches. ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the show}} begins {{there is a}} 10-minute {{thunderstorm}} pre-roll. when the show begins there is a mysterious music swell that leads into show and following the music swell the lights on International Street turn off and the show is ready to begin. The music begins and the fountain's shoots {{into the air and}} dances with the music. the mountain is being constantly struck with lightning and lava is being spilled out all over thee mountain. as the scene ends the fountains shoot up and they are all red. in the following scene the fountains are flashing with the mountain and the song playing, the fountains twirl and dance to the song and the mountain plays its supporting role as the backdrop in this sequence. the fountain continues to twirl, swirl and dance to the music with vibrant green and blue colored lights and the beam lighting is a UV color pointing at the water fountain and surrounding area. The scene ends and the lighting fades out. The next scene follows with the mountain with streamers draping down from all of the waterfall points and starting the sequence the fountain shoots up in sections this time from the bridge to the front and then all of the beam lights come on in a stunning pattern and move everywhere creating a stunning aura effect and the water fountains continue to follow the music and move around until the scene ends. in the following scene the fountain flashes in an array of colors matching to the mountain. the lights flash a lot of colors and the scene continues with all of the beam lights to come on flashing colors rapidly and moving around the fountain and the surrounding area. The music continues and then the fountain becomes a bot slower creating a rotating spire effect and the lighting is all green and moving around like searchlights. then the scene continues flashing colors rapidly and the fountain lighting also flashes colors rapidly creating a flashing rainbow effect. the scene fade's out and the lights dim off into the next scene. thee mountain looks like a giant rock with two sides that move up/down and then the fountain shoots up with red & blue lighting effects and all of the spectacular tree lights come on and the fountain dances with the beat and the scene continues. as the fountains continue to dance the mountain looks like cosmic goop sliding down from the top and then leaking into the fountains created with lighting effects within the fountain. then the scene ends and the final song comes on. the mountain is as specially a supporting role in this scene with the mountain changing with the lyrics of the song like [...] "Tree's Of Green" [...] "Red Roses too" [...] "I See Them Bloom For Me And You" [...] and the song goes on the fountains slowly move upwards in a crossing pattern with yellow lighting effects as well as a rainbow effect when the song says [...] "The Color's Of The Rainbow So Deeply In The Sky" [...] and the fountain & mountain Become A Stunning Rainbow Pattern and the song continues {{after the end of the}} song the mountain projects the [...] "Canada's Wonderland" [...] logo with twinkling sparkles and then says Goodnight to the audience then the show progresses into Post Show where the fountain and mountain are general the same with <b>cycling</b> <b>colors</b> and limited show sequences and the show finally comes to an end.|$|R
5000|$|The fractal {{software}} Fractint also incorporates an algorithm {{known as}} [...] "plasma", which, {{when combined with}} the <b>color</b> <b>cycling</b> feature of the software, can provide a result which resembles a typical plasma effect used in demos. The technical basis, however, is completely different, and a <b>color</b> <b>cycling</b> plasma is somewhat less dynamic than a demo plasma.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{adventure}} games used <b>color</b> <b>cycling</b> {{to simulate}} moving water, lava and similar effects.|$|E
50|$|The GUI is {{customizable}} with a dockable MDI. The software calculates {{statistics about}} the fractal {{that is being}} previewed. Other features include fullscreen mode, <b>color</b> <b>cycling,</b> a render queue, distributed rendering calculations and a detailed help file. Version 4 added support for animations and improved flame fractal rendering.|$|E
5000|$|SimCity 2000 made {{extensive}} use of this technique: every building with animation had its animation provided by <b>color</b> <b>cycling.</b> This was used to provide effects such as blinking lights, cars moving on roads, and even four frames of animation displaying on a tiny movie screen in a drive-in theater.|$|E
50|$|<b>Color</b> <b>cycling,</b> {{also known}} as palette shifting, is a {{technique}} used in computer graphics in which colors are changed {{in order to give}} the impression of animation. This technique was mainly used in early computer games, as storing one image and changing its palette required less memory and processor power than storing the animation as several frames.|$|E
50|$|NEOchrome is {{an early}} color bitmap {{graphics}} editor for the Atari ST computer family. It was written by Dave Staugas, a programmer at Atari {{and co-author of the}} ST's operating system. NEOchrome allows hardware-supported <b>color</b> <b>cycling</b> to give the impression of animation. A color-cycling waterfall, created with NEOchrome, was one of the iconic images of the early Atari ST.|$|E
50|$|All the {{versions}} of the program are designed for drawing in indexed color mode, up to 256 colors. A palette editor allows very precise operations on the image and its palette. These functions are precious for console or mobile game graphics where some specific color indices in the palette are required for special effects : Palette swap, <b>Color</b> <b>cycling,</b> transparent color for sprites.|$|E
50|$|The Amiga {{natively}} supports indexed color, where a pixel's {{color value}} does not carry any RGB hue information but instead is an index to a colour palette (a collection of unique color values). By adjusting the color {{value in the}} palette, all pixels with that palette value change simultaneously in the image or animation. Creative artists could use this in their animation by using <b>color</b> <b>cycling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scrolling {{displays}} {{built up}} of individual tiles {{can be made}} to 'float' over a repeating background layer by animating the individual tiles' bitmaps in order to portray the parallax effect. <b>Color</b> <b>cycling</b> can be used to animate tiles quickly on the whole screen. This software effect gives the illusion of another (hardware) layer. Many games used this technique for a scrolling star-field, but sometimes a more intricate or multi-directional effect is achieved, such as in the game Parallax by Sensible Software.|$|E
50|$|Animator {{gave the}} ability to do frame-by-frame {{animation}} (creating each frame as an individual picture, much like traditional cel animation). Animator Studio also had tweening features (transforming one shape into another by letting the computer draw each in-between shape onto a separate frame). Animator and Animator Pro supported FLI and FLC animation file formats, while Animator Studio also supported the AVI format. Animator was particular strong in Palette based editing, effects (like <b>Color</b> <b>cycling)</b> and animations a favoured technology in the time of indexed CGA and VGA graphics modes.|$|E

50|$|By {{manipulating}} the color hardware registers (Color look-up table or CLUT) {{of the display}} adapter in the indexed color graphic modes, full-screen color-animation effects can be achieved without redrawing the image - that is, at low CPU time cost; a single change of the register values affects the whole screen at once. Color-map animation, also known as <b>Color</b> <b>cycling,</b> is extensively used in the demoscene. The Microsoft Windows boot logo screen in Windows 95, 98, ME, and 2000 Professional (which uses VGA 320x200x256 color display mode {{because it is the}} greatest common denominator on all PCs) employs this technique for the scrolling gradient bar across the bottom of the screen; the picture is a static image with no pixels rewritten after it is initially displayed. Custom boot screen images could tap the cycled colors to animate other parts of the images.|$|E
5000|$|These were {{followed}} by the SCPH-700x and SCPH-750x series, released in May 1998—they are externally identical to the SCPH-500x machines, but have internal changes made to reduce manufacturing costs (for example, the system RAM went from 4 chips to 1, and the CD controller went from 3 chips to 1) and these were the last models to support parallel port for Gameshark devices. In addition, a slight change of the start-up screen was made; the diamond is seen as longer and thinner and the trademark symbol (™) is now placed after [...] "Computer Entertainment" [...] instead of after the diamond, as {{it was on the}} earlier models. New to the SCPH-700x series was the introduction of the [...] "Sound Scope" [...] - light show music visualizations. These were accessible by pressing the Select button while playing any normal audio CD in the system's CD player. While watching these visualizations, players could also add various effects like <b>color</b> <b>cycling</b> or motion blur and can save/load their memory card. These were seen on the SCPH-700x, 750x, 900x, and PS one models.|$|E
5000|$|The latest {{revival of}} {{interest}} began in 1977, with {{a revival of}} floodlighting. Color {{has been a major}} preoccupation, with computerized sequences used and, increasingly, large LED screens. The upper stories of the Empire State Building were floodlighted from 1964 to 1973; on October 12, 1977, using a new lighting installation by Douglas Leigh, they were lighted in blue and white to celebrate the Yankees' World Series win, and since then the building has been lighted in different colors to celebrate a variety of holidays and other special occasions, despite the objections of Paul Goldberger that the colors [...] "turn it into a toy". I. M. Pei and Harold Fredenburgh's Bank of America Tower in Miami, completed in 1987, also changes colors on holidays. Modern computerized lighting can respond to external conditions, as in Toyo Ito's 1986 Tower of Winds in Yokohama, or execute other complex tasks, as in the installation on the facade of the Forty-Second Street Studios in New York, where the <b>color</b> <b>cycling</b> speeds up throughout the week from slow changes on Mondays to changes every few seconds on weekend nights.|$|E
5000|$|One {{feature of}} most escape time fractal {{programs}} or algebraic-based fractals is a maximum iteration setting. Increasing the iteration count is required if {{the image is}} magnified so that fine detail is not lost. Limiting the maximum iterations is important when a device's processing power is low. Coloring options often allow colors to be randomised. Options for color density are common because some gradients output hugely variable magnitudes resulting in heavy repetitive banding or {{large areas of the}} same color. Because of the convenient ability to add post-processing effects layering and alpha compositing features found in other graphics software have been included. Both 2D and 3D rendering effects such as plasma effect and lighting may be included. Many packages also allow the user to input their own formula, to allow for greater control of the fractals, as well as a choice of color rendering, along with the use of filters and other image manipulation techniques. Some fractal software packages allow for the creation of movies from a sequence of fractal images. Others display render time and allow some form of <b>color</b> <b>cycling</b> and color palette creation tools.Standard graphics software (such as GIMP) contains filters or plug-ins which can be used for fractal generation. Blender contains a fractal (or random) modifier. Many stand-alone fractal-generating programs can be used in conjunction with other graphics programs (such as Photoshop) to create more complex images. POV-Ray is a ray tracing program which generates images from a text-based scene description that can generate fractals. Scripts on 3ds Max and Autodesk Maya can be used. A number of web-based interfaces for the fractal generation are freely available including Turtle Graphics Renderer. Fractal Lab can generate both 2D and 3D fractals and is available over the web using WebGL. JWildfire is a java-based, open-source fractal flame generator. [...] Mandelbrot Fractal is a fractal explorer written in Javascript. [...] Fractal Grower is software written in Java for generating Lindenmayer Substitution Fractals (L-systems).|$|E

40|$|Immigrants now {{comprise}} the largest {{share of the}} population of the United States since 1850, with continued increases projected into the foreseeable future. Most foreign-born residents come from Latin America and other developing countries. Nationwide, they tend to travel by cheaper and more sustainable modes of transportation upon arrival, gradually adopting American habits of driving over time. A challenge for planners concerned with reducing the impact of automobile travel and providing an equitable transportation system is to understand and capitalize on the motivations for immigrant travel that would allow them to meet their travel needs without relying on cars. In this mixed-methods dissertation, I investigate three questions about the nature of how immigrants travel in the San Francisco Bay Area, a fairly transit- and bicycle-friendly metropolitan region, with these sustainability and equity questions in mind: 1. How do travel patterns differ between low-income immigrants and other population subgroups? 2. What influences cycling among immigrants and non-immigrants? More specifically, to what extent do individual factors, the social environment, and the built environment predict bicycling, and how do their effects differ between immigrants and non-immigrants? 3. What factors contribute to the cycling experience for low-income Latino immigrants? First, how do travel patterns differ between low-income immigrants and other population subgroups? I use a custom-designed intercept survey to describe the frequency of travel by each mode of transportation, in addition to individual perceptions and personal experiences related to public transit and bicycling. I find fairly small but statistically significant differences in mode use between immigrants and non-immigrants: immigrants travel up to a day per week less frequently than non-immigrants by each mode of transportation except walking. When controlling for socioeconomic and certain built environment characteristics, many differences between immigrants and non-immigrants diminish. Most significantly, however, Latin American immigrants substantially reduce their transit use as incomes rise, while Latina women of all income groups very rarely ride a bicycle. Certain perceptions and attitudes about transportation also differ significantly among nativity groups. Low-income immigrants are least likely to perceive bicycling as an option to meet their travel needs. They are also less likely to take transit or ride a bicycle when they have an option to drive. Second, to what extent do individual factors, the social environment, and the built environment predict bicycling, and do their effects differ between immigrants and non-immigrants? This question uses the dissertation conceptual framework to test how each of those three factors influence one another, and how they affect cycling. Relying on a subset of the same survey results as in the previous chapter, I use a set of structural equations models to estimate the likelihood of bicycling based on socioeconomic characteristics, including nativity, perceptions and attitudes, social networks, and urban form, accounting for the endogeneity of these influences. I find many similarities in what influences cycling among immigrants and non-immigrants. Unexpectedly, once perceptions and social factors are accounted for, objective measures of the built environment matter little in predicting bicycling. However, cycling is associated with positive perceptions of how the built environment supports cycling. Bicycling itself influences both perceptions of the difficulty of cycling and cycling social networks. Findings suggest two keys to supporting cycling: addressing how people view neighborhood safety and how well infrastructure meets cyclists' needs. Third, what factors contribute to the cycling experience for low-income Latino immigrants? Interviews with about two dozen Latino immigrants reveal that a number of factors beyond cost, safety, and urban form encourage people to bicycle. People described cycling emotionally, empowering in the face of life obstacles. New immigrants can use bicycling as a means to learn their way around a new city, though some find it difficult to navigate when directions and information are not readily available in their native languages. But more than anything, benefits of bicycling were tied to certain social values that many interviewees held, such as a desire to protect future generations by traveling more sustainably. Some have the perception that bicycle planning has been fundamentally unfair to their community and other communities of <b>color.</b> <b>Cycling</b> investments that tie into social networks present in immigrant neighborhoods may motivate others to establish a bicycling habit. Each chapter of this dissertation contributes to a different component of the literature on immigrants and travel. As a whole, the dissertation leads readers from a discrete choice view of travel behavior to one influenced by psychology and social and cultural elements of human environments. I argue that planning for sustainability and equity in transportation requires adoption of measures that address the soft influences on travel. While investing in infrastructure is important, it is not enough: increasing neighborhood and traffic safety and improving perceptions of transit and cycling relative to driving will help facilitate immigrant travel...|$|E
