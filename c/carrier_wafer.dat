40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of wafer bow of Si <b>carrier</b> <b>wafer</b> to achieve high-yield BCB cap {{transfer}} in wafer-scale packaging. BCB caps are built-up on Si <b>carrier</b> <b>wafer</b> and then they are bonded and transferred to a target wafer. The height of BCB cap is 25 lm and the thickness of Si <b>carrier</b> <b>wafer</b> is 380 lm. Through several experiments, {{it is found that}} BCB cap transfer rate is mainly dependent on wafer bow of Si <b>carrier</b> <b>wafer</b> rather than that of the target wafer due to relatively large thickness of BCB caps. Therefore, Si <b>carrier</b> <b>wafer</b> bow with the BCB layers is investigated as a function of temperature. It is to figure out the effect of the wafer bow at certain temperature and applying pressure on BCB cap transfer rate. Through the study, it is found that zero wafer bow is very important for the cap transfer. Hence, aluminum metal layer is introduced to compensate the existing wafer bow of the Si <b>carrier</b> <b>wafer...</b>|$|E

An adhesive bonding and laser assisted de-bonding technology which is a proven platform for TSV wafer processing is introduced to be a versatile basis for these different kinds of handling scenarios. By adapting this base technology, single devices can be temporary fixed at <b>carrier</b> <b>wafers,</b> subsequently processed in parallel and finally release from the <b>carrier</b> <b>wafers.</b> Furthermore, processes for thin IC wafers {{can be adapted to}} end up with singulated thin ICs equipped with temporary bonded carrier dice on their backside which act as mechanical support during a standard pick&place and reflow process scheme.

The electrical performance and characterization of the TSVs is also discussed. The interposers are created at 200 mm or 300 mm silicon wafers. The fabrication processes include deep reactive ion etching, TSV side wall isolation, PVD seed layer deposition, TSV filling by copper electroplating, wafer front side redistribution, temporary wafer bonding, wafer thinning by mechanical grinding, CMP, silicon dry etching, PECVD, silicon oxide dry etching and wafer backside redistribution. Depending on the final device application, after backside processing a component assembly is done directly at the interposer backside. In other cases, the interposer wafers are either released from the <b>carrier</b> <b>wafers</b> or transfer bonded so that their front side can be accessed again and the component assembly can be done. Finally, the assembled interposers can be release from their <b>carrier</b> <b>wafers</b> and singulated or run into further processes like molding or hermetic sealing by wafer to wafer bonding using suitable capwafers. In the following sections, important technological aspects of interposer fabrication and assembly as well as results from electrical characterizations will be presented.
