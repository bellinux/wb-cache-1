We use household production theory {{to build a}} model of forest products collected on Siberut {{as a function of}} labour, tools, forest condition and household classes. Five forest products—rattan, sago, and wood for con-struction, carpentry and fuel—are combined into a <b>composite</b> <b>forest</b> product using market prices as weights. Four classes of households are identified through cluster analysis of assets, including land, livestock, productive equipment and consumer durables. The parameters of the estimated forest production functions are consistent with underlying theory and statistically significant. Labour allocated to forest product collection has the greatest overall influence. In turn, labour allocation is significantly influenced by household composition and socio-economic factors. We also find that forest quality is negatively correlated with forest product col-lection. All things considered, the wealthiest households collect the least amoun...|$|E

The analysed forest soil samples were collected {{in the spring and}} summer seasons of 2011. Before sampling, a grid of the area covering 10 × 10 km including all biggest forest areas of the territory was made. In total, 42 <b>composite</b> <b>forest</b> soil samples were examined. The conducted analysis measured soil moisture, pH and the content of total organic carbon. The assessment of these parameters and performed statistical analysis has disclosed that the content of total organic carbon positively and significantly correlates with pH and the content of soil moisture. Additionally, it has been determined that the content of total organic carbon tends to increase when pH of soil is close to neutral and a total value of soil moisture does not reach 0, 61 %</span...|$|E
40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{a six-month}} {{participatory}} tool and a rapid assessment survey this ethnobiological research study produced valuable results covering forest valuation methodology, tropical forest resource use, and conservation priorities for the Cordillera Azul National Park and surrounding communities in the northern Peruvian Amazon. The research aimed to quantify changes in forest use value over a successional continuum from fallow fields to old secondary forests. Suggestions for methodological improvements and future research focus on improved measurements of collection area sizes, the collection of data on all plant types, especially timber species, epiphytes, and herbaceous plants, and the inclusion of animal taxa. This study found only a limited use for a rapid survey approach to forest valuation, but suggested investigations on the potential of a two-stage rapid method. In terms of general resource use, the study found an impressive heterogeneity of use values at inter- and intracommunity levels, between different taxa, and among the three forest types studied. The median values of all secondary forests on private land holdings in the Cordillera Azul (6. 80 – 28. 60 $/ha/yr) are {{at the low end of}} previous estimates of forest product use values in the tropics. Open-access lands had the highest total value, but the large area they cover means per hectare values were negligible. Forest stands are less valuable than alternative land uses that follow forest clearing. The most valuable use categories were wood and food, and the relative value of the three forest types varied between the three communities surveyed. Based on these results land management suggestions were made regarding swidden-fallow cycles that would maximize <b>composite</b> <b>forest</b> value on family land holdings. The length of time a family resides in a community was the most important predictor of both forest use values and ecological knowledge. Data on the intensity of use and the local value of the most used plant and animal taxa provide baseline data that will inform integrated conservation and development programs aimed at protecting natural resources and ensuring the livelihoods of local people in the Cordillera Azul. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of pine forests in various natural areas of European Russia depends on environmental conditions, specifics {{of soil and}} underlying parent rock. Types of pine forests are distinguished by such features as their species composition of the lower layers, {{structure of}} grass-shrub layer {{and the nature of}} its mosaic. The purpose of the study are regional features of the <b>composite</b> pine <b>forests,</b> distributed on ancient terraces of left bank of the Volga River in north-western Tatarstan, considering specifics of their position in the contact zone of coniferous-deciduous forests with steppes. The structure of the communities of the pine forests on such indicators as species richness, quantitative participation of species, their occurrence and horizontal structure of grass cover were analyzed, and detailed description of the stand and of its renewal was given. In addition, ecological and coenotic structure of communities of pine forests was investigated. It was found that group of types of <b>composite</b> pine <b>forests</b> on the slopes and flat sections of high Volga terraces in northwest of Tatarstan are distinguished by age and completeness of the stand, but is characterized by similar composition of dominant species of lower layer and microgroups in grass layer composition. These communities are characterized by high participation of meadow-steppe plants. This feature distinguishes them from <b>composite</b> pine <b>forests</b> that are found in {{the central part of the}} European Russia. This is due to the fact that the area of our study takes position of a buffer, with broad invasion of meadow and meadow-steppe species in the communities of pine forests, especially when anthropogenic disturbances take place. The probability of further transformation of pine stands in the direction of their xerophytization has been identified...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. After an {{analysis}} of foreign works on the application to forestmanagement of forest survey by statistical methods of sampling, theauthor describes the stands which he studied himself. The dcmanialforest of Izeure, a rich <b>composite</b> <b>forest</b> about to be converted, liesin {{the valley of the}} Saône, 25 km south-east of Dijon. The characteristic species of the reserve is oak (Quercus robar andQ. pedunculata) forming 77 % of the total volume together withsome beech (12 %) ans various species (II %). The average volume per hectare is 177 cubic meter (stem andbranch wood). The survey of 170, 47 ha of the forest was done on the one handstem by stem, along traditional methods, ans compartment by compartment,on the other hand by mathematical-statistical methods ofsampling. Systematically laid circular plots of io ares in area were usedat the density of one every for 50 ares of forest. The main following results were obtained:I° Survey of forest stands by sampling and use of mathematical-statistical methods can be applied in France in the frameworkof managements, and in particular to the case of cannice with standardsforests such as are found in the plain of the Saône. 2 ° Systematic samplings in forest surveys give results that are atleast as good as random probings and the computation of the standarderror of the mean usualy reserved to the latter type of surveyscan eotially be applied to them. 3 ° Circular sampling plots are very convenient. In this study Toares nlnts revealed therselve dequate. 4 ° The methods described can he readily i_iti'ized by the ordinarypersonnel of the Forest Service. The conduct of inventory operations— preparatory office work, actual field application, calculations. — has been established. 5 ° For the management of a forest. it appears sufficient to obtain,at the 5 % level of siaoificance, an error on the mean smaller than± 10 % for total volumes. 6 ° Sampling 1 / 10 th of the area inventoried — on e 10 ares plotper hectare of stand — costs twice less than complete sat -online: inthe case studied here. It is adequate for area larger than 75 hectares. 7 ° Sampling I/zoth of the area inventoried — one Io ares plotper two hectares of stand — is at least one third cheaper than completesampling. It is applicable to areas larger than 170 hectares. 8 ° This type of inventory also gives accurate enough results —standard error of the man of ± 15 % for exemple,— for secondarydata used un the estimation of the possibility (separation of stemsbetween mature and immature in particular). 9 ° A méthode is shown for finding by a preliminary test surveythe number of sampling points to be laid over a given forest inorder to obtain a given level of precision. 1 ° After a division of the forest into elementary units, the authorstudied the eventual use of variance analysis permitting a reductionof the true error on the survey. This method may certainly oe usefulin dealing with a heterogeneous forest; but in this particularcase, it appeared that the variations between stands, although noticeable,did not motivate {{an analysis}} of the variance. The. ubdivision of a forest into blocks, {{if it is to be}} justified,should essentially be based on the study of the ecological sites. (Traduction L. ROUSSEAU. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was carried out}} in Mayombe, between the soil of natural forest and the soil under four Terminalia superba plantations of 7, 12, 32 and 48 year old. In each plantation type and natural <b>forest</b> <b>composite</b> soil samples were taken in 0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30, 30 - 40 and 40 - 50 cm layers. The goal was {{to assess the impact of}} reforestation on soil organic matter and its biological characteristics. Statistically differences between the sites were tested using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results showed that there was a general decrease of soil organic matter in the profile of all sites except in the 48 year old plantation for total nitrogen. In the surface soil the carbon content and total nitrogen were respectively, 22. 2 mg g - 1 and 1. 56 μg g - 1 in the forest. The carbon content was between 14. 9 and 23. 5 mg g - 1 while total nitrogen was between 1. 31 and 2. 24 μg g - 1 in the plantations. The microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) was 732 μg g - 1 soil in the forest, it varied between 461 and 740 μg g - 1 in the plantations. The metabolic quotient (qCO 2) was between 3. 6 mg C-CO 2 mg - 1 Cmic day - 1 and 4. 8 mg C-CO 2 mg - 1 Cmic day - 1 in plantations. The qCO 2 in forest was 3. 6 mg C-CO 2 mg - 1 Cmic day - 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{trade-off}} between economically critical provisioning {{services and}} environmentally sustaining supporting services often seems absolute. Yet, when land use is inefficient, managers {{may be able}} to increase provision of both economically and ecologically sustaining services. To explore such sustainable "win-win" outcomes, I present a model of predicted trade-offs of provisioning and supporting services on smallholder farms in eastern Paraguay. The spatially implicit model simulates smallholder parcels as mosaics of subsistence agriculture, cattle pasture, eucalyptus plantations, and/or natural forest cover, and predicts provisioning and supporting service supply depending on the relative abundance of each land-use type per parcel. I represent provisioning services as the annual, per-ha proportion of a smallholder family's subsistence needs met by agriculture and forestry. I represent multidimensional supporting services as a <b>composite</b> index of <b>forest</b> bird biodiversity, soil organic carbon content, and aboveground annual net primary productivity (NPP) relative to what would be expected in a stand of high-quality Atlantic Forest. I use this model first to predict ecosystem-service supply for 38 actual smallholder parcels in rural eastern Paraguay, and then to generate an efficiency frontier that illustrates the optimal trade-offs between provisioning and supporting services that are biophysically possible for the system. Comparison of the empirical findings and the efficiency frontier indicates that current land use is inefficient relative to the biophysical optimum. All smallholder parcels included in the study but one lie far from the modeled efficiency frontier, indicating that for a given level of agricultural and forestry production, supporting services are not optimally conserved. If parcel owners were able to overcome constraints to sustainability by, for example, transitioning from cattle ranching to agroforestry production, they could protect high levels (often upward of 90 %) of the supporting ecosystem services provided by natural forest without sacrificing economically valuable provisioning services. Pathways to such sustainable outcomes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Since 2006 the Mora Cavorso Cave {{has been}} object of archaeological investigations, and archaeological and faunal finds have been {{recorded}} referable, with some discontinuities, to an interval of time lasting over 13, 000 years. The most ancient testimonies till now investigated are referable to the terminal phases of the Late Pleistocene and are followed by various Holocene layers between the Mesolithic and the Middle Age. In this paper the preliminary data related to the large Mammals, together with the hare and the greats Rodents, attributed to the latest Pleistocene are described. Nine taxa of fossil mammals in the “Dig B 2 ” of the room 1 and ascribed to a late Upper Paleolithic cultural horizon (final Epigravettian) have been found: Lepus sp., Marmota marmota, Vulpes vulpes, Mustela nivalis, Sus scrofa, Cervus elaphus, Capreolus capreolus, Rupicapra sp. and Capra ibex. From other places of the cave (the perturbed ground of the room 1 and the “Sinkhole”) the fossil remains of Lepus sp., Lepus corsicanus, Castor fiber, M. marmota, Canis lupus, Ursus arctos, Equus ferus, E. hydruntinus, S. scrofa, C. elaphus, C. capreolus and C. ibex have been also found and these too are referable to the latest Pleistocene.

40|$|AbstractForest {{inventory}} and monitoring programs {{are needed to}} provide timely, spatially complete (i. e. mapped), and verifiable information to support forest management, policy formulation, and reporting obligations. Satellite images, in particular data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+) sensors, are often integrated with field plots from forest inventory programs, leveraging the complete spatial coverage of imagery with detailed ecological information from a sample of plots to spatially model forest conditions and resources. However, in remote and unmanaged areas such as Canada's northern forests, financial and logistic constraints can severely limit the availability of inventory plot data. Additionally, Landsat spectral information has known limitations for characterizing vertical vegetation structure and biomass; while clouds, snow, and short growing seasons can limit development of large area image mosaics that are spectrally and phenologically consistent across space and time. In this study we predict and map forest structure and aboveground biomass over 37 millionha of forestland in Saskatchewan, Canada. We utilize lidar plots—observations of forest structure collected from airborne discrete-return lidar transects acquired in 2010 —as a surrogate for traditional field and photo plots. Mapped explanatory data included Tasseled Cap indices and multi-temporal change metrics derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ pixel-based image <b>composites.</b> Maps of <b>forest</b> structure and total aboveground biomass were created using a Random Forest (RF) implementation of Nearest Neighbor (NN) imputation. The imputation model had moderate to high plot-level accuracy across all forest attributes (R 2 values of 0. 42 – 0. 69), as well as reasonable attribute predictions and error estimates (for example, canopy cover above 2 m on validation plots averaged 35. 77 %, with an RMSE of 13. 45 %, while unsystematic and systematic agreement coefficients (ACuns and ACsys) had values of 0. 63 and 0. 97 respectively). Additionally, forest attributes displayed consistent trends {{in relation to the}} time since and magnitude of wildfires, indicating model predictions captured the dominant ecological patterns and processes in these forests. Acknowledging methodological and conceptual challenges based upon the use of lidar plots from transects, this study demonstrates that using lidar plots and pixel compositing in imputation mapping can provide forest {{inventory and}} monitoring information for regions lacking ongoing or up-to-date field data collection programs...|$|R
