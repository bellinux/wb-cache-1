"The objective of the Direct Magma Tap Research Program now under way at Sandia Laboratories is to investigate the feasibility of extracting energy directly from deeply buried <b>circulating</b> <b>magma</b> sources. With temperatures of the order of 1000 C temperature, these buried sources represent great amounts of high-quality energy. A fully closed heat exchanger system inserted directly into the source would allow extraction of this energy with minimal environmental impact. Major problem areas being studied include source location and configuration, in situ magma characteristics, material compatibilities, tapping methods, and energy extraction equipment. US DO...|$|E
40|$|Report Numbers: SAND- 78 - 0443 C; CONF- 780708 - 1; OSTI ID: 6700728 The {{scientific}} feasibility of extracting energy directly from buried <b>circulating</b> <b>magma</b> resources is being assessed. One {{of the tasks}} of the project {{is the study of}} geophysical measuring systems to locate and define buried molten rock bodies. To verify the results of a molten rock sensing experiment performed at Kilauea Iki lava lake, it is necessary to drill a series of holes through the solid upper crust and through the molten zone at that location. Thirteen holes have been drilled in Kilauea Iki. The results achieved during the drilling of the last two holes indicated that the molten zone in Kilauea Iki is not a simple, relatively homogeneous fluid body as expected. The encountering of an unexpected, unknown rigid obstruction 2. 5 ft below the crust/melt interface has led to the conceptual development of a drilling system intended to have the capability to drill through a hot, rigid obstruction while the drill stem is immersed in molten rock. The concept will be field tested at Kilauea Iki in the summer of 1978. DOE Contract Number: EY- 76 -C- 04 - 078...|$|E
40|$|Duke Island, 59 {{square miles}} in area, {{is at the}} {{southern}} end of southeastern Alaska. Sedimentary and volcanic rocks, possibly Mesozoic in age, are metamorphosed and intruded by gabbroic, ultramafic and granitic plutons, in that order. The granitic rocks may be of Cretaceous age. Primary gabbroic rocks are dominantly two-pyroxene gabbro and norite. Their plagioclase is An 50 -An 70. Ultramafic rocks crop out as two main areas and more than a dozen minor ones. The rocks in the main areas probably are continuous at depth forming the Duke Island ultramafic complex. Constituent minerals are olivine, clinopyroxene, and hornblende; orthopyroxene and plagioclase characteristically are absent. Rock units are classified as dunite, peridotite, olivine pyroxenite, and hornblende pyroxenite. Hornblende pyroxenite contains 10 - 20 per cent magnetite and typically occurs as a border zone. The olivine-bearing units have remarkable layering which developed by gravitational settling of crystals from a body of <b>circulating</b> <b>magma.</b> Most of the olivine pyroxenite is cut by an intrusion represented at the present surface by dunite and peridotite. Hornblende-anorthite (An 95) pegmatite, an ultramafic derivative, occurs in an aureole around the complex. In the aureole, pyroxene gabbro is altered to hornblende gabbro with plagioclase intermediate between those of pegmatite and primary gabbro. The relationship of ultramafic and primary gabbroic rocks indicates that they formed from ultramafic magma and normal gabbroic magma respectively. Mechanisms of crystallization differentiation, multiple intrusions, solid intrusion, and vapor transfer are examined as possible explanations of the distribution of rock types within the ultramafic complex. No one is sufficient, but all have applicability. The border zone is accounted for by transfer of water, silica, lime, and iron from the ultramafic magma to olivine-bearing rocks initially solidified from the magma body onto its walls. The required reactions are demonstrable in other parts of the complex, and the process is related to the development of the surrounding aureole. Evidence is given of late magmatic recrystallization in the complex and of local replacement of olivine pyroxenite by dunite. Disequilibrium, largely arising from multiple intrusion, and transfer of materials by an aqueous-rich vapor phase are probable causes. A sequence of events is summarized...|$|E
50|$|Hydrothermal {{metamorphism}} is {{the result}} of the interaction of a rock with a high-temperature fluid of variable composition. The difference in composition between existing rock and the invading fluid triggers a set of metamorphic and metasomatic reactions. The hydrothermal fluid may be magmatic (originate in an intruding <b>magma),</b> <b>circulating</b> groundwater, or ocean water. Convective circulation of hydrothermal fluids in the ocean floor basalts produces extensive hydrothermal metamorphism adjacent to spreading centers and other submarine volcanic areas. The fluids eventually escape through vents in the ocean floor known as black smokers. The patterns of this hydrothermal alteration is used as a guide in the search for deposits of valuable metal ores.|$|R
40|$|The rate {{at which}} energy can be {{extracted}} from crustal magma bodies has an important influence on the economic viability of the magma energy concept. Open heat exchanger systems where fluid is <b>circulated</b> through solidified <b>magma</b> offer the promise of high energy extraction rates. This concept was successfully demonstrated during experiments in the molten zone of Kilauea Iki lava lake. Ongoing research is directed at developing a fundamental understanding of the establishment and long term operation of open systems in a crustal magma body. These studies show that magma solidifying around a cooled borehole will be extensively fractured and form a permeable medium through which fluid can be circulated. Numerical modeling of the complete magma energy extraction process predicts that high quality thermal energy can be delivered to the wellhead at rates that will produce from 25 to 30 MW electric. 10 figs., 10 refs...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} heat, readily {{provided}} by <b>magma,</b> <b>circulating</b> hot fluids, or rapid fault slip on carbonate substrata {{is an important}} factor in determining the flank stability of volcanoes and the mechanical behavior of faults in areas where carbonate lithologies are prevalent. The mineralogy and mechanical properties of carbonate rocks are demonstrably altered by thermally induced decarbonation. While previous studies have considered the role of decarbonation in bulk strength loss at subvolcanic conditions and dynamic weakening during coseismic fault slip, little is known about the effects of decarbonation on the frictional properties of carbonate rocks during both the nucleation and inter-seismic phases. Here, we present results from experiments performed on a portlandite-rich material, a typical hydrous product of the decarbonation reaction. To evaluate frictional strength, stability, and healing at shallow crustal conditions, we sheared gouge layers of this material under saturated conditions at room temperature and at velocities comparable to those involved in earthquake nucleation. Our data indicate that the reaction of calcite to portlandite results in a distinct change in the mechanical behavior of the gouge. Decarbonated shear zones are (1) frictionally weaker at higher normal stresses, (2) more frictionally unstable, and (3) likely to regain their frictional strength more quickly than unaltered calcite-rich zones. The occurrence of portlandite could be key for interpreting the stability of volcanic flanks that root into carbonate substrata and for seismogenic normal faults located within thick sedimentary sequences, and thus provide a better understanding of the hazards they pose...|$|R
40|$|Geology of the {{vermiculite}} deposits, Gold Butte mining district, southern Virgin Mountains, Nevada: Vermiculite deposits {{lie within}} a one mile square {{area in the}} Gold Butte mining district, Southern Virgin Mountains, Nevada. An integrated field and laboratory study of the deposits was undertaken {{in an attempt to}} determine their origin. Particular attention was devoted to the mineralogy of the vermiculite and associated minerals and the geochemistry of vermuculitization. The deposits occur in ultramafic sheets and lenses of probable pre-Cambrian age. Peridotites and perknites have intruded pre-Cambrian migmatites, granulites, and quartzites, and now crop out in the interior of an elliptical dome. Diverse ages of ultramafic intrusives, demonstrated by crosscutting relations, suggest multiple intrusion. Intrusion and formation of the domical structure are believed essentially coincident in time, with intrusion outlasting the severe deformation associated with the forceful injection of an ultramafic crystal mush. During an early Cenozoic(?) orogeny the Gold Butte granite porphyry was emplaced. This granite was the probable source of most granitic pegmatites which are abundant in the area. Hydrothermal solutions supplied from the granitic <b>magmas</b> <b>circulated</b> through the ultramafic rocks, profoundly altering them. Vermiculite is widely distributed in altered ultramafic rocks, occurring in veins, stringers, pockets, and as scattered flakes. A study of X-ray, chemical, differential thermal and heat exfoliation data indicate two distinct types of vermiculite mixtures are present. All vermiculites examined were one of these two types or gradations between them. All must be considered varieties of hydrobiotite, for K 2 O is present in every case and represents a contamination by biotite layers. One type is a vermiculite-biotite mixture with the approximate ratio of 2 : 1, respectively. The second type is essentially biotite, containing approximately four per cent vermiculite. Both types show a marked degree of heat exfoliation, the second type to a lessor degree. Considerable variation between the ratio of vermiculite and biotite exists in a single vein. This heterogeneity is believed due to the high cation-exchange capacity of vermiculite. The fact that all samples showed either biotite interleaved with vermiculite, or non-expandable biotite along with hydrobiotite {{is one of the best}} evidences that vermiculite has altered from biotite, which most cases, is an intermediate product in the alteration of other ultramafic minerals. Vermiculitization of biotite involved (1) progressive subtraction of the alakies, (2) hydration and formation of loosely-bound interlayered water, and (3) progressive oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron. The process was largely accomplished by hydrothermal solutions. Zoning relations of vermiculite and other minerals in serpentine veins are especially indicative of hydrothermal activity. Still, other facts are suggestive of meteoric origin. Hence it is believed that meteoric solutions continued the process of vermiculitization after hydrothermal activity ceased, and perhaps, in some cases initiated it. Ogives of the East Twin Glacier, Alaska [...] their nature and origin: Investigations in the Taku Glacier firn, Alaska: The perfection, fine exposure, and unusual accessibility of ogives on East Twin Glacier, Alaska, make this an exceptional place in which to study the nature and origin of this phenomenon. The origin of ogives is discussed, and previous hypotheses are critically analyzed. With the exception of a hypothesis first suggested by R. T. Chamberlin, that ogives are the surficial expressions of shearing planes, no other hypothesis satisfactoriy accounts for the fact that these ogives are exposed edges of layers of denser and dirtier ice than the intervening layers. Concepts of glacier flow evolved by Demorest provide a reasonable mechanism for understanding their formation, namely, periodic obstructed extrusion flow down-glacier from an icefall. Debris which was originally basal is believed to become, by upthrusting and ablation, the surface manifestation of an ogive...|$|R
