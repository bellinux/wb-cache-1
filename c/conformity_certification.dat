40|$|Summary and Conclusion Certification of wind {{turbines}} or components is state-of-the-art and a must {{in many places}} around the world. Furthermore certification to harmonised requirements is an active support of export. Therefore {{it is important to}} know the different certification processes and guidelines as well as the keystones of their development for manufacturers, banks and insurances of {{wind turbines}} and components. This paper puts focus on IEC TS 61400 - 22 : <b>Conformity</b> Testing and <b>Certification</b> of Wind Turbines, First Edition, 2008 (CD) and describes the outcome and latest innovations of the IEC-Maintenance Team MT 22 of the Technical Committee TC 88 for certification of wind turbines and projects on- and offshore.

40|$|The {{paper is}} aiming to {{implement}} the general principles of risk prevention at employer’s level, with respect to occupational risks evaluation, the elimination of risk and accident factors, and information of workers which are using the machinery in the forestry sector. For the use of machinery in the forestry sector {{in terms of economic}} performance and a level of maximum safety, it is necessary to ensure the user guides set by the manufacturer in terms of commissioning, use and to provide appropriate safe working operations and interventions and to guarantee the technical and environmental requirements, including appropriate measures and means of protection against accidents and occupational disease. The impact of occupational risks for machinery used in this sector can be reduced through the application of modern principles in <b>conformity</b> assessment and <b>certification</b> and, where appropriate, through technical diagnostics and inspection, taking into account the provisions of the new Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 / EC which is imposing the obligation of manufacturer to implement conformity assessment procedures in accordance with the methods of assessment and verification of safety at the certification bodies, notified at the European Commission. The paper aims to develop modern technical tools for conformity assessment and verification of this category of machines used in the forestry sector that would provide prerequisite for increasing competitiveness of employers in the market economy. Applying these tools of modern technology for manufacturers and users of this category of machinery provides the necessary conditions for placing on the market of safe products with a appropriate safety level, in the intended using conditions, in order to guarantee the essential requirements for safety and health, technical and environmental conditions, including measures and means of protection. The result of this research is to develop technical tools needed to assess compliance on effective occupational risk management for professional machinery used in the forestry sector...|$|R
40|$|Investments in planted {{forests in}} {{emerging}} markets are increasing and investors {{are looking for}} Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI) to integrate Environmental, Social And Governance (ESG) into the investment process. This study is presenting a first attempt to develop a framework to evaluate the ESG performance of investments in planted forests and to identify relations {{between the use of}} SRI tools and the financial performance of investments in planted forests. The analysis of 121 investments in planted forests allowed the identification of 339 organizations and 50 SRI tools (e. g. : management and investment standards, investment rating) operating with investments in planted forests in emerging markets. The analysis of the 50 SRI tools resulted in the definition of a ESG Reference Document including 155 issues. These issues were organized into an ESG Risk Assessment and have been tested in 12 case studies evenly distributed between Uganda, Cambodia and Vietnam. The results suggest that the most common instruments are management standards (e. g. : FSC), bank investment policies (e. g. : ABN AMRO Forest and Plantation Policy) and investment rating systems (e. g. : FairForest). The majority of the SRI tools have a broad sectoral approach and are managed by business organizations. Investors are using more than 30 SRI tools but these are characterized by a low level of control such as signature and/or participation or at the most a conformity declaration. On the contrary plantation companies are using less instruments but with top level of control such <b>conformity</b> assessment and <b>certification.</b> Aspects related to “Legal and Institutional framework” and “Environment” are the most represented inside SRI tools. On the contrary aspects such as “Minimum percentage of protected areas”, “Poverty reduction” and “Prevention of encroachment” are not only the less frequent issues but also the less controlled issues by SRI tools. The Gold Standard and the Forest Stewardship Council are the SRI tools with the highest performance among the 50 SRI tools analysed. The ESG Risk Assessment allows to identify the most important 25 issues and reveals that SRI tools are focusing on issues that on-the-ground are not the major risk sources. This is the case of “Third party certification” and “High Conservation Value Forests” (HCVFs). Few exemptions where SRI tools are properly identifying the major risks are “Tenure rights”, “Health and safety of workers” and “Social impact assessment”. Climate change impacts, long term financial sustainability, poverty reduction and encroachment are ranked as the most dangerous sources of risk across the 12 case studies. SRI tools are positively influencing the risk mitigation, accounting for a percentage of risk mitigation that ranges from 34. 31 till 60. 63 %. FSC certification was often reported by projects’ stakeholders as a key instrument to mitigate risk of investments in planted forests...|$|R
