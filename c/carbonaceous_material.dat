Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components.

The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).

The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind.

The results showed that CO 2 gasification of polystyrene completed at 470 °C, which was {{lower than those of}} other <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>materials.</b> This behaviour was attributed to the high volatile content coupled with its unique thermal degradation properties. It was found that the initial decomposition temperature of blends decreased with the increasing amount of waste <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>materials</b> in the blends. In this study, results demonstrated that CO 2 co-gasification process was enhanced as a direct consequence of interactions between coal and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>materials</b> in the blends. The intensity and temperature of occurrence of these interactions were influenced by the chemical properties and composition of the <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>materials</b> in the blends. The strongest interactions were observed in coal/polystyrene blend at the devolatilisation stage as indicated by the highest value of Root Mean Square Interaction Index (RMSII), which was due to the highly reactive nature of polystyrene. On the other hand, coal/oat straw blend showed the highest interactions at char gasification stage. The catalytic effect of alkali metals and other minerals in oat straw, such as CaO, K 2 O, and Fe 2 O 3, contributed to these strong interactions. The overall CO 2 gasification of coal was enhanced via the addition of polystyrene and oat straw...|$|R

They proposed that the [...] "Chicxulub asteroid" [...] was {{also a member of}} this group. The connection between Chicxulub and Baptistina is supported by the large amount of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>material</b> present in microscopic fragments of the impactor, suggesting the impactor {{was a member of a}} rare class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites, like Baptistina.

In 2011, new data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago. This makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the Chicxulub crater, as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years. In 2010, another hypothesis was offered which implicated the newly discovered asteroid P/2010 A2, a member of the Flora family of asteroids, as a possible remnant cohort of the K/Pg impactor.|$|E
