Germany allows its citizens to hold several German passports (two or three, in extreme cases up to ten) to circumvent such travel restrictions.

5000|$|On 10 September 1980, PRC's {{current and}} only {{statutory}} nationality law went into effect.

It is worth-noting that dual nationality is still possible under the <b>current</b> <b>nationality</b> law (see [...] "Dual nationality" [...] below).|$|E

50|$|The South Korean {{nationality}} law {{is based}} on jus sanguinis instead of jus solis, which is a territorial principle {{that takes into account}} the place of birth when bestowing nationality. In this context, most South Koreans have stronger attachment to South Koreans residing in foreign countries and foreigners of South Korean descent, than to naturalized South Korean citizens and expatriates residing in South Korea. In 2005, the opposition Grand National Party suggested a revision of the <b>current</b> South Korean <b>nationality</b> law to allow South Korean nationality to be bestowed to people who are born in South Korea regardless of the nationalities of their parents but it was discarded due to unfavorable public opinion against such a measure.|$|R
40|$|A {{nationality}} law is {{an outgrowth}} of sociopolitical adaptations. Basic principles of nationality laws originated from Europe and were applied into modern nationality laws depending on sociopolitical circumstances. France, Germany, and Japan flexibly changed their nationality principles and laws throughout history. Likewise, this paper will demonstrate how the Korean Nationality Act is an outcome of continuous adjustments to sociopolitical demands {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. It argues that the first Nationality Act was the product of the Japanese colonial family registry system, the confiscation policy under the US occupation government, and ethnic nationalism movements around the world. A series of revisions on the law relaxed naturalization criteria, but the Nationality Act has not caught up with the changing landscape of Korea in the twenty first century. While there is a significant increase in immigrants, refugees, and North Korean defectors, there has also been a major decrease in the ethnic Korean population. Under the current law, people acquire Korean nationality based on their parental bloodlines. This criterion deprives foreign residents of their basic rights, including health care, education, and protection from the government. Furthermore, it reduces the economically active Korean population, which pushes Korea towards an economic downturn. By examining the conditions that led to the establishment of the <b>current</b> Korean <b>Nationality</b> Act and highlighting the communal benefits of expanding the nationalization criteria, this paper argues for wider nationalization criteria that are based on residency in modern day Korea...|$|R
50|$|There {{are almost}} as many Syrian people living outside of Syria (15 million), as within (18 million). The {{majority}} of the diaspora population consists of Syrian Christians. They trace their origin to several waves of Christian emigration, starting with the exodus {{from the time of}} the Ottoman Syria. Under the <b>current</b> <b>nationality</b> law, diaspora Syrians do not have an automatic right of return to Syria. Due to varying degrees of assimilation and high degree of interethnic marriages, most diaspora Syrians have not passed on the Arabic language to their children, while still maintaining a Syrian ethnic identity.|$|E
50|$|The third category, por opción (by choice), {{is given}} to some people of Spanish origins that, though not {{complying}} with the requisites to attain the original citizenship, are able to prove close ties to Spain; this option is given mainly {{to the children of}} people that have attained or recovered Spanish citizenship after their birth, but it has age limits and one must exercise this choice prior turning 20 (in some countries, like Argentina, prior turning 23, as majority of age is attained at 21 there). Most of the por opción clauses do not confer original status (except those included in the Historical Memory Law), thus it can be lost, and, in case one possesses nationality other than those described below as historically related to Spain (e.g., United States), renounce their <b>current</b> <b>nationality</b> in front of Spanish consular officials.|$|E
50|$|In December 2012 Klink {{announced}} that she will run for the Lebanese parliamentary elections of June 2013. During a January 2013 interview she discussed a number of her positions including her support for the amendment of the <b>current</b> <b>nationality</b> law that forbids foreign husbands of Lebanese wives and their children from obtaining Lebanese citizenship. She also supports civil marriage as an option and the setting up of temporary camps for Syrian refugees, and eventually doing away with sectarian quotas in the government. Klink justified Hizbollah's attachment to its arms but condemned the party for using its military strength against other Lebanese factions and citizens. In 2013, Myriam participated in Al Jadeed TV's reality show al-za'im (الزعيم) where young candidates to the Lebanese parliamentary elections showcase their agendas. Klink was visiting the Beirut suburb of hay-al-sellom where a firecracker was thrown to her face resulting in respiratory injury and the transportation of Klink to a medical facility.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} whether {{its desire to}} join the European Union exerted any influence upon Latvian nationality policy. The author concludes that external pressure upon Latvian policymakers during the accession process led to a significantly more liberal and inclusive citizenship law than might have otherwise been adopted. The analysis includes an assessment of <b>current</b> concerns in <b>nationality</b> and minority policy in Latvia including the large number and status of non-citizens, the application of language legislation, and the reform of the education system. EU membership {{is expected to make}} Latvian citizenship more attractive for non-citizens and the country will continue to be required to meet its international obligations regarding treatment of the non-citizen population and minorities. However, there is a risk that the completion of accession negotiations and accompanying reduction in European Commission influence coupled with intense pressure on limited economic and administrative resources in the new member states will sideline respect for and protection of minority rights...|$|R
40|$|The book {{explores the}} <b>current</b> role of <b>nationality</b> {{from the point}} of view of {{international}} law, reassessing the validity of the ‘classical’, state-centered, approach to nationality in light of the ‘new’ role the human being is gradually acquiring within the international legal order. In this framework, the collection assesses the impact of international human rights rules on the international discourse on nationality and explores the significance international (including private international) law attaches to the links individuals may establish with states other than that of nationality. The book weighs the significance of the bond of nationality in the context of regional integration systems, and explores the fields of international law in which nationality still plays a pivotal role, such as diplomatic protection and dispute settlement in international investment law. The collection includes contributions from legal scholars of different nationalities and academic backgrounds, and offers an excellent resource for academics, practitioners and students undertaking advanced studies in international law...|$|R

Nº 06 XX This paper computes {{an index}} of labour quality in Spain between 1988 and 2006. We include into the {{analysis}} gender, age, education, experience in the <b>current</b> job and <b>nationality.</b> Some of these characteristics, like nationality or experience, are not present in previous studies for Spain. Moreover, we use microdata from the Labour Force Survey and the Survey of Structure of Earnings– 2002 that allows the introduction of all possible interactions in a semi-parametric fashion. Also, we retrieve indexes for different sectors of activity (industry, construction, agriculture and market services) that could be included in empirical macroeconomic specifications of production functions by sector. Overall, the index grows at an average annual rate of 0, 42 pp. After a period of slight decline (between 1988 and 1992) the index grows continuously. During the last years the growth has decelerated a little bit. Education is the highest contributor to this growth although the decline in tenure i...|$|R
