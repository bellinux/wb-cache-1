The Emmets were financially <b>comfortable,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> house at St Stephen's Green and a country residence near Milltown. One of his elder brothers was the nationalist Thomas Addis Emmet, {{a close friend of}} Theobald Wolfe Tone, who was a frequent visitor to the house when Robert was a child.|$|E
25|$|Mbeki {{was finally}} given {{permission}} {{to undergo a}} year of military training at the Lenin International School in Moscow. He arrived in Moscow in February 1969 and became {{a student at the}} Lenin Institute, which was established exclusively for communists, the exception being non-communist members of liberation movements who could get ideological training at the Institute. Mbeki excelled at the Institute and regularly addressed the Institutes' weekly assembly. While in Moscow, he continued writing articles, documents and speeches for the ANC and its organs. In June 1969, Mbeki was chosen to be secretary of a high-level SACP delegation to the International Conference of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow. In June 1970, Mbeki was secretly shuttled from his military camp north-west of Moscow to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) guest house in Volynskoye, where the South African Communist Party's (SACP's) Central Committee was holding its meeting. This was indeed significant because, up to this point, the SACP leadership had been largely non-African. Mbeki and several Africans were now included in the committee, including Chris Hani. Both Hani and Mbeki celebrated their 28th birthdays at this meeting, making them the youngest members to ever serve on the committee. While in Moscow, Mbeki was trained in advanced guerrilla warfare at Skhodnya, and although he was more <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> book rather than a gun, the training was considered a necessary requirement if he was to be accepted as a leader. His military training was cut short as he was sent back to London to prepare for a new post in Lusaka. Throughout Mbeki's training, he kept in constant contact with Zanele.|$|E

500|$|As governor, Huntsman listed {{economic}} development, health-care reform, education, {{and energy}} security as his top priorities. He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> requirement – you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we're {{going to have to get}} serious about how we deal with this issue".|$|E

He distilled the voluminous work of Karl Marx into a simple observation, [...] "If one man has a dollar he didn't work for, some other man worked for a dollar he didn't get." [...] While Haywood respected the work of Marx, he referred to it with irreverent humor. Acknowledging his scars from dangerous mining work, and from numerous fistfights with police and militia, he liked to say, [...] "I've never read Marx's Capital, but I have the marks of capital all over me." ...|$|E

This development began during the latter episodes of the third season and {{would continue to be}} a major theme throughout the fourth season. The episode also introduced the ongoing theme of Jesse's moral decline and self guilt over his killing of Gale. Aaron Paul said of this, [...] "Jesse's much more raw this season. He's very distant, and he's turned to just utter chaos and destruction to keep his mind busy. When he's left alone in his own thoughts, that's when things can get kind of dangerous and scary for Jesse." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his grand}} funeral, Hancock faded from popular memory after his death. According to {{historian}} Alfred F. Young, [...] "Boston celebrated only one {{hero in the}} half-century after the Revolution: George Washington." [...] As early as 1809, John Adams lamented that Hancock and Samuel Adams were [...] "almost buried in oblivion". In Boston, little {{effort was made to}} preserve Hancock's historical legacy. His house on Beacon Hill was torn down in 1863 after both the city of Boston and the Massachusetts legislature decided against maintaining it. According to Young, the conservative [...] "new elite" [...] of Massachusetts [...] "was not <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rich man who pledged his fortune to the cause of revolution". In 1876, with the centennial of American independence renewing popular interest in the Revolution, plaques honoring Hancock were put up in Boston. In 1896, a memorial column was finally erected over Hancock's essentially unmarked grave in the Granary Burying Ground.|$|E

[...] Bajpayee's performance as Bhiku Mhatre in Satya is considered {{to be one of the}} most memorable characters of Hindi cinema, along with his dialogue in it: [...] "Mumbai ka king kaun?

Kay Kay Menon credits this character as a turning point for other method actors: [...] "If it were not for Manoj’s brilliant performance in Satya, actors like Irrfan and me might still be waiting to be accepted. Manoj opened the doors for us." [...] Writing about the character in his book Popcorn Essayists, journalist-writer Jai Arjun Singh wrote that the [...] "earthiness" [...] and the [...] "authenticity" [...] , was the subtle result of a persistence in Bajpai's performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Morale worsened {{once the}} {{sessions}} commenced, {{as the band}} worked long days but could not agree on a musical direction. The Edge had been listening to electronic dance music and to industrial bands like Einstürzende Neubauten, Nine Inch Nails, the Young Gods, and KMFDM. He and Bono advocated new musical directions along these lines. In contrast, Mullen was listening to classic rock acts such as Blind Faith, Cream, and Jimi Hendrix, and he was learning how to [...] "play around the beat". Like Clayton, he was more <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sound similar to U2's previous work and was resistant to the proposed innovations. Further, the Edge's interest in dance club mixes and drum machines made Mullen feel that his contributions as a drummer were being diminished. Lanois was expecting the [...] "textural and emotional and cinematic U2" [...] of The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree, {{and he did not}} understand the [...] "throwaway, trashy kinds of things" [...] on which Bono and the Edge were working. Compounding the divisions between the two camps was a change in the band's longstanding songwriting relationship; Bono and the Edge were working more closely together, writing material in isolation {{from the rest of the}} group.|$|E
