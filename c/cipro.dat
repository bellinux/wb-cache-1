25|$|Quinolone antibiotics: Ciprofloxacin (<b>Cipro)</b> {{was shown}} to {{significantly}} lower viral loads but no data on survival and graft loss exist.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} is rarely used. Frequently prescribed drugs are Avelox (moxifloxacin), <b>Cipro</b> (ciprofloxacin), Levaquin (levofloxacin), and, to some extent, their generic equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{quinolone}} antibiotics {{in modern}} use are fluoroquinolones, which contain a fluorine atom in their chemical structure and are effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. One example is ciprofloxacin (<b>Cipro),</b> {{one of the}} most widely used antibiotics worldwide.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (<b>Cipro),</b> mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|Biologically {{synthesized}} organofluorines {{have been}} found in microorganisms and plants, but not animals. The most common example is fluoroacetate, which occurs as a plant defence against herbivores in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil and Africa. Other biologically synthesized organofluorines include ω-fluoro fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate which are all believed to be biosynthesized in biochemical pathways from the intermediate fluoroacetaldehyde. Adenosyl-fluoride synthase is an enzyme capable of biologically synthesizing the carbon–fluorine bond. Man made carbon–fluorine bonds are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals because it adds stability to the carbon framework; also, the relatively small size of fluorine is convenient as fluorine acts as an approximate bioisostere of the hydroxyl group. Introducing the carbon–fluorine bond to organic compounds is the major challenge for medicinal chemists using organofluorine chemistry, as the carbon–fluorine bond increases the probability of having a successful drug by about a factor of ten. An estimated 20% of pharmaceuticals, and 3040% of agrichemicals are organofluorines, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (<b>Cipro),</b> mefloquine, and fluconazole.|$|E
25|$|Shelf {{life is not}} {{significantly}} studied during drug development, and drug manufacturers have economic and liability incentives to specify shorter shelf lives so that consumers are encouraged to discard and repurchase products. One major exception is the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which commissioned a major study of drug efficacy from the FDA starting in the mid-1980s. One criticism is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to issue guidelines based on SLEP research for normal marketing of pharmaceuticals even though the FDA performed the study. The SLEP and FDA signed a memorandum that scientific data could not be shared with the public, public health departments, other government agencies, and drug manufacturers. State and local programs {{are not permitted to}} participate. The failure to share data has caused foreign governments to refuse donations of expired medications. One exception occurred during the 2010 Swine Flu Epidemic when the FDA authorized expired Tamiflu based on SLEP Data. The SLEP discovered that drugs such as <b>Cipro</b> remained effective nine years after their shelf life, and, as a cost-saving measure, the US military routinely uses a wide range of SLEP tested products past their official shelf life if drugs have been stored properly.|$|E

2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs.

2500|$|In the May 2010 {{issue of}} The Atlantic, Freed {{reported}} on the plight of scientist Steven Hatfill who was investigated extensively by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) following anthrax attacks in 2001. Freed's article, [...] "The Wrong Man," [...] {{told the story of}} the FBI's efforts to track down individuals responsible for mailing anthrax powder to targets throughout the United States. Hartfill was targeted due to his work with the Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, his use of an antibiotic called <b>Cipro</b> useful in fending off anthrax and faulty investigating done by consultant Donald Wayne Foster. After six years of investigations and court proceedings, the FBI settled with Hatfill for $5.8 million after a U.S. District Court judge found no evidence that Hatfill was responsible for the anthrax attacks. Freed's account of the FBI investigation included extensive interviews with Hatfill, who had not provided his account with any publication prior to 2010. The article was one of the feature writing finalists for the 2011 National Magazine Awards from the American Society of Magazine Editors.|$|E

But on July 20,He returned to the unlimited Pro Stock wars by showing up at Milan for IHRA's Northern Nationals. Don went on to win the event. At the IHRA Summernationals at Bristol,Nicholson set top speed at 169.45 on the way to a runner-up finish. He had a brand new Mustang built to replace his [...] "old" [...] Mustang II and he debuted it at Maryland International Raceway's Mountain Motor Nationals. The paint was still tacky and the car was unlettered but Don qualified the car in the show. He lost in the first round. The '81 season saw Don on a roll.He qualified first at the AHRA Winternationals and finished runner-up at that event.He did run a NHRA combination as well.The 500 c.i. qualified at the NHRA Winternationals but he lost early.He also qualified for the NHRA Gatornationals but he failed to reach the finals.Where Don really rocked was in the IHRA Pro Stock. He qualified first at Darlington for the IHRA Winternationals with 7.81-176 times.He lost in the second round to a holeshot.In April,Don went to Atlanta for the NHRA Southern Nationals.He qualified well and made it into the semi final.In the semi-final,he had a front wheel come off in the speed traps.Don showed that he could still drive by keeping the Mustang upright and not crashing.On May 3,"Dyno" [...] won his last IHRA event.The Pro Am Championships at Rockingham. His car was, by this time, known as the quickest IHRA Pro Stock car and once again he proved it by qualifying first with a 7.82-176.81.He went on to win the event.Shortly after this he sold his Pro Stock operation to Harold Denton who retained Don's services for the next few races to acquaint himself with the car.Don did quite well for Denton,wrenching him to a runner-up finish at the next IHRA event,the Springnationals at Bristol.They may have won too,had it not been for a burned out clutch in the final. He continued to race a Pro Stock Ford until 1980. Nicholson made a [...] in 1984 in an Oldsmobile. He returned in 1988 in the nostalgia tour in a version of 1962 Chevrolet Bel Air, which he was still campaigning in 2001. He also made some appearances in a Pro Stock Truck in 1998 and 1999.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Times {{stated in}} their paper that Hatfill had {{obtained}} an anti-anthrax medicine (ciprofloxacin) {{immediately prior to}} the anthrax mailings.

[...] Hatfill had previously said the antibiotic was for a lingering sinus infection. [...] The omission in the Times article, of the reason why he had been taking <b>Cipro,</b> is one reason Hatfill sued the newspaper.
