50|$|A greeble or nurnie {{is a fine}} {{detailing}} {{added to}} the surface of a larger object that makes it appear more complex, and therefore more visually interesting. It usually gives the audience an impression of increased scale. The detail can be made from simple geometric primitives (such as cylinders, cubes, and rectangles), or more complex shapes, such as pieces of machinery (<b>cables,</b> <b>tanks,</b> sprockets). Greebles are often present on models or drawings of fictional spacecraft or architectural constructs in science fiction and are used in the movie industry (special effects).|$|R
50|$|When the Chemical Corps {{took control}} of Fort Terry, in 1952, it {{required}} the remodeling of 18 original buildings on post. The Army had been developing plans for the animal disease facility at Fort Terry since 1951. A laboratory was planned for the circa 1911 Building 257, originally known as Combined Torpedo Storehouse and <b>Cable</b> <b>Tanks</b> building. The lab was not completed {{by the time the}} Chemical Corps transferred the fort to the USDA but it {{and the rest of the}} remodeled buildings were eventually incorporated into the civilian facility.|$|R
50|$|Building No. 257 at Fort Terry, on Plum Island near Long Island, New York, was {{completed}} around 1911. The original {{purpose of the}} building was to store weapons, such as mines, and the structure was designated the Combined Torpedo Storehouse and <b>Cable</b> <b>Tanks</b> building. Fort Terry went {{through a period of}} activations and deactivations through World War II until the U.S. Army Chemical Corps took over the facility in 1952 for use in anti-animal biological warfare (BW) research. The Chemical Corps planned a laboratory for the fort, to be housed in Building 257. The conversion of Fort Terry to a BW facility required the remodeling of Building 257 and other structures.|$|R
50|$|Clifford's Fort, {{located on}} the Fish Quay, {{was built in the}} 17th century as a coastal defence against the Dutch. The Fort also played a role during the Napoleonic Wars. The site of the fort was used to build new fish {{processing}} facilities and very little now remains of the original fort. The area is currently undergoing restoration. Part of the foundations of the 18th century Master Gunner’s House (demolished in 1973) were found below the concrete floor of a fish processing unit. Elsewhere on the site, part of the stone edging of <b>Cable</b> <b>Tanks</b> belonging to the Submarine Mining Depot (established at the fort in 1888) were uncovered.|$|R

As work neared completion on the lab and other facilities in the spring of 1954, the mission of Fort Terry changed. Construction was completed on the facilities on May 26, 1954, but Fort Terry was officially transferred to the USDA on July 1, 1954. At the time, scientists from the Bureau of Animal Industry were already working in Building 257.|$|R

Typical summer attire for this time included navy two button blazers with gold buttons, striped college blazers, Ascot ties, <b>cable</b> knit <b>tank</b> tops, Oxford shirts, Breton striped shirts, and wingtip shoes. For fall, trendsetters such as the Duke of Windsor combined the latest American fashions with traditional British country clothing such as brogue boots, Argyll socks and jumpers, and tweed cloth sportcoats, Irish walking hats and plus fours in houndstooth, herringbone, or the Prince of Wales check popularized by Edward VII of England.|$|R

25|$|In 2005, {{the problem}} of foam shed had not been fully cured; on STS-114, {{additional}} cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent unsteady air flow underneath the <b>tank’s</b> <b>cable</b> trays and pressurization lines during ascent.

40|$|External <b>Tank</b> <b>Cable</b> Tray {{vibration}} data for three successive Space Shuttle flights were analyzed to assess response to buffet {{and the effect}} of removal of the Protuberance Air Loads (PAL) ramp.

The flight data indicated that PAL ramp removal had minimal effect on the fluctuating loads on the cable tray.

50|$|For use in {{open air}} applications, where the sensor cannot be mounted {{to the bottom}} of the tank or pipe thereof, a special version of the {{hydrostatic}} pressure level sensor can be suspended from a <b>cable</b> into the <b>tank</b> to the bottom point that is to be measured. The sensor must be specially designed to seal the electronics from the liquid environment. In tanks with a small head pressure (less than 100 INWC), it is very important to vent the back of the sensor gauge to atmospheric pressure. Otherwise, normal changes in barometric pressure will introduce large error in the sensor output signal. In addition, most sensors need to be compensated for temperature changes in the fluid.|$|R

The primary test objective was to obtain structural loads on the following external tank protuberances: (1) LO 2 feedline; (2) GO 2 pressure line; (3) LO 2 antigeyser line; (4) GH 2 pressure line; (5) LH 2 <b>tank</b> <b>cable</b> tray; (6) LO 2 <b>tank</b> <b>cable</b> tray; (7) Bipod; (8) ET/SRB cable tray; and (9) Crossbeam/Orbiter cable tray. To fulfill these objectives the following steps were taken: Eight 3 -component balances were used to measure forces on various sections of 1 thru 6 above; 315 pressure orifices were distributed over all 9 above items. The LO 2 feedline was instrumented with 96 pressure taps and was rotated to four positions to yield 384 pressure measurements. The LO 2 antigeyser line was instrumented with 64 pressure taps and was rotated to two positions to yield 128 pressure measurements; Three Chrysler miniature flow direction probes were mounted on a traversing mechanism on the tank upper surface centerline to obtain flow field data between the forward and aft attach structures; and Schlieren photographs and ultraviolet flow photographs were taken at all test conditions.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{modeling}} and simulation of anchor handling vessels. Computer simulations of anchor handling vessels {{can be used to}} evaluate the forces acting on them, and to gain valuable insight into their operational limitations. Introductorily, an overview containing important aspects of anchor handling operations is presented. The objective is to highlight important subjects that must be considered before a simulator is developed. A simulator of an anchor handling vessel is successfully implemented in Matlab and Simulink. The simulator contains modules for ballast <b>tanks,</b> anti-roll <b>tanks,</b> <b>cables,</b> seabed and anchor interaction, winch systems and guide pins. The vessel model is matched up against a real anchor handling vessel to give realistic thrust characteristics. The simulator is capable of simulating both anchor deployment and anchor recovery operations in real time. Catenary equations are used to model cables. A quasi-static polynomial approach with look-up tables is used for implementation. The method allows the use of different catenary models to simulate different phases of the anchor handling operation. A catenary model of two cables with a point load, imitating the effect of an anchor, is developed based on existing catenary models in the literature. The simulator is verified through simulations. A set of case studies is used to evaluate the vessel performance during anchor deployment and recovery. The case studies consider operation in ideal and rough weather conditions, and it is shown how equipment failures and poor vessel configuration can lead to decreased vessel stability and loss of maneuvering capabilities. </p...|$|R
