50|$|The semirigid rotor {{can also}} be {{referred}} to as a teetering or seesaw rotor. This system is normally composed of two blades that meet just under a common flapping or teetering hinge at the rotor shaft. This allows the blades to flap together in opposite motions like a seesaw. This underslinging of the blades below the teetering hinge, combined with an adequate dihedral or <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> on the blades, minimizes variations in the radius of each blade's center of mass from the axis of rotation as the rotor turns, which in turn reduces the stress on the blades from lead and lag forces caused by the Coriolis effect. Secondary flapping hinges may also be provided to provide sufficient flexibility to minimize bouncing. Feathering is accomplished by the feathering hinge at the blade root, which allows changes to the pitch angle of the blade.|$|E
40|$|A {{sequential}} filter {{is presented}} for estimating {{the center of}} mass (CM) of a spinning spacecraft using Doppler shift data from a set of onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. The advantage of the proposed method {{is that it is}} passive and can be run continuously in the background without using commanded thruster firings to excite spacecraft dynamical motion for observability. The NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is used as a test case for the CM estimator. The four MMS spacecraft carry star cameras for accurate attitude and spin rate estimation. The angle between the spacecraft nominal spin axis (for MMS this is the geometric body Z-axis) and the major principal axis of inertia is called the <b>coning</b> <b>angle.</b> The transverse components of the estimated rate provide a direct measure of the <b>coning</b> <b>angle.</b> The <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> has been seen to shift slightly after every orbit and attitude maneuver. This change is attributed to a small asymmetry in the fuel distribution that changes with each burn. This paper shows a correlation between the apparent mass asymmetry deduced from the variations in the <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> and the CM estimates made using the GPS Doppler data. The consistency between the changes in the <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> and the CM provides validation of the proposed GPS Doppler method for estimation of the CM on spinning spacecraft...|$|E

Specifically, cross coupling terms in roll rate and yaw rate have been investigated for non-planar cross-flow. An instrumented slender body of revolution with length/diameter of 9. 5 was tested at Reynolds number of about 5 million, based ol length. The tests were conducted at free streani velocity of 25 ft/s for coning angles between zero and - 20 j in 2 Zincrements, at rotation rates of up to 200 rpm in 12. 5 rpm increments in both rotational directions. The character of force and moment terms varying with rotation rate and <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> was determined. The results may be translated to functional relationships between the hydrodynamic coefficients and the angular velocities in roll and yaw. The data showed a transition in the forms of the sway force and the pitch moment after the <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> exceeded - 10 *, due to body lift in the cross flow. A method for measuring the velocity field about the model using laser doppler velocimetry has been developed. The flow field was mapped for two model coning angles at one moderate rotation rate. The flow field representation portrays perturbations in cross flow velocity at five sections in a body-fixed reference frame. This method is useful in understanding the vortex mechanisms at work to influence body forces and moments.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the calculation of the moments exerted by a viscous fluid on the walls of a cylinder that is spinning about its axis and coning about an axis that passes through its center of mass. For small <b>coning</b> <b>angles</b> and/or <b>coning</b> frequencies, these moments are estimated by solving the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. Solving the linearized Navier-Stokes equations is computationally expensive. Fortunately, when using the control volume approach to calculate these moments, these moments depend essentially on the axial velocity, and the linearized equations describing the deviation of the fluid motion from solid body rotation can be reduced to a single sixth-order partial differential equation governing the axial velocity. This single equation is solved by expanding the axial velocity in a triple series made of Fourier functions in the azimuthal direction and Chebyshev polynomials in the radial and axial directions. For linear analysis, only the fundamental component in the azimuthal direction is needed for the evaluation of moments and the triple series is reduced to a double Chebyshev expansion in the radial and axial directions thereby reducing the three-dimensional problem into a two-dimensional one. The results obtained by Chebyshev expansion show good agreement with those obtained by using eigenfunction expansion...|$|R
40|$|In the dual-axis {{rotation}} {{inertial navigation}} system (INS), besides the gyro error, accelerometer error, rolling misalignment angle error, and the gimbal angle error, the shaft swing angle and the axis non-orthogonal angle also affect the attitude accuracy. Through {{the analysis of the}} structure, we can see that the shaft swing angle and axis non-orthogonal <b>angle</b> will produce <b>coning</b> errors which cause the fluctuation of the attitude. According to the analysis of the rotation vector, {{it can be seen that}} the coning error will generate additional drift velocity along the rotating shaft, which can reduce the navigation precision of the system. In this paper, based on the establishment of the modulation average frame, the vector projection is carried out, and then the attitude conversion matrix and the attitude error matrix mainly including the shaft swing angle and axis non-orthogonal are obtained. Because the attitude angles are given under the static condition, the shaft swing angle and the axis non-orthogonal angle are estimated by the static Kalman filter (KF). This kind of KF method has been widely recognized as the standard optimal estimation tool for estimating the parameters such as <b>coning</b> <b>angles</b> (α 1, α 2), initial phase angles (ϕ 1,ϕ 2), and the non-perpendicular angle (η). In order to carry out the system level verification, a dual axis rotation INS is designed. Through simulation and experiments, the results show that the amplitudes of the attitude angles’ variation are reduced by about 20 %– 30 % when the shaft rotates. The attitude error equation is reasonably simplified and the calibration method is accurate enough. The attitude accuracy is further improved...|$|R

ASSP requires the high velocity ejection (up to 50 m/s) of 6 secondary payloads, spin stabilized {{perpendicular to the}} ejection velocity. The proposed scientific instrumentation depends on {{a high degree of}} spin stability, requiring a maximum <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> of less than 5 º. It also requires that the spin axis be aligned within 25 º of the local magnetic field lines.

Within these studies, invariably, shot outcome has not been quantified. The aims {{of this study were}} to analyse group homogeneity, then investigate whether kinematic differences exist based on shot quality, using classical statistical methods compared to Data Mining methodology (C 5. 0, PASW Modeller). Nine golfers (handicap: mean 1. 4 s = 2. 44) each performed 50 drives into a Kevlar screen. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with University ethics guidelines. Shot scores were calculated using a VectorPro launch monitor (Accusport, USA). Good/bad shots were designated as those ± 1 s from the mean. Kinematic data were captured at 500 Hz (Qualisys, Sweden), 64 retro-reflective markers were tracked to define a 14 segment 6 -DOF model (Visual 3 D, C-motion, USA). Events were defined as initiation (INIT), start (ST), mid-backswing (MBS), top (TOP), mid-downswing hands (MDH), mid-downswing club (MDC) and contact (CON). Post data-cleaning, 436 shots remained for analysis. TOP-CON lateral CoG shift (mean - 0. 11 m s = 0. 037 m) and shoulder rotation (mean 118 º s = 15. 25 º) were selected for 2 -step cluster analysis to assess group homogeneity. Four clusters were clearly defined and validated by k-means analysis. Good/bad shots within clusters were analysed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment. 18 variables associated with shoulder, torso and pelvic rotation at events, and 10 associated with weight transfer and stance were investigated. Significance was set at P < 0. 05. Significant differences between shots were only found in Cluster 1, these being pelvic-torso <b>angle</b> (<b>CON)</b> and shoulder-torso <b>angle</b> (MDC). Two clusters were further analysed using C 5. 0., the Neural Network ranks variables based on information gain and reducing entropy, discovering hidden patterns of information, (mean ± s), Cluster 1 - low rotation (93. 87 ± 2. 71 º) with low lateral CoG shift (- 0. 077 ± 0. 008 m), Cluster 3 - high rotation (131. 04 ± 2. 39 º) with high lateral CoG shift (- 0. 151 ± 0. 021 m). Three variables in Cluster 1 were ranked in order of importance by the network, pelvic-torso angle and shoulder-torso <b>angle</b> (<b>CON),</b> shoulder-torso <b>angle</b> (ST).

40|$|THIS {{body of work}} {{details the}} {{development}} of the first at-scale (> 15 cm) robotic samara, or winged seed. The design of prototypes inspired by autorotating plant seed geometries is presented along with a detailed experimental process that elucidates similarities between mechanical and robotic samara flight dynamics. The iterative development process and the implementation of working prototypes are discussed for robotic samara Micro-Air-Vehicles (MAV) that range in size from 7. 5 cm to 27 cm. Vehicle design issues are explored as they relate to autorotation efficiency, stability, flight dynamics and control of single winged rotorcraft. In recent years a new paradigm of highly maneuverable aircraft has emerged that are ideally suited for operation in a confined environment. Different from conven- tional aircraft, viscous forces play a large role in the physics of flight at this scale. This results in relatively poor aerodynamic performance of conventional airfoil and rotorcraft configurations. This deficiency has led to the consideration of naturally occurring geometries and configurations, the simplest of which is the samara. To study the influence of geometric variation on autorotation efficiency, a high speed camera system was used to track the flight path and orientation of the mechan- ical samaras. The wing geometry is planar symmetric and resembles a scaled version of Acer diabolicum Blume. The airfoil resembles a scaled version of the maple seed with a blunt leading edge followed by a thin section without camber. Four mechan- ical samara geometries with equal wing loading were designed and fabricated using a high precision rapid prototyping machine that ensured similarity between models. It was found that {{in order to reduce the}} descent velocity of an autorotating samara the area centroid or maximum chords should be as far from the center of rotation as possible. Flight data revealed large oscillations in feathering and <b>coning</b> <b>angles,</b> and the resultant flight path was found to be dependent on the mean feathering angle. The different flight modalities provided the basis for the design of a control sys- tem for a powered robotic samara that does not require high frequency sensing and actuation typical of micro-scaled rotorcraft. A prototype mechanical samara with a variable wing pitch (feathering) angle was constructed and it was found that active control of the feathering angle allowed the variation of the radius of the helix carved by the samara upon descent. This knowledge was used to design a hovering robotic samara capable of lateral motion through a series of different size circles specified by precise actuation of the feathering angle. To mathematically characterize the flight dynamics of the aircraft, System identi- fication techniques were used. Using flight data, a linear model describing the heave dynamics of two robotic samara vehicles was verified. A visual positioning system was used to collect flight data while the vehicles were piloted in an indoor laboratory. Closed-loop implementation of the derived PID controller was demonstrated using the visual tracking system for position and velocity feedback. An approach to directional control that does not require the once-per-revolution actuation or high-frequency measurement of vehicle orientation has been demon- strated for the first time. Lateral flight is attained through the vehicles differing responses to impulsive and step inputs that are leveraged to create a control strategy that provides full controllability. Flight testing revealed several linear relationships, including turn rate, turn radius and forward speed. The steady turn discussed here has been observed in scaled versions of the robotic samara, therefore the open-loop control demonstrated and analyzed is considered to be appropriate for similar vehicles of reduced size with limited sensing and actuation capabilities...|$|R

The problem possesses relevant experimental interest to deduce the interfacial tension and the contact angle from the geometrical properties of the drop. The exact knowledge of both quantities is required by many mathematical models of two-phase flow. However the compu tation usually assumes the solid plane to be perfectly smooth an d chemically homo geneous, w hile actual surfaces are always rough and often smeared by contaminants. Recent researches on oil-water flow have shown that sometimes the flow regime depends critically upon th e roughness and wettability of the in ner pipe surface. Even assuming the chemical homogen eity of the solid, roughness may influence heavily the drop shape and size, wettability and contact angle, {{but it is difficult}} to classify because it involves various parameters (average roughness, root mean square, texture, etc.). A case of peculiar interest is periodic roughness having a parallel rectilinear texture because such surfaces are already available as industrial products, suitable for experiments. The key idea of the ongoing research, not found in any other paper known to the author, is that diffraction gratings u sed in optics possess this kin d of texture, whic h is accurate to a small fraction of the wavelength of visible light. Moreover they are made of high-quality glass with carefully controlled composition, hence they guarantee good chemical homogeneity. Another promising surface which possesses a regular roughness is the old microgroove record.

40|$|Insect {{flight is}} being studied {{to aid in}} the {{development}} of micro-air vehicles that use the flapping wing model in an attempt to achieve the high levels of maneuverability that insects have. The flight of the dragonfly has been chosen to be modeled because of its exceptional flight capabilities. This thesis addresses the flapping mechanism designed for the root of each wing. The prototype of the mechanism, built at a scale of four times the size of a dragonfly having a wingspan of 150 mm, is able to create motions in the wing of flapping and feathering, and can vary the stroke plane. The <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> can be set between tests. The design process began with considering two methods of actuation, a four-bar transmission mechanism used in the Micromechanical Flying Insect developed in the UC Berkeley Biomimetic Millisystem Lab, and by pivoting the wing support directly with cables or rigid links. The second design was chosen to be developed further. A functional prototype was built from acrylic and parts made using stereolithography. by Teresa Liu. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Abstract: Braking {{operation}} {{is a process}} that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of a moving automobile into other energies. Most of the mechanical energy is transferred into heat. Frictional heat, which is generated on the interface of the disc and pads, can cause high temper-ature during the braking process. The objective of the present work is to determine temperature distribution, thermaldistortion, and thermal stress ina soliddiscby three-dimensionalmodelling for repeated braking. Braking is applied four times in the present study; the vehicle is decelerated from 100 to 50 kph with 0. 6 g, after which the velocity is again accelerated to 100 kph. In order to simulate the friction heat behaviour accurately in repeated braking, the moving heat source, which is defined by time and space variable, is applied on the frictional surface. The temperature field and thermal stress in the disc present a non-uniformity characteristic because of themoving heat source. Temperature and thermal stress of the point on the frictional surface of the brake disc present fluctuation in the braking operation. The <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> due to the non-uniform radial temperature distribution varieswith temperature. Thermal fatigue is also discussed in this article...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{analysis}} of rigid hub, three-bladed horizontal-axis, axisymmetric wind turbines in yaw is made using a linearized, four-degree-of-freedom model. The linearized {{equations of motion}} of rotor and nacelle are developed using quasi-steady blade element theory and Lagrange's equations. The yaw behavior {{of the system is}} studied from coefficients of the equations of motion. Analytical results for two wind turbines are presented and studied. The study shows that yaw tracking error is primarily caused by tower shadow. The contribution of the nacelle to the yaw stability is proved to be a destabilizing one. The yaw stability of a wind turbine in a reverse position is investigated and used for verification of the analysis. The characteristics of yaw static stability are primarily determined by the characteristics of the in-plane force coefficient and the location of the yaw axis relative to the rotor plane. A sensitivity study of the terms in the yaw stiffness coefficient is made. The yaw static stability is strongly affected by a change in the <b>coning</b> <b>angle.</b> Two Fortran computer programs are developed to compute the numerical values of coefficients of the equations of motion. Program listings and sample outputs are included...|$|E

The paper reassesses {{the mechanism of}} biodynamical feedthrough coupling to helicopter body motion in lateral-roll helicopter tasks. An analytical bio-aeroelastic pilot–vehicle model is first developed and tested for various pilot's neuromuscular adaptions in the lateral/roll axis helicopter tasks. The results demonstrate that pilot can destabilize the low-frequency regressing lead-lag rotor mode; however he/she is destabilizing also the high-frequency advancing lag rotor mode. The mechanism of pilot destabilization involves three vicious energy circles, i. e. lateral-roll, flap-roll and flap-lag motions, in a very similar manner as in the air resonance phenomenon. For both modes, the destabilization is very sensitive to an increase of the steady state rotor <b>coning</b> <b>angle</b> that increases the energy transfers from flap to lag motion through Coriolis forces. The analytical linear time-invariant model developed in this paper can be also used to investigate designs proneness to lateral/roll aeroelastic rotorcraft–pilot couplings.
