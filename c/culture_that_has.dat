5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

25|$|African-American {{culture is}} {{primarily}} rooted in West and Central Africa, {{and the majority}} of African-Americans have ancestry among the Yoruba people. Understanding its identity within the culture of the United States it is, in the anthropological sense, conscious of its origins as largely a blend of West and Central African cultures. Although slavery greatly restricted the ability of African-Americans to practice their original cultural traditions, many practices, values and beliefs survived, and over time have modified and/or blended with European cultures and other cultures such as that of Native Americans. African-American identity was established during the slavery period, producing a dynamic <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> had and continues to have a profound impact on American culture as a whole, {{as well as that of}} the broader world.|$|E

500|$|Many theorists, {{including}} Jacqueline Doyle, Jean Wyatt, Emma Perez and Cordelia Candelaria, {{have argued}} that the gender identity of Mexican and Chicana women is complexly constructed in reference to these three figures. La Virgen de Guadalupe, a Catholic icon of the manifestation of the Virgin Mary in the Americas, is revered in Mexico as a [...] "nurturing and inspiring mother and maiden". La Malinche, the indigenous mistress and intermediary of conquistador Hernán Cortés, has according to Wyatt [...] "become the representative of a female sexuality at once passive, [...] "rapeable," [...] and always already guilty of betrayal". Cisneros describes the problematic dichotomy of the virgin and the whore presented by these two figures: [...] "We’re raised in a Mexican <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> two role models: La Malinche and la Virgen de Guadalupe. And you know that’s a hard route to go, one or the other, there’s no in-betweens." [...] Madsen has noted that these 'good' and 'bad' archetypes are further complicated by the perception, held by many Chicana feminists, that they would be guilty of betraying their people, like La Malinche, if they attempt to define their femininity in more [...] "Anglo" [...] terms. Through her work, Cisneros critiques the pressures Chicanas face to suppress their sexuality or channel it into socially acceptable forms so as to not be labeled [...] "Malinchista...corrupted by gringa influences which threaten to splinter [...] people".|$|E

[...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> become something of a tease — winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but I wonder what the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment {{in the history of the}} MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder.

2500|$|Sudan has a {{rich and}} unique musical <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been through chronic {{instability}} and repression during the modern history of Sudan. Beginning with the imposition of strict sharia law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like Mahjoub Sharif, were imprisoned while others, like Mohammed el Amin (returned to Sudan in the mid 1990s) and Mohammed Wardi (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional Zār ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated [...] At the same time, however, the European militaries contributed {{to the development of}} Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish bagpipes, were renowned, and set traditional music to military march music. The march March Shulkawi No 1, is an example, set to the sounds of the Shilluk.|$|E
2500|$|Bakhtin had a {{difficult}} life and career, and few of his works were published in an authoritative form during his lifetime. As a result, there is substantial disagreement over matters that are normally taken for granted: in which discipline he worked (was he a philosopher or literary critic?), how to periodize his work, and even which texts he wrote (see below). He is known {{for a series of}} concepts that have been used and adapted in a number of disciplines: dialogism, the carnivalesque, the chronotope, heteroglossia and [...] "outsidedness" [...] (the English translation of a Russian term vnenakhodimost, sometimes rendered into English—from French rather than from Russian—as [...] "exotopy"). Together these concepts outline a distinctive philosophy of language and <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> at its center the claims that all discourse is in essence a dialogical exchange and that this endows all language with a particular ethical or ethico-political force.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{a period}} of {{relative}} isolation from whites while working on large plantations in rural areas, the Africans, drawn {{from a variety of}} Central and West African ethnic groups, developed a creole <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> preserved much of their African linguistic and cultural heritage from various peoples; in addition, they absorbed new influences from the region. The Gullah people speak an English-based creole language containing many African loanwords and influenced by African languages in grammar and sentence structure. Sometimes referred to as [...] "Sea Island Creole" [...] by linguists and scholars, the Gullah language is especially related to and almost identical to Bahamian Creole. There are also ties to Barbadian Creole, Belizean Creole, Jamaican Patois and the Krio language of West Africa. Gullah crafts, farming and fishing traditions, folk beliefs, music, rice-based cuisine and story-telling traditions all exhibit strong influences from Central and West African cultures.|$|E

2500|$|The New York Times observed, [...] "In {{translating}} the novel into a film, the producer Ismail Merchant, his directing partner, James Ivory, and their favorite screenwriter, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, {{have made a}} movie that's an ambitious, profoundly ambiguous statement about their own passion for the cultivated, high-culture sensibility epitomized by James and E.M. Forster, {{as opposed to the}} cruder mass <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> eclipsed these literary heroes [...] [...] [...] Much of the dialogue in Ms. Jhabvala's carefully wrought screenplay voices feelings that remain unspoken in the novel, and this is the movie's biggest problem. No matter how well the characters' thoughts have been translated into speech, the act of compressing their rich, complex inner lives into dialogue without resorting to voice-over narration inevitably tends to cheapen them and turn a drama about the revelation of hidden truths into the terser, more commonplace language of an intelligent soap opera." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Catholic Government", now {{removed from}} his apostolate's site but still {{available}} online, Voris reiterates the statement by St. Thomas Aquinas that monarchy is the highest form of government ("Accordingly, the best form of government {{is in a state}} or kingdom, wherein one is given the power to preside over all." [...] Summa Theologica I-11, 105.1). In the video Voris said, [...] "The only way to run a country is by benevolent dictatorship, a Catholic monarch who protects his people from themselves and bestows on them what they need, not necessarily what they want." [...] Voris later clarified his remarks, saying it would have been more accurate if he had called it an [...] "enlightened monarchy," [...] but maintaining that his larger point [...] "that a society needs strong morals in order to survive" [...] remains true. Voris holds {{that there has been a}} liberal shift in the Catholic Church, a post-1960s <b>culture</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> had a negative influence over Catholics; some of this has been influenced by [...] "Americanism," [...] a heresy that Pope Leo XIII warned about in the 19th century.
