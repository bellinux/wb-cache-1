40|$|Se presenta una paciente que fue investigada y operada en el Hospital Universitario "Gral. Calixto García", portadora de una malformación arteriovenosa cerebral, que desapareció espontáneamente después de un cuadro neurológico de intensa gravedad. Arteriográficamente se comprobó que estaba asociada a un aneurisma {{arterial}} en su mismo sistema vascular cerebral. La paciente había sufrido 3 eventos neurológicos en orden ascendente de gravedad, y fue el último motivo de ingreso en la Unidad de Terapia Intensiva, con un nivel de 5 en la escala de Glasgow para el coma y sin signos meníngeos evidenciables. La lesión valorada como malformación arteriovenosa cerebral en las tomografías axiales cumputarizadas previas, no se evidenció en la panangiografía cerebral realizada en la fase de mejoría clínica relativa después de su etapa más crítica. Dicha angiografía demostró un aneurisma arterial homolateral a la malformación arteriovenosa ya desaparecida, el cual fue excluido de la circulación por presillamiento de su cuello sin eventos transoperatorios ni posoperatorios relevantes. Se realiza una revisión de la literatura al respecto. Authors {{present the}} case of a patient researched and operated on in the "General Calixto García" University Hospital presenting with a cerebral arteriovenous malformation disappeared spontaneously after a neurologic picture of intense severity. From the arteriographic point of view it was verified that it was associated with an arterial aneurysm present in her same cerebral vascular system. The patient has had three neurological events in rising order of severity which was the last reason for admission in the Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) with a level of 5 in the Glasgow scale for the coma and without obvious meningeal signs. The injury classified as a cerebral arteriovenous malformation according to the previous <b>computerized</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomographies</b> was not evidenced in the cerebral panangiograpy carried out in the clinical phase improvement after its more critical stage.

40|$|Patellofemoral (PF) {{disorders}} {{are a common}} cause of knee pain and sometimes it can be quite difficult to make a diagnosis, because, besides PF disorders due to lateral compression or instability, the pain {{may be caused by}} a parapatellar postraumatic disorder, overuse syndrome, sympathetic algodystrophy or internal knee derangement. Thus, a thorough history and careful physical examination are essential for accurate diagnosis. Besides conventional radiographic views, <b>axial</b> <b>Computerized</b> <b>Tomography</b> (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or arthroscopy could sometimes be important. If physical therapy for at least 6 months fails, lateral release is performed in the lateral patellar compressive syndrome (lateral tilt), while either proximal or distal realignment of the extensor mechanism is done in the case of subluxation due to the altered Q angle or patellar height abnormality. In cases of dysplastic and shallowflat trochlea the trochleoplasty could be performed. In the presence of cartilage destruction, tibial tubercle elevation and medialisation are accompanied by arthroscopic debridement or shaving, which could diminish further cartilage symptomatology.

40|$|Introduction of {{nasogastric}} feeding tubes {{is usually}} blindly performed and {{is generally considered}} a safe procedure. However, the rate of complications of a blind insertion technique varies from 0. 3 to 15 %, and is usually related to inadvertent insertion of nasogastric tubes into the trachea and distal airways. The main predisposing factors related to tube malpositioning and complications are altered mental status with decreased cough or gag reflex, a preexisting endotracheal tube and severe illness. Complications include severe aspiration pneumonia, hydrothorax, hemothorax, empyema and pneumothorax. The mortality related to misplacement of a nasogastric tube is around 0. 1 - 0. 3 % of the procedures. This 61 -year old female {{had a history of}} poor appetite, weight loss, dyspnea and fever.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{establish}} values and parameters using multislice reconstruction in <b>axial</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) {{in order to}} quantify {{the erosion of the}} glenoid cavity in cases of shoulder instability. Methods: We studied two groups using CT. Group I had normal subjects and Group II had patients with shoulder instability. We measured values of the vertical segment, the superior horizontal, medial and inferior segments, and also calculated the ratio of the horizontal superior and inferior segments of the glenoid cavity in both normal subjects and those with shoulder instability. These variables were recorded during arthroscopy for cases with shoulder instability. 				 				 					 						Results 					The mean values were 40. 87  mm, 17. 86  mm, 26. 50  mm, 22. 86  mm and 0. 79 for vertical segment, the superior horizontal, medial and inferior segments, and the ratio between horizontal superior and inferior segments of the glenoid cavity respectively, in normal subjects. For subjects with unstable shoulders the mean values were 37. 33  mm, 20. 83  mm, 23. 07  mm and 0. 91 respectively. Arthroscopic measurements yielded an inferior segment value of 24. 48  mm with a loss of 2. 39  mm (17. 57 %). The ratio between the superior and inferior segments of the glenoid cavity was 0. 79. This value {{can be used as a}} normative value for evaluating degree of erosion of the anterior border of the glenoid cavity.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: The {{anatomical}} {{study of}} the vertebrae C 7 and T 1 of the cervicothoracic junction aimed to evaluate quantitatively, by <b>axial</b> <b>computerized</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT), the linear and angular dimensions of the anatomical laminae of the vertebrae of the cervicothoracic junction C 7 and T 1 in adults over 18 years. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 49 CT of the cervical and thoracic spine (C 7 and T 1) of individuals over 18 years, of both sexes. We also evaluated the length and thickness of the laminae, as well as spinolaminar angle in axial sections of C 7 and T 1 {{at the point of}} least thickness between the inner cortical layers. The variables were correlated with age groups and sex of the individuals. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test and the results were considered significant when p< 0. 05. Results: After analyzing tomographic measurements of 49 patients, it was found that men had greater laminae thickness than women, both in C 7 and T 1, with 71 % of C 7 laminae and 92 % of T 1 laminae thicker than 5 mm, and 97 % of C 7 laminae and 100 % of T 1 thicker than 4 mm. The mean spinolaminar angle was 56. 40 degrees in C 7 and 57. 31 degrees in T 1. Conclusion: This study brings important anatomical information about the cervicothoracic junction C 7 and T 1 in the Brazilian population, showing that fixation of C 7 and T 1 with intralaminar screws is anatomically possible...|$|R

In contrast to earlier designs, the Artronix scanner used a fan-shaped beam with 128 detectors on a rotating gantry. The system would take 540 degrees of data (1½ rotations) to average out noise in the samples. The beam allowed 3mm slices, but several slices would routinely be mathematically combined into one image for display purposes. The first generation of scanners was a head scanner while a later generation was a whole-body scanner.

5000|$|A silent lacunar {{infarction}} (SLI) is {{one type of}} silent stroke which usually shows no identifiable outward symptoms thus the term [...] "silent". Individuals who suffer a SLI are often completely unaware they have suffered a stroke. This type of stroke often causes lesions in the surrounding brain tissue that are visibly detected via neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and <b>computerized</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT scan). Silent strokes, including silent {{lacunar infarction}}s, {{have been shown to}} be much more common than previously thought, with an estimated prevalence rate of eleven million per year in the United States.

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} approaches {{can be used to}} visualize the pancreas. The most common include CT scan (<b>computerized</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography),</b> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP).

The broad questions that clinicians try to answer using these various approaches include: 1) Is a mass present? 2) Is the mass solid or is it cystic (does it form spaces or holes)? 3) Is the mass confined to the pancreas or has it spread to involve other structures or other organs? 4) What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient’s tumor? ...|$|E
