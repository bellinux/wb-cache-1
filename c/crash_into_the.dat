5|$|Jovian Europa Orbiter was an ESA Cosmic Vision concept {{study from}} 2007. Another concept was Ice Clipper, {{which would have}} used an {{impactor}} similar to the Deep Impact mission—it would make a controlled <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> surface of Europa, generating a plume of debris that would then be collected by a small spacecraft flying through the plume.|$|E
5|$|In Metroid Fusion, Samus {{returns to}} SR388, where a {{parasitic}} organism infects and nearly kills her. Galactic Federation scientists surgically remove {{large portions of}} her corrupted Power Suit and inject her with the Metroid hatchling's DNA to save her. To prevent the now-dubbed X Parasites from spreading beyond SR388 and the space station orbiting above it, Samus sets the station to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> planet, during which she contends with the SA-X, an X Parasite that was born from her infected Power Suit pieces and possesses all of her abilities.|$|E
5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very slight damage.|$|E

5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as {{incubators}} for the creatures' offspring. When the marines kill a chestburster, the other aliens are roused and ambush the troops, killing Frost, Crowe, Wierzboswki, and Drake while capturing Apone and Dietrich alive to be cocooned as hosts. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, taking control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Hicks, Private Hudson and Private Vasquez, the only three survivors. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots Spunkmeyer and Ferro, causing it to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> station. The remaining group barricade themselves inside the colony command center.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's body {{reportedly}} sustained two falls. As {{the coffin}} was lifted into {{place for the}} lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the chime of bells.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of the 23 August an Fw 190 was claimed off Dunkirk and on 8/9 September 1943, an Fw 190A-5 off Aldborough proved his 19th victory and last claim of Cunningham for the year. The Fw 190 was seen to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea by the Coastguard. Cunningham {{achieved}} his 20th and final air victory on {{the night of}} the 2/3 January 1944. He chased a Messerschmitt Me 410 to France, near Boulogne before shooting it down. The machine, Werknummer 017, Code U5+FE, belonging to 14./Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2), crashed at Marquise. Oberleutnant Helmut Schülze and Heinz Beger were killed.|$|E
5|$|The driver's {{clothing}} was color-coded {{in accordance with}} his faction, which would help distant spectators {{to keep track of}} the race's progress. According to Tertullian, there were originally just two factions, White and Red, sacred to winter and summer respectively. As fully developed, there were four factions, the Red, White, Green, and Blue. Each team could have up to three chariots each in a race. Members of the same team often collaborated with each other against the other teams, for example to force them to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spina (a legal and encouraged tactic). Drivers could switch teams, much like athletes can be traded to different teams today.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} medias res with Walker, Adams, and Lugo flying in a {{helicopter}} past the skyscrapers of Dubai, shooting down several pursuing helicopters until a sudden sandstorm forms, causing one of the pursuers to spin {{out of control and}} <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trio. The story then jumps back to the start, with Delta traversing the storm wall to the outskirts of a mostly buried Dubai, being taunted on broadcasts by the Radioman (Jake Busey), a DJ and former journalist speaking for the 33rd. After coming across refugees being rounded up by the 33rd and engaging in a firefight, Walker elects to disobey orders and find Konrad.|$|E

5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday saw limited running as well, as training was halted {{due to a}} massive crash by Carlos Sainz Jr.. The Spaniard lost control of his car going into turn 13, hit a wall {{and went on to}} <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> safety barriers, burying the nose of his car in the process. The session was stopped while Sainz was taken {{out of the car and}} transported to hospital, albeit uninjured. Practice was not resumed afterwards and the time of 1:38.561 set by Nico Rosberg before the accident remained the fastest lap of the session. He was more than seven-tenths of a second faster than Valtteri Bottas in second, with Lewis Hamilton another tenth behind. Sainz's teammate Max Verstappen finished the session 17th fastest after spinning in the final corner.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in {{the sixth}} {{encounter}} of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. Angle was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. The referee forced Tomko {{to head to the}} backstage area due to the referee believing he would interfere. Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver on Angle, which Angle countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. Styles escaped the hold, causing Angle to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Karen Angle then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand Angle a steel chair. Once Angle grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing Styles to grab Angle and perform the Styles Clash by slamming Angle face-first into the mat. Styles then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, Angle and Tomko assaulted Styles.|$|E
5|$|As {{they make}} their way to the tower, Nicholai disappears and is presumed dead, while Nemesis corners the {{remaining}} members of the group on the cable car headed to the tower. Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing the car to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tower's main courtyard and separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the T-Virus. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock Tower. Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.|$|E

5|$|By August 1940 the Battle of Britain was intensifying. Most of {{the battles}} thus far were in daylight, leaving night-fighter crews frustrated. Now based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire and {{operating}} from the satellite airfield at Wellingore the unit formed part of No. 12 Group RAF defending British air space north of London. On {{the night of}} 24 August 1940 Braham took off and patrolled the Humberside area. The Blenheim was piloted by Braham, and contained air gunner Sergeant Wilsdon and aircraftman and trained radar operator N. Jacobson. Braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot. His gunner succeeded in damaging the aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea. It {{was identified as a}} Heinkel He 111. Braham's only other interaction with the enemy occurred at Ternhill, when a Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs on the airfield destroying 13 Avro Ansons and damaged 20 more. Braham survived the attack uninjured.|$|E
5|$|Howell and Fraser {{took off}} in their Martinsyde from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome on 4 December 1919. However, the pair soon ran into poor weather, and were forced to land the {{aircraft}} in Dijon, France later that day. Airborne again, they reached Pisa, Italy the following day, where a replacement tail skid was fitted to the A1; by 6 December, the duo were in Naples. On 10 December, Howell and Fraser {{took off in}} their fully fuelled plane from Taranto in the afternoon. They intended to reach Africa next, but poor weather conditions forced them to alter their plan and they instead headed for Crete. Their Martinsyde was reported flying over St George's Bay, Corfu at 20:00 that evening. For unknown reasons, Howell and Fraser attempted to execute an emergency landing at Corfu. They were, however, unable {{to make it to}} the coast and were forced to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea. Citizens in the area later reported that they heard cries for help coming from the sea that night, but that a rescue was not possible in the rough conditions. Both Howell and Fraser were drowned.|$|E
5|$|Lapierre's {{offensive}} production decreased to 14 {{points in}} 2009–10, his lowest total in the NHL since his rookie season. On March 5, 2010, Lapierre was suspended four games for a hit against opposing forward Scott Nichol {{during a game}} against the San Jose Sharks the previous day. Nichol left the game injured after Lapierre pushed him from behind, causing him to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end boards. In addition to the suspension, Lapierre lost approximately $14,000 in pay, which went to the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA)'s emergency fund. In the 2010 playoffs, Lapierre helped the Canadiens advance to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, scoring goals in Game 6 of the first round against the Washington Capitals and the second round against the Pittsburgh Penguins, both elimination games. The Canadiens, however, were eliminated in the third round by the Philadelphia Flyers; Lapierre finished the playoff season with three goals and one assist in 19 games.|$|E

5|$|March 10 and 11 were {{dedicated}} to the scenes in Sang Min's warehouse. The team's assault of the warehouse was filmed by three separate units. Kono's fight sequence was included to assert to the audience {{that she would be}} a valuable asset to the team. In the scene where McGarrett shoots Sang Min's Mercedes-Benz before it crashes into a shipping container was done with two separate takes, the first of which involved O'Loughlin shooting blanks into a car. The car would swerve away. The second take saw the car <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> container with O'Loughlin away from the shot as McGarrett was in close proximity to the car. The eighth day of filming was spent in a village of quonset huts where McGarrett and Danny chase Doran. In one part of the sequence, McGarrett jumps over the trunk of one car as it was hit from behind by another car. To make the scene a reality, the film crew made a three-part composite shot to ensure no harm came to O'Loughlin.|$|E
5|$|Paul and Amanda Kirby, a {{seemingly}} wealthy couple, offer Grant funding for his research {{if he will}} give them an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Although initially suspicious of their true intentions, Grant is desperate for research support and thus reluctantly agrees. He flies there along with Paul, Amanda, Billy, and the Kirbys' mercenary associates, Udesky, Cooper, and their pilot Nash. On the plane, Grant learns that the Kirbys actually plan {{to land on the}} island. When Grant opposes, he is knocked out by Cooper and wakes to the sound of Amanda using a megaphone. This attracts a Spinosaurus, which devours Cooper and Nash. The creature's obstructing of the runway causes the plane to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forest. Fleeing, the survivors briefly lose the Spinosaurus, only to encounter a Tyrannosaurus. The Spinosaurus returns, but the group escapes while the two predators fight each other. The Spinosaurus bites the T. rexs neck and kills it.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{returns to}} Erinsborough and sets {{fire to the}} Lassiter's complex. He also kills Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack), when Gus catches him. Paul helps rebuild the complex and reclaims Lassiter's for himself. Paul has affairs with both Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) and Liljana Bishop (Marcella Russo). He later frames Liljana's husband, David (Kevin Harrington) for fraud. Paul strikes a deal with Affirmacon to build on Ramsay Street and he gets his protégé Dylan Timmins (Damien Bodie) to pollute the local wetlands. When Paul wants {{to pull out of}} the deal, he is taken to the bush and beaten up. Paul escapes and falls down a cliff, badly {{breaking}} his leg. While Paul recovers in hospital, his leg becomes infected and is amputated. Paul's sister, Lucy, encourages him to make a proper home for himself in Erinsborough and he moves into Number 22.
