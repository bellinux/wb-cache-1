A <b>concentrating</b> <b>collector</b> directs sunlight into a fiber-optic cable which transmits light to a TiO_ 2 photocatalyst immobilized on the fibers and immersed in a reaction solution.

Reaction rates for the oxidation of 4 -chlorophenol of 25 and 12 μM min^(- 1) were measured for solar and artificial UV sources, respectively.
