5|$|Downes, in {{his role}} as DGMS, pressed for the {{construction}} of major military hospitals in the <b>capital</b> <b>cities.</b> He argued that, after the war, they should be handed over to the Repatriation Commission for the care of sick and disabled ex-service personnel. Despite strong opposition on the grounds of cost, Downes won his case in October 1940. Time soon vindicated his judgement; and today the major military hospitals in the state <b>capital</b> <b>cities,</b> the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney, the Austin Hospital in Melbourne and Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane remain his greatest legacy.|$|E

The territory has changed the seat of government for numerous reasons, including civil conflict, development of infrastructure, and a history of significant revisions to its territorial boundaries.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{position}} of <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> region in Estonia. An analysis of the position of the <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> in the local self-government organisation of a country must consider the following four aspects: 1. The <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> in the system of human settlements. 2. The <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> and the national legal environment, including the <b>capital</b> <b>city’s</b> relationship with the central government and regional co-operation. 3. Management models of the <b>capital</b> <b>city,</b> including decentralisation. 4. The economic environment in the capital city; the <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> and the economic environment of the region and the country. The author is of the opinion that there are practically no interdisciplinary analyses addressing legal, economic, and demographic and management problems of <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> in Estonia...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to explain a <b>capital</b> <b>city's</b> size. We assume away {{explanations}} such as exploitation of the <b>capital</b> <b>city's</b> hinterland. Instead, we emphasise the role of the localisation of government activity (i. e., administration or legislation) in the <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> for both the <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> economy and the hinterland economy. We assume in the model that larger regions benefit from agglomeration economies. We discuss the interaction of those agglomeration economies with an agglomeration diseconomy specific to the <b>capital</b> <b>city.</b> Under certain conditions, a stable population distribution between the <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> and its hinterland emerges where neither region captures the entire population. We also analyse the comparative statics properties of this stable equilibrium. <b>Capital</b> <b>city,</b> public goods, urban growth...|$|R

5|$|The {{automobile}} {{is by far}} {{the dominant}} form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other <b>capital</b> <b>cities</b> in Australia have substantially less green space.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} relative change over 17 years in clinical oral health outcomes inside and outside <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> areas of Australia. METHODS: Using data from the National Oral Health Survey of Australia 1987 - 88 and the National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004 - 06, relative trends in clinical oral health outcomes inside and outside <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> areas were measured by age and gender standardized changes in the percentage of edentate people and dentate adults with less than 21 teeth, in mean numbers of decayed, missing and filled teeth, and mean DMFT index. RESULTS: There were similar reductions inside and outside <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> areas in the percentage of edentate people (<b>capital</b> <b>city</b> 63. 7 %, outside <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> 60. 7 %) and dentate people with less than 21 teeth (52. 5 %, 50. 1 %), in the mean number of missing teeth (34. 3 %, 34. 5 %), filled teeth (0. 0 %, increase of 5. 5 %), and mean DMFT index (21. 2 %, 19. 2 %). The reduction in mean number of decayed teeth was greater in <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> areas (78. 0 %) than outside <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> areas (50. 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: Trends in four of the five clinical oral health outcomes demonstrated improvements in oral health that were of a similar magnitude inside and outside <b>capital</b> <b>city</b> areas of Australia.
