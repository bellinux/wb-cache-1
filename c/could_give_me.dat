500|$|Actress Joy Kilpatrick {{was cast}} as Dawson's photo double. Dawson {{described}} {{having a great}} working relationship with her stand-in. Discussing Kilpatrick, she said, [...] "I {{was about to tell}} her what I was going to be doing so she <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the beats that I could react to properly" [...] and found her to be supportive and intuitive. Kilpatrick was not credited for her performance in the episode. Kolbe noted that the episode used a lot of visual effects, specifically to create the illusion of the two versions of Torres. The casting of a photo double allowed Kolbe avoid relying on split screen. The scheduling was carefully planned to account for the make-up used for both roles.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} advice {{he would give}} to his character, Barber said [...] "Unfortunately, I don't think he would listen {{to me in the}} first place, but if he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the time of day, I would say lighten up on the control because you’re never going to have it." [...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next.

[...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Holy Bull again {{skipped the}} Breeders Cup, {{in part because}} the {{supplemental}} fee to enter him in the Classic would have been $360,000.

[...] "You <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a half-million dollars tax-free and I wouldn't run him in the Breeders' Cup," [...] he said.

2500|$|His eloquence was in vain, and {{his request}} {{to be shot}} was denied. On 10 November 1798, he was found guilty and was {{sentence}}d to be hanged on 12 November. Before this sentence was carried out, either he attempted suicide by slitting his throat or British soldiers tortured and mortally wounded Tone.

2500|$|... "I want {{to explain}} what happened. Sunday night when you {{requested}} to have someone over I didn't realize you wanted the room in private. I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Yeston and David Hahn's In the Beginning, {{a musical}} poking good-natured {{fun at the}} first five books of the Bible from the {{perspective}} of ordinary people living through the events described, had been workshopped at the Manhattan Theatre Club with an initial Book by Larry Gelbart under the title [...] 1-2-3-4-5 in 1987 and 1988. [...] After various revisions and tryouts, it was finally produced under its current title at Maine State Music Theatre in 1998. A producer introduced Yeston to Alan Jay Lerner to show him a song from the show, [...] "New Words", and [...] "Lerner thought the song was so wonderful he invited me to stop by his office every couple of weeks so he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> pointers. He said Oscar Hammerstein had done that for him and he wanted to do that for me. So, I really got coaching lessons – mentoring – in a series of meetings with Alan Jay Lerner as a result of having written that song." [...] In 1988 Yeston recorded a studio recording of a musical entitled , produced by the noted Phil Ramone. Plácido Domingo sang the role of Spanish painter Francisco de Goya, with Jennifer Rush, Gloria Estefan, Dionne Warwick, Richie Havens, and Seiko Matsuda.

[...] Because of Domingo's time commitments, the musical was made into a concept album instead.|$|E
