25|$|Although his {{great-grandfather}} John Carter had freed slaves {{in his will}} (as well as provided homesteads and livestock for them), manumission became illegal in the year Carter's father and grandfather died, and did not again become legal until 1783. King Carter in fact had greatly expanded slavery in Virginia, purchasing many off ships and owning {{more than a thousand}} slaves upon his death. King Carter gave his grandson his first slave (a girl) when he was just three months old. By the time he came of legal age in 1749, Robert Carter III owned 6500 acres of land and 100 slaves. Although Carter sold land and some slaves to pay his debts in 1758, he did not purchase slaves (unlike George Washington and other neighbors), and in fact became known for his humane treatment. Carter's plantations had roughly double the rate of slave population increase as others in the state. Carter was particularly moved by the example of Governor Fauquier, who in his will allowed his slaves to choose their masters. When Carter became a <b>co-administrator</b> of his father-in-law's estate, he (with the support of Daniel Dulany) delayed scheduling a sale of the slaves of Bel-Air plantation, since that would break up families, although his procrastination led to more than 18 years of litigation with his Tasker in-laws. Furthermore, Carter rarely whipped slaves, or allowed them to be whipped, let alone scarred them although he whipped his children, particularly his eldest son Robert Bladen.|$|E

50|$|There was {{controversy}} over the copying of the mailing list data from the old server to create the new mailing list of Google Groups. This was raised {{as a violation of}} the UK Data Protection Act by Luke Leighton. Whether this was actually a legal violation is not really clear and is open to interpretation. This was a community driven open source project. According to many in the community, both Luke and Anthony were co-administrators of the project and co-leads to it. It was being forked by a team including Anthony, one of the administrators who had privileges for the server, which Luke Leighton owned. The mailing list was part of the domain. So the ownership of the mailing list data itself isn't very clear. Though Luke claims he personally owned the mailing list and that using it to create a new mailing list for the new pyjs.org fork of the project constituted stealing, many in the community feel differently. Many feel that this was an open source community project and Luke Leighton was a co-lead and <b>co-administrator.</b> Hence the mailing list was actually a community property of the pyjs.org community and not the personal property of Luke.|$|E
