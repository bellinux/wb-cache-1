5|$|A {{variety of}} peptide {{coupling}} reagents <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> prepare Weinrebâ€“Nahm amides from carboxylic acids. Various carbodiimide-, hydroxybenzotriazole-, and triphenylphosphine-based couplings {{have been reported}} specifically for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> introduce aldehyde groups onto aromatic rings, {{for example}} via the Gattermann-Koch reaction which uses carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride and a copper(I) chloride co-catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Because underwire can tear through cloth, {{most women}} hand-wash underwire bras or machine-wash {{them on a}} {{delicate}} cycle. Bra wash bags, usually zippered mesh pouches, <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> protect bras and prevent the underwire from separating from the bra during machine washing.|$|E
50|$|The {{co-monomer}} {{is typically}} dioxolane but ethylene oxide <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b> Dioxolane <b>is</b> formed by reaction of ethylene glycol with aqueous formaldehyde over an acid catalyst. Other diols <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|R
50|$|TETRIX PRIME was {{developed}} for middle school <b>use</b> but <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> with TETRIX MAX components. The systems <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> with R/C controllers or a variety or programmable options such as myRIO and Arduino.|$|R
50|$|Dimethylamine <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|R
5|$|Clique-finding {{algorithms}} {{have been}} used in chemistry, to find chemicals that match a target structure and to model molecular docking and the binding sites of chemical reactions. They <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> find similar structures within different molecules.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{prove the}} theorem {{of the three}} geodesics, that every smooth Riemannian {{manifold}} topologically equivalent to a sphere has three geodesics that form simple closed curves.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made {{with peanut butter}} and marshmallow fluff usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients. The term fluffernutter <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and marshmallow fluff.|$|E
50|$|Bootstrapping {{approaches}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|R
50|$|It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a {{mouthwash}} when diluted, and <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as {{a general}} disinfectant. A Pfizer representative in South Africa stated that if diluted, it can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a vaginal douche, although the safety of {{this has not been}} fully ascertained.|$|R
50|$|It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on billboards.|$|R
5|$|A jonline <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> tether the diver's {{equipment}} to the dive boat {{before or after the}} dive. This helps the diver to put on or take off the equipment while in the water without drifting away from the boat. It is similar to a buddy line, which is used to tether two divers together during a dive.|$|E
5|$|As well as finding {{objective}} {{evidence of a}} crime being committed, investigations <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> prove the intent (known by the legal term mens rea). For example, the Internet history of convicted killer Neil Entwistle included references to a site discussing How to kill people.|$|E
5|$|Changing the reflux (in {{combination}} {{with changes in}} feed and product withdrawal) <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> improve the separation properties of a continuous distillation column while in operation (in contrast to adding plates or trays, or changing the packing, which would, at a minimum, require quite significant downtime).|$|E
5000|$|ATM cards <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on improvised ATMs such as [...] "mini ATMs", merchants' card {{terminals}} {{that deliver}} ATM features without any cash drawer. These terminals <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as cashless scrip ATMs by cashing the receipts they {{issue at the}} merchant's point of sale.|$|R
50|$|Uvular fluttertonguing <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> when an {{alveolar}} trill is {{not appropriate}} to achieve the effect of fluttertonguing, e.g. in the low range of the flute, or when a faster fluttertongue <b>is</b> desired. Fluttertonguing <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{in conjunction with other}} types of articulation.|$|R
50|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>|$|R
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine changes {{due to the}} starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster. That is, the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of globular clusters are then used to study {{the evolution of the}} Milky Way as a whole.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD version 10.0 {{introduced}} the package manager pkg {{as a replacement}} for the previously used package tools. It is functionally similar to apt and yum in Linux distributions. It allows for installation, upgrading and removal of both ports and packages. In addition to pkg, PackageKit <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> access the Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|From version 2.0 to 9.0, FreeBSD {{used the}} sysinstall program as its main installer. It {{was written in}} C by Jordan Hubbard. It uses a text user interface, and is divided {{into a number of}} menus and screens {{that can be used to}} {{configure}} and control the installation process. It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> install Ports and Packages as an alternative to the command-line interface.|$|E
50|$|Nootka Cypress <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in bonsai.|$|R
50|$|Ruby {{annotation}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in handwriting.|$|R
50|$|This <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> with a hash.|$|R
5|$|HST's {{guidance}} system {{can also be}} used as a scientific instrument. Its three Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> carry out extremely accurate astrometry; measurements accurate to within 0.0003arcseconds have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|In addition, larger organs may use unison off couplers, {{which prevent}} the stops pulled in a {{particular}} division from sounding at their normal pitch. These {{can be used in}} combination with octave couplers to create innovative aural effects, and <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> rearrange the order of the manuals to make specific pieces easier to play.|$|E
5|$|In that vein, {{infinite}} matrices <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence {{and continuity}} questions arise, which again results in certain constraints {{that have to}} be imposed. However, the explicit point of view of matrices tends to obfuscate the matter, and the abstract and more powerful tools of functional analysis can be used instead.|$|E
5000|$|Kaiser {{described}} his pupil as follows: 'He {{is a right}} wing midfielder and he <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as an attacking midfielder. He's a skilled player with a good pass and he can create chances. He's got insight, power and <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a target man' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{methods can}} <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for translating an arbitrary constraint satisfaction problem, either binary or otherwise. Since they <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on binary problems, they <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> on {{the result of}} making constraints binary, either by translating to the dual problem or by using hidden variables.|$|R
25|$|Water <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a heat-storage medium.|$|R
5|$|Predators {{including}} Cactoblastis cactorum (mentioned above) <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> destroy invasive plant species. As another example, {{the poison}} hemlock moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) {{can be used}} to control poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its host plant, poison hemlock, and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.|$|E
5|$|Snow can be {{compacted}} {{to form a}} snow {{road and}} be part of a winter road route for vehicles to access isolated communities or construction projects during the winter. Snow <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> provide the supporting structure and surface for a runway, as with the Phoenix Airfield in Antarctica. The snow-compacted runway is designed to withstand approximately 60 wheeled flights of heavy-lift military aircraft a year.|$|E
5|$|The contemporative mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if {{the subject of the}} subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.|$|E
25|$|CO2 <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as the raw material.|$|R
