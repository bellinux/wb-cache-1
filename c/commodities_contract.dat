Except in the extreme equilibrium exhibiting full indexation, policy shocks will generate correlated movements in output and employment over time. The analysis thus suggests an inverse relationship between indexation of contracts and persistence of policy effects. Labor contracts, money shocks...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Companies {{that are}} {{dependent}} on different commodities as input or output are exposed to price risk in these commodities. The price changes can be expressed as volatility and higher volatility results in higher risk. Hedging the <b>commodity</b> <b>contracts</b> with futures can offset this risk. One {{of the most important}} questions in this field is to what extent the risk exposure should be hedged with futures contract, i. e. the optimal hedge ratio. Purpose: The study aims to conduct an analysis of the variance in different <b>commodities</b> <b>contracts</b> and provide evidence of the optimal hedge ratio in the respective commodities. Method: We used a quantitative study with daily spot and futures price changes of Copper, Gold, Cotton and Oil. We investigated the 6 -month hedging behaviour where timeseries were created for the period January-June each year during 2001 - 2004. We used a simple linear regression of the futures and spot price changes and a minimum variance model in order to calculate the optimal hedge ratio. Conclusion: Companies that {{are dependent on}} Copper, Gold, Cotton and Oil can significantly reduce the risk by engaging in futures contracts. The optimal hedge ratio for Copper is (96 %), Gold (52 %), Cotton (96 %) and Oil (88 %). By applying the optimal hedge ratio, a company may reduce their risk exposure up to 90 % compared to an unhedged position...|$|R

Forexample, it involves an investor in only the most liquid <b>commodity</b> <b>contracts</b> in theirrespective sectors. Last year, aluminium accounted for 46% of combined turnover onthe LME. Consequently, a commodity index which has part of its basket in lead ornickel would entail greater liquidity risk since these two metals constitute only 11% oftotal turnover on the LME.
