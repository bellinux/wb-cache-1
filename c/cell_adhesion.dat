5|$|Like other {{biological}} macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins {{are essential}} parts of organisms {{and participate in}} virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, <b>cell</b> <b>adhesion,</b> and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down {{for use in the}} metabolism.|$|E

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, <b>cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by <b>cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{function}} is supported through dynamic and reciprocal communication between cells and the tissue environment. Tyrosine phosphorylation {{is an important}} example of a mediator of this communication. Elevated levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation promote malignant growth and behavior, although the tyrosine kinases {{that are responsible for}} this signaling remain largely unknown. Antibodies were generated against tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in malignant tissue in an attempt to identify tyrosine kinases responsible for the malignant phenotype. Here we report increased levels of the EphA 2 (ECK) receptor protein tyrosine kinase in clinical specimens and cell models of breast cancer. Overexpression of EphA 2 is sufficient to induce malignant transformation and tumorigenesis in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. Specifically, common in vitro and in vivo assays identified increased survival in a foreign environment and alterations in <b>cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> as phenotypes of the EphA 2 transformed cell, MCFEphA 2. A major contributor to at least the alteration in <b>cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> provoked by EphA 2 overexpression is increased production of the ECM component fibronectin. Further analysis of the balance of <b>cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> in nontransformed tissue reveals that the strength of ECM attachments adversely affects the strength of cell-cell adhesions. Additional studies revealed that the steroid sex hormone estrogen and the transcription factor Myc suppress EphA 2 expression.

A terpolymer (TERP) was synthesized by free radical copolymerization of its three monomers and cross-linked with collagen, creating a hybrid biological-synthetic hydrogel scaffold. The terpolymer is based on poly(NIPAAM), which is known to be a cell friendly polymer. TERP is used both as a cross-linker to increase hydrogel robustness and as a site for grafting of bioactive peptides or growth factors, by reacting some of its acryloxysuccinimide groups with the –NH2 groups on the peptides or growth factors.

The adhesion of RBCs has been studied extensively in the frame of cell-to-cell interaction induced by dextran macromolecules, whereas the data is lacking for native plasma solution. We apply optical tweezers to investigate the induced adhesion of RBCs in plasma and in dextran solution. Two hypotheses 'cross-bridges' and 'depletion layer' are being utilized to describe the mechanism of cells interaction, while both need to be confirmed experimentally.

40|$|Motile cells transduce {{environmental}} chemical signals into {{mechanical forces}} to achieve properly controlled migration. This signal-force transduction {{is thought to}} require regulated mechanical coupling between actin filaments (F-actins), which undergo retrograde flow at the cellular leading edge, and <b>cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> via linker "clutch" molecules. However, the molecular machinery mediating this regulatory coupling remains unclear.

Shootin 1 -cortactin interaction was enhanced by shootin 1 phosphorylation by Pak 1, which is activated by the axonal chemoattractant netrin- 1.

There is growing evidence {{for the importance of}} crosstalk between these two adhesion types, yet {{little is known about the}} impact of these interactions on the mechanical coupling of cells to the extracellular-matrix (ECM). Here, we combine experiment and theory to reveal how intercellular adhesions modulate forces transmitted to the ECM. In the absence of cadherin-based adhesions, primary mouse keratinocytes within a colony appear to act independently, with significant traction forces extending throughout the colony. In contrast, with strong cadherin-based adhesions, keratinocytes in a cohesive colony localize traction forces to the colony periphery. Through genetic or antibody-mediated loss of cadherin expression or function, we show that cadherin-based adhesions are essential for this mechanical cooperativity. A minimal physical model in which <b>cell</b> [...] <b>cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> modulate the physical cohesion between contractile cells is sufficient to recreate the spatial rearrangement of traction forces observed experimentally with varying strength of cadherin-based adhesions.
