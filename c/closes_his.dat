25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes as he dies.|$|E
500|$|The 1928 {{version of}} [...] "Good Old Mountain Dew" [...] {{is close to}} the style of a ballad. The lyrics tell the story of a man's first day in court to answer charges of making illegal alcohol. In the first verse, the {{prosecutor}} <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> case. In the next three verses, several respected members of the community—the deacon, the doctor, and the conductor—visit the charged man, trying to buy his whiskey. In the final verse, the judge offers the young man clemency if he is willing to pay court costs for the trial.|$|E

500|$|Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp {{starts to}} shuffle away, {{but the girl}} steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes hold {{of his hand and}} presses the coin into it. As she <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> palm she stops abruptly; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: [...] "You?" [...] The Tramp nods with an {{uncertain}} smile and asks, [...] "You can see now?" [...] The girl replies, [...] "Yes, I can see now" [...] and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.|$|E
500|$|In Harper's office, Michael confronts {{her about}} her {{involvement}} in his accident, pulling out his gun to shoot her. However, he instead lets Bird and another detective arrest her. Later, Dr. Evans applauds Michael's apparent rejection of the [...] "red reality" [...] and, when Michael suggests his fantastic experiences may have simply been a dream of the [...] "red reality," [...] Dr. Evans warns him not to create a third reality. She suddenly goes still. Michael, confused, goes through her office door and finds himself in his bedroom. He goes downstairs and finds both his son, Rex (Dylan Minnette), and wife alive. Concerned about Michael's odd behavior, Hannah asks if he is okay. He replies, [...] "I'm perfect," [...] and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes.|$|E
500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Cosima's death, some writers heaped copious praise on her. Ernest Newman, Wagner's biographer, called her [...] "the greatest figure that ever came within [...] circle"; Richard du Moulin Eckart, Cosima's first biographer, introduced her as [...] "the greatest woman of the century". In time judgements became more measured, and divided. Marek <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> account by emphasising her role not only as Wagner's protector but as his muse: [...] "Without her {{there would have been no}} Siegfried Idyll, no Bayreuth, and no Parsifal". In Hensher's judgement, [...] "Wagner was a genius, but also a fairly appalling human being. Cosima was just an appalling human being." [...] In 1977, 47 years after her death, Cosima's urn was recovered from Coburg and buried alongside Wagner in the Wahnfried garden.|$|E

500|$|The {{response}} for [...] "Dial D for Diddly" [...] {{was that it}} started well, but then gradually declined. In Marnell's opinion, [...] "he best segment of the entire episode comes when Ned makes his normal routine look sinister and yet when he finally <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> hands to pray, he's actually holding a pair of severed hands", but {{as for the rest}} of the segment, he is disappointed: [...] "hen it seems like the short is heading for some darkly hilarious territory, the voice of God turns out to be Homer urging Ned to murder his enemies." [...] Other reviewers agreed with his assessment. Surette concluded that the episode [...] "tarted off good, but got boring very quick." [...] Likewise, Childs commented that the [...] "segment had a lot of promise for the funny, but it started to sag fast and then sank altogether." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{on a school}} bus with {{children}} playing and throwing things, and features a young boy who then selects the track [...] "I Don't Remember" [...] on his iPod and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes. He then dreams about a school concert for a band called [...] "Littlefinger", a parody of the band {{for which he is}} the lead singer [...] "Bernie", a parody of Bernard Fanning. The band and audience are composed of primary school students. Children are seen offering a chocolate milk called smilo, a take on Milo, and a camera crew for [...] "Channel [...] " [...] and reporter [...] "Su-Mi". This is a parody of Yumi Stynes, a presenter from Australian music station Channel V. The end of the clip shows that it was a dream being had by the student who played the lead singer for [...] "Littlefinger".|$|E
500|$|At Rome {{the poets}} of the Late Republic and Augustan age {{continued}} the Hellenistic period's allusive {{engagement with the}} Catalogue. Catullus, a poet who made plain his Callimachean affiliations, is the earliest Roman author who {{can be seen to}} engage with the Catalogue. In his epyllion on the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, Catullus alludes to the theoxeny that the proem to the Catalogue presented as a defining characteristic of the heroic age and to the epithalamium of the couple that was sung in a later book. In the Aeneid Vergil <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> catalogue of combatants with the swift female warrior Camilla, alluding to the Hesiodic account of Iphiclus' speed in [...] "a remarkably subtle nod to tradition in the best Alexandrian style." [...] Ovid picked up on Vergil's allusion in the Metamorphoses with his treatment of Atalanta, which recast's his Roman forbearer's allusion to Iphiclus {{in such a way that}} it highlights the Hesiodic character of his own poem in contrast with the Homeric character of the Aeneid.|$|E

500|$|Details {{surrounding}} the accident are slowly revealed as the series progresses. Shortly after the crash, Michael's commanding officers (Tricia Harper and Carl Kessel) meet {{to talk about}} the accident and how they set up a [...] "short" [...] guy. Later a microphone at Ricky's Tacos speaks to Michael, claiming that if he moved to Portland he would [...] "never know the truth". Michael slowly begins to remember what happened in the accident; after realizing that Ed caused it, he speaks with Dr. Evans and Dr. Lee. His therapists insist that he is imagining it all to help cope with the pain. However, when Michael later breaks into Ed's house Ed admits that he and an accomplice were hiding heroin at the Westfield Distribution Center; [...] "they decided he had to go", after Michael began to uncover it. Michael does not know who [...] "they" [...] are, demanding that Ed tell him. Ed asks for protection before telling him, and attacks Michael when he is distracted. During the struggle Michael kills Ed, and Bird comes into the house after speaking to Dr. Evans. Michael later discovers that Carl and Tricia are involved in the setup. Tricia shoots Carl in the [...] "green reality" [...] (in an attempt to hide her involvement in the accident), but is later imprisoned. At the end of the series finale ("Turtles All the Way Down"), Michael sees Hannah and Rex together. Concerned about his odd behavior, they ask if he is all right. Michael replies, [...] "I'm perfect," [...] and <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> eyes.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with Till {{arguing with}} his girlfriend through a phone call. As soon as Swift, as the protagonist, notices, they begin to {{communicate}} by holding up signs through their bedroom windows. Till <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> curtains, and Swift holds up a sign saying, [...] "I love you". As the song's chorus approaches, Swift starts to sing and dance {{in front of a}} mirror, changing to different clothing multiple times. Afterward, Swift is sitting in a bench while reading a book. Till arrives and the two converse. Then, Swift, as the antagonist, arrives in a red convertible car and Till gets in it; Swift, the antagonist, kisses him and gives a hostile look towards the protagonist. Suddenly, she is seen cheerleading at a football game while Swift's other persona is in the bleachers, performing in the school band. After scoring the winning touchdown, Till moves toward his girlfriend and finds her flirting with a teammate, resulting in a heated argument which results in their breakup. Meanwhile, Swift, the protagonist stares in amazement. Back in their bedroom windows, they again communicate through signs, Till asked Swift, the protagonist, if she was attending prom and she responded, [...] "no, studying". Swift, however, notices Till has a dejected expression as he leaves and changes her mind. Shortly after, Swift is seen entering prom with a white dress, no longer looking like a nerd, while all her peers stare in amazement. When Till spots her, he walks towards her and Swift, the antagonist in a red dress, attempts to impede him, but he ignores her. Ending the video, Till and Swift reveal folded signs saying [...] "I love you" [...] and kiss.

500|$|Three months later, while {{attending}} {{a party with}} Phoenix and Pearl, Maya is abducted by assassin Shelly de Killer, who threatens to kill her if Phoenix does not win an acquittal for his client, actor Matt Engarde, who has been arrested for killing his rival, Juan Corrida. As a [...] "present", de Killer stages an assassination attempt on Franziska, rendering her unable to act as prosecutor. At the last second, Edgeworth arrives and steps in to replace her. With Phoenix resorting to increasingly desperate acts to prolong the trial, Edgeworth offers to help him save Maya, explaining {{that he has been}} leading a task force to capture de Killer. Using a tape that Engarde, in truth a thoroughly guilty psychopath, had recorded as blackmail, Phoenix reveals his betrayal to de Killer. Fearing that Shelly will target him, Engarde pleads guilty and is convicted of murder. As a reward for Phoenix's help, de Killer releases Maya, who subsequently reunites with Pearl and all of their friends. Edgeworth explains that his absence was spent soul-searching for [...] "the answer" [...] as to {{what it means to be}} a prosecutor, and he and Phoenix reconcile, while Franziska pledges to renounce her profession in disgrace. Edgeworth confronts her at the airport, where Franziska breaks down in tears and admits that she is jealous of Edgeworth and wanted to destroy him, but now feels that she cannot with such huge losses on her record. Recognizing that she needs to find the same answers he did, she returns to her native Germany with a picture of Phoenix in her possession. There is also an alternate ending, where Engarde is declared innocent, and his manager is convicted instead based on Franziska's evidence. Phoenix, convinced that he can no longer continue as an attorney, <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> firm and retires in disgrace.|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} on Godwin's other writings {{and the nature}} of his genius. His productions are not spontaneous but rather rely on long, laboured thought. This quality also limits Godwin's powers of conversation, so he fails to appear the man of genius he is. [...] "In common company, Mr. Godwin either goes to sleep himself, or sets others to sleep." [...] But Hazlitt <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> essay with personal recollections of the man (and, as with Bentham, a description of his appearance) that set him in a more positive light: [...] "you perceive by your host's talk, as by the taste of seasoned wine, that he has a cellarage in his understanding." ...|$|E

2500|$|Short selling {{is a form}} of {{speculation}} that allows a trader to take a [...] "negative position" [...] in a stock of a company. [...] Such a trader first [...] "borrows" [...] shares of that stock from their owner (the lender), typically via a bank or a prime broker under the condition that he will return it on demand. Next, the trader sells the borrowed shares and delivers them to the buyer who becomes their new owner. [...] The buyer is typically unaware that the shares have been sold short: his transaction with the trader proceeds just as if the trader owned rather than borrowed the shares. Some time later, the trader <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> short position by purchasing the same number of shares in the market and returning them to the lender.|$|E

He begins saying that Nancy Mitford's article has given rise to much pleasurable discussion. Before pushing on to the less etymological aspects of her theme, he addresses how language evolves and changes naturally, and U-slang, attributing to it a sense of parody. He says interest in the study of U-speech has been arbitrarily awakened and considers this interest unhealthy and contrary to the [...] "national interest". He <b>closes</b> <b>his</b> article hoping (ironically) that the U-young will strive for a clear, classless medium of communication in which all say [...] "Pardon?" [...] and none say [...] "What?", and every ball is a dance and every man's wife is [...] "the" [...] wife, but then saying that he will be surprised and disappointed if they do anything of the sort.|$|E
