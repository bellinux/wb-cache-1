These organisations are known as prime providers, or "primes", and operate within a geographical <b>Contract</b> <b>Package</b> Area (CPA). Each CPA has either two or three primes and individuals entering the Work Programme are {{randomly assigned to one}} of these. Comparing the outcomes of individuals assigned to each prime within a CPA provides robust estimates of relative effectiveness. Overall, there are 40 contracts across Britain, allowing 26 within-CPA comparisons. An interim report confirmed both that randomisation had worked well and that there was statistically significant variation in outcomes between primes. This report extends the interim analysis to relate the variation in outcomes to differences in the services offered by primes. By doing so, it aims to understand what makes some primes more effective than others. The results provide evidence of certain aspects of service being more associated with better outcomes than others and that much of this is concentrated among particular subgroups. Several relationships have been revealed which could provide some clues as to what is driving the variation in provider performance. However, the analytical approach provides evidence of an association only and does not enable us to establish whether these relationships are causal in nature. In addition, much of the variation in performance is not associated in a statistically significant way with the provider characteristics that we have been able to measure. This may suggest that the key characteristics have not been taken into account...|$|E

This study attempts to identify, health and safety practices prevailing in road construction projects, issues and propose measures to mitigate. The study was confined to seven contract packages implemented under Northern Road Connectivity Project (Additional Financing) funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB). Five of them were located in the North Central Province while {{the other two were}} in Northern Province. Data was gathered through questionnaires, interviews and observations. Questionnaire comprised six major criteria, namely, training and supervision, safe work procedures, communication, reporting safety, management commitment and injury and return to work. Study revealed that workers are exposed to hazards of frequent and heavy lifting, noise and vibration, hazardous substances such as oil, gas, hydraulic fluid, welding fumes, heavy vehicle operation, working in blasting faces, clearing operations, slips, trips and falls, struck by, being struck by falling objects, hand-arm-whole body vibration, dust, sources of noise, electrical hazards etc. In asphalting areas workers are exposed to high temperatures and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydro Carbons (PAHC) which are carcinogenic. Working in excavated areas is prone to collapse of slopes. Workers are also prone to ergonomic issues caused due to manual handling and awkward postures. Main causes of accidents have been identified as fall from height, fall of objects, struck on stationary objects, struck by moving objects, struck on moving objects, caught in between, exposure to heat, exposure to electricity and exposure to harmful substances. Information gathered from 250 respondents revealed a high positive response in overall health and safety management practices. Five of the six criteria concerned showed a high positive response of greater than 78 percent. Communication recorded the lowest. <b>Contract</b> <b>package</b> wise comparison shows that P 3 and P 4 had a low positive response in the criteria concerned other than management commitment. Interviews conducted with Project Managers revealed a high commitment. Safety Committees were nonexistent in six of the seven packages except (P 2). Observations revealed safety lapses such as working without PPE, working under unsafe conditions, non barricading hazardous zones, lack of warning sign boards and deploying non competent flagmen etc. It is recommended to conduct awareness programmes through Labour Department Officials prior to commencement of construction work, qualified Safety Officers should be employed, sites should be thoroughly inspected to eradicate hazards, work zones should be safe for workers, consultant’s field staff should check adequacy of precautionary measures, importance of PPE should be emphasized, hazard areas should be properly barricaded, trained flagman should be deployed, records of toolbox meetings should be maintained, near misses should be recorded, Safety Policy should be accessible to all workers, officials from the Labour Department should visit the sites to check compliance...|$|E

40|$|In {{trying to}} get {{products}} out to the market in promotional or display packaging, companies {{have the option of}} turning to a contract packager. The purpose of this thesis is to present the area of <b>contract</b> <b>packaging,</b> specifically discussing the internal factors that make a contract packager an attractive actor to outsource packaging of products to and also to find out how a contract packager can affect the supply chain of the company outsourcing to such an actor. The questions posed in this thesis are: - When is it appropriate to outsource? - Why is a supplier of <b>contract</b> <b>packaging</b> successful? - How is the supply chain affected when outsourcing to a contract packager? In addressing these questions a systems approach has been used, because a systems approach allows the researcher to see properties of the whole, rather than seeing the sum of parts as the collective properties of a system. The empirical data were collected through a case study of one company performing <b>contract</b> <b>packaging.</b> Literature was studied in the areas of outsourcing, supply chain/supply chain management, third-party logistics and <b>contract</b> <b>packaging.</b> Each of the questions posed was answered through the papers appended in this thesis. The first paper uses complexity theory in order for managers to be able to view outsourcing situations from a balanced perspective, providing guidance from two important functions – relative power and interface complexity. The conclusion reached in this paper is that in order for an outsourcing situation to be appropriate, the outsourcing company, vis-à-vis the supplier of the activity/process, needs to have high relative power while keeping interface complexity low. V The second and third papers discuss why a contract packager is successful and how it affects the supply chain of the company engaging it. In reference to the contract packager, it is ascertained that important activities to offer, besides the packing of products, are design and manufacturing of packaging and warehousing of the product of the customer. In using a contract packager, the company engaging it can utilize certain characteristics of <b>contract</b> <b>packaging.</b> The characteristics displayed by <b>contract</b> <b>packaging</b> are the “one-stop shop”, flexibility and warehousing. These characteristics give an outcome in the supply chain that can be used by the company to achieve effectiveness — from manufacturing of the product to the delivery of the product in display packaging to the store. The company’s supply chain is enabled to reduce uncertainty, reduce time-to-market of the promotions, and increase responsiveness. The company can also realize other benefits including consolidation of products and postponement of manufacturing of packaging and packing...|$|R
40|$|The Nigeria's highway {{infrastructure}} {{are currently}} being procured and maintained using the traditional Design, Bid Build (DBB) method. The procurement method and funding mechanism appeared not to have produced the desired result of timely and cost effective project outcome nor good quality and sustainable road network. This study set out to investigate the challenges being experienced in this traditional procurement method. The study also explored the features of Public Private Partnership (PPP) and its potentials as an alternative procurement method for highway development, operation and maintenance, including developing and validating PPP framework for application in highways in Nigeria. The study formulated two research questions - to investigate why the traditional method has not produced the desired result; and how the PPP method {{can play a role}} in achieving the desired highway project output. The research conducted literature review to examine the challenges of DBB method in Nigeria, and subsequently explored the concepts of PPP generally and its particular application in highways. The research philosophy is majorly interpretive with minor positivists blend in a methodological pluralism for methodology enhancement. The research used case study research design where quantitative method was first used to investigate the current highway projects performance in cost and time perspective under the DBB method. The research also used qualitative method to analyse official documents and questionnaires to conduct an in-depth analysis of the highway Performance Indicators and their Critical Success Factors under DBB and PPP methods. The comparative analysis of the research findings showed that the DBB method used for highway development in Nigeria generally results in cost and time overruns, low quality road network occasioned by the lack of adequate public financing, poor road maintenance management system, suboptimal risk sharing and lack of innovative processes, and inefficient procurement process. The findings also showed that PPP by way of its financial models, efficient procurement, operation and maintenance processes, technical and managerial capacities, as well as the bundling of design, construction and maintenance in a single <b>contract</b> <b>package</b> may produce timely, cost effective, good quality and sustainable highway network in Nigeria. The concomitant road sustainability will result in economic benefits of reduction in vehicle operating and maintenance costs, improved standard of road and longevity that support other economic activities. The resultant social sustainability benefits include reduction in accident rate, reduced travel hours, improvement in health and safety of road users. Environmental benefits of road sustainability include protection and enhancement of natural environment by reducing pollutants being generated from dilapidated roads. The findings were subjected to testing for validity, reliability and generalisability. The findings from data analysis were further processed to develop PPP framework for highways in the Nigeria. The framework was validated and the result of the validation showed that the framework is appropriate and applicable in the Nigeria environment. The framework developed in the research is a unique contribution to knowledge. It provides a holistic view, in a single pictorial display of interconnecting web relationships, the performances of both the DBB and PPP procurement methods, the possible enhancement of DBB method and the implementation procedure of PPP method for a sustainable highway infrastructure in Nigeria. The framework will be of benefits to policy makers and regulators such as PPP Unit of the Federal Ministry of Works as the operators of Nigeria's highways and the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, the regulators of PPP scheme in the areas of decision making on alternative procurement options for highway projects, as well as adequate PPP governance. Other actors that will benefit from the study are the external consultants and contract managers being engaged by FMW. Academic community and trainers will also benefit from the research, particularly as regards to the peculiarity of implementing PPP for sustainable highways in Nigeria. Accessibility to the research work will be made possible through publications in both local and international journals, and also presenting technical papers in workshops and conferences...|$|E
