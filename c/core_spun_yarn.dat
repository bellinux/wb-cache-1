30|$|On {{the other}} hand, for the denim fabrics, the Hanji paper single yarn, <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn,</b> and Hanji {{combination}} yarn {{were used as}} the weft. As shown in Fig.  3, the twisted shape of Hanji paper yarn showed a stable structure with little fluff on the surface unlike that of cotton yarn. The <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> had a slightly bulky structure because the cotton yarn enveloped a spandex filament (core yarn). In the existing denim fabrics, the use of <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> as the weft began {{with the development of}} skinny denim products in recent years, and core spun yarns were commonly used to improve the surface properties of core yarns and to produce stretch fabrics.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> used to impart {{elasticity}} to fabrics and their usage {{has recently been}} increasing. Most significantly, {{in the production of}} denim fabrics when the <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> and the paper yarn are used properly as weft, it is found that the disadvantages of the paper denim fabric’s heaviness, roughness, and wrinkles caused by low stretchability, can be greatly improved.|$|E
30|$|Another fire {{blocking}} technology uses <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> {{to produce}} barrier materials. <b>Core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> (also known as core-sheath yarn) {{begins with an}} inherently fire resistant fiber core (e.g., glass). This core is then coated with a less expensive material (e.g., polyester) that is primarily responsible for the aesthetic and comfort properties. The thermally stable core maintains the structural integrity and provides a woven framework (grid) for the char layer (lattice) formed by the thermal decomposition of the sheath fiber. This type of “grid/lattice” structure ([[URL] 2999]) provides the physical barrier that prevents flame penetration into the more flammable cushioning layer as discussed earlier. The composition of the core and sheath can be tailored to satisfy fabric performance requirements. For example, to further improve fire resistance the sheath layer may contain FR, and to improve strength and durability a polyester or polyamide sheath may be used instead of a cotton or polypropylene. Beside barrier fabrics, the <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> may {{also be used as}} sewing thread in upholstery.|$|E

In this study, <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> were produced with cotton fibres and PBT/elastane filament yarns (cotton as sheath material, PBT yarn and elastane as core yarns). Twill woven (1 / 3 Z) fabrics were produced by using <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> (30 tex) and cotton yarns (30 tex) as weft, and 100 % cotton yarn (59 tex) as warp yarns. The fabrics consisting of PBT were washed at 100 °C for 30 minutes to gain the elasticity. The woven fabrics’ weight, thickness, elongation, permanent elongation, dimensional stability, air permeability, thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity characteristics were tested and statistically evaluated. According to the results, the fabrics containing PBT and elastane filaments had similar elongation and shrinkage values. PBT filament yarns have a great potential to produce lightweight elastic fabrics...|$|R
40|$|Yarn supercapacitors, as knittable and weavable {{energy storage}} devices, are {{attracting}} {{more and more}} attention in recent years. Similar to various yarns with different physical and mechanical properties available in textile industry, different yarn supercapacitors should be developed as well. However, as a device, stretchable yarn supercapacitors suffer a lot from limited stretchability, complicated and high cost fabrication, which greatly restrict their wide adoptions. Here, we use urethane elastic fiber <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> (UY) with intrinsic high stretchability for the first time, as a wearable scaffold for hosting conductive CNT and electrocapacitive PPy to fabricate large-scale highly stretchable yarn electrodes via a simple two-step process (CNTs dipping and PPy electrodeposition). The yarn supercapacitor keeps the excellent stretchability of the UY without using any extra stretchy substrate or wavy structure as most stretchable yarn supercapacitors used, {{and at the same}} time, exhibits a high areal capacitance of 69  mF cm− 2 (normalized to two electrodes) as well as a good rate capacity. Furthermore, the capacitive performance of the yarn supercapacitor remains nearly unchanged even at a high strain of 80 %. The high-performance stretchable yarn supercapacitor with the use of intrinsically stretchable yarns paves a way for the production of large-size fabrics for wearable electronic applications.

30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{physical}} properties of yarns, the breaking stress of Hanji paper yarn was {{lower than those of}} the cotton yarn and the <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn,</b> but the paper yarn maintained a relatively high breaking strain. The Hanji combination yarn has been improved the weaving ability by complementing the tensile strength of Hanji paper yarn. In the surface structure of the yarn, the rope-dyed cotton yarn showed a rather bulky structure while the cheese-dyed cotton yarn showed a compact structure. The structure of Hanji combination yarns showed that the Hanji single yarn and <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> were tightly combined resulting in a stable form. The optimal weft inserting speed for the Hanji paper yarn was approximately 90 % of the cotton yarn with the same yarn count. Also, the appearance of most Hanji denim fabrics produced showed no significant difference from the existing stretchable denim fabrics indicating commercialization of Hanji denim fabrics as highly possible.|$|E

30|$|The paper yarns {{used in the}} weft {{were made}} into two types, single yarn and {{combination}} yarn. First, in the manufacturing process of a single yarn, a paper sheet was cut to a pre-determined width to make a tape yarn, and after that the single yarn was produced by adding a proper twist to the tape yarn through a twisting machine. In other words, the Hanji paper sheet, {{with the weight of}} 13  g/m 2, was cut into the tape yarn in the width of 2.75 and 3.75  mm. Then, the Hanji paper yarns, count of 16 and 11  Ne, were produced after twisting 600 and 520  tpm (Z-twist), respectively, using a twisting machine (Murata® 363). The combination yarn was manufactured by combining paper yarn and <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn.</b> In this study, Hanji paper yarn of 16 or 30  Ne was plied in S-twist with the <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> [cotton (sheath)/spandex (core)]. After that, the structures of Hanji combination yarns were stabilized through the steam setting for 14  min at 105  °C. With this process, the count of Hanji combination yarn produced was 10 and 15  Ne, respectively.|$|E
30|$|The study {{evaluated}} the optimal weft inserting speed with two cases using Hanji combination yarn alone and Hanji paper yarn and <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> in a 1 : 1 ratio. As a result, the optimal weft inserting speed (approximately 620  rpm) for the Hanji paper yarn was approximately 90 % {{of the cotton}} yarn with the same yarn count. This is because we believe the tensile strength of Hanji paper yarn and Hanji combination yarn is {{lower than that of}} ordinary cotton yarn.|$|E
30|$|Human skin has {{an ability}} to stretch greatly with body movements. Generally, a wearer also expects {{to see the same}} {{attitude}} from their clothing (Ozdil 2008). However, the denim fabric is wrinkled since it does not have stretchable fiber component. It is a heavy weight fabric compared to other woven fabrics. Instead of using the unbleached weft roll, one way to give successful stretchability to the denim fabric as a way to prevent wrinkles, is by the use of cotton yarn and spandex yarn by turns or, a second way, is by using a cotton/polyester blended spun yarn. However, even though the denim fabric that used cotton yarn and spandex yarn by turns has a relatively good stretchability, there have been issues due to the denim fabric’s uneven surface because the spandex yarn is of a fine sized yarn compared to the cotton yarn. In addition, {{in the case of the}} cotton/polyester blended spun yarn, it has been found that stretch and fabric lightweight improvement is needed to meet consumers’ needs. Recently, a <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> is used as the weft yarn in order to give the denim fabric stretch (Ozdil 2008). The <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> has stretchability with a feel of cotton because it has spandex as its core yarn and it is wrapped by cotton yarn.|$|E

30|$|Another fire {{blocking}} technology uses <b>core</b> <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> {{to produce}} knitted barrier materials ([2999 c]).

The thermally stable core maintains the structural integrity during a fire by providing a woven framework (grid) for the char layer (lattice) formed by the thermal decomposition of the sheath fiber while burning. The composition of the core and sheath can be tailored to satisfy barrier performance and comfort requirements.|$|E
30|$|In general, {{yarn count}} of the weft for {{commonly}} used cotton denim fabrics in summer and winter are respectively about 15 and 10  Ne.
