40|$|As {{stated in}} the thesis project, "For the past two years, {{concerned}} community organizations in Ottawa-Carleton have been meeting to discuss {{the establishment of a}} <b>Community</b> <b>Loan</b> Fund in the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton(RMOC). In early 1993, the Community Enterprise Centre(CEC) released funding to assist in the financing of the fund's development. The CEC is a community based organization which promotes and supports activities that improve the economic health and sustainability of local communities through partnerships, advocacy and demonstrated leadership on community economic development (CED) issues. The CEC struck a steering committee to develop a loan fund and contracted the Social Investment Organization(SIO) to facilitate the development of a model for the fund through a process which included several consultations over a two-month period with community stakeholders. In June, the steering committee issued a press release announcing the creation of the Ottawa-Carleton <b>Community</b> <b>Loan</b> Fund(OCCLF) and committed the fund to begin lending operations in the fall of 1993. At {{the same time that the}} CEC was working on setting up the OCCLF, the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs(MMA) was circulating a discussion paper on establishing a provincial <b>Community</b> <b>Loan</b> Fund Guarantee Program. In August 1993 the model developed by SIO and the MMA's discussion paper were presented at a meeting of community stakeholders. The meeting endorsed the work to done to date and agreed to strike a working group with broad representation and appropriate skills to establish the OCCLF and to qualify as one of thirty five <b>community</b> <b>loan</b> funds to be supported by the MMA program when the appropriate legislation was passed. The Community Economic Development Act was passed in the Ontario legislature in December 1993. The legislation earmarked $ 10 million to guarantee the principal of loans made by a proposed 35 <b>community</b> <b>loan</b> funds in Ontario over the next five years. The proposed MMA process envisioned that sponsors of <b>community</b> <b>loan</b> funds would express their interest in being selected for participation in this program through a request for proposals. These proposals would include a business plan with such outlines as: a financial management plan, a long-term marketing plan, sources of investment capital, technical support, etc. The community groups who were selected would be eligible to receive financial assistance of $ 15, 000 to move into the start-up phase which included: incorporation, the development of bylaws, an offering statement to investors, registration, etc. " (Library-derived description) Brown, G.

40|$|International Financial Institutions (IFIs) tie {{resource}} {{transfers to}} capital-scarce countries to improvements in their economic policies and institutions. The {{objective of this}} assistance is twofold: to augment the recipient's capital base and to improve its allocation of resources. This paper offers a political-economy explanation for the limited success {{of some of these}} loan programs. In our model, governments select policies under the influence of interest groups. Their capacity to absorb IFI loans and their reform efforts are both unobservable to the IFI. An optimally designed <b>loan</b> <b>mechanism</b> must create sufficient incentives - in the form of rewards and punishments - to counter the influence of interest groups on economic policy choices. The <b>loan</b> <b>mechanism</b> is, however, constrained in two ways: it cannot punish a country so severely as to threaten its political stability and it must remain affordable to the IFI. Whenever reform incentives are inadequate, a government will accept the loan but cheat on the implementation of reforms. If, on the other hand, the mechanism design is optimal, it might be so costly to the IFI that a well-entrenched interest group can block the reform program. Nonetheless, the availability of properly designed <b>loan</b> <b>mechanisms</b> will push governments to implement partial reforms even if the optimal mechanism is too costly for the IFI.

The obstacles to creating a secondary market for <b>community</b> development <b>loans</b> are similar to obstacles other markets faced: lack of data, standardization of documents and loan process, and loan volume. Other markets have managed to overcome these obstacles. Yet despite recent advances, such as the Community Reinvestment Fund’s issuance of rated securities in November 2004 and May 2006, {{the goal of a}} vibrant secondary market for <b>community</b> development <b>loans</b> seems as tantalizingly close today as it did nearly a decade ago, when a community development consultant wrote in Community Investments that “piece by piece, a secondary market is taking shape. ” This development was in the “not-too-distant future.
