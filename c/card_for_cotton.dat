40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study the working of two {{different}} combinations of stationary flats having different wire points per square inch and its impact on waste percentage reduction and cotton fiber behavior. The overall objective is to increase the yield percentage by minimizing the carding waste with the help of stationary flats, and also improving the quality of ring spun yarn. This research is partial to the performance of stationary flats only, and does not involve other parts of carding machine. Further research may be carried out on other parts of the carding machine as well.

5000|$|In 1764, James Hargreaves is {{credited}} as {{inventor of the}} spinning jenny which multiplied the spun thread production capacity of a single worker [...] - [...] initially eightfold and subsequently much further. Others credit the invention to Thomas Highs. Industrial unrest and a failure to patent the invention until 1770 forced Hargreaves from Blackburn, but his lack of protection of the idea allowed the concept to be exploited by others. As a result, there were over 20,000 spinning jennies in use {{by the time of}} his death. Also in 1764, Thorp Mill, the first water-powered cotton mill in the world was constructed at Royton, Lancashire, and was used <b>for</b> <b>carding</b> <b>cotton.</b> With the spinning and weaving process now mechanized, cotton mills cropped up all over the North West of England.|$|R

40|$|Cotton {{subsidies}} are widespread, {{especially among the}} world leading cotton producing countries. China, the world leading producer and consumer of cotton, allocated its producers an estimated $ 43 billion in 2006 up from $ 18 billion in 2004 and $ 15 billion in 2003. India, the world leader in terms of acreage, provides annual subsidies estimated at $ 12 billion while Brazil, a rising {{force in the world}} agricultural market, is proposing $ 26. 1 billion in various forms of credit assistance and agricultural production insurance. In addition to domestic support, many importing countries have been using high import tariffs to restrict imports. China uses of tariff rate and quota system create major distortions in the world cotton market. Meanwhile, Pakistan a leading cotton importer has an average applied tariffs ranging from 37. 5 % <b>for</b> non-carded <b>cotton</b> to 65 % <b>for</b> <b>carded</b> <b>cotton.</b> The highest per pound indirect {{subsidies are}} found in Uzbekistan (about 18 cents per pound) where indirect subsidies account for about 28 percent of the total farm price. The lowest levels of indirect support are found in Brazil and China where indirect support adds about 3 percent to the domestic price. As for direct support, Mexico has the highest share of direct support relative to domestic price with almost 12 percent. China and Turkey are the next with almost 10 and 6 percent, respectively.

5000|$|Doek is Dutch for cloth, {{which was}} {{evolved into the}} English word [...] "duck" [...] in {{reference}} to sail canvas. Duck was typically made from cotton or linen (flax), with some use of hemp. These natural fibers have poor resistance to rot, UV light and water absorption. Linen is stronger, but cotton is lighter. Linen was the traditional fiber of sails until it was supplanted by cotton during the 19th century. At first cotton {{was used as a}} matter of necessity in the United States as it was indigenous and the supply of flax was periodically interrupted by wars such as the War of 1812, during which demand for sailcloth for military use was high. As sail size grew linen was too heavy to be practical so cotton became more popular. Cotton did not substantially replace linen worldwide {{until the end of the}} age of sail; however, in some cases the strength of linen was preferred for some types of sails. It was not until the late 20th century that natural fibers were replaced by synthetics in mainstream use. Cotton sailcloth is still used for sportswear, upholstery and draperies. The traditional width <b>for</b> <b>carded</b> <b>cotton</b> sailcloth in the US was 23 inches (58 cm) while the British standard was 24 inches (61 cm).|$|R
