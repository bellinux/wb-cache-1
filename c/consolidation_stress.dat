Thirteen constant rate of strain (CRS) tests were performed to ascertain the compression properties as a function of <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress.</b> <b>Consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> for these specimens ranged from 6, 800 kPa to 39, 000 kPa. CRS results show that the compression ratio (CR) decreases with increasing <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> which is in accord with research completed on resedimented Boston Blue clay (RBBC) and behavior of RUC during Ko consolidation. The CRS data established a value of cv at 0. 0015 cm 2 /sec and an average Ck of the tested specimens at approximately 0. 35. Thirteen K, consolidated triaxial compression tests were performed to ascertain the Ko and undrained shear properties as a function of <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress.</b> <b>Consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> for these specimens ranged from 190 kPa to 9, 800 kPa. The range of Ko at maximum stress ranged from 0. 47 to 0. 65 where increasing <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> resulted in an increase in Ko values and a decrease in undrained shear strength, which is in accord with research completed on resedimented Boston Blue clay (RBBC) and resedimented Gulf of Mexico Clay (RGOM) at MIT. Undrained Strength Ratios (USRs) ranged from 0. 262 to 0. 349 with a trend of decreasing normalized strength and strain softening, and increasing axial strain at failure increase with increasing <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress.</b> Peak friction angles during shearing ranged from 20. 30 - 27. 80 with a general trend of decreasing with increasing <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress.</b> Observed Skempton's A parameters at failure (Af) ranged from 0. 407 to 0. 777 with a trend of with increasing with <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress.</b> Normalized secant moduli (Eu/o've) measured at 0. 01 % axial strain ranged from 150 to 475 with the trend of decreasing with increasing <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress.</b> When compared with RBBC and RGOM, the effects of plasticity and mineralogy on clay behavior are readily apparent.

The installation of stone column was simulated by performing lateral expansion at different rates within hollow cylindrical remolded kaolin specimens initially subjected to K 0 consolidation path. These specimens were, then, subjected to classical consolidated undrained triaxial tests while recording excess pore pressure values. The objective of the experimental programme was to quantify the effects of <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> and stone column on the undrained Young's modulus and shear strength of kaolin clay. Obtained results showed a significant improvement in Young's modulus when the cavity expansion ratio and the <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> increase.

40|$|In {{geotechnical}} engineering, soil {{is subject}} to shear stress, as well as normal stress. In many cases, soil is sheared along multiple directions, such as an embankment under earthquake loading and foundation soil of a structure under a complex loading. In recent years, significant research {{has been devoted to}} understanding the static and cyclic shear behaviour of sand under complex stress conditions. To investigate the shear behaviours of soils, a few testing devices have been specifically developed. The most commonly used apparatuses are direct shear, direct simple shear, and hollow cylinder apparatuses. While each has its own merits, they share one common limitation. That is the soil specimens are sheared along only one direction in these devices, making it impossible to study the soil responses under multiple shear stresses encountered in many geotechnical engineering problems. It is widely acknowledged that testing stress path has a significant effect on shear stress, so specimens must be examined under a stress path similar to in-situ. In many cases, a simple shear apparatus closely duplicates the stress conditions in soil elements, and a bi-directional direct simple shear apparatus can create complex stress conditions. To investigate the shear behaviour of soils subject to complex loading conditions, several studies of multidirectional simple shear testing were performed on the first commercially available Variable Direction Dynamic Cyclic Simple Shear (VDDCSS) system. In the VDDCSS, the secondary shear actuator acting at 90 degrees to the primary shear actuator enables it to add shear stress in any horizontal direction. Various previously unexplored complex stress paths were tested in this study using the VDDCSS. Sand samples of Leighton Buzzard sand (Fraction B) were first subjected to <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stresses</b> under drained conditions along different directions (from 0 ° to 180 ° to the X direction of the apparatus), followed by monotonic or cyclic secondary shear stresses along 0 ° until failure occurs. The magnitude and direction of the <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stress</b> on the static and cyclic secondary shear behaviours of sand were systematically studied. In undrained static tests, soil strength was the lowest when the angles between the two shears stresses were near 90 °, and the strength was the highest at 0 °. In addition, a smaller angle produced a more brittle response, and a greater angle led to a more ductile response. The effect of stress path (the direction of <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stresses)</b> was found to be more significant in tests with a greater magnitude of <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stresses,</b> and the relationship between the angles (between the first shear stresses and secondary shear stresses) and shear behaviours was much more complex when the magnitude of <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stresses</b> was increased. In drained static tests, the evidence of non-coaxiality was obtained. The non-coaxiality was the greatest at the initial stage of shearing, and it decreased to zero at higher shear strains. The degree of non-coaxiality was affected by the relative density of the specimen, vertical stress, level and direction of <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stress.</b> In addition, the non-coaxiality was significantly affected by the <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stress,</b> and the effect increased at a greater magnitude of <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stresses.</b> The non-coaxiality increased as the angle was increased. In stress-controlled undrained dynamic tests, {{there was no significant difference}} in pore water generation rate among samples with <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stresses</b> in different directions. However, samples with different directions of <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stresses</b> failed at different numbers of cycles and in different directions. Liquefaction resistance was decreased by the increased magnitude of <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stress.</b> In most of the tests with <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stress,</b> the levels of liquefaction resistances were lower than that without <b>consolidation</b> shear <b>stress.</b> In strain-controlled undrained dynamic tests, liquefaction resistance (shear strength) was decreased from 0 ° to 90 °, and increased from 90 ° to 180 °.

Interparticle adhesion can be largely increased by <b>consolidation</b> <b>stresses</b> applied during powder handling. As a consequence, fragments of the consolidated powder may persist when the powder is fluidized, which gives rise to large agglomerates of strongly adhered particles in fluidization.

40|$|A {{program of}} K[subscript 0]-consolidated {{undrained}} triaxial compression tests has been performed {{to investigate the}} effects of <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> level on the compression and shear behavior of resedimented Boston blue clay (RBBC). Specimens were consolidated to maximum vertical effective stresses in the range 0. 15 – 10 MPa and tested at three overconsolidation ratios (OCR) : 1, 2, and 4. The {{results show that the}} virgin compression curves are essentially linear in e–log σ[' over v] space over the <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> range.

At high pressures, the undrained shear stress–strain behavior becomes more ductile, requiring larger strains to mobilize peak resistance and exhibiting less post-peak strain-softening. The undrained strength ratio (s[subscript u]/σ[' over vc]) is not uniquely controlled by OCR as suggested by the SHANSEP equation, but consistently decreases with increasing consolidation effective stress.

Torrefaction is a pre-treatment step of the gasification process that improves the physical characteristics of biomass by making it more coal-like.

In this study, we investigated the effect of particle size and shape distribution on flow properties (unconfined yield stress and flowability factor) of powder from raw and torrefied biomass (Picea abies). Several intensities of torrefaction were tested, and its extent was quantified by the global mass loss, chosen as synthetic indicator of torrefaction intensity (its accounts for both the temperature level and the residence time).

Although residual soil is commonly encountered during constructions in the tropical region, studies on its engineering properties are far from adequate. There is a lack of in-depth study to characterize the strength and deformation behaviour of intact residual soils in Singapore, especially under more representative testing conditions such as plane-strain conditions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{intercept}} of the log(1 +e) - logσv' {{straight line}} is introduced {{to describe the}} effect of the starting point on the compressibility of natural and reconstituted clays. It is found that when the effective stress exceeds the remoulded yield stress, the compression behaviour of reconstituted clays is controlled solely by the water content at the remoulded yield stress and the liquid limit. Comparison of the compression behaviour of natural and reconstituted clays indicates that their difference in compressibility is caused by soil structure and the difference in water content at the compression starting point. The compression behaviour of natural clays can be classified into three regimes: 1) the pre-yield regime characterised by small compressibility with soil structure restraining the deformation up to the consolidation yield stress; 2) the transitional regime characterised by a gradual loss of soil structure when the effective stress is between the <b>consolidation</b> yield <b>stress</b> and the transitional stress; and 3) the post-transitional regime characterised by the same change law in compression behaviour as reconstituted clays when the effective stress is higher than the transitional stress. For the investigated clays, the transitional stress is 1. 0 - 3. 5 times the <b>consolidation</b> yield <b>stress.</b> The compression index varies solely with the void ratio at an effective stress of 1. 0 kPa for both natural clays in post-transitional regime and reconstituted clays when the effective stress exceeds the remoulded yield stress, and when compressed in such cases the compression curves of both natural clays and reconstituted clays can be normalised well to a unique line using the void index...|$|R

Discussion is then directedt o the evaluationo f the consolidations tressesa cting in both in both the cylinder and hopper sectionsd uring both initial and flow conditions. Here the vast difference, especially in vicinity of the bin outlet, between the initial or filling and flow conditions is highlighted. This vast difference has major design and operation implications. A further major implication is that all bulk solids must dilate to flow. The opportunity to simultaneously attain reliable discharge and partial moisture removal is also examined. The selection of design parameters to maximise the <b>consolidation</b> <b>stresses</b> in both the cylindrical and hopper sections is detailed. In regard to the latter, it is recommended fine coal bins be discharged using low friction lined transition hoppers with large outlet spans. Such outlets will discharge fine coal in a relatively compacted state. This compaction state should exhibit minimum water retention and short term moisture uptake. The multiphase attributes of fiDe damp coal flow is then considered. Here is it noted, {{as a consequence of}} the dilation in the hopper negative or suction interstitial fluid pressures form. It is noted such pressures generate an adverse pressure gradient which significantly retards the discharge. One technique to conveniently eliminate the adverse pressure gradient is to install low pressure high volume air sparging to the hopper. It is suggested this air sparging will have the added benefit of effecting partial moisture reduction. This technique should prove far more reliable than post feeder compaction using relatively complex mechanical systems...|$|R

Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the experimental apparatus. The model piles are a polyvinyl chloride pipe and a mortar bar, 3. 2 cm in diameter. The relations between negative friction and <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> are obtained by measurement of the point resistance. From these results, we obtain {{the fact that the}} application of Broms's equation for the calculation of the negative friction is most adcquate...|$|E

Design equations for mass-flow are presented in which the variation in bulk density with major <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> and variation in wall friction with normal wall pressure taken into account. The solution of these equations provides the means of determining the distribution of vertical and major consolidation stresses throughout silos of specified geometry. The use of mass-flow hopper inserts to limit, for process requirements, consolidation stresses and bulk density and improving air permeation is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of semi arid residual soils {{derived from}} the weathering of Johannesburg quartzite are difficult to predict because of their heterogeneous particle constitution and weakly bonded structure. The collapse behaviour of undisturbed and remoulded weathered Johannesburg quartzite was investigated; and {{the reliability of the}} collapse settlement data was also evaluated. The results showed that a combination of low initial saturation of 13 % and <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> of 200 kPa result in the greatest collapse and that in order to avoid collapse, at any stress range, the soil must be compacted at a degree of saturation higher than 26 %. The effect of desiccation on the magnitude of collapse settlement is dependent on the fines content and clay minerals. The collapse settlement of the undisturbed and remoulded quartzite was more sensitive to changes in dry density than changes in moisture content. Statistical analysis of collapse settlement test data of 15 undisturbed and remolded samples inundated at <b>consolidation</b> <b>stress</b> of 200 kPa revealed a mean, covariance and 95. 5 % reliability of 4. 75 %, 13. 65 ± 1. 477 % for undisturbed samples and 6. 82 %, 7. 57 ± 1. 17 % for remolded samples. The implications are that the higher values of collapse settlement associated with remolded samples should be recommended for geotechnical design...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted on the static liquefaction behaviour of very loose lightly cemented sands. Undrained and drained triaxial compression tests, one dimensional <b>consolidation,</b> high <b>stress</b> compression, and unconfined compression tests were performed on artificially prepared lightly cemented loose samples with cement-sand ratios of 2, 4 and 6 %. Additional tests were also conducted on uncemented samples prepared at the same initial void ratio as the cemented samples. Besides the influence of degree of cementation, the effects of void ratio and confining pressure on the liquefaction potential of cemented sands were examined. The aim {{of this study is to}} make significant contribution to the understanding of static liquefaction failures in lightly cemented sands. It is shown that cementation could increase the initial stiffness and yield strength of cemented sands but its effect might decrease considerably after the peak strength because of destruction of the cementation bond. The response of cemented sands at lower cement contents was very similar to the response of loose sands and behaviour approached the response of medium to dense sands with increase in the degree of cementation. It is also shown that degree of cementation has a significant influence on liquefaction resistance. Even though the presence of small amounts of cementation did not prevent liquefaction failure, the liquefaction resistance of cemented sands generally increased for higher degrees of cementation. The <b>consolidation,</b> high <b>stress</b> compression and unconfined compression tests demonstrated the effect of cementation in increasing both the stiffness and strength of cemented sands. The unconfined compression strength increased approximately linearly with the increase in cement content. The rate of strength gain increased with an increase in the dry density of the compacted sample, indicating that the cementation was more for denser samples...|$|R
