In a document dated 1147 the toponym is spelt Chiselentona. Chislehampton came into use later in the same century and was still in use in 1974. A document dated 1517 calls the village Chessyllyngton.

In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{under what conditions}} is a mapping f of a semigroup S into the class of cardinals representable by a groupoid G and a homomorphism g of G onto S such that ker(g) is the associativity congruence of G and Card(g− 1 (x)) = f(x) for every x ∈ S. Abstrakt. V tomto článku vyˇsetˇrujeme, za jak´ych podmínek lze zobrazení f pologrupy S do tˇrídy vˇsech kardinálních <b>čísel</b> reprezentovat grupoidem G a zobrazením g: G → S tak, ˇze f(G) = S, ker(g) je kongruence asociativity grupoidu G a Card(g− 1 (x)) = f(x) pro vˇsechna x ∈ S. For a groupoid G, we denote by sG the least congruence of G such that the corresponding factor of G is a semigroup. Clearly, sG is just the congruence of G generated by the pairs (xy. z,x. yz) with x,y,z ∈ G arbitrary. Let S be a semigroup. By a cardinal function on S we mean a mapping of...|$|E
