Several variants of gun and <b>carriage</b> were proposed until on 15 December {{a combination of}} the T10 gun and T5 <b>carriage</b> was officially adopted as the 37mm Gun M3 and <b>Carriage</b> M4. Although the weapon followed the concept of the PaK 36 and was often referred to as a copy of it, the M3 differed significantly from the German design and used different ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Wartime Mikkeli is {{identified}} with Marshal Mannerheim, {{the commander of}} the Finnish army and later President of Finland. His personal railway <b>carriage,</b> which he used as a command post during the war, is parked in a siding at Mikkeli station. It is possible to look inside the <b>carriage</b> through its windows at any time. But public entry to the <b>carriage</b> is only permitted once a year, on Mannerheim's birthday (June 4). The <b>carriage</b> was the venue of Mannerheim's famous 1942 meeting (near Immola) with Hitler, on which occasion a private conversation between the two men was secretly recorded. Photographs of this meeting are on display in the <b>carriage.</b> Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E

5|$|Another of the property's buildings, {{commonly}} called the <b>carriage</b> house, never {{lived up to}} its popular name. The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles. The southern section of the <b>carriage</b> house was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1912 and features a mansard roof. The building is sheathed in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs as well as a barbed wire history museum.|$|E
5|$|Balch {{conducted}} {{many of his}} excavations {{in conjunction}} with the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society; he is credited with being the first to explore many of the caves in the area, the most famous being the Wookey Hole Caves. Balch kept a base at Rookham for his longer excavations, he bought a railway <b>carriage</b> in a field near Rookham from his friend, the headmaster at the Blue School. Balch called the 26 foot long <b>carriage</b> his 'Summer Palace' and modified it to form part of a bungalow. Balch's family would continue to use the <b>carriage</b> for summer holidays after Balch's death.|$|E

25|$|<b>Carriages</b> are the SW class, rebuilt British Rail Mark 2 <b>carriages</b> {{introduced}} in 2007 {{to replace the}} NZR 56-foot <b>carriages</b> used since the service's introduction, {{some of which were}} 70 years old. Eighteen <b>carriages</b> are used – twelve SW with 64 seats; three SWS with 37 seats, wheelchair hoist and disabled toilet; and three SWG with 37 seats, luggage compartment and generator. The <b>carriages</b> are formed into three sets of between three and eight <b>carriages,</b> consisting of (from the Masterton end of train) an SWG, an SW, an SWS, and then the remaining SW <b>carriages.</b> Because of the short platforms at Renall Street, Solway, Matarawa and Maymorn stations, selective door operation is employed and passengers are asked to alight from the three northernmost (Masterton-end) <b>carriages.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107), the Chamberlain Wu Deren {{presented}} specifications of the south-pointing <b>carriage</b> and the <b>carriage</b> with the li-recording drum (odometer).

5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by <b>carriage</b> wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill {{mentioned}} above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a <b>carriage,</b> its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the <b>carriage</b> forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long <b>carriage</b> that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the <b>carriage</b> halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carriages</b> were {{connected}} by semi-permanent drawbars, {{except for the}} driving ends of motor <b>carriages,</b> and one end of BT <b>carriages,</b> which were provided with automatic couplers.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 and 1971, six new trailer <b>carriages</b> {{were built}} as prototypes {{for the next}} fleet (the Hitachi trains). These <b>carriages</b> were 75 ft long, {{compared}} to 63 ft of the earlier <b>carriages,</b> and were equipped with the mechanisms for power-closing doors, the first such use in Melbourne. However, {{it was not until}} the following year that a complete (4-carriage) train was used this way, after conversion of some motor <b>carriages.</b> These <b>carriages</b> were converted into H type <b>carriages,</b> for use in LH sets with V/Line, in the mid 1980s.|$|R

5|$|With through running {{between the}} lines in place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original passenger <b>carriage</b> began as a horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The passenger <b>carriage</b> from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger <b>carriage.</b> As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR <b>carriage.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay from the fire to a rail <b>carriage</b> with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire <b>carriage</b> from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E

5|$|After the 1899 {{transfer}} {{of services to}} the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger <b>carriage</b> on the line; unlike other stations on the line, the platform height at Wood Siding was not raised {{at this time to}} accommodate the new <b>carriage.</b> From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 {{transfer of}} services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935.|$|E
