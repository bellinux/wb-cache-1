We investigate the effect on small business finance of an alternative <b>contractual</b> <b>scheme</b> based on group lending, the Mutual Guarantee Institution (MGI).

Hence, MGI willingness to post collateral signals firms credit-worthiness to banks. Our estimates indicate that indeed MGI affiliation improves small firms lending. ...|$|E
30|$|Public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) is a <b>contractual</b> <b>scheme</b> {{under which}} public sector and private firms cooperate and share risks and profits to construct infrastructure projects, or provide public products and services. Due {{to the potential}} contribution to reduced transaction costs, innovation, continuous exploitation of a learning curve, the re-focusing of government on its core tasks, and the enabling of large infrastructure investments, PPP has been widely applied in projects of transport infrastructure such as roads, rails, airports, seaports, waterways, etc. (Cruz and Marques 2013 a; Siemiatycki 2011). Moreover, the recent liberalization in transport sector and global economic crisis are favoring the implementation of transport projects through the PPP model (Tsamboulas et al. 2013). In fact, there are many successful cases such as the “Subway plus Property” model and “Landlord Port” model.|$|E

First of all, this paper investigates the legal issues associated to cloud computing, specific <b>contractual</b> <b>scheme</b> that is able to define rights a duties both of user (private and/or public body) and cloud provider.

Indeed the Italian legal system is particularly adaptable to changing technologies and it could use as better as possible to adapt the already existing legal tools to this new technological era.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of a {{knowledge}} based economy, a growing part of the processes of knowledge production and knowledge diffusion are hold by so-called communities of practice. Communities, by providing intangible spaces triggering the sharing of information and knowledge, play a paramount role in collective learning processes. Those communities may be broadly defined as specific social interaction structures aiming at the production and the diffusion of knowledge. More precisely, they correspond to groups of people engaged in a common practice and frequently interacting {{in order to develop}} their competences. Due to the absence of any <b>contractual</b> <b>scheme,</b> one of the defining traits of communities of practice lies in the ability of the members to determine their specialization trajectories in a decentralized manner. To put it differently, they enjoy the ability to determine the extent and the nature of their contribution to the growth of the common practice. However, such a freedom left to the agents may raise some issues concerning the efficiency of this system. From the incentives point of view, the absence of any <b>contractual</b> <b>scheme</b> may give the agents the opportunity to engage in opportunistic behaviors, giving rise to a problem of prisoner dilemma. Moreover, the absence of any clear-cut division of labour may imply two possibilities: either the agents engage in too different tasks which may hinder the overall coherence of the common practice. Or the individuals engage in similar activities, leading to problems of redundancies in the common practice. The goal of this thesis is to isolate some of the mechanisms governing the coordination of agents within communities of practice. It is proposed that coordination is supported by the emergence of individuals enjoying a specific status within the community: communitarian leaders. Leadership is here defined as the ability to influence individual behaviors through an influence exercises on information and knowledge flows. This is due to the adoption by community leaders of a central position within the community. The leaders’ ability to control knowledge flows arises out of the conjunction of two complementary features. First, the ability to constrain communication flows, which arises out of their ability to take on the role of mediators and to link distant parts of the community. This ability allows leaders to enhance the coherence of the common knowledge base by filtering communication flows. Second, due to their ability to accumulate relationships {{with other members of the}} community, leaders enjoy an enhanced access to information and knowledge. Knowing this, community members assume that leaders are facing lower levels of uncertainty, implying that they are able to take more adequate decisions. Community leaders are likely to be subject to mimesis behaviors. Leadership constitutes an emergent phenomenon in the sense that it arises out of a process of selforganization. The conjunction of reputation and trust comes in support of the community leaders’ specific status. Reputation is here defined as a set of information concerning constant and recurring evidences of an individual’s past behavior. Those information are shared among community members. Reputation, by reducing the uncertainty associated with an individual’s behaviour during a first interaction, eases its occurrence. Individuals endowed with high reputation levels benefit from a higher number of acquaintances within the community. This allows them to acquire a central position in the community. Trust complements reputation in {{the frame of}} recurrent interactions among two partners. Trust corresponds to the expectation of a cooperative behavior and relies on the accumulation of knowledge arising out of preceding interactions. A strong relationship binds reputation and trust: while reputation constitutes a necessary condition for a first interaction to occur, trust allows perpetuating it...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the spatial aspects of {{oil and natural gas}} production to investigate the extent and effects of inefficient and unnecessary spatial competition. Because oil and natural gas are migratory, operators can cause hydrocarbon resources to flow from a neighboring property onto his or her own through rapid extraction. This problem is compounded when productive leases are comparatively small, {{as is the case in}} Texas. Following an introduction and literature review, the third chapter takes advantage of a natural experiment to demonstrate how spillovers in production limit total cumulative recovery, and how the assignment of secure property rights can enhance economic outcomes. The chapter examines production from wells in Oklahoma and Texas near the panhandle border. While wells on either side of this line have similar geologies and so should be similarly productive they are exposed to different treatments: Oklahoma has a much higher rate of unitization (a <b>contractual</b> <b>scheme</b> where competing owners hire a common operator and share profits), whereas the unitization rate in Texas is lower. Using regression discontinuity design, I find that Oklahoma wells are produced more slowly early on, and that this results in greater cumulative recovery over the course of a well’s life (150 % more relative to Texas). These results are robust after controlling for reservoir specific effects, and across parametric, semi-parametric and nonparametric specifications. xiiThe fourth chapter quantifies the degree to which competing owners interfere with each other’s production through spatial spillovers. I use a spatial econometric model that controls for spatial autocorrelation and spatial dependence and can therefore identify the spillovers in production. Additionally, by comparing leases owned by competing producers to leases owned by a common producer, I show empirically how securing property rights through common ownership can alleviate the externality in production. A priori, one would expect that when a common producer owns adjacent leases, the producer has the incentive to fully account for how spillovers in production affect neighboring wells. Conversely, when adjacent landowners are in competition to extract the resource, they will not account for the damage rapid production causes at neighboring wells. After controlling for secondary injection I find that this is indeed the case for Slaughter field of West Texas. The fifth chapter investigates the statistical properties of oil and natural gas production. I find striking evidence that both oil and natural gas production are power-law distributed with the exponent approximately equal to one. This distribution might arise from disequilibrium in production and exploration. Highlighting this distribution is important because it has potential consequences for the political economy of regulation as well as for resource management. For example, because the most productive wells lie in the far-right tail of the distribution, regulation geared to prevent a Deepwater Horizon scale spill need fall on a vanishingly small percent of wells. The distribution also has consequences for management because a company profitability depends disproportionately on how it manages its most productive wells. The sixth chapter provides a short conclusion...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>contractual</b> <b>schemes</b> which an unin-formed {{principal}} can o¤er to an informed agent {{when they can}} share {{the rights to the}} output they jointly produce. The innovation I intro-duce is the possibility to write a contract which relates the allocation of rights to the agents announcement, thus using this instrument to construct a revelation mechanism. I study this problem building on Khalil and Lawarrée (1995), relating the choice of allocating rights to the variable which is used to construct a contractual performance, the input or the output. The most important result of the paper is that, under reasonable conditions, the informational asymmetries between the parties have no practical importance and the principal is able to extract the full surplus from the agent. This result holds under input observation. When the output is observed the distribution of rights is instead irrelevant. Hence input monitoring always dominates output monitoring...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the case law and the {{legislative}} activity concerning electronic platforms have taken off considerably in Italy. Relevant problems and questions continue to arise not only concerning private law issues, but also regarding competition and public law, {{as well as several}} aspects of administrative law and tax regulation. In particular, if on the one hand in recent years Italian courts have been dealing with electronic platforms prevalently in a business-to-business perspective – mainly by analysing competition, administrative and tax law issues – on the other hand the Italian Competition Authority (hereinafter: AGCM) and administrative judges set a specific focus on business-to-consumer relationships. They carry out a fairness control of the behaviour of platforms that convey misleading information to consumers, created by other individuals or entities. In this context, an analysis of the activity of the AGCM {{as well as of the}} administrative courts concerning the liability of rating websites, with specific regard to Tripadvisor, reveals several interesting aspects. Particularly remarkable in a systematic perspective is the circumstance that both the AGCM and the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale per il Lazio (hereinafter: TAR) qualified Tripadvisor as a ‘trader’ according to Art 18, Para 1, lett b), Codice del consumo, which implements Art 2, Para 1, lett b) of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (hereinafter: UCP Directive), rather than as a service provider acting as a host in the sense of Directive 2000 / 31 /EC (hereinafter: E-Commerce Directive), as was alleged by the online platform. Most recently, in 2015 a debate arose concerning the platform Uber and in particular UberPop, services which also gave rise to a number of court claims in Italy. Uber has actually been the subject matter of significant case law, as well as legislative activity. Concerning these issues, in particular the AGCM as well as – most recently – the Consiglio di Stato showed to be strongly in favour of the introduction of a comprehensive regulation dealing with the platform service provided by Uber. It is therefore interesting to examine the Italian experience with this topic. An examination of relevant issues could also be useful in order to better understand the elements of the preliminary ruling proceedings pending before the European Court of Justice (CJEU). In the context of the cases here described, Italian courts dealt also with contract law issues, trying to answer to the question if Uber should be considered an intermediary, one of the contractual parties in a multilateral contract, or the counterparty (respectively of the driver and of the customer) of two distinct contracts. In this regard, in a position paper published on 29 th September 2015, the Italian competition authority AGCM—also taking into consideration the request for a preliminary ruling recently submitted to the European Court of Justice in the case of Uber System Spain—classified an agreement concluded by means of the app UberPop as an electronic intermediary service or an information society service, as defined by Art 1, para 2 of Directive 98 / 34 /EC on Information Society services, rather than as a ‘transport contract’. Most recently, in an opinion of the 23 rd December 2015, the Consiglio di Stato tried to properly qualify the ‘new’ contractual relationships arising from the Uber platform and other, similar platforms offering taxi services. In the opinion of the highest Italian administrative court, these ‘new’ contractual relationships are fundamentally different from those currently regulated under existing law. Indeed, Uber and similar platforms do not merely offer a transport service but also further ‘innovative complementary services’, which sensibly modify the <b>contractual</b> <b>scheme.</b> This contribution discusses therefore the Italian case law concerning online platforms, the legislative activities in this area and the further debate on this topic. It concludes with some thoughts on whether the existing Italian law is able to provide adequate solutions to the current challenges concerning online platforms...|$|E

40|$|The {{contracts}} {{of commercial}} distribution are indispensable legal instruments {{to the development}} of the economic activity. The distribution, since the industrial revolution, acquired autonomy, given the necessity of specialized intermediation to distribute good and products. In this process, the structural organization of the distribution process suffered mutations, starting to assume a set of activities aiming at adjusting demand to supply, including, among others, clients canvassing, after-sales services, financing and assumption of risks, advisory services, promotion and advertising. The insufficiency of traditional contracts of purchase and sales and commission to satisfy the distributive needs caused by the industrial revolution will justify the development of new <b>contractual</b> <b>schemes,</b> such us agency contract, commercial concession and franchising. The obligation of the distributer to ensure the interests of the producer and to promote the distribution of the goods and services of the producer, in the context of a lasting relation of cooperation between the parts, through which the distributer is incorporated, with greater or minor intensity, in the producer distribution network, allowed us to sustain, as affirmed in the Portuguese and European literature, that distribution contracts could be framed in the same legal category. These contracts, as contracts that were shaped by praxis, do not have, with exception of agency contract, a legal framework in Portugal and Spain. It has been discussed in literature if agency contract legal framework can be applied, by analogy, to the contracts that fit in the legal category of distribution contracts. This paper aims at analyzing the legal framework of contracts of distribution in these legal systems, with the purpose to discuss the analogical application of the agency contract to these contracts. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} personal pensions (exempt unit trusts) in the UK 1980 - 2000. Unitised personal pension schemes are a type of mutual fund that is constituted as a <b>contractual</b> savings <b>scheme,</b> whose value can only be accessed at retirement. By studying the performance of these schemes {{we are able to}} assess the role of illiquidity in retail savings products. The paper examines those personal pension schemes that invest predominantly in UK equities, and first reports on the growth in personal pension schemes over this twenty-year period. The paper then assesses the performance of these pension funds relative to various asset pricing benchmarks, including a four factor benchmark that allows for momentum in stock returns, and allowing for market timing and conditioning on macroeconomic variables, and finds that average performance is not significantly different from zero. The paper goes on to examine persistence in performance of these pension schemes and identifies negative persistence at short horizons, but at time-intervals of six months to one year finds significant positive persistence, though this positive persistence weakens at longer time intervals. ...|$|R

40|$|Activist {{hedge funds}} have {{transformed}} how bondholders respond to violations of their contractual rights. Insurance companies and mutual funds, the traditional investors in bonds, often slept on {{their rights and}} turned active only little and late. Hedge funds, by contrast, seek out opportunities for activism {{in order to make}} profits. In the wake of their activism, hedge funds have not only benefitted themselves, but their fellow bondholders as well. Alas, the remedy scheme for violations of bondholders rights - in particular, the centrality of the acceleration remedy - introduces its own set of imperfections. When treasury interest rates have increased or the stock price of a company that has issued convertible bonds has declined, acceleration generates a windfall: bondholders receive compensation in excess of the harm associated with the violation. In these cases, activists will spend excessive resources in detecting and pursuing potential claims and companies have excessive incentives to stave off potential violations. When treasury rates have declined, the tables are turned, and bondholder rights are underenforced. Whether this selective enforcement has generated aggregate benefits for bondholders and companies in the short term is unclear. Over the long term, however, the market will adjust to hedge fund activism by changing other terms in corporate bond indentures. In particular, we suggest that the <b>contractual</b> remedy <b>scheme</b> be revised by giving companies an expanded defeasance option and offering bondholders a make-whole premium upon acceleration, which would reduce, respectively, the incentives for overenforcement and underenforcement...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims {{to provide}} a legal {{analysis}} of project finance, examining profiles and civil problems arising from the legal instrument, also through comparative insights. In particular, the paper develops in three directions: (i) analysis of the overall phenomenon, in public contracts area {{as well as in}} the private contracts context; (ii) examination of the aforesaid theoretical framework as a whole; (iii) the existence of a legal obligation to renegotiate between the parties themselves. As regards the first issue after a brief reconstruction of the economic phenomenon and the analysis of the essential features of the project finance, the unity of the purpose of the contract was emphasized, arguing that its application in public or private contexts does not alter the nature of the contract itself that remains, therefore, the same. And in fact, the rules contained in the Italian Public Contract Code concerning the project financing cannot be considered neither as a discipline of the legal instrument nor as the discipline of the legal relations existing between the parties; rather the abovementioned rules should be considered as an adaptation of the funding model to the specific needs of the public sector. Therefore, the validity of a general unique scheme is not altered: it is therefore characterized by the presence of specific elements in both areas, public and private: this being true, the legal issues raised by the legal instruments of private and public project finance have been jointly dealt with. As for the second issue, after investigated the relationships existing among the stakeholders of the project finance, the thesis sustained is that the most convincing qualification of the legal tool supporting the economic operation should described as a unique multilateral contract with common purpose, thus rejecting the more common qualification as ‘connected contract’. Once the distinction between ‘connected contracts’ and a unique multilateral contract with common purpose has been imputed to the existence of a unitary consideration, it has been argued that in the project finance the unitary consideration consists in splitting the risk of the project among the involved parties to the contract. This thesis seems confirmed by the special operational guarantees asset, as well as by the conditioning mechanism by which the loan agreement is subject to the existence of construction building, management, supply and sales contracts, while in turn, the abovementioned contracts are subject to the condition precedent consisting in the fulfillment of the loan contract. More precisely: evidence of the common purpose is given by the existence of a common interest of all the stakeholders of the economic operation. A first commonality can be perceived among SPV and lenders, through a parallelism with the Italian agriculture associative agreements and their corresponding institutions in Islamic finance. A second commonality can be highlighted among SPV and the other “satellite” participants, thus assuming a compatibility between exchange contracts and associated contracts, as noted by some academics in the area of network contracts. Consequently, art. 1420 of the Italian civil code would apply, thus avoiding the implications of the principle simul stabunt simul cadent applied to ‘connected contracts’. In other words: the interest of the parties to the fulfillment of the project is, in fact, confirmed by the systematic presence of a specific contractual clause, defined as “terms of survival of the project”. In relation to the third and final point, project finance proves to be an elective ground for renegotiation as appropriate remedy. The legal obligation - now expressly regulated in the German, Dutch and Greek Civil Code as well as implicitly subsisting in the U. S. system - proves to be accepted in the Italian legal system, where it is based on the principle of good faith in the performance of the contract, as interpreted in the light of solidarity constitutional values ?? protected by art. 2 of the Italian Constitution. Additionally, the unified framework of project finance would be consistent with the need to overcome the logic of relativity of contractual fragments, as demonstrated both by the English academic debate now reflecting on the role of sanctity of contract and on the concept of connected contracts, and by the French experience in the area of contractual ‘indivisibilté’. Not every relationship established between the parties is contractual stricto sensu, since there are bilateral agreements: nevertheless, the close “organisational relation” generated leads to reflect on the opportunity to allow an extension of limitation or exclusion liability objections also between the parties of the global operation not linked themselves by a contract and to conclude that there is a responsibility among them that exceed the forms of non-contractual liability. The observations proposed hereabove would lead to a reinterpretation of the borderline between the two legal instruments, ‘connected contracts’ and multilateral contracts, thus leading to the conclusion that there is a legal obligation to renegotiate in both <b>contractual</b> <b>schemes,</b> as both can be defined as relational contracts...|$|R
40|$|Although {{active ageing}} policy and {{practice}} vary between countries, we believe that knowledge {{about the effects of}} Norwegian companies’ initiatives to delay early retirement is of interest for all countries striving to increase the employment rates of older workers. Since the agreement on a more inclusive working life (IW agreement) was signed in 2001, the Norwegian government and social partners have encouraged companies to develop a more senior-friendly policy and implement special measures to retain older workers. In this article, we evaluate the effects of such measures. Our research question is, have preventive measures offered by companies to employees aged 62 years and older contributed to reduced rates of early retirement? We use a ‘difference-in-differences’ approach and examine whether measures at the company level to counteract early retirement actually affect older employees’ retirement decisions, controlling for different individual and enterprise factors. This is done by comparing changes and differences in the individual likelihood of early retirement on the <b>contractual</b> pension (AFP <b>scheme)</b> and disability pension in the period 2002 – 2007 among employees 62 years of age in businesses with and without the corresponding preventive measures/instruments. The analyses show that the likelihood that a 62 -year-old worker will retire on the AFP scheme has increased from 2002 to 2007. This applies equally to 62 -year-old employees in enterprises that have enacted special measures to retain older workers as well as 62 -year-olds in enterprises that have not enacted any such measures. On the other hand, the likelihood that a 62 -year-old worker will retire because of disability decreased from 2002 to 2007, among employees in both the intervention enterprises and the control enterprises. However, when controlling for other relevant characteristics of individuals and enterprises, the analysis indicates that the measures as such have had no effect on the likelihood of 62 -year-olds retiring...|$|R
40|$|Faced with {{a rapidly}} aging labor force, {{increasing}} the labor supply of older workers {{has become an}} important goal for European countries. Offering additional leave to older workers with the option of withdrawing a contractual pension (contractual early retirement pension AFP) has become a widespread retention measure in Norwegian companies. Thus far, no studies documenting the effects of individual retention measures on early retirement behavior have been published. The aim {{of this article is}} to examine whether offering additional leave impacts the relative risk of withdrawal of a contractual pension. The analysis uses a difference-in-differences approach and examines whether offering additional leave to counteract early retirement impacts the retirement decisions of 61 - and 62 -year-olds within the next two years of their employment, controlling for a range of different individual and company characteristics. This is achieved by comparing changes and differences in the individual relative risk of retiring early on the <b>contractual</b> pension (AFP <b>scheme)</b> in the period 2001 – 2010 among older workers in companies with and without the retention measure. The analysis shows an overall average increase in the relative risk of a 61 - or 62 -year-old worker retiring on the contractual pension between 2001 and 2010; however, among older workers employed in companies offering additional leave there has been a decrease in the relative risk. The effect of additional leave is evident both before and after controlling for the selected individual and company characteristics. Thus, the analysis shows that offering additional leave as a retention measure reduces the individual relative risk of withdrawing a contractual pension (AFP) in the next two years of employment among older workers between the age of 61 and 62 years...|$|R
40|$|Background There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} both nationally and internationally in socioeconomic health inequalities since the mid- 1990 s. Even though the Norwegian welfare state {{is based on an}} egalitarian ideology characterized by universalism and a redistributive social security system, health inequalities are still of considerable magnitude. Generally, the higher we get on the social ladder, the better is our health. The health difference between those in more or less favourable socioeconomic positions might be expected to be the same in women and men, with successive improvements in health with more advantageous positions. However, it has been historically assumed that health inequalities are less pronounced among women relative to men, an assumption largely based on studies of total mortality. This assumption has at least partly been attributed to challenges in the measurement of socioeconomic position among women. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether there were smaller socioeconomic inequalities in women than men for health-related aspects other than mortality. This was done by studying 1) the associations between selected indicators of adolescents’ health-related dietary habits and parental socio-economic position (education, social class, and income), 2) trends in absolute and relative educational inequalities in four modifiable ischaemic heart disease risk factors over the last three decades among Norwegian middle-aged women and men, 3) educational inequalities in disability pensioning in Norwegian women and men, and 4) education-based health inequalities from the perspective of couples. Material and methods The papers in this thesis were based on data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and national registry data on families/households, education, income, disability pension, the <b>contractual</b> pension <b>scheme,</b> and death. The data were linked by the unique 11 -digit identity number which is given to Norwegian citizens at birth. All research was performed with files where the personal identification numbers were removed. Several methods were utilized throughout the four papers. Paper I deals with the socioeconomic gradient in adolescents’ health related dietary habits. Data from the Young HUNT study (1995 - 97) provided an opportunity to classify self-reported dietary habits in adolescents by four dimensions: daily intake of candy, soft drinks, fruits and vegetables versus no daily intake. As measures of socioeconomic position, maternal and paternal education, occupational class and income were used. The cross-sectional data analyses were performed using cross-tables and binary logistic regression, with separate models for girls and boys. In Paper II, trends in educational inequalities in four modifiable risk factors for ischaemic heart disease (smoking, diabetes, hypertension and high total cholesterol) over the three HUNT studies—HUNT 1 (1984 - 1986), HUNT 2 (1995 - 1997) and HUNT 3 (2006 - 2008) — were approached. The age standardized prevalence of the IHD risk factors were calculated using 5 year age groups, with separate models for women and men. To measure the magnitude of relative and absolute educational inequalities in the IHD risk factors, the relative index of inequality (RII) and the slope index of inequality (SII) were calculated. Paper III deals with educational gradients in disability pensioning in women and men. The baseline data consisted of adults without disability pensions and in paid work, defined as the population at risk for disability pensioning. Information on the occurrence of disability pensions was obtained from national registries up to 2008. Additional analyses were made for housewives and unemployed/laid-off persons. Data analyses were performed using Cox regression with the opportunity to consider potential mediating factors. In Paper IV, cross-sectional analyses were performed with two-level linear random effect regression models to study educational inequalities in subjective health, anxiety, and depression scores in about 18, 000 couples from HUNT 2 (1995 - 97). The couple mean education and the deviation from the couple mean education was considered an appropriate model specification, one that was sensitive to the clustered or non-independent nature of the data. Results Studies presented in Paper I showed that girls reported healthier dietary habits than the boys. Considerable gradients in the adolescents’ dietary habits, both in girls and boys, were also found. This was particularly true when maternal education was used as an indicator of socioeconomic position. Parental income showed virtually no association with adolescents’ health related dietary habits. Paper II showed a decrease in the prevalence of hypertension and high total cholesterol, and an increase in the prevalence of diabetes in all education groups over the last three decades. The prevalence of smoking increased among women, mostly among the lower educated from HUNT 1 to HUNT 3. The smoking prevalence decreased in men, mostly among those with tertiary education. The absolute and relative inequalities in smoking increased in both genders from HUNT 1 to HUNT 3, while the absolute inequalities were larger in women relative to men in HUNT 2 and HUNT 3. The relative inequalities in hypertension were larger in women than men through all HUNT surveys, while absolute inequalities were larger in women than in men in HUNT 1 and 2. For high total cholesterol, there were larger relative and absolute inequalities in women than men in HUNT 2 and HUNT 3 (information on total cholesterol was not available from HUNT 1). There were no significant gender differences in the size of inequalities for diabetes. Paper III showed a higher incidence proportion of disability pensioning in women than men and considerable educational inequalities. The gradients in the youngest women and men (25 - 49 years) were quite similar, but there were small inequalities in the oldest women in paid work and non-existing inequalities in the oldest housewives and unemployed/laid-off women. We found considerable couple clustering of education, self-perceived health, anxiety, and depression scores in Paper IV. Smaller educational health differences within couples than between couples suggest that socioeconomy, as measured by education, represents a couple level variable as well as an individual characteristic. Conclusions For the health related aspects studied, clear gradients were found also in girls and women. For smoking, hypertension, and high total cholesterol, educational inequalities were stronger for women than for men. For disability pension, however, there was virtually no educational gradient among the oldest women in the particular time period studied. There is still a need to refine measures of socioeconomic position and health inequalities. Studies comparing health inequalities in women and men rarely consider the most immediate social context for many persons: the couple. In the last paper, it is suggested that couples form their socioeconomic position together. This expanded perspective on social inequalities in health may prove fruitful in further research, as well as in relation to the gender puzzle of the mortality gradients. The couple analysis is limited to subjective health, anxiety, and depression. This is the first study to assess within and between couple educational differences in health, and a similar approach prospectively investigating the incidence of both morbidity and mortality health outcomes might shed further light on this topic.
