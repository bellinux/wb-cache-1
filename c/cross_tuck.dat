60|$|If {{you look}} at the telegraph-map of India you will see a long line {{skirting}} the coast from Backergunge to Madras. Michele was ordered to Tibasu, a little Sub-office one-third down this line, to send messages on from Berhampur to Chicacola, and to think of Miss Vezzis and his chances of getting fifty rupees a month out of office hours. He had the noise of the Bay of Bengal and a Bengali Babu for company; nothing more. He sent foolish letters, with <b>crosses</b> <b>tucked</b> inside the flaps of the envelopes, to Miss Vezzis.|$|R
5000|$|Cross {{over the}} immobilized {{other end of}} the rope, then <b>cross</b> back <b>tucking</b> under both turns, (option 2 : this last tuck with a bight instead of the end as an end-side-slip for the final knot).|$|R
5000|$|Cross {{over the}} immobilized {{other end of}} the rope, then <b>cross</b> back <b>tucking</b> under the <b>crossing</b> point of step 3.2 (of the immobilized other end, and the part between the two turns), (option 2 : this last tuck with a bight instead of the end as an end-side-slip for the final knot).|$|R
50|$|In The Byzantine Rite {{practice}} of the Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches, the stole worn by a deacon is called an orarion, while that worn by a priest or bishop is called an epitrachelion (a bishop additionally wears an omophorion), all similar in meaning and use to the Western stole. In Greek Orthodox practice, the deacon wears a double orarion, meaning it comes over the left arm and under the right. Minor clerics (and in Greek and Melkite traditions the altar servers as well) wear an orarion wrapped around their waist, crossed in back, and then either crossed again in front and tucked under the belted section or not <b>crossed</b> and <b>tucked</b> in (see explanation of subdeacon below).|$|R
50|$|The move used {{to trick}} an unsuspecting opponent. The wrestler sits down, <b>crosses</b> their legs, <b>tucks</b> their head into their chest and wraps one arm around their ankle (so they are {{effectively}} rolled into a ball). The wrestler then extends their remaining arm between their legs and then waits. The opponent, ostensibly confused, normally takes the offered hand, {{at which point}} the wrestler rolls forward and into an arm lock.|$|R
5000|$|For services, the subdeacon is {{vested in}} a sticharion with an orar tied around his waist, {{up over his}} {{shoulders}} (forming a cross in back), and with the ends <b>crossed</b> over, and <b>tucked</b> under the section around the waist. [...] This distinguishes them from acolytes in those jurisdictions where acolytes are ordained and blessed to wear the orar, as the latter do not wear the orar crossed in front but simply hanging straight down.|$|R

50|$|Wide eaves {{overhang}} the verandah {{which has a}} delicately detailed timber valance, dowel balustrades and chamfered timber posts with moulded timber capitals. The verandah has three wide bays with steps centrally located in the middle bay. The wall areas {{either side of the}} verandah are clad with vertical tongue-and-groove timber boards and have small sections of exposed timber <b>cross</b> bracing <b>tucked</b> under the eaves. Each contains a double hung timber sash window. The extensions at each end have skillion roofs, are clad with horizontal weatherboards and each has a timber door and set of steps. At the southern corner, the building has sliding, timber framed, multi-paned windows with coloured glass that return around the corner and continue along the western wall. The eastern corner has a timber sill at the same level as the windows but the windows are along the eastern elevation only. The building is set on concrete stumps with timber batten infill.|$|R

5000|$|Most of the pre-Hispanic {{clothing}} that survives is for women. [...] These include “enredos”, or wrap dresses, fajas, or cloth belts, huipils, {{a type of}} tunic, quechquemitl, which {{is a kind of}} rectangular or square short poncho. The last was originally worn directly on the upper body of a woman but today it is worn over a blouse. Loose-fitting sack dresses, called huipils in Oaxaca and guanengos in Michoacán, are often heavily embroidered with straight stitching, <b>cross</b> stitching and <b>tucks</b> with floral and geometric motifs.A widely used garment in both indigenous and mixed race communities is the rebozo. This is a long rectangular shawl used both as a wrap and as a means to carry children or heavy objects tied onto the body. The rebozo came about during the colonial period, not in the pre-Hispanic era. [...] The rebozo is a synthesis of three historical influences, the pre-Hispanic “mámatl,” the Spanish mantilla and the “repacejo,” an Oriental garment. [...] This is a long rectangular piece of cloth with long fringes at both ends. Most rebozos are made with multicolored designs woven into the pieces using threads of different colors. Those of a single color are usually made of yarn or thread that has been tie-dyed to produce color variations in the final piece. This latter style is called “jaspe” or jasper and are usually woven on backstrap looms.|$|R
