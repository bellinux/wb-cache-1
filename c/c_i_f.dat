In patients with congestive heart failure, {{it is not known}} whether the activation of this factor is related to the impairment in systolic contractility. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the differences in Cotransport Inhibitory Factor (<b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.)</b> response between patients with or without left ventricular dysfunction. Twenty one patients were included in this study (16 men and 5 women, mean age 53, range 38 to 72). All treatments were maintained except loop diuretics. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by contrast or isotopic angiography (range 14 – 74 %). Plasma and urine <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.</b> levels were measured by potency of the samples to inhibit cotransport fluxes in Madin and Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and in human erythrocytes. Cotransport inhibition in urine and plasma was correlated with LVEF as shown in figure (*and **=p< 0. 0002). This study shows that the degree of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F</b> activation is related to the level of LV dysfunction and that besides ANF, <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.</b> could playa key role in diuresis and natriuresis control in congestive heart failure...|$|E

We investigate whether these data are usable, by comparing their levels and variation to directly measured transport costs for the US and New Zealand.

40|$|In {{establishing}} {{the value of}} imports for tariff assessment, most countries apply duties either to the cost-insurance-freight (<b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.)</b> or the free-on-board (f. o. b.) value of the traded good. One effect of using the far more common <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> base is to place a disproportinate burden on countries that have higher freight and insurance costs. Distant countries often not only pay higher transport costs, but are further penalized by disproportionate tariff costs that worsen their competitive disadvantage. The f. o. b. valuation procedure does not penalize exporters for their location, but applies a nominal tariff rate directly to the export costs of each country. Using cost information for six Latin American countries, this paper examines {{the influence of the}} two procedures on the level and incidence of tariff protection. It concludes that transport and insurance costs generally put developing countries at a disadvantage (compared to developed countries) on interregional trade and that the relatively high Latin American tariffs on <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> prices further worsen their competitive position. To correct the bias against trade between developing countries, it is recommended that f. o. b. valuation procedures used by developed countries be adopted. This change would also reduce tariff barriers considerably.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{address the}} problem of visual recognition of non-rigid objects. I introduce the frame alignment approach to recognition and illustrate it in two types of non-rigid objects: contour textures and elongated flexible objects. Frame alignment is based on matching stored models to images and has three stages: first, a "frame curve" and a corresponding object are computed in the image. Second, the object is brought into correspondence with the model by aligning the model axis with the object axis; if the object is not rigid it is "unbent" achieving a canonical description for recognition. Finally, object and model are matched against each other. Rigid and elongated flexible objects are matched using all contour information. Contour textures are matched using filter outputs around the frame curve. The central contribution of this thesis is Curved Inertia Frames (<b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.),</b> a scheme for computing frame curves directly on the image. <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.</b> is the first algorithm which can c [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An object-based analysis-synthesis image {{sequence}} coder for transmission bit {{rates between}} 8 and 16 kbit/s is presented. Each moving object {{is described by}} three sets of parameters defining its shape, motion, and colour. Coding {{is based on the}} source model of flexible 2 -dimensional objects which move translationally in the image plane, as it has been used in an implementation for 64 kbit/s I S D N videophone by Hotter. In order to cut down the bit rate f rom 64 kbit/s to 8 kbit/s, Q <b>C</b> <b>I</b> <b>F</b> image resolution instead of <b>C</b> <b>I</b> <b>F</b> resolution is applied. Image analysis and coding of object parameters have been adapted to the reduced resolution and to the changed parameter statistics, respectively. I n addition to Hotter's coder, predictive coding is used for encoding polygons and splines to improve the coding efficiency of shapes. Vector quantization is applied instead of D C T for coding the luminance and chrominance parameters of the object textures. Uncovered background regions are encoded by applying adaptive prediction from either the neighbouring static background or a special background memory. Experi mental results, obtained by computer simulations, confirm that the presented coding algorithm is a promising scheme for the application at extremely low transmission bit rates. This is shown by comparing the picture qualities obtained with the presented algorithm and a block-based hybr id-DCT scheme corresponding to H. 261 /RM 8 at 11 kbit/s...|$|E
