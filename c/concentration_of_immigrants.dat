25|$|A {{study which}} mapped {{patterns}} of segregation and congregation of incoming population groups found that, if a majority group {{is reluctant to}} accept a minority influx, they may leave the district, avoid the district, or use tactics to keep the minority out. The minority group in turn react by either dispersing or congregating, avoiding certain districts in turn. Detailed analysis of data from the 1990s onwards indicates that the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> in certain city districts, such as Husby in Stockholm and Rosengård in Malmö, is {{in part due to}} immigration influx, but primarily due to white flight.|$|E
40|$|While {{studies on}} {{residential}} <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> from non-industrial countries are now common, studies <b>of</b> residential <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> from industrial countries are less common and comparative studies are almost nonexistent. This paper will apply identical research methods to both types <b>of</b> <b>immigrants.</b> By making a detailed {{comparison of the}} geography of seven ethnic groups in Amsterdam between 1994 and 2001, it is shown that immigrants from non-industrial countries are not extremely segregated, while immigrants from industrial countries show higher levels <b>of</b> <b>concentration.</b> Residential concentration levels do not necessarily tell us anything {{about the level of}} economic success and social/civil integration, because the different spheres of integration do not run parallel. However, <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> from nonindustrial countries often intersect with low levels of neighbourhood satisfaction, and <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> from industrial countries with high levels of neighbourhood satisfaction. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{years before}} World War II, the {{government}} of President Getúlio Vargas initiated a process of forced assimilation of people of immigrant origin in Brazil. The Constitution of 1934 had a legal provision about the subject: [...] "The <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> {{anywhere in the country}} is prohibited, the law should govern the selection, location and assimilation of the alien". The assimilationist project affected mainly German, Italian, Jewish, Japanese immigrants and their descendants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{identity}} of porteños has {{a rich and}} complex history, and {{has been the subject}} of much analysis and scrutiny. The great European immigration wave of the early 20th century was integral to [...] "the growing primacy of Buenos Aires and the accompanying urban identity", and established the division between urban and rural Argentina more deeply. Immigrants [...] "brought new traditions and cultural markers to the city," [...] which were [...] "then reimagined in the porteño context, with new layers of meanings because of the new location." [...] The heads of state's attempt to populate the country and reframe the national identity resulted in the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> in the city and its suburbs, who generated a culture that is a [...] "product of their conflicts of integration, their difficulties to live and their communication puzzles." [...] In response to the immigration wave, during the 1920s and 1930s a nationalist trend within the Argentine intellectual elite glorified the gaucho figure as an exemplary archetype of Argentine culture; its synthesis with the European traditions conformed the new urban {{identity of}} Buenos Aires. The complexity of Buenos Aires' integration and identity formation issues increased when immigrants realized that their European culture could help them gain a greater social status. As the rural population moved to the industrialized city from the 1930s onwards, they reaffirmed their European roots, adopting endogamy and founding private schools, newspapers in foreign languages, and associations that promoted adherence to their countries of origin.|$|E
40|$|In immigrant-receiving countries, {{immigrants}} are often concentrated in residential neighbourhoods with high <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants.</b> In addition, they {{are concentrated in}} workplaces with high <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants.</b> Many researchers have assumed that these are {{two sides of the}} same coin, so that policy affecting residential segregation could be expected to influence workplace segregation. Using Swedish register data for 2007, we directly assess whether immigrants who live in residential neighbourhoods concentrated with immigrants also work in firms concentrated with immigrants. We find that there is very little correlation between residential and workplace segregation, suggesting that policy could profitably target both types of segregation separately...|$|R

40|$|Immigrants {{and their}} {{residential}} outcomes are {{of great interest}} to urban researchers and policymakers. The literature, however, provides little knowledge about the residential status <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> with publicly subsidized housing assistance. In this article, we draw on three streams of literature—assimilation, neighborhood effects, and housing policy—to investigate the residential choices and outcomes (neighborhood conditions) <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> who receive housing choice vouchers. We use primary survey data from a sample of voucher households from two local housing authorities in Orange County, California, to investigate housing search behavior, locational choice, and neighborhood conditions. The results of our regression analyses show that immigrants, compared with nonimmigrants, are more likely to receive assistance from friends or family in their housing search and that they tend to live in neighborhoods with relatively higher <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> overall. Immigrant status is not directly associated with worse neighbor hood conditions; however, higher <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> are strongly associated with relatively worse neighborhood conditions. This finding indi-cates an indirect association between immigrant status and neighborhood conditions. We conclude with a discussion of the research and policy implications of these findings...|$|R
40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on {{quantitative}} research carried out on a statistically representative sample of Italian primary schools with a high <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students. Research data show that schools with a higher number <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students offer a greater number and {{a wider variety of}} intercultural initiatives. The presence <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students serves as an effective stimulus in enhancing intercultural approaches. Furthermore, the opinions of head teachers about the proposal of ‘separate classes’ for immigrant students and the proposed ‘limit of 30 % on the presence’ <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students are negative. These judgements do not change in a statistically significant manner in relation to <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students: in particular, higher rates <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> students are not related to more positive opinions. Continuing education on intercultural issues is widely adopted, mainly on behalf of teachers and less often on behalf of head teachers and other school personnel. Finally, activities by ‘linguistic facilitators’ and ‘linguistic and cultural mediators’ are not significantly related to a decrease in perceived concern regarding problematic situations...|$|R
