Three deployment strategies are compared: <b>captive</b> <b>use,</b> where the firm uses the innovation to enhance the competitive position of its own product; licensing, where the firm shares the innovation with competitors; and independent selling, where the firm incorporates the innovation in a complementary product or service that is sold separately to consumers. We study how the interplay of efficiency and competitive considerations favors certain deployment options over others. ...|$|R
