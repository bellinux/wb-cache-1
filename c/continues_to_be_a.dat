5|$|After {{a decline}} in the 1890s, the logging of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One nail in the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and dairy farming, which <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mainstay of the Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.|$|E

5|$|Expansion of the {{population}} and settlements in the county continued during the Tudor and more recent periods. Agriculture and coal mining expanded until the 18th century, although other industries declined during the industrial revolution. In modern times {{the population}} has grown, particularly in the seaside towns, notably Weston-super-Mare. Agriculture <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the acreage of apple orchards is less than it once was.|$|E

Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy.

5|$|In 1920 {{more of the}} {{south-west}} corner {{collapsed and}} the castle's owner, Lord Hothfield, gave the property to the Office of Works. Work to stabilise the ruins was carried out and the castle, as a listed building and ancient monument, eventually passed into the control of English Heritage as a tourist attraction. There were initial archaeological excavations on the site in 1925, and then further work in 1970-71, 1993, 2007 and 2009. Erosion <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> threat to the castle's masonry, and as of 2010 English Heritage considered the castle's condition to be declining, with some parts at particular risk.|$|E

5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} would go on for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> difficult issue for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union {{would go on to}} describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a liberation from fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as a corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E
