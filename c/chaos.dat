5|$|As in most Sonic series games, the <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds {{play a major}} role; {{they help}} Shadow {{remember}} his past and allow him to perform <b>Chaos</b> Control and <b>Chaos</b> Blast. <b>Chaos</b> Control allows Shadow to move more quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and <b>Chaos</b> Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform <b>Chaos</b> Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform <b>Chaos</b> Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Dragons of Summer Flame {{covers the}} <b>Chaos</b> War, {{also known as}} the Second Cataclysm. The gods and mortals join forces to defeat <b>Chaos</b> in his attempt to destroy Krynn. The war ends with the {{withdrawal}} of <b>Chaos</b> and the gods of Krynn in a divine agreement to keep the world safe.|$|E
5|$|However, the unfazed Eggman awakens a {{creature}} named <b>Chaos</b> from a huge gem called the Master Emerald. The animals fight {{a losing battle}} to retrieve the Emeralds until <b>Chaos</b> absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named Tikal, who entombed herself and <b>Chaos</b> in the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds to become Super Sonic, he defeats <b>Chaos,</b> who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.|$|E
5|$|Portnoy {{spent a month}} {{directing}} {{and editing}} a documentary titled <b>Chaos</b> in Progress: The Making of Systematic <b>Chaos,</b> which was released on the two disc special edition of the album. The bonus disc of the special edition also included 5.1 surround sound mix of the entire album. Dream Theater supported the album by touring on the <b>Chaos</b> in Motion Tour from June 3, 2007 to June 4, 2008. The world tour comprised 115 shows throughout thirty-five countries. Multiple concerts were filmed for the band's fifth DVD, titled <b>Chaos</b> in Motion 2007–2008. The compilation of concerts was released on September 30, 2008.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of <b>Chaos.</b> Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of <b>Chaos,</b> Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of <b>Chaos</b> to engulf the world into darkness. While he is saying this, the Dark Sword of <b>Chaos</b> vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of <b>Chaos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alongside fractals, <b>chaos</b> theory {{ranks as}} an {{essentially}} universal influence on patterns in nature. There {{is a relationship}} between <b>chaos</b> and fractals—the strange attractors in chaotic systems have a fractal dimension. Some cellular automata, simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably Stephen Wolfram's Rule 30.|$|E
5|$|Between 2013 and 2016, Taylor {{appeared}} with Kings of <b>Chaos.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Yusnaan, Lightning infiltrates Snow's {{palace and}} finds him {{preparing}} {{to enter a}} concentration of <b>Chaos</b> contained inside the palace. He plans to absorb the <b>Chaos,</b> transform into a Cie'th, and have Lightning kill him. Though he performs the act and they fight, Lightning manages to renew his hope of seeing Serah again, reverse his transformation and lift his burden.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to steal the six <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds and harness their power, the game's antagonist, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, has trapped the animal {{inhabitants}} of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself. If the player collects all the <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown. If all the emeralds are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of the <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds not collected by the player.|$|E

5|$|The ending varies {{depending}} upon the level of <b>chaos</b> the player has caused throughout the game. If Corvo saves Emily, she ascends the throne as Empress with Corvo at her side. If {{only a small amount}} of <b>chaos</b> has been caused, a golden age dawns and the plague is finally overcome. After many decades, Corvo dies of natural causes and Empress Emily Kaldwin I the Wise buries him beside Empress Jessamine. If much <b>chaos</b> is caused, the city remains in turmoil and is overrun with the plague. If Corvo fails to save Emily, Dunwall crumbles and Corvo flees the city by ship.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} the Aurum invasion, Pit is {{revealed}} to be trapped inside a ring with no clear memory of what lead to his predicament. Using hosts {{to make his way}} to a ruined city, he meets up with Magnus, who reveals that Palutena's army has turned against humanity and that Pit's body is attacking humans. Using Magnus' body, Pit defeats his body and repossesses it. Viridi then flies him to Palutena's capital of Skyworld which has been reduced to ruins: Viridi reveals that the Lunar Sanctum was a prison holding the <b>Chaos</b> Kin, a soul-devouring creature that escaped when Pit destroyed the base. The <b>Chaos</b> Kin has possessed Palutena and caused her to become deranged. After obtaining the Lightning Chariot, Pit breaks through the defensive barrier around Skyworld's capital and defeats Palutena. The <b>Chaos</b> Kin then steals her soul, leading to both Pit and Dark Pit pursuing the <b>Chaos</b> Kin into its dimension, the <b>Chaos</b> Vortex, to retrieve Palutena's soul. To save Dark Pit from a final attack from the defeated <b>Chaos</b> Kin, Pit overuses his Power of Flight, burning his wings and nearly dying in the process.|$|E
5|$|Torn was {{to contain}} {{four types of}} magic: <b>Chaos,</b> Order, Alchemy and Summoning. Order magic {{primarily}} consisted of healing, protective, and empowering spells. Conversely, <b>Chaos</b> magic was to have consisted of harmful elemental attacks, detrimental status afflictions, and invisibility spells.|$|E
5|$|Zelenin and Jimenez {{respectively}} {{side with}} Law and <b>Chaos,</b> while a resurrected Gore becomes Neutral. Depending on the choices {{made during the}} game, the protagonist has the choice of allying with either Law, <b>Chaos</b> or following a Neutral route and continuing with the original mission. If he sides with Law, the protagonist and Zelenin defeat both Jimenez and Mem Aleph before using the Cosmic Eggs to create a World of Law, with Zelenin worshiped as a channel to God for humanity, which is forced to surrender its free will. If he sides with <b>Chaos,</b> he and Jimenez help Mem Aleph and defeat Zelenin, using the Eggs to fulfill the Schwarzwelt's original purpose and create a world where humans and demons live together in a primal world where only the strong survive. In both the Law and <b>Chaos</b> routes, Arthur chooses to destroy his new personality to save the protagonist after the Red Sprite is damaged by Gore. If the protagonist rejects Law and <b>Chaos,</b> Gore transmits the necessary information {{for the destruction of}} the Schwarzwelt to him before truly passing on. After defeating Zelenin, Jimenez, and Mem Aleph, the protagonist and surviving crew escape in the Red Sprite while Arthur sacrifices himself to ensure the destruction of the Schwarzwelt, although there is a chance of it reappearing if humanity continues its abuse of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of <b>chaos</b> at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial <b>chaos.</b> Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for <b>chaos</b> to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial <b>chaos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Agent Orange {{was used}} as a {{defoliant}} in eastern Cambodia during the Vietnam War, but its impacts are difficult to assess due to the <b>chaos</b> caused by the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{infantry}} {{landing in the}} second wave, supporting arms began to arrive, meeting the same <b>chaos</b> and destruction as had the rifle companies. Combat engineers, tasked with clearing the exits and marking beaches, landed off-target and without their equipment.|$|E
5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The <b>chaos</b> system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered <b>chaos</b> system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of <b>chaos,</b> was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E
5|$|Aspects of Thelema and Crowley's {{thought in}} general {{provided}} {{inspiration for the}} development of Wicca and, to a certain degree, the rise of Modern Paganism as a whole, as well as <b>chaos</b> magick and Satanism.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and <b>Chaos</b> Heroes were imbalanced, with the <b>Chaos</b> Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor <b>Chaos</b> (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor <b>Chaos</b> and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that of others. In contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor <b>Chaos</b> to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor <b>Chaos</b> and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor <b>Chaos</b> and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{writings}} and teachings have proved a significant influence over other currents of occultism, including <b>chaos</b> magic, the Temple of Set and the Dragon Rouge.

5|$|Just Cause 2 is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} players control Rico Rodriguez, a major {{operative}} of the Agency, {{in an effort to}} overthrow the island dictatorship of Panau: an open world for players to explore. The game has three types of missions. Agency missions advance the story and are the game's main campaign; faction missions task players to assist the game's three factions, and stronghold missions task players to infiltrate government bases and liberate them for the factions. To advance through the campaign missions a player must earn <b>chaos</b> points, a progression system introduced in the game. Players earn <b>chaos</b> points for completing missions and destroying designated government property. As the number of <b>chaos</b> points increases, the factions gain influence and the government begins to collapse. In addition to typical missions, Just Cause 2 has race challenges which give players cash.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles {{encounters}} Rouge and Eggman, who try {{to steal}} the Master Emerald. He stops them by shattering the emerald and searches for the scattered shards. Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK. There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another superweapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds {{and use it to}} take over the world. Rouge appears, offering them a <b>Chaos</b> Emerald to gain their trust.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tourists}} {{sites were}} disrupted and {{the access to}} the Pyramids was suspended. The resort town of Sharm-el Shaikh, however, remained calm. <b>Chaos</b> was reported at Cairo International Airport, where thousands of stranded and frightened foreigners attempted to evacuate.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman {{builds a}} robotic {{assistant}} named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who {{was destroyed in}} Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using the <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds to perform the <b>Chaos</b> Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.|$|E
5|$|Soma ascends to the castle's {{keep and}} confronts Graham in the throne room. Although Soma's sole desire {{is to leave}} the castle, Graham is {{convinced}} that Soma must be killed for absorbing {{the souls of the}} castle's monsters. Soma manages to defeat Graham, even after Graham uses his newfound powers to assume a demonic form. As Graham falls in defeat, Soma absorbs his powers, and realizes he is Dracula's reincarnation. Arikado arrives and reveals a way for Soma to save himself by halting the flow of <b>chaos</b> into the castle. Soma proceeds to the Chaotic Realm, but Julius attacks him, believing that Soma is Dracula. Julius allows Soma to defeat him, as he sensed Soma's soul fighting against Dracula's influence. Before he leaves, Soma elicits a promise from Julius to kill him if he fully becomes Dracula. Soma travels through the Chaotic Realm and finally locates the source of <b>chaos.</b> Soma manages to defeat the manifestation of <b>chaos</b> and is sent congratulations by Yoko, Hammer, Julius, and Arikado. Soma awakens back in the Hakuba Shrine with Mina, pleased that the conflict is over.|$|E
5|$|Systematic <b>Chaos</b> is {{the ninth}} studio album by American {{progressive}} metal/rock band Dream Theater. Released on June 4, 2007 in the United Kingdom and June 5, 2007 in the United States, Systematic <b>Chaos</b> was the band's first release through Roadrunner Records, which {{was sold to}} their previous label Atlantic Records, through which the band had released their previous studio album Octavarium (2005). The album was recorded from September 2006 to February 2007 at Avatar Studios in New York City, after the band's first break from summer touring in ten years. The lyrics of the album were written by John Petrucci, James LaBrie, and Mike Portnoy about fictional, political, and personal topics, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The first divine act is the {{creation}} of the cosmos, described in several creation myths. They focus on different gods, each of which may act as creator deities. The eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the <b>chaos</b> that precedes creation, give birth to the sun god, who establishes order in the newly formed world; Ptah, who embodies thought and creativity, gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself; and Amun, according to the theology promoted by his priesthood, preceded and created the other creator gods. These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory. Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated <b>chaos.</b> The period following creation, in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society, is the setting for most myths. The gods struggle against the forces of <b>chaos</b> and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} the Hero dreaming that he meets the Law Hero, the <b>Chaos</b> Hero, and a woman named Yuriko; she {{promises}} that she will become the Hero's partner. He wakes up, and receives an e-mail with a computer program for summoning demons attached. While out on an errand, he learns that a scientist has opened a portal to the Abyss, which allows demons to enter Tokyo. He also meets Yuriko, who says she will fulfill her promise. The next night, the Hero again dreams that he meets the Law Hero and <b>Chaos</b> Hero, and that they save the Heroine from a sacrificial ritual. The next day, he meets the Law Hero and <b>Chaos</b> Hero in reality; they reveal {{that they had the}} same dreams. News of the demons spread, and the US military, led by ambassador Thorman, decides to intervene. The Japan Self-Defense Forces, led by general Gotou, opposes them, as they see demons as the ancient spirits of the land. A third group, led by the Heroine, tries to prevent conflict between the other two. She gets captured by Gotou's forces; they are about to publicly execute her under supervision by Yuriko, but she is saved by the Hero, Law Hero, and <b>Chaos</b> Hero. Players can choose to support Thorman or Gotou, or to reject both; regardless of what they choose, the conflict escalates until Thorman launches missiles towards Tokyo. The Heroine is killed, but saves the Hero, Law Hero, and <b>Chaos</b> Hero by using magic to teleport them to another plane of existence.|$|E
5|$|The game {{progresses}} {{through the}} Westopolis level and five more levels {{from the different}} paths Shadow may take. As missions are completed, Shadow learns more about his past and regains memories. He can choose to help Doctor Eggman or the Black Arms, to help G.U.N. and the series' heroic characters, or to help neither and keep the <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds for himself. The missions completed determine which one of ten possible endings will be seen after Shadow collects all the <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds and defeats one of the game's final bosses. The possible ending events range from planning to defeat the Black Arms to planning to destroy the planet.|$|E
5|$|The levels contain {{features}} like vertical loops, springs, and rails that the player can grind on. Each level {{is divided into}} three acts, punctuated by a boss fight with Doctor Eggman at the end; all three acts, the boss fight, and two minigames that grant the player extra lives are bound by a hub world. Within each act, the player collects Chao creatures; finding 10 in all 3 acts in one zone grants the player access to a special stage, where a <b>Chaos</b> Emerald can be found. Collecting all seven <b>Chaos</b> Emeralds, which can be done after completion of the main campaign, allows the player to fight an extra final boss for the game's true ending.|$|E
