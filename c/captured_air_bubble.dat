This paper reports {{the development of}} a microfluidic platform with the reproducible and efficient bubble-induced micromixing for bead disaggregation and immunoassay of prostate-speci fic antigen (PSA). The platform consists of a microfluidic chip with a microchamber and rectangular traps for <b>capturing</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and a home-made controller to generate sound wave using an external piezo transducer. Methods for reproducible bubble formation and bubble size control during mixing are explored. The influence of driving voltage, PDMS thickness and the substrate material on the mixing efficiency is characterised by mixing a fluorescence dye and a buffer solution. The optimised acoustic microstreaming is able to break clusters with hundreds of beads and homogenise individual beads over the microchamber. Immunoassay with efficient micromixing has been applied to PSA immunoassay with greatly reduced detection time.

25|$|The {{beginning}} of nest building is {{preceded by a}} courtship ritual. This pair formation consists of {{the male and female}} swimming parallel to each other, the male and female facing each other and contacting their barbels, the male stimulating the flanks of the female, the swimming to the surface by the male and female and production of the first bubbles at the nest site, and adding further bubbles to the nest under construction. The male produces most of the foam. First, the male and female come to the surface and swim belly-up in small circles. The film of the air-water interface is swallowed and pumped out through the gills, where it gains mucus. Movement of the pelvic fins stirs the water and mucus, <b>captures</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles,</b> and breaks these <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> into a foam. The female may add some bubbles to the nest under construction. Pelvic fin movement differs between sexes; males move their pelvic fins in a side-to-side fashion, while females open and close their pelvic fins. The male often dives to the bottom to retrieve plant debris; filamentous nest materials are preferred, which are knitted together in the nest by the male. The male creates an upward water current with its tail fin that lift plant materials up. Then, the male uses its developed pectoral fin spines to cary the plant materials to the nest. The male uses its mouth and pectoral fins to incorporate the plant material into the foam mass of the nest. Females neither have developed pectoral fin spines nor do they help in transporting plant debris. The end result is a dome-shaped nest made up of loosely interwoven plant material on top of tightly interwoven plant material, held up to the surface with a layer of foam; the eggs will be laid on top of this foam from below.|$|R

The basis of this technique was that the horizontal distance that the float travels {{on its way to}} the surface is the image of the integrated velocity profile over depth. Viol and Semenov (1964) improved this method by using <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> as floats, but still distances were measured manually until Sargent (1981) introduced a technique that could derive the distances from two photographs simultaneously taken from each side of the river bank.

40|$|Gas traps are {{critical}} for the smooth operation of coolant loops because gas bubbles can cause loss of centrifugal pump prime, interference with sensor readings, inhibition of heat transfer, and blockage of passages to remote systems. Coolant loops are ubiquitous in space flight hardware, and thus {{there is a great}} need for this technology. Conventional gas traps will not function in micro-gravity due to the absence of buoyancy forces. Therefore, clever designs that make use of adhesion and momentum are required for adequate separation, preferable in a single pass. The gas traps currently used in water coolant loops on the International Space Station are composed of membrane tube sets in a shell. Each tube set is composed of a hydrophilic membrane (used for water transport and capture of bubbles) and a hydrophobic membrane (used for venting of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles).</b> For the hydrophilic membrane, there are two critical pressures, the pressure drop and the bubble pressure. The pressure drop is the decrease in system pressure across the gas trap. The bubble pressure is the pressure required for <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> to pass across the water filled membrane. A significant difference between these pressures is needed to ensure complete <b>capture</b> of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in a single pass. Bubbles trapped by the device adsorb on the hydrophobic membrane in the interior of the hydrophilic membrane tube. After adsorption, the air is vented due to a pressure drop of approximately 1 atmosphere across the membrane. For water systems, the air is vented to the ambient (cabin). Because water vapor can also transport across the hydrophobic membrane, it is critical that a minimum surface area is used to avoid excessive water loss (would like to have a closed loop for the coolant). The currently used gas traps only provide a difference in pressure drop and bubble pressure of 3 - 4 psid. This makes the gas traps susceptible to failure at high bubble loading and if gas venting is impaired. One mechanism for the latter is when particles adhere to the hydrophobic membrane, promoting formation of a water layer about it that can blind the membrane for gas transport (Figure 1). This mechanism is the most probable cause for observed failures with the existing design. The objective of this project was to devise a strategy for choosing new membrane materials (database development and procedure), redesign of the gas trap to mitigate blinding effects, and to develop a design {{that can be used in}} ammonia and Freon- 21 coolant loops...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> {{entrainment}} {{is defined}} as the exchange of air between the atmosphere and flowing water. Also called self-aeration, the continuous exchange between air and water is most important for the biological and chemical equilibrium on our planet. <b>Air</b> <b>bubble</b> entrainment is observed in chemical, coastal, hydraulic, mechanical and nuclear engineering applications {{as well as in the}} natural environment such as waterfalls, mountain streams and river rapids, and breaking waves on the ocean surface. The resulting "white waters " provide some spectacular effects. The entrainment of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> may be localised at a flow discontinuity or continuous along an air-water free-surface: i. e., singular and interfacial aeration respectively. At a flow singularity, the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> are entrained locally at the impinging perimeter and advected in a region of high turbulent shear stresses.

40|$|The {{potential}} of textured hydrophobic surfaces to provide substantial drag reduction has {{been attributed to}} the presence of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> trapped on the surface cavities. In this paper, we present results on water flow past a textured hydrophobic surface, while systematically varying the absolute pressure close to the surface. Trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> on the surface are directly visualized, along with simultaneous pressure drop measurements across the surface in a microchannel configuration. We find that varying the absolute pressure within the channel greatly influences the trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> behavior, causing a consequent effect on the pressure drop (drag). When the absolute pressure within the channel is maintained below atmospheric pressure, we find that the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> grow in size, merge and eventually detach from the surface. This growth and subsequent merging of the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> leads to a substantial increase in the pressure drop. On the other hand, a pressure above the atmospheric pressure within the channel leads to gradual shrinkage and eventual disappearance of trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> We find that in this case, <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> do cause reduction in the pressure drop with the minimum pressure drop (or maximum drag reduction) occurring when the bubbles are flush with the surface. These results show that the trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> dynamics and the pressure drop across a textured hydrophobic microchannel are very significantly dependent on the absolute pressure within the channel.

However, particle detachment from hydrophilic, positively charged surfaces [3 -(2 -aminoethylamino) propyldimethoxysilane-coated glass, water contact angle 33 degrees] was most sensitive to variations in <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> velocity and liquid/vapour interfacial tension, while detachment from hydrophobic, negatively charged surfaces (dimethyldichlorosilane-coated glass, water contact angle 96 degrees) was affected least.

Thus, the retrieved cloud optical thicknesses are reduced by employing inhomogeneous ice cloud models. At a wavelength of 2. 13 microns, including <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in ice cloud models may also increase the reflectance. This effect implies that the retrieved effective particle sizes for inhomogeneous ice crystals are larger than those retrieved for homogeneous ice crystals, particularly, in the case of large <b>air</b> <b>bubbles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim: We aim to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} movement of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> after embryo transfer (ET) on pregnancy outcomes under transabdominal ultrasound-guided ET in IVF cycles. Material and Method: One hundred and thirty six (136) ultrasound-guided fresh fundal ETs included in this study were divided into 3 groups according to the movement of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> after ET. Group 1 (n= 101) consisted of ETs in which the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> moved towards the uterine fundus with ejection immediately after transfer; Group 2 (n= 5) consisted of ETs in which the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> moved towards the cervical canal after transfer; Group 3 (n= 30) consisted of ETs in which no movement of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> was observed after transfer. The primary outcome was the clinical pregnancy rate. Results: Of all the transfers, 53 (38. 9 %) resulted in a clinical pregnancy. Of these clinical pregnancies, 75 % was in group 1, 1. 9 % was in group 2 and 22. 6 % was in group 3. The clinical pregnancy rates were 39. 6 %, 20 %, and 40 % in groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The clinical pregnancy rates were dramatically reduced in cases with the <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> moving towards the cervical canal after transfer, although this did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 67). Discussion: The movement of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> towards the cervical canal after transfer can reflect a poor prognostic outcome in terms of lower pregnancy rates and can influence the success of IVF treatment...|$|R
40|$|When a {{water jet}} impinges {{a pool of}} water at rest, <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> may be entrained and carried away below the pool free-surface; this process is called {{plunging}} jet entrainment. The study presents new experimental data obtained in a vertical supported jet. Distributions of air concentration and mean air-water velocity, and bubble chord length distributions measured in the developing shear layer are presented. The results indicate that the distributions of void fraction follow closely analytical solution of the diffusion equation. Further, the momentum shear layer and the <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> diffusion layer do not coincide. Chord length data show a wide range of <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> sizes and overall the experimental results suggest strong interactions between the entrained <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and the momentum transfer mechanisms...|$|R
