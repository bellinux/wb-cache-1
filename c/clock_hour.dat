To compare laser {{peripheral}} iridotomy (LPI) with trabeculectomy as {{an initial}} treatment for primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) with peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) [*]≥[*] 6 <b>clock</b> <b>hours.</b> Methods. Patients {{were drawn from}} two randomized controlled trials. 38 eyes of 38 patients (PAS[*]≥[*] 6 <b>clock</b> <b>hours)</b> were treated with LPI (group 1) while 111 eyes of 111 PACG patients (PAS[*]≥[*] 6 <b>clock</b> <b>hours)</b> underwent primary trabeculectomy (group 2). All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination at baseline and at postoperative visits and were followed up {{for a minimum of}} one year. Results. Group 2 had higher baseline IOP (45. 7 [*]±[*] 14. 8 [*]mmHg versus 34. 3 [*]±[*] 14. 3 [*]mmHg) than group 1 and more <b>clock</b> <b>hours</b> of PAS (10. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 9 versus 9. 0 [*]±[*] 2. 2).

40|$|This essay aims {{to debate}} the minimum <b>clock</b> <b>hours</b> of {{instruction}} necessary for obtaining a bachelor's degree in nutrition considering the challenges to educate health professionals. Official documents on the minimum <b>clock</b> <b>hours</b> of instruction required by undergraduate nutrition programs were analyzed to investigate compliance with the curriculum guidelines for the area, the law that regulates the profession of dietitian, and the necessary education for the Sistema Único de Saúde (Unified Health Care System). Compared with other health programs, nutrition presented the smallest {{increase in the minimum}} <b>clock</b> <b>hours</b> of instruction required for the degree. The changes that occurred in the epidemiological, demographic, and nutritional profile of the population and scientific advances require specific nutrition actions. Since Sistema Único de Saúde focuses on comprehensiveness in the three levels of care, on humanization, and on health care, the theoretical and methodological concepts given in undergraduate programs need to be improved for the dietitians education to meet the Sistema Único de Saúde needs. Incorporation of the knowledge needed for working with food and nutritional phenomena, including its social and cultural dimensions, management of public policies, quantity cooking, and food and nutritional surveillance requires a higher minimum <b>clock</b> <b>hours</b> of instruction.

They also note that age {{should be considered in}} assessments of morningness and eveningness, noting how a [...] "bed time of 23:30 may be indicative of a morning type within a student population, but might be more related to an evening type in the 40-60 years age group" [...] (Horne & Östberg, 1976, p. 109).

Duffy et al. investigated [...] "changes in the phase relationship between endogenous circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle", and found that although evening types woke at a later <b>clock</b> <b>hour</b> than morning types, morning types woke at a later circadian phase. Zavada et al. show that the exact hour of mid-sleep on free (non-work) days may be the best marker for sleep-based assessments of chronotype; it correlates well with such physiological markers as dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and the minimum of the daily cortisol rhythm.

Professional growth plans are thought to have characteristics indicative of high quality professional development that can positively impact student gains, and were developed to support Washington State goals for transitioning teachers from continuing education that is measured in “seat-time” to a performance-based system driven by teacher and student needs.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to document the}} occurrence of tumors with respect to <b>clock</b> <b>hour</b> location and distance from the macula and to evaluate tumor location in relation to retinal topography and light dose distribution on the retinal sphere. Analysis of patterns of tumor initiation may provide new evidence to clarify the controversy regarding the possible light-related etiology of choroidal melanoma. Incident cases of choroidal and ciliary body melanoma in Massachusetts residents diagnosed between 1984 and 1993 were the basis for analysis. Conventional fundus drawings and photos {{were used to assess}} the initiation site of each tumor. The initiation site was defined as the intersect between the largest tumor diameter and the largest perpendicular diameter of the tumor. Initiation sites were recorded using spherical coordinates. The retinal sphere was divided into 61 mutually exclusive sectors defined according to <b>clock</b> <b>hour</b> and anteroposterior distance from the macula. Rates of initiation were computed for each sector, overall, and according to gender and other clinical factors. Results were similar in left and right eyes; therefore, these were combined in analysis. Tumor initiation had a predilection for the macula (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Overall, no significant <b>clock</b> <b>hour</b> preference was observed (P = 0. 63). However, the parafoveal zone showed a strong circular trend (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), with highest rates occurring in the temporal region, and the lowest rates occurring in the nasal region. Rates of occurrence in six progressively more anterior concentric zones (designated as the foveal, parafoveal, posterior, peripheral, anterior, and ciliary body zones) were 21. 4, 14. 2, 12. 1, 8. 9, 4. 5, and 4. 3 counts per spherical unit per 1000 eyes, respectively. Concentric zone location did not vary by gender (P = 0. 93) or laterality (P = 0. 78). However, posterior location was associated with light iris color (P = 0. 01). Tumor diameters were largest in the peripheral region of the fundus and smallest in the macular and ciliary body zone (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). <b>Clock</b> <b>hour</b> location was not influenced by gender (P = 0. 74), laterality (P = 0. 53), iris color (P = 0. 84), or tumor diameter (P = 0. 73). Results suggest that tumor initiation is not uniformly distributed, with rates of occurrence concentrated in the macular area and decreasing monotonically with distance from the macula to the ciliary body. This pattern is consistent with the retinal topography and correlates positively with the dose distribution of solar light on the retinal sphere...|$|E
