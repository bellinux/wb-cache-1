40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an UML {{modeling}} of a <b>technical</b> <b>memory</b> oriented for the knowledge documentation. The particular knowledge we address in this work is the one generated along the decision making process during product design. The decision model considered here concerns the technological choices and the architecture definition of the products at the knowledge level. After considering the general problem of knowledge documentation in the first section, we devote the following section to the requirements of a <b>technical</b> <b>memory.</b> In the third section we discuss the main contributions in this area. We deal then with the conceptual architecture followed in the fifth section by the corresponding UML modeling. We finally discuss the validation criteria for such a <b>technical</b> <b>memory</b> and open new perspectives...|$|R

We propose the definition of structural and functional patterns of specific corporate documents by analyzing the contexts and sections in which the expression occurs. Such patterns and its automated processing are the basis for identifying organizational domain knowledge and business information which is used later for the first instances of requirement elicitation processes in software engineering. ...|$|R

In 1963, E.S.R., Inc. marketed the low-cost Digi-Comp I, which allowed children to construct a simple digital computer, composed entirely of mechanical parts operated by hand. They could then play with it, watching as mechanical versions of “flip-flop” electronic circuits demonstrated Boolean logic computations, solved problems in binary logic, and calculated simple mathematical operations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} develop {{artificial}} agents operating in complex ever-changing environments, advanced <b>technical</b> <b>memory</b> systems are re-quired. At this juncture, two central questions are which information needs to be stored {{and how it is}} represented. On the other hand, cog-nitive psychology provides methods to measure the structure of mental representations in humans. But the nature and the characteristics of the underlying representations are largely unknown. We propose to use feature selection methods to determine adequate technical features for approximating the structure of mental representations found in humans. Although this approach does not allow for drawing conclusions transfer-able to humans, it constitutes an excellent basis for creating technical equivalents of mental representations...|$|R

In order {{to proceed with the}} aforementioned, we assume that capacity planning decision, which considers the general <b>corporate,</b> <b>technical,</b> users and executive views aiming at prioritizing a measurable relative importance of the planning constraints is capable of giving more economic added-value decision elements to the management. Thus, the optimization multicriteria analysis leads us to infer upon the reasonableness of the decision taken in regard to implementing budgetary planning in moment of business uncertainties. Results {{of this study indicate that}} corporate strategic views in decision-taking processes some times override some technical, users and executive views as relating to capacity planning in information technology management environment...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the industrial art of videogame design and production as an exemplar {{of what could be}} termed affective design. In doing so, the article theorizes the relationship between affect and attention as part of what Bernard Stiegler calls a ‘retentional economy’ of human and <b>technical</b> <b>memory.</b> Through the examination of a range of different videogames, the article argues that videogame designers utilize techniques of what I term ‘affective amplification’ that seek to modulate affect, which is central to the commercial success of these games. The article considers how the concepts of amplification, modulation and bandwidth, developed through this example, inform and expand understandings of this retentional economy by analysing the ways in which affective design attempts to transmit and translate the potential for affect through a range of technical systems and environments...|$|R
50|$|The International Electro-Technical Exhibition of 1891, in Frankfurt, Germany, {{featured}} the long distance transmission of high-power, three-phase electric current. It was held between 16 May and 19 October on the disused {{site of the}} three former “Westbahnhöfe” (Western Railway Stations) in Frankfurt am Main. The exhibition {{featured the}} first long distance transmission of high-power, three-phase electric current, which was generated 175 km away at Lauffen am Neckar. It successfully operated motors and lights at the fair. When the exhibition closed, the power station at Lauffen continued in operation, providing electricity for the administrative capital, Heilbronn, making it {{the first place to}} be equipped with three-phase AC power. Many <b>corporate</b> <b>technical</b> representatives (including E.W. Rice of Thomson-Houston Electric Company (what became General Electric)) attended. The technical advisers and representatives were impressed. As a result of the successful field trial, three-phase current, as far as Germany was concerned, became the most economical means of transmitting electrical energy.|$|R
