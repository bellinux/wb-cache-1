50|$|Pedersen invented and {{patented}} a novel <b>corn</b> <b>thresher</b> {{capable of}} separating corn from chaff, a transmission system, a gear system for horse drawn mills and a braking system for waggons, among other ideas. He was also musical, and although his primary trade {{was that of}} a smith, he was listed as a musician in the 1890 census.|$|E
60|$|Equal grumbling heralded the {{introduction}} of a threshing-machine, which Captain Carbonel purchased after long consideration. The beat of the flail on barn floors was a regular winter sound at Uphill, as in all the country round, but to get all the <b>corn</b> <b>threshed</b> and winnowed by a curious revolving fan with four canvas sails, was a troublesome affair, making farmers behindhand in coming to the market. And as soon as he could afford the venture the Captain obtained a machine to be worked by horse-power, for steam had hardly been brought as yet into use even for sea traffic, and the first railway was only opened late in 1830, the time of the accession of William the Fourth.|$|R
50|$|The {{galician}} granary is {{an agricultural}} building intended for drying, curing and storing the <b>corn</b> before <b>threshing</b> and grinding it. It {{consists of an}} oblong storage chamber, narrow and permeable to the air passage, separated from the ground to avoid entrance of humidity and animals.|$|R
5000|$|The first powered farm {{implements}} {{in the early}} 19th century were portable engines [...] - [...] steam engines on wheels {{that could be used}} to drive mechanical farm machinery by way of a flexible belt. Richard Trevithick designed the first 'semi-portable' stationary steam engine for agricultural use, known as a [...] "barn engine" [...] in 1812, and it was used to drive a <b>corn</b> <b>threshing</b> machine. The truly portable engine was invented in 1839 by William Tuxford of Boston, Lincolnshire who started manufacture of an engine built around a locomotive-style boiler with horizontal smoke tubes. A large flywheel was mounted on the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment being driven. In the 1850s, John Fowler used a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine to drive apparatus in the first public demonstrations of the application of cable haulage to cultivation.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>corn</b> <b>thresher</b> comprising {{at least one}} feeder mounted on a platform, and having an opened top for receiving a load of corn. It is also consist of a cylinder, which is being electrically actuated to push a corn {{from one end of}} the feeder to its opposite end horizontally through a passage way within the feeder. A magnetic sensor coupled to each of the cylinder for controlling its movement on the platform. At least one cutter, each configured at the opposite end of each feeder for threshing the corn's seeds from its stem. In this context, filtering is located below the cutter for separating the corn seeds and the stem. A collector under the filtering means for collecting the corn seeds; wherein the cylinder is configured to continuously push another corn from the one end of the feeder when the threshed corn leaves the cutter. Overall, this invention can reduce the human effort and increase the productivity in the corn food processing industries...|$|E
5000|$|Early {{steam engines}} were too large and {{expensive}} {{for use on}} the average farm; however, the first positive evidence of steam power being used to drive a threshing machine was in 1799 in north Yorkshire. The next recorded application was in 1812, when Richard Trevithick designed the first 'semi-portable' stationary steam engine for agricultural use, known as a [...] "barn engine". This was a high-pressure, rotative engine with a Cornish boiler, for Sir Christopher Hawkins of Probus, Cornwall. It was used to drive a <b>corn</b> <b>threshing</b> machine and was much cheaper to run than the horses it replaced. Indeed, it was so successful that it remained in use for nearly 70 years, and has been preserved by the Science Museum in London. Although termed 'semi-portable', {{as they could be}} transported and installed without being dismantled, these engines were essentially stationary. They were used to drive such barn machinery as pumps and hammer mills, bone-crushers, chaff and turnip cutters, and fixed and mobile threshing drums.|$|R
40|$|Summary. The paper {{considers}} an infl uence of {{the angular}} speed of threshing drum on power consumption dur-ing the <b>threshing</b> of sweet <b>corn</b> variety Candle. The sweet corn cobs were blanched and frozen prior to threshing. The changes of angular speed of threshing drum varied from 100 to 180 rad·s- 1, which affected {{an increase of}} power consumption {{in the range from}} 2. 29 to 2. 44 kW (t·h- 1), about 7 %. Key words: sweet <b>corn,</b> frozen, <b>threshing,</b> power consumption...|$|R
5000|$|Further {{problems}} arose {{with the}} upkeep {{of the local}} farms, but people from the nearby villages helped. Apprentices came from local firms, students, firemen, soldiers, boy scouts, railroad workers and policemen, as well as volunteer school children, and even from abroad to help. 600 tons of potatoes was harvested manually, <b>corn</b> was <b>threshed</b> and the new crop seeds were sown in time. Just over {{a month after the}} crash, a new council was elected by the remaining 52 people entitled to vote.|$|R
40|$|Alcoholic fermentations were performed, {{adapting}} {{the technology to}} exploit the residual thermal energy (hot water at 83 – 85 °C) of a cogeneration plant and to valorize agricultural wastes. Substrates were apple, kiwifruit, and peaches wastes; and <b>corn</b> <b>threshing</b> residue (CTR). Saccharomyces bayanus was chosen as starter yeast. The fruits, fresh or blanched, were mashed; CTR was gelatinized and liquefied by adding Liquozyme® SC DS (Novozymes, Dittingen, Switzerland); saccharification simultaneous to fermentation was carried out using the enzyme Spirizyme® Ultra (Novozymes, Dittingen, Switzerland). Lab-scale static fermentations were carried out at 28 °C and 35 °C, using raw fruits, blanched fruits and CTR, monitoring the ethanol production. The highest ethanol production was reached with CTR (10. 22 % (v/v) and among fruits with apple (8. 71 % (v/v)). Distillations at low temperatures and under vacuum, to exploit warm water from a cogeneration plant, were tested. Vacuum simple batch distillation by rotary evaporation at lab scale at 80 °C (heating bath) and 200 mbar or 400 mbar allowed to recover 93. 35 % (v/v) and 89. 59 % (v/v) of ethanol, respectively. These results support a fermentation process coupled to a cogeneration plant, fed with apple wastes and with CTR when apple wastes are not available, where hot water from cogeneration plant is used in blanching and distillation phases. The scale up in a pilot plant was also carried out...|$|R

50|$|In 1871, Jerusalem {{was visited}} by the {{explorer}} and Arabist Sir Richard Francis Burton. Lady Burton later described their {{exploration of the}} Well of Souls as tourists:A flight of fifteen steps takes us into the cave under this Rock. This feature has been immensely written about. I shall content myself with saying that Captain Burton holds {{it to be the}} original granary of the <b>corn</b> <b>threshed,</b> or rather trodden out, upon the plain on either side, and winnowed from the Rock. If the latter prove to be the great Altar of Sacrifice, the cave will be the cistern for the blood which ran off by the Bir el Arwáh (Well of Souls) into the Valley of Hinnom. My husband did his best to procure the opening of the hollow-sounding slab in the centre, but the time has not yet come. The more ignorant Moslems believe that the Sakhrah is suspended in the air, and its only support is a palm tree, held by the mothers of the two greatest prophets, Mohammed and Abraham. The most projecting point is called “the Tongue,” because, when Omar thought he had discovered the stone which was Jacob’s pillar in his vision at Bethel, he exclaimed, “Es Salámo Alaykúm” (“Peace be unto thee”), and the stone replied, “Alaykúm us Salám, wa Rahmat-Ullahi” (“Peace be to thee, and the mercy of God”). The Shaykhs of the Mosque explained everything to us, even the minutest trifle, and showed us the places where Solomon prayed, and also David, and where Abraham and Elijah and Mohammed met on the occasion of his night flight upon El Borák. They also made an echo for us, and told us that there was a hollow place beneath the Bir el Arwáh before mentioned, where every Friday the departed souls come to adore Allah.|$|R
50|$|The tithe barn {{was built}} by Sir William Paston (1528-1610), {{the founder of the}} Paston Grammar School in North Walsham, in 1581 and was used to store and <b>thresh</b> <b>corn.</b> The barn is {{constructed}} of flint and brick with an alternate tie and hammerbeam roof, which is thatched. The barn is 160 ft long and 24 ft wide; to the apex the height is 60 ft. It has Grade II* listed building status. Pevsner remarks that the roof span does not require hammer beams and that 'they are here for show: the Renaissance magnate's love of bravado and expression of wealth'.|$|R
25|$|Other {{actions were}} {{believed}} to offend fairies. Brownies {{were known to be}} driven off by being given clothing, though some folktales recounted that they were offended by inferior quality of the garments given, and others merely stated it, some even recounting that the brownie was delighted with the gift and left with it. Other brownies left households or farms because they heard a complaint, or a compliment. People who saw the fairies were advised not to look closely, because they resented infringements on their privacy. The need to not offend them could lead to problems: one farmer found that fairies <b>threshed</b> his <b>corn,</b> but the <b>threshing</b> continued after all his corn was gone, and he concluded that they were stealing from his neighbors, leaving him the choice between offending them, dangerous in itself, and profiting by the theft.|$|R
60|$|Las Palmas {{down beside}} the smoking beach is no longer Spanish. It is filled with bustle and a rampant commercialism, and English is spoken there; but the {{quietness}} of the ages lingers among the hills where the grapes of Moscatel are still trodden in the winepress by barelegged men in unstarched linen who live very much as one fancies the patriarchs did, plowing with oxen and wooden plows, and beating out their <b>corn</b> on wind-swept <b>threshing</b> floors. They also comport themselves, even towards the wandering Briton, who does not always deserve it, with an almost stately courtesy, and seldom trouble themselves about the morrow. All that is essentially Spanish is Eastern, too. The life in the hill pueblos is that portrayed in the Jewish scriptures, and the olive-skinned men whose forefathers once ruled half the world have also like the Hebrew the remembrance of their departed glory to sadden them.|$|R
60|$|They {{are working}} without respite and with little speech, {{not at all}} {{as if they had}} been brought {{together}} for the benefit of some one else's corn, but as though they, one and all, had a private grudge against Time and a personal pleasure in finishing this job, which, while it lasts, is bringing them extra pay and most excellent free feeding. Just as after a dilatory voyage a crew will brace themselves for the run in, recording with sudden energy their consciousness of triumph over the elements, so on a farm the harvests of hay and <b>corn,</b> sheep-shearing, and <b>threshing</b> will bring out in all a common sentiment, a kind of sporting energy, a defiant spurt, as it were, to score off Nature; for it is only a philosopher here and there among them, I think, who sees that Nature is eager to be scored off in this fashion, being anxious that some one should eat her kindly fruits.|$|R

Our gods have been smitten and defied; woes great and terrible, such as history tells not of, have fallen upon us through magic; tens of thousands, from the first-born child of Pharaoh down, have perished in a single night. And now these Hebrews, who have murdered them by sorcery, for they are sorcerers all, men and women together, especially one of them who sits at Memphis, of whom I will not speak because she has wrought me private harm, by the decree of Pharaoh are to be suffered to leave the land.

40|$|R. Douglas Hurt {{deals with}} the {{invention}} and development of American farm implements and machinery with a special emphasis on the nineteenth century. The material is organized around the functions of various agricultural machines used in the major grain-growing states. Ten chapters focus on the improvements made in plows, grain drills, corn planters, cultivators, reapers, binders, headers, corn binders, <b>corn</b> shellers, <b>threshing</b> machines, combined harvesters, mowing machines, hay stackers, feed mills, and steam traction engines. The author decided to describe certain lines of farm equipment without trying to catalogue all agricultural tools, implements, and machines. Therefore the reader will not find descriptions of such items as cotton gins, saw mills, blacksmith tools, windmills, irrigation pumps, wagons, buggies, washing machines, and hardware materials. Also, during the period 1892 to 1914, no mention is made of the manufacture of {{the internal combustion engine}} and its uses in stationary gas engines, the early tractors, automobiles, trucks, and electric light plants. The judicious use of 219 photographs and illustrations gives a visual presentation of the evolution of rural technology. The verbal descriptions of mechanical and technical matters can be readily understood by the general reader. The book includes a good bibliography and a helpful appendix to aid the reader in understanding the importance of metallurgy as an important factor in the manufacture of farm machinery. Better farm machinery had to wait until the making of steel had been perfected. Some readers would welcome more analysis and interpretation of rural technology. For example, virtually all historians mention that our colonial forefathers used the wooden plow, the sickle, and the flail to grow crops, the same tools used thousands of years earlier in Biblical times. Why was this progress so slow? Why were no new machines invented in colonial America in the 170 years prior to the Revolutionary War? Why did it take two hundred years of experimentation before the first successful track-type Caterpillar engines were built in 1904 ? Combines were widely used in the Pacific Coast states in the 1880 s, yet they were not adopted in the Midwest until the late 1920 s, a lag of forty years. Perhaps historians should give more attention to the factors that deter progress and to the obstacles that prevent the adoption of new ideas, to try to explain the inability of people to adopt new methods. Nevertheless, the narrative is informative and well written. American Farm Tools is a fine addition to the historical record...|$|R

50|$|Punvaranogadh {{was built}} around 878 by Punvar, son of Ghaa or Ghav, {{the chief of}} Kera, Kutch and {{possibly}} a nephew of Lakho Phulani. Quarreling with his family, Punvar or Punrao resolved to found a city and call it after his own name. When the city was finished, the architect was rewarded by having both his hands chopped off {{that he might not}} do work like it for any one else. Soon after, seven devotees of Jakhs renowned for their virtues and miracles came from Rum-Sham (possibly Anatolia and Syria or Byzantine), and settled in a high hill near Punvaranogadh. Hearing of their fame, Punvar's childless queen had an underground passage dug from the palace to the devotees' hill. Helping them in the service of their god Jakh, she after six months prayed them to ask the god to give her a son. But, for her husband's sins, until a sacrifice was offered in the palace, the prayer could not be granted. By the underground passage the holy men entered the palace and were performing their rites when Punvar, hearing there were strange men in the women's rooms, forced his way in, seized the devotees, and set them with bare feet to tread out <b>corn</b> in a <b>threshing</b> floor bristling with harrow-spikes. Pitying their sufferings a friendly barber named Babra offered {{to take the place of}} one of them. The freed devotee went to the top of Lakhadiya hill nearby and call Jakhs to their aid. Jakhs heard the prayer, and, with an earthquake that shook the hills, appeared with seventy-one brothers and a sister, Sayari or Sairi. Called on to give up the holy men, Punvar refused and by the help of the gods and a magic amulet suffered nothing from the arrows of Jakhs. Then Sayari, taking the form of a mosquito, bit Punvar on the arm so that he drew of his amulet, and, in the siege, a stone falling from the roof broke his head. Jakhs cursed the town and it has since lain desolate. Later Jakhs were revered by people and the temples were erected in their dedication.|$|R
