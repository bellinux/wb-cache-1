5|$|In 1978 Robert Randall {{sued the}} federal {{government}} for arresting him for using <b>cannabis</b> to treat his glaucoma. The judge ruled Randall needed <b>cannabis</b> for medical purposes and required the Food and Drug Administration set up a program to grow <b>cannabis</b> on a farm at the University of Mississippi and to distribute 300 <b>cannabis</b> cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 George H. W. Bush discontinued the program after Randall tried to make HIV/AIDS patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving <b>cannabis</b> cigarettes; today the government still ships <b>cannabis</b> cigarettes to four people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive <b>cannabis</b> from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the George W. Bush administration to reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, Johnson {{was named}} {{president}} and CEO of <b>Cannabis</b> Sativa Inc., a Nevada-based company that aims primarily to sell medical <b>cannabis</b> products {{in states where}} medicinal and/or recreational <b>cannabis</b> is legal.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana <b>Cannabis</b> Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of <b>cannabis</b> use. <b>Cannabis,</b> while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as a subject for open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise <b>Cannabis</b> Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{association}} with the number 420 in <b>cannabis</b> culture, Highway 420 is also the location for the annual <b>Cannabis</b> Conference and Protest, usually taking place sometime around April20. The event includes a march beginning near Niagara Falls and travelling to Highway 420.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} <b>cannabis</b> offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated <b>cannabis</b> from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of <b>cannabis.</b> In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive study from the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the constitutionality of <b>cannabis</b> prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, <b>cannabis</b> was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use <b>cannabis</b> but only when {{prescribed}} by a doctor/physician. <b>Cannabis</b> was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those who needed <b>cannabis</b> for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the <b>cannabis</b> they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Guam {{became the}} first U.S. {{territory}} to legalize <b>cannabis</b> for medical use. In December 2014, the US Virgin Islands passed a bill that decriminalized possession of <b>cannabis</b> up to an ounce. In Puerto Rico, medical <b>cannabis</b> was legalized on May 3, 2015, by an executive order from its governor.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{efforts to}} {{reschedule}} <b>cannabis</b> under the Act have failed, and the United States Supreme Court has ruled in United States v. Oakland <b>Cannabis</b> Buyers' Cooperative and Gonzales v. Raich {{that the federal}} government has a right to regulate and criminalize <b>cannabis,</b> even for medical purposes.|$|E
5|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{opposed the}} act because the tax was imposed on {{physicians}} prescribing <b>cannabis,</b> retail pharmacists selling <b>cannabis,</b> and medical <b>cannabis</b> cultivation and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act the AMA proposed <b>cannabis</b> {{be added to}} the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. This approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a tax was the only viable way to legislate marijuana.|$|E
5|$|The Oregonians For <b>Cannabis</b> Reform 2010 {{hoped to}} make <b>cannabis</b> {{products}} legal and {{available in a}} retail environment by enacting the Oregon <b>Cannabis</b> Tax Act of 2010 (OCTA), but the effort failed to collect the minimum 83,000 signatures by the July 2 deadline {{to qualify for the}} 2010 ballot.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, {{finding that}} <b>cannabis</b> grown within California for medical {{purposes}} is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana. Moreover, because the intrastate medical <b>cannabis</b> market {{contributes to the}} interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical <b>cannabis</b> in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.|$|E
5|$|The first International <b>Cannabis</b> Business Conference (ICBC) {{took place}} in Portland, on September 13 and 14, 2014, at the Oregon Convention Center. The conference brought {{together}} entrepreneurs, professionals and advocates from across the globe, with the goal to further mainstream the global <b>cannabis</b> industry. The ICBC is a collaboration between veteran activists Anthony Johnson, Alex Rogers and Debby Goldsberry. Johnson has served as chief petitioner of statewide <b>cannabis</b> reforms and is currently Director of the Oregon <b>Cannabis</b> Industry Association; Rogers is CEO of Northwest Alternative Health and lead producer of the Oregon Medical Marijuana Business Conference; Goldsberry is a co-founder of the Berkeley Patients Group and serves as an ambassador for Magnolia Wellness. The ICBC further cements Portland has a prominent locale for <b>cannabis</b> activism.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{misconception}} about the intoxicating effects of hemp because {{it has the same}} active substance, THC, which is in all <b>cannabis</b> strains. Hemp normally has a minimal amount of THC when compared to recreational <b>cannabis</b> strains but, in the 1930s, THC was not yet fully identified. The methods FBN used for predicting the psychoactive effect of different samples of <b>cannabis</b> and hemp therefore gave confusing results.|$|E
5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew {{attention to the fact that}} those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of <b>cannabis,</b> an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of <b>cannabis</b> which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of <b>cannabis,</b> did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
5|$|Glastonbury {{received}} {{national media}} coverage in 1999 when <b>cannabis</b> plants {{were found in}} the town's floral displays.|$|E
5|$|Gonzales v. Raich 545 U.S. 1 (2005) was a {{decision}} in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (6–3) that even where individuals or businesses in accordance with state-approved medical <b>cannabis</b> programs are lawfully cultivating, possessing, or distributing medical <b>cannabis,</b> such persons or businesses are violating federal marijuana laws. Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants the federal government jurisdiction to prosecute marijuana offenses, here defendants violation of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe (South Dakota) {{voted to}} legalize {{recreational}} <b>cannabis</b> on its territory.|$|E
5|$|In Gonzales the {{respondents}} (criminal defendants) argued because the <b>cannabis</b> in question had been grown, transported, and consumed entirely {{within the state}} of California, in compliance with California medical <b>cannabis</b> laws, the defendants' activity did not implicate interstate commerce. Therefore, the defendants argued, their activity could not be regulated, and eventually prosecuted, {{by the federal government}} through the Commerce Clause.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Johnson {{resigned}} {{from his post}} as CEO of <b>Cannabis</b> Sativa, Inc., to pursue political opportunities, hinting to a 2016 presidential run.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, amidst a {{nationwide}} trend of <b>cannabis</b> prohibition, Oregon outlawed {{the drug in}} 1923.|$|E
5|$|Lee Harris {{stood for}} the <b>Cannabis</b> Is Safer Than Alcohol Party.|$|E
5|$|Mandatory {{sentencing}} {{and increased}} punishment were enacted when the United States Congress passed the Boggs Act of 1952 and the Narcotics Control Act of 1956. The acts made a first-time <b>cannabis</b> possession offense {{a minimum of}} two to ten years with a fine up to $20,000; however in 1970 the United States Congress repealed mandatory penalties for <b>cannabis</b> offenses.|$|E
5|$|Marijuana smoke {{contains}} {{many of the}} same carcinogens as those in tobacco smoke. However, the effect of smoking <b>cannabis</b> on lung cancer risk is not clear. A 2013 review did not find an increased risk from light to moderate use. A 2014 review found that smoking <b>cannabis</b> doubled the risk of lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{served as}} a keynote speaker and {{moderator}} at the <b>Cannabis</b> World Congress and Business Expo in New York City on June 15–17, 2016.|$|E
5|$|More {{states began}} to {{initiate}} their own legalization in 2017, despite {{the ambiguity of}} the <b>Cannabis</b> policy of the Donald Trump administration.|$|E
5|$|Oregon imports <b>cannabis</b> from Washington, California, Mexico and Canada, {{while also}} {{producing}} a large quantity locally. Large {{indoor and outdoor}} growing operations have been discovered on private, state, and forest lands, with plants numbering in the thousands. Allegedly large outdoor growing operations run by Mexican cartels drug trafficking were assumed to be operating in remote locations. Highly potent <b>cannabis</b> grown in Oregon is consumed locally, and distributed {{to other parts of}} the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Rathbun helped work on Proposition P, {{which made}} it {{the policy of the}} City of San Francisco to {{recommend}} that the State of California and the California Medical Association make <b>cannabis</b> available for medicinal purposes and to protect physicians from penalties for prescribing medicinal <b>cannabis.</b> Proposition P passed with the support of 79percent of San Francisco voters on November 5, 1991.|$|E
5|$|According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), <b>cannabis</b> {{is readily}} {{available}} in Oregon. According to a 2006 report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 20032004 Oregon {{ranked in the top}} fifth of states for <b>cannabis</b> usage in three age categories: 12 to 17, 18 to 25, and 26 and older. In 2005, while most states that had passed medical marijuana bills over the past decade saw marijuana use among teenagers decline faster than the national average (a 43% decrease), Oregon, Nevada, and Maine saw smaller decreases than the average.|$|E
5|$|Anslinger claimed <b>cannabis</b> caused {{people to}} commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. The FBN {{produced}} propaganda films promoting Anslinger's views and Anslinger often commented {{to the press}} regarding his views on marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{derived from}} plants {{including}} opiates, cocaine and <b>cannabis</b> have both medical and recreational uses. Different countries have {{at various times}} made some uses of drugs illegal, partly {{on the basis of}} the risks involved in taking psychoactive drugs.|$|E
5|$|He {{was sacked}} by Charlton and banned {{for six months}} by The Football Association in November 1997 for testing {{positive}} for cocaine and <b>cannabis.</b> He denied the charge, claiming that a cigarette he smoked had been laced with the cocaine.|$|E
5|$|Houston is a {{significant}} hub for trafficking of cocaine, <b>cannabis,</b> heroin, MDMA, and methamphetamine due to its size and proximity to major illegal drug exporting nations. Houston {{is one of the}} country's largest hubs for human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Oregon House Bill 3466, {{which would}} have recriminalized {{marijuana}} in Oregon, died. According to bill sponsor Jerry Grisham (R–Beavercreek), HB 3466 was meant to counter a circulating initiative petition called The Oregon <b>Cannabis</b> Tax Act of 1997, {{which would have}} allowed state liquor stores to sell marijuana and permitted hemp production for paper, fabric, oil, and protein. Taxes on these products would go to schools to replace funding allegedly lost by Measure 5. The petition was sponsored by a political action committee named Pay for Schools by Regulating <b>Cannabis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pesticides {{derived from}} plants include nicotine, rotenone, {{strychnine}} and pyrethrins. Plants such as tobacco, <b>cannabis,</b> opium poppy, and coca yield psychotropic chemicals. Poisons from plants include atropine, ricin, hemlock and curare, {{though many of}} these also have medicinal uses.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{childhood}} {{trauma is}} {{also associated with}} a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of <b>cannabis</b> was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, <b>cannabis,</b> and other illegal drugs.|$|E
5|$|Substance misuse, {{dependence}} and withdrawal {{are associated with}} self-harm. Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self-harming behaviour in young people. Alcohol is a major risk factor for self-harm. A study which analysed self-harm presentations to emergency rooms in Northern Ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations. A recent study in the relation between <b>cannabis</b> use and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in Norway and England found that, in general, <b>cannabis</b> use {{may not be a}} specific risk factor for DSH in young adolescents.|$|E
