Mice of all strains became bacteremic after intraperitoneal injection of a serogroup C, serotype 2 a human disease isolate, but the strains differed in levels of bacteremia, indicating influences of the host genome on susceptibility. There was no significant correlation between level of bacteremia and differences at major histocompatibility or immunoglobulin loci; the Salmonella susceptibility locus, Ity; the complement C 5 locus, Hc; the antibody response locus, xid; or the transferrin locus, Trf. However, the Lps locus, which influences a range of host cellular responses to endotoxin and affects susceptibility to Salmonella typhimurium, did influence susceptibility to meningococcemia. There were significant differences in levels of bacteremia between C 3 H/HeJ (Lpsd) mice {{and each of the}} other strains (all Lpsn). We confirmed the association of the Lpsd genotype with susceptibility by using <b>coisogenic</b> strains from two widely separated mouse lineages: C 3 H and B 10. Lpsd mice experienced a 1, 000 -fold proliferation of bacteria and were bacteremic for days before clearing the infection. In contrast, Lpsn mice cleared the bacteremia in less than 1 day. There was no difference in meningococcal growth in vitro in serum from C 3 H/HeJ and <b>coisogenic</b> C 3 H/HeN (Lpsn) mice, suggesting that the Lps-related difference in susceptibility may involve a cellular response...|$|E
40|$|Hyperglycemia induced {{in animals}} by beta cell toxins or by pancreatectomy can be {{reversed}} by pancreatic islet transplantation. Abnormal carbohydrate metabolism in juvenile onset human diabetics {{has also been}} corrected, albeit temporarily because of graft rejection, by pancreatic transplantation. It does not necessarily follow that naturally occurring diabetes in animals or adult onset diabetes in man would respond to similar treatment. Islet transplantation was studied in mice with chemically induced or genetically determined diabetes. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were permanently cured by syngeneic islets and, when immunosuppressed, were rendered normoglycemic for six weeks after receiving xenogeneic rat islets. In contrast, histocompatible islets from normoglycemic <b>coisogenic</b> donors were ineffective in hyperglycemic db/db recipients as were xenogeneic rat islets in immunosuppressed db/db hosts. However, when islets were isolated from db/db donors and transplated to genetically normal <b>coisogenic</b> mice, which had been rendered hyperglycemic with streptozotocin, they became normoglycemic. Apparently the metabolic defect in the db/db mice, which is {{similar in some ways}} to human maturity onset diabetes, does not reside in their islets as these cells can function normally if transplanted to genetically nondiabetic hosts. In two other types of genetic diabetes (ob/ob and NZO) islet transplantation was more effective.

40|$|Mov mouse strains {{differ from}} their respective, <b>coisogenic</b> partner strains by the embryonic, germ-line {{introduction}} of Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} genomes. The possibility that retroviral insertions into the mouse genome resulted in gain or loss mutations at non-H- 2 histocompatibility loci was investigated by reciprocal skin grafting between Mov mice and mice from <b>coisogenic,</b> background strains. Two B 6 -derived and eight 129 -derived Mov strains were analyzed. B 6 mice rejected skin from the viremic Mov- 3 and Mov- 14 strains, indicating that these mice had new histocompatibility antigens. No rejections were observed with reciprocal skin grafts exchanged between mice of the 129 background strain and 129 -derived Mov strains, one of which (Mov- 9) is viremic. To investigate the potential viral origin of the new histocompatibility antigen in Mov- 14, lymphocytes from B 6 mice primed in vivo with Mov- 14 cells or skin were restimulated in vitro with Mov- 14 spleen cells and with two retroviral-induced B 6 lymphomas, MBL- 2 and RBL- 5. All three cell types stimulated cytotoxic lymphocytes that lysed Mov- 14 Con A lymphoblasts, MBL- 2 and RBL- 5. The same cytotoxic lymphocytes lysed only lymphoblasts from the viremic Mov- 9 strain when tested on cells from 129 and 129 Mov mice. Thus the insertion and expression of exogenous Moloney murine leukemia virus results in {{the appearance of a}} new histocompatibility antigen as defined by its stimulation of skin-graft rejection and cytotoxic effector T-cell generation. The non-H- 2 histocompatibility antigen identified in this study has been designated H- 43 and is encoded by genes mapping to different loci in different Mov strains. These observations suggest that at least a subgroup of non-H- 2 histocompatibility antigens is encoded by endogenous retroviruses; the implications of these results for understanding the origin and the identity of non-H- 2 histocompatibility antigens are discussed...|$|E

Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is {{a unique}} renal disease {{characterized}} by intraglomerular lipoprotein thrombi associated with severe proteinuria and frequent progression to renal failure.

The mechanisms of susceptibility to particle-induced lung injury are not clearly understood. To evaluate {{the contribution of}} genetic background to pulmonary pathogenesis, we compared the lung injury responses to residual oil fly ash (ROFA) in inbred mouse strains, and calculated heritability estimates. Significant inter-strain (genetic) variation was observed in ROFA-induced lung inflammation and hyperpermeability phenotypes, and broad-sense heritability ranged from approximately 0. 43 - 0. 62, and the coefficient of genetic determination ranged from 0. 28 - 0. 45. C 3 H/HeJ (HeJ) mice were most resistant to the ROFA-induced injury responses. This was particularly important as HeJ mice contain a dominant negative mutation in Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr 4).

40|$|A {{variety of}} ecotropic murine leukemia viruses cause {{neurodegenerative}} disease. We describe here the clinical and histopathological {{features of a}} neurologic disease induced by a polytropic murine leukemia virus, FMCF 98. Clinical disease was dominated by hyperexcitability and ataxia, and the histopathology was char-acterized primarily by astrocytosis and astrocytic degeneration. The viral envelope gene harbored the deter-minants of neurovirulence, since the chimeric virus Fr 98 E, which contained the envelope gene of FMCF 98 on a background of the nonneurovirulent virus FB 29, caused a similar disease. The disease caused by Fr 98 E differed from that induced by the <b>coisogenic</b> neurovirulent ecotropic virus FrCasE in clinical presentation, histopathology, and distribution of virus in the central nervous system. Since Fr 98 E contains a polytropic envelope gene and FrCasE contains an ecotropic envelope gene, these phenotypic differences appeared {{to be determined by}} envelope sequences and may reflect differences in virus receptor usage in the central nervous system.

The regions on chromosomes 6 and 10 have a lesser but still suggestive effect. The contribution of each locus ranged from 3 % to 13 %, and together these loci accounted for about 40 % of the phenotypic variance at each titration time.

40|$|Endotoxic {{lipopolysaccharide}} {{has recently}} been shown to fix large amounts of the complement components related to the biologic activities mediated by that system.

Preheating serum, incubating at 0 °C, or incubating in the presence of EDTA, all prevented chemotactic factor generation as well as complement fixation by endotoxin. "Endotoxoids" deficient in complement-firing activity were also deficient in chemotactic factor generation. Chemotactic factor could not be generated by endotoxin in sera of mice congenitally deficient in the C'S component of complement, while chemotactic factor was generated by endotoxin in the sera of <b>coisogenic</b> mice with normal complement levels for that species. The chemotactic factor induced by endotoxin was heat stable and nondialyzable. Molecular sieve chromatography and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation demonstrated that the chemotactic factor was a relatively low molecular weight product (15, 000 – 30, 000) and as such different from previously scribed C' system-derived chemotactic factors. These experiments demonstrate that generation of chemotactic factor by endotoxin in serum is dependent upon C' system activation involving at least C' 5. Furthermore, the relatively low molecular weight of this factor suggests that it might be derived from activation of a single complement component rather than from complexing of multiple complement components...|$|E
40|$|How {{to choose}} wild type {{laboratory}} strains of N. crassa for reference and for special uses. Background Oak Ridge (OR) wild types are preferred for most purposes (Perkins 2004). These {{were derived from}} wild types designated 'Standard ' (ST), which had been selected originally by Patricia St. Lawrence (1953) {{on the basis of}} high fertility and properties which made them favorable for cytology [...] good chromosome pairing at pachytene and asci predominantly with eight viable black spores. Differences in heterokaryoncompatibility led to replacement of the original St. Lawrence standards by derivatives designated OR (Oak Ridge) (Case et al. 1965). Additional backcrosses and reisolations were made to minimize remaining heterogeneities and obtain largely <b>coisogenic</b> strains of opposite mating type, 74 -OR 23 - 1 V A (FGSC 2489) and 74 -ORS- 6 a (FGSC 4200) (Mylyk et al. 1974). For pedigree and references, see Newmeyer et al. (1987) and Gavric and Griffiths (2004). The Oak Ridge wild types and mutant derivatives in the OR (ST) genetic background came to be widely used. Strain 74 -OR 23 - 1 V A (FGSC 2489) was chosen as the source of DNA for genome sequencing (Galagan et al. 2003). There have been notable exceptions to the use of Oak Ridge strains as standards.

It was found, {{in keeping with the}} findings of earlier investigators (Pierce, C. H., R. J. Dubos, and W. B. Schaefer. 1953. J. Exp Med. 97 : 189.), that in immunocompetent mice, virulent organisms grew progressively only in the lungs, whereas the growth of attenuated organisms was controlled in all organs. In SCID mice, in contrast, virulent mycobacteria grew rapidly and progressively in all organs, as did BCG, although at a slower rate. However, H 37 Ra failed to grow progressively in any organs of SCID mice, unless the mice were treated with hydrocortisone. In fact, hydrocortisone treatment enabled virulent, as well as attenuated, organisms to grow strikingly more rapidly in all organs of SCID mice and in all organs of CB- 17 mice. A histological study showed that in SCID mice, multiplication of mycobacteria in the liver occurs in the cytoplasm of macrophages in granulomas and presumably in macrophages in other organs.

Whether previously experienced with immature males or not, dnc+ and dncM 14 males were indistinguishable in their response and mating efficiency when individually paired with virgin females. However, courtship performance of dnc+ and dncM 14 males was different if they were first experienced with immature males and were then individually tested in an artificial population of nine immature males and one virgin female. In this situation, dnc + males spent much less time in courtship with immature males and achieved copulation in one-third the time required for dncM 14 males. As a control, the behavior and mating efficiency of courtship-naive dnc + and dncM 14 males in the artificial population was indistinguishable. In competition for a single virgin female, experienced dncM 14 males showed a slight mating advantage over experienced dnc+ males.

In this study, some invasive and non-invasive sampling methods were compared, with the main focus on the impact on animal physiology. We compared ear punch, tail biopsy, hair plugging, mouth and rectum swabs and the simple restraint of the animals, scoring for the impact on heart rate (HR), core body temperature (BT) and motor activity by telemetry, during biopsy and for the following 6 h. Furthermore, in order to correlate the physiological impact with the practicability and reliability of the genotyping results, we performed a PCR analysis of the biopsy samples obtained by using the same collection procedures analysed by telemetry. All sampling methods and restraint induced significant increase in HR and BT and {{a slight increase in}} motor activity for 1 h, independent of the invasiveness of the method used. Genotyping of all biopsies allowed the proper identification of transgenic animals, tail biopsies, ear punches and hair follicles giving clear signals, the last method being fast, but also susceptible to cross contaminations during sampling by large numbers of animals.

Furthermore, shRNA-mediated reduction of Aqp 9 expression reduces liver triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in a diet-induced rat model of obesity. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate metabolic effects of Aqp 9 deletion in <b>coisogenic</b> db/db mice of the C 57 BL/ 6 background. Aqp 9 (wt) db/db and Aqp 9 (-/-) db/db mice did not differ in body weight and liver TAG contents. On the C 57 BL/ 6 genetic background, we observed elevated plasma glucose in Aqp 9 (-/-) db/db mice (+ 1. 1 mmol/L, life-time average), while plasma insulin concentration was reduced at the time of death. Glucose levels changed similarly in pentobarbital anesthetized, glucagon challenged Aqp 9 (wt) db/db and Aqp 9 (-/-) db/db mice. Liver transcriptional profiling did not detect differential gene expression between genotypes. Metabolite profiling revealed a sex independent increase in plasma glycerol (+ 55 %) and glucose (+ 24 %), and reduction in threonate (all at q < 0. 1) in Aqp 9 (-/-) db/db mice compared to controls. Metabolite profiling thus confirms a role of AQP 9 in glycerol metabolism of obese C 57 BL/ 6 db/db mice.

No effect of the beige gene on the rate of glucuronidase synthesis was detected in either untreated or testosterone-treated mice. Moreover, glucuronidase of beige mice decayed relatively slowly in pulse labeling and in hormone withdrawal experiments. Direct measurements of secretion confirmed that both {{in the presence of}} testosterone and following its withdrawal, there was a threefold lower rate of secretion of kidney glucuronidase in beige mice. Following hormone withdrawal, the loss of glucuronidase activity in beige mice was biphasic, with the second more slowly turning over component apparently lost by a nonsecretory mechanism. This persistent nonsecreted glucuronidase activity was specifically associated with giant lysosomes in kidney proximal tubule cells near the corticomedullary border. Thus, there are two major populations of lysosomes in proximal tubule cells of beige mice. Cells of the outer cortex contain mainly morphologically normal lysosomes, and their lysosomal enzymes are secreted at near normal rates. However, lysosomal enzymes derived from the giant lysosomes of cells near the corticomedullary border are secreted either very slowly or not at all. The altered secretion of lysosomal enzymes from specific kidney cells of beige mice may serve as a model system for study of defective fusion of lysosomes with phagocytosed bacteria in cells of Chédiak-Higashi patients...|$|E

Unlike A/Sn and its IR strains, all sarcomas and lymphomas tested pro-duced variants when transplanted in the parental strains. Again, for any hybrid combination, no parental strain was favored for variant production. The number of variants produced de-viated from generation to generation. Different sublines of the same tumor also gave different numbers of variants. The number of variants decreased with reduction in inoculum. This indicates that the pre-existence of certain cell clones in the initial inoculum is im-portant in variant production. The variants were higWy specific and stable. Homozygous tumors, however, failed to produce true variants. Cytological studies showed that the variants had larger numbers of cells at hyperdiploidy and triploidy than the original tumor. In view of the cytological instability and the difference in transplantation behavior of hybrid tumors, it is con-cluded that tumors are not good ma-terial for the study of somatic mutations.

The results have been compared with those for <b>coisogenic</b> normal lens used as a control. In both, the first positive reaction was detectable at identical stages of lens development.

However, the stalk leading to the lens epithelium did not show any reaction. Appearance of vacuoles in the lens nucleus and cortex marked the beginning of degeneration of fibres which otherwise showed strong fluorescence.

40|$|Topoisomerase II (Top 2) is an {{essential}} protein that resolves DNA catenations. When Top 2 is inactivated, mitotic catastrophe results from massive entanglement of chromosomes. Top 2 is also the target of many first-line anticancer drugs, the so-called Top 2 poisons. Often, tumors become resistant to these drugs by acquiring hypomorphic mutations in the genes encoding Top 2. Here, we have compared the cell cycle and nuclear segregation of two <b>coisogenic</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying top 2 thermosensitive alleles that differ in their resistance to Top 2 poisons: the broadly-used poison-sensitive top 2 - 4 and the poison-resistant top 2 - 5. Furthermore, we have performed genome-scale synthetic genetic array (SGA) analyses for both alleles under permissive conditions, chronic sublethal Top 2 downregulation, and acute, yet transient, Top 2 inactivation. We find that slowing down mitotic progression, especially {{at the time of}} execution of the mitotic exit network (MEN), protects against Top 2 deficiency. In all conditions, genetic protection was stronger in top 2 - 5; this correlated with cell biology experiments in this mutant, whereby we observed destabilization of both chromatin and ultrafine anaphase bridges by execution of MEN and cytokinesis. Interestingly, whereas transient inactivation of the critical MEN driver Cdc 15 partly suppressed top 2 - 5 lethality, {{this was not the case}} when earlier steps within anaphase were disrupted; i. e., top 2 - 5 cdc 14 - 1. We discuss the basis of this difference and suggest that accelerated progression through mitosis may be a therapeutic strategy to hypersensitize cancer cells carrying hypomorphic mutations in TOP 2...|$|E
40|$|A newly {{discovered}} autosomal recessive mutation, generalized lymphoproliferative disease (gld), in the C 3 H/HeJ strain of mice, determines {{the development of}} early onset massive lymphoid hyperplasia with autoimmunity. Significant lymph node enlargement is apparent as early as 12 wk of age. By 20 wk, lymph nodes are 50 -fold heavier than those of <b>coisogenic</b> C 3 H/HeJ-+/+ mice. There is a concomitant increase {{in the numbers of}} peripheral blood lymphocytes. Analysis of C 3 H-gld lymph node lymphocyte subsets by immunofluorescence indicates an increase in numbers of B cells, T cells, and null (Thy- 1 -, sIg-) lymphocytes by 6 -, 15 -, and 33 -fold compared with congeneic control mice. Serologically, gld/gld mice develop antinuclear antibodies (including anti-dsDNA), thymocyte-binding autoantibody, and hypergammaglobulinemia with major increases in several immunoglobulin isotypes. Mutant gld mice live only one-half as long as normal controls (12 and 23 mo, respectively). Interstitial pneumonitis was found in virtually all C 3 H-gld mice autopsied when moribund. Although immune complexes were detected in the glomerulus by immunofluorescence techniques, only 14 % of the autopsied mice had significant lupus-like nephritis. Vascular disease was not found. The pattern of early onset massive lymph node enlargement, hypergammaglobulinemia, and production of antinuclear autoantibodies resembles the basic abnormal phenotype induced by the lpr (lymphoproliferation) mutation. The mutations gld and lpr are not allelic. Linkage studies indicate that gld is located between Pep- 3 and Lp on chromosome 1. This new mutation adds another genetically well-defined model to the list of murine lymphoproliferative/autoimmune disorders that may be exploited to gain a clearer understanding of immunoregulatory defects and for identifying common pathogenetic factors involved in systemic autoimmune diseases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coisogenic</b> diabetes-resistant (DR) BB rats are not lymphopenic and {{are free}} of {{spontaneous}} autoimmune disease, but become diabetic in response to depletion of RT 6 � T cells. The basis for the predisposition to autoimmunity in BB rats is unknown. Abnormal T cell development in DP-BB rats can be detected intrathymically, and thymocytes from DR-BB rats adoptively transfer diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these T cell developmental abnormalities are not known. To study these processes, we established adult thymus organ cultures (ATOC). We report that cultured DR- and DP-BB rat thymi generate mature CD 4 and CD 8 single-positive cells with up-regulated TCRs. DR-BB rat cultures also generate T cells that express RT 6. In contrast, DP-BB rat cultures generate fewer CD 4 �, CD 8 �, and RT 6 � T cells. Analysis of the cells obtained from ATOC suggested that the failure of cultured DP-BB rat thymi to generate T cells with a mature phenotype {{is due in part}} to an increased rate of apoptosis. Consistent with this inference, we observed that addition of the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK substantially increases the number of both mature and immature T cells produced by DP-BB rat ATOC. We conclude that cultured DR-BB and DP-BB rat thymi, respectively, recapitulate the normal and abnormal T cell developmental kinetics and phenotypes observed in these animals in vivo. Such cultures should facilitate identification of the underlying pathological processes that lead to immune dysfunction and autoimmunity in BB rats.

40|$|Transglutaminase type 2 (TG 2) {{has been}} {{reported}} to be a candidate gene for maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) because three different mutations that impair TG 2 transamidase activity have been found in 3 families with MODY. TG 2 null (TG 2 (-/-)) mice have been reported to be glucose intolerant and have impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Here we rigorously evaluated the role of TG 2 in glucose metabolism using independently generated murine models of genetic TG 2 disruption, which show no compensatory enhanced expression of other TGs in pancreatic islets or other tissues. First, we subjected chow- or fat-fed congenic SV 129 or C 57 BL/ 6 wild type (WT) and TG 2 (-/-) littermates, to oral glucose gavage. Blood glucose and serum insulin levels were similar for both genotypes. Pancreatic islets isolated from these animals and analysed in vitro for GSIS and cholinergic potentiation of GSIS, showed no significant difference between genotypes. Results from intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) were similar for both genotypes. Second, we directly investigated the role of TG 2 transamidase activity in insulin secretion using a <b>coisogenic</b> model that expresses a mutant form of TG 2 (TG 2 (R 579 A)), which is constitutively active for transamidase activity. Intraperitoneal GTTs and ITTs revealed no significant differences between WT and TG 2 (R 579 A/R 579 A) mice. Given that neither deletion nor constitutive activation of TG 2 transamidase activity altered basal responses, or responses to a glucose or insulin challenge, our data indicate that glucose homeostasis in mice is TG 2 independent, and question a link between TG 2 and diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Several {{murine leukemia}} viruses (MuLV) induce {{neurologic}} disease in susceptible mice. To identify features of {{central nervous system}} (CNS) infection that correlate with neurovirulence, we compared two neurovirulent MuLV, Fr 98 and Fr 98 /SE, with a nonneurovirulent MuLV, Fr 54. All three viruses utilize the polytropic receptor and are <b>coisogenic,</b> each containing a different envelope gene within a common genetic background. Both Fr 98 and Fr 98 /SE induce a clinical neurologic disease characterized by hyperexcitability and ataxia yet differ in incubation period, 16 to 30 and 30 to 60 days, respectively. Fr 54 infects the CNS but fails to induce clinical signs of neurologic disease. In this study, we compared the histopathology, regional virus distribution, and cell tropism in the brain, {{as well as the}} relative CNS viral burdens. All three viruses induced similar histopathologic effects, characterized by intense reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation associated with minimal vacuolar degeneration. The infected target cells for each virus consisted primarily of endothelial and microglial cells, with rare oligodendrocytes. Infection localized predominantly in white matter tracts of the cerebellum, internal capsule, and corpus callosum. The only feature that correlated with relative neurovirulence was viral burden as measured by both viral CA protein expression in cerebellar homogenates and quantification of infected cells. Interestingly, Fr 54 (nonneurovirulent) and Fr 98 /SE (slow disease) had similar viral burdens at 3 weeks postinoculation, suggesting that they entered the brain with comparable efficiencies. However, spread of Fr 98 /SE within the brain thereafter exceeded that of Fr 54, reaching levels of viral burden comparable to that seen for Fr 98 (rapid disease) at 3 weeks. These results suggest that the determinants of neurovirulence in the envelope gene may influence the efficiency of virus spread within the brain and that a critical number of infected cells may be required for induction of clinical neurologic disease...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Previously, several {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) that influence age-related retinal degeneration (ageRD) were demonstrated in {{a cross between}} the C 57 BL/ 6 J-c 2 J and BALB/cByJ strains (B x C). In this study, as a complementary approach to ongoing recombinant progeny testing {{for the purpose of}} identifying candidate {{quantitative trait}} genes (QTG), a second test cross using the A/J and the pigmented C 57 BL/ 6 J strains (A x B) was carried out. The albino A/J strain was selected because it had the most amount of ageRD among several inbred strains tested, and the pigmented C 57 BL/ 6 J strain was selected because along with its <b>coisogenic</b> counterpart C 57 BL/ 6 J-c 2 J it had the least amount of ageRD. Thus, the effect of pigment on ageRD could be tested {{at the same time that}} the C 57 BL/ 6 genetic background was kept in common between the crosses from the two studies for the purpose of comparison. Methods: A non-reciprocal F 1 intercross between the A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 J strains produced 170 F 2 progeny. At 8 months of age after being maintained in relatively dim light, F 2 mice, control mice and mice of other strains were evaluated for retinal degeneration by measurement of the thickness of the outer nuclear layer of the retina. The F 2 mice were genotyped with dinucleotide repeat markers spanning the genome. Correlation of genotype with phenotype was made with Map Manager QTX software. Results: Comparison of several strains of mice including the pigmented strains 129 S 1 /SvImJ and C 57 BL/ 6 J and the albino strains A/J, NZW/LacJ, BALB/cByJ and C 57 BL/ 6 J-c 2 J, showed significant differences in ageRD.

40|$|The W/Kit mouse locus, {{affecting}} {{proliferation and}} survival of pigment cells, blood cells, and germ cells, {{is known to}} encode a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor and is considered a protooncogene; yet it has not heretofore been causally implicated in any malignancies of those cells. The Wf/Wf mutant mouse coat comprises viable and inviable melanoblast clones, seen ultimately as pigmented and white transverse stripes [...] the latter more prominent. Judging from the pattern, all clones initially expand, and the inviable ones then undergo programmed cell death prenatally. To observe skin melanocytes of the viable clones during extended proliferation, the cells were explanted from individual young mice. An unusually large number of primary explants failed to survive [...] a result consistent with a growth handicap. In 3 of the 10 surviving cell lines, many cells spontaneously underwent a series of striking changes with the classic features of transformation. The two transformed lines that have been tested by grafting to immunosuppressed hosts formed undifferentiated invasive tumors compatible with malignant amelanotic melanoma. None of our 52 other melanocyte lines of the <b>coisogenic</b> wild-type strain and 13 other natural genotypes have become transformed under the same culture conditions. Molecular analysis of the Wf gene revealed a single change from wild-type: a point mutation affecting the catalytic region in the kinase domain of the Kit protein. The apparent growth disadvantage due to the mutation may allow selection for melanocytes mobilizing more efficient pathways, thus leading to neoplasia. Production of both viable and inviable melanoblast clones {{is unlikely to be}} due only to the kinase mutation; possibly the degree, duration, and consistency of expression of this locus may be controlled by cis elements outside the coding region...|$|E
