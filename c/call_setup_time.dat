This information can be passed between the network and the user end-point at call set-up time. In North America, ISDN is now used mostly {{as an alternative to}} analog connections, most commonly for Internet access. Some of the services envisioned as being delivered over ISDN are now delivered over the Internet instead. In Europe, and in Germany in particular, ISDN has been successfully marketed as a phone with features, as opposed to a POTS phone with few or no features. Meanwhile, features that were first available with ISDN (such as Three-Way Calling, Call Forwarding, Caller ID, etc.) are now commonly available for ordinary analog phones as well, eliminating this advantage of ISDN. Another advantage of ISDN was the possibility of multiple simultaneous calls (one call per B channel), e.g. for big families, but with the increased popularity and reduced prices of mobile telephony this has become less interesting as well, making ISDN unappealing to the private customer. However, ISDN is typically more reliable than POTS, and has a significantly faster <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> <b>time</b> compared with POTS, and IP connections over ISDN typically have some 30-35ms round trip time, as opposed to 120-180ms (both measured with otherwise unused lines) over 56k or V.34/V.92 modems, making ISDN more reliable and more efficient for telecommuters.|$|E

Node mobility and dynamic hop number changes between nodes are considered the main routing problems within MANET routing protocols.

40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{auxiliary}} strategy, called per-user forwarding, for locating users who move {{from place to}} place while using Personal Communications Services (PCS). The forwarding strategy augments the basic location strategy proposed in existing standards such as GSM and IS- 41, with the objective of reducing network signalling and database loads in exchange for increased CPU processing and memory costs. The key observation behind forwarding is that if users change PCS registration areas frequently but receive calls relatively infrequently, {{it should be possible to}} avoid registrations at the Home Location Register (HLR) database, by simply setting up a forwarding pointer from the previous Visitor Location Register (VLR). Calls to a given user will first query the user's HLR to determine the first VLR which the user was registered at, and then follow a chain of forwarding pointers to the user's current VLR. We use a reference PCS architecture and the notion of a user's call-to-mobility ratio (CMR) to quantify the costs and benefits of using forwarding and classes of users for whom it would be beneficial. We show that under a variety of assumptions forwarding is likely to yield significant net benefits in terms of reduced signalling network traffic and database loads for certain classes of users. For instance, under certain cost assumptions, for users with CMRG 0 : 5, forwarding can result in 20 ^ 60 % savings over the basic strategy. This net benefit is due to the significant saving in location update compared to a penalty of moderately increased <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> for the infrequent occasions when these users do receive calls. 197 An auxiliary user location strategy employing forwarding pointers to reduce network impacts of PC...|$|R

The proposed approach attempts to combine the benefits of both preferred neighbor and flooding approaches {{in a way to}} improve all the three performance metrics simultaneously. This is achieved by probing k different paths in parallel, for a channel, by employing different heuristics on each path. Also, the proposed approach uses a notion called intermediate destinations (ID’s), which are subset of nodes along the least-cost path between source and destination of a call, {{in order to reduce the}} excessive resource reservations while probing for a channel by releasing unused resources between ID’s and initiating parallel probes at every ID. Further, it has the flexibility of adapting to different load conditions by its nature of using different heuristics in parallel, and hence, a path found for a channel would have different segments (a segment is a path between two successive ID’s), and each of these segments would very well be selected by different heuristics. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been studied through simulation for well-known network topologies for a wide range of quality-of-service and traffic parameters. The simulation results reveal that the average call acceptance rate offered by the proposed route-selection approach is better than that of both the flooding and preferred neighbor approaches, and the average <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> <b>time</b> and routing distance offered by it are very close to that of the flooding approach.

40|$|The {{sliding window}} {{algorithm}} proposed for determining an optimal sliding window {{does not consider}} the waiting <b>times</b> of <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> requests of a mobile station in queue at a Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) in the Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communication Network. This study proposes a model integrating the sliding window algorithm with a single server finite queuing model, referred to as integrated model for measurement of realistic throughput of a MSC considering the waiting <b>times</b> of <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> requests. It assumes that a MSC can process one <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> request at a time. It is useful in determining an optimal sliding window size that maximizes the realistic throughput of a MSC. Though the model assumes that a MSC can process one <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> request at a time, its scope can be extended for measuring the realistic throughput of a MSC that can process multiple <b>call</b> <b>setup</b> requests at a time...|$|R
