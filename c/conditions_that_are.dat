5|$|Geysers are {{temporary}} geological features. Geysers {{are generally}} associated with volcanic areas.

5|$|Other <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{closely linked}} to {{cerebellar}} degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, {{mushrooms}} occur predominantly on decaying petioles of the palm Phenix roeberenii. The fungus requires a proper range of humidity to form mushrooms; for example, on Hachijo Island, fruiting only occurs in the rainy seasons in June/July and September/October when the relative humidity is around 88%, usually the day after rain falls. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} mushroom primordia that are too wet become deformed, while <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> too dry cause the caps to warp and break because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E
5|$|In general, La Niña {{events are}} {{associated}} with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to El Niño events. This {{is due to a}} stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in cyclonic activity (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates <b>conditions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> favourable for bringing cold air from the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia (associated with the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing cold air from the south. Thus, invasions of cold air from the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during El Niño events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of cold air from the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of cold air in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to more frequent and intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, El Niño events lead to more frequent and intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). Cold air anomalies arising from El Niño events are observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in insolation. For the southern parts of the country, El Niño events {{are associated with}} more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, El Niño events are associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country.|$|E
