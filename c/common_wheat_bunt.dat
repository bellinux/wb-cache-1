40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>bunt</b> (caused by {{the fungus}} Tilletia caries or Tilletia foetida) {{is a disease}} whose {{incidence}} is clearly {{on the rise in}} organic farming, jeopardising the balance of the French organic cereal sector. Control methods adapted to organic farming must be found, especially since we know that no seed treatment is 100 % effective. The use of varietal resistance appears particularly promising for limiting the spread of the disease. Since 2000, an experiment whose purpose is to assess the resistance of soft wheat varieties to Tilletia caries is conducted each year by the French plant institute, ARVALIS. These experiments make it possible to identify the existence of a wide behavioural variability with respect to this pathogen among the different varieties grown in France. However, no variety corresponding to the specific criteria imposed by organic agriculture has yet to show adequate levels of resistance. At the same time, a European testing network revealed a strong genotype X environment interaction, emphasizing the necessity of consolidating these initial observations by increasing the number of test sites and by identifying virulence genes present in France as well as resistance genes present in the different varieties...|$|E

30|$|Volatile {{compounds}} {{are typically}} lipophilic liquids with high vapor pressures. These are lethal {{to a wide}} variety of plant and human pathogenic fungi and bacteria and are also effective against nematodes and certain insects (Strobel 2006 and Grimme et al. 2007) (Table 1). Emission of volatiles by bacteria and fungi has been known and reviewed by many authors for a long time (Kai et al. 2009). Volatile production is species-specific and serve as info chemicals for inter-and intra-organismic communication, cell-to-cell communication signals, a possible carbon release valve, or growth-promoting or growth-inhibiting agents (Kai et al. 2009). The inhibitory mode of action, when it involves one plant pathogen among interacting organisms, will be of interest in biological control. Strobel et al. (2001) reported that the volatiles produced by endophytic fungus M. albus inhibited the germination of the teliospores of Tilletia horrida, T. indica, and T. tritici (pathogenic fungi cause the plant diseases rice kernel smut, <b>wheat</b> kernel <b>bunt</b> and <b>wheat</b> <b>common</b> <b>bunt,</b> respectively). The VOC molecules produced from M. albus were 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl-acetate, esters, alcohols, acids, lipids, and ketones. The most effective class of inhibitory compounds tested against fungi was the esters, of which 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl-acetate was the most biologically active, reducing growth of Cercospora beticola, Fusarium solani, Pythium ultimum, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Tapesia yallundae, and Xylaria sp. (Strobel et al. 2001). An endophytic isolate of Gliocladium sp. was obtained from the Patagonian Eucryphiacean tree (Eucryphia cordifolia), producing a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) lethal to plant pathogenic fungi such as Pythium ultimum and Verticillium dahliae. Some of the volatile bioactive compounds exuded by Gliocladium sp. (1 -butanol, 3 -methyl-, phenylethyl alcohol and acetic acid, 2 -phenylethyl ester, and various propanoic acid esters) are also produced by Muscodor albus, a well-known volatile antimicrobial producer (Stinson et al. 2003).|$|R

In 2007 – 08 stem rust was absent in all locations tested except Montelibretti (Rome, Central Italy), where two <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties “Arsenal” and “Compair” had stem rust infections. Two stem rust pathotypes were identified by testing in the greenhouse a set of differential lines/varieties carrying known genes for resistance to Puccinia graminis. These pathotypes corresponded to races MSK and PTK {{on the basis of the}} North American classification system. Genes Sr 24 and Sr 25 (both derived from Thinopyrum ponticum) and Sr 31 (from Secale cereale), were resistant to the Italian pathotypes, and the lines carrying Sr 38 (from Triticum ventricosum) were susceptible.

Here, we investigated transcripts in <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> developing caryopses using the emerging single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology PacBio RSII, and assessed the resultant data for improving <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> genome annotation and grain transcriptome research. Results We obtained 197, 709 full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) reads, 74. 6  % {{of which were}} estimated to carry complete open reading frame. A total of 91, 881 high-quality FLNC reads were identified and mapped to 16, 188 chromosomal loci, corresponding to 13, 162 known genes and 3026 new genes not annotated previously. Although some FLNC reads could not be unambiguously mapped to the current draft genome sequence, {{many of them are}} likely useful for studying highly similar homoeologous or paralogous loci or for improving chromosomal contig assembly in further research. The 91, 881 high-quality FLNC reads represented 22, 768 unique transcripts, 9591 of which were newly discovered. We found 180 transcripts each spanning two or three previously annotated adjacent loci, suggesting that they should be merged to form correct gene models. Finally, our data facilitated the identification of 6030 genes differentially regulated during caryopsis development, and full-length transcripts for 72 transcribed gluten gene members that are important for the end-use quality control of <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> Conclusions Our work demonstrated the value of PacBio transcript sequencing for improving <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> genome annotation through uncovering the loci and full-length transcripts not discovered previously.

The main objectives of this study were to compare the yield potential and growth characteristics of spring spelt wheat to that of <b>common</b> spring <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) in central Saskatchewan, using growth analysis; to investigate the response of spring spelt to seeding date; and to determine the effect of the hulls of spelt on seedling emergence and establishment under adverse temperature and moisture conditions. The seeding rate and growth analysis experiment was conducted in the field using two spring spelt cultivars (CDC Bavaria and PGR 8801) and a <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivar (Katepwa) at four seeding rates ranging from 150 to 450 seeds/m 2 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1995 and 1996. The response of spring spelt and <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> to seeding date was measured from late April to early June under field conditions over two years. The role of spelt hulls on seed germination, seedling emergence and crop establishment was studied under field conditions using an early (late April) and a late (early June) date of seeding over two years. Seed germination, seedling establishment and seed water uptake were studied under controlled environment conditions at water potentials ranging from 0 to - 1. 8 MPa, at temperatures of 9, 16 and 23 °C. The field studies indicated that spring spelt can produce grain yield comparable to <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> The same seeding rate as <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> (150 to 250 seeds/m 2) can be used for spring spelt wheat in central Saskatchewan. Spring spelt has a higher leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD) and crop growth rate (CGR) than <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> giving rise to 24 per cent higher biological yield for spring spelt compared to that of <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> Optimal seeding date for spring spelt is late April to early May; with later seeding spring spelt's grain yield tends to decrease. Seedling establishment for spring spelt is lower and less stable than <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> though this variation in seedling plant density does not influence the final grain yield. Controlled environment studies indicated that the hull of spring spelt wheat acts as an obstacle to water uptake, leading to an approximate 25 per cent slower water uptake rate compared to naked seeds. The hull has negative impact on seed germination and seedling emergence. The negative impact of the hull on seed water uptake, seed germination and seedling emergence increases under drought conditions. Thus, only under sufficiently wet soil conditions may using hulled seed as the propagule lead to comparable establishment of spring spelt relative to <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> In conclusion, spring spelt can be grown successfully in central Saskatchewan, producing a comparable grain yield to <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> provided it is seeded before mid-May...|$|R
