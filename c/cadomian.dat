25|$|Around 600 {{million years}} ago, the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny (mountain {{building}} period) created mountains {{in what would}} subsequently become England, along with much of north west Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Breton {{peninsula}} appeared {{during the}} <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny, which formed its northern coastline, between Guingamp and Fougères. The southern part emerged during the Hercynian orogeny. At the same time, an intense volcanic activity left large quantities of granite. Between the <b>Cadomian</b> and Hercynian periods, the region was submerged several times and the sea left fossils and sedimentary rocks, mostly schist and sandstone. Because {{of the absence of}} limestone, soils in Brittany are usually acid. The Armorican massif straightened and flattened several times during the formation of the Pyrenees and the Alps. Changes in sea levels and climate led to a strong erosion and to the formation of more sedimentary rocks. Metamorphism is responsible for the distinctive local blue schist and for the rich subsoil of the Groix island, which comprises glaucophane and epidote.|$|E
25|$|Fougères is {{situated}} in the <b>Cadomian</b> chain. The oldest buildings use readily available stone: la cornéenne. A metamorphic rock, difficult to cut and of very different appearance, it is very solid. Later came the use of Louvigné granite, which is more homogeneous. Most of the buildings of the town are built with these local materials. It took {{the arrival of the}} railway to import other stones (late 19th century). In military strategy, note that the castle is not on high, but on a deposit of la cornéenne, which prevents the risk of attacks by mining and from underground.|$|E
2500|$|Nantes {{is built}} on the Armorican Massif, a range of {{weathered}} mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching {{from the end of}} the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the sedimentary Paris Basin, are composed of several parallel ridges of Ordovician and <b>Cadomian</b> rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays. The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark [...] above sea level; its foothills are at an elevation of [...]|$|E

5000|$|The pre <b>Cadomian</b> {{basement}} rocks {{consist of}} Orosirian or Paleoproterozoic Icart gneiss dated {{at close to}} [...] These are exposed on Guernsey and at Cape La Hague in Brittany. This is termed the Icartian succession. Near Trégor the gneiss in the <b>Cadomian</b> Perros-Guirec complex has been U-Pb dated to [...] Sark also has a gneiss basement. Vidal et al. studied Strontium isotope ratios {{and concluded that the}} basement is not widely present below the <b>Cadomian</b> orogeny, and Rabu et al. argued that the existing surface gneiss are fragments detached from the African craton. However it is possible that a basement of gneiss exists at depth below Normandy and Brittany. This gneiss was formerly known as Pentevrian. However it is now known that the Pentevrian type rocks do not predate the <b>Cadomian</b> orogeny, and this name is no longer appropriate for the Icart Gneiss.|$|E
50|$|There are two overall {{models for}} the {{formation}} of the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny.|$|E
5000|$|After the orogeny, {{continental}} sediments were washed {{on top of}} the deformed <b>Cadomian</b> rocks. They include conglomerate and sandstone in Brittany, Jersey and Alderney. The Cap Frehel red {{beds are}} dated at [...] These post orogeny deposits were dumped from braided stream channels. The basins for these sediments followed the structural grain in the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny.|$|E
50|$|Sark {{is made up}} {{mainly of}} {{amphibolite}} and granite gneiss rocks, intruded by igneous magma sheets called quartz diorite. Recent (1990-2000) geological studies and rock age dating by geologists from Oxford Brookes University shows that the gneisses probably formed around 620-600 million years ago during the Late Pre-Cambrian Age <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny. The quartz diorite sheets were intruded during this <b>Cadomian</b> deformation and metamorphic event.|$|E
50|$|The older rocks were {{deformed}} {{during the}} <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny. The Icart Gneisses formed the basement to an outboard terrane that was subsequently accreted to Armorica.|$|E
50|$|Around 600 {{million years}} ago, the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny (mountain {{building}} period) created mountains {{in what would}} subsequently become England, along with much of north west Europe.|$|E
50|$|The subsoil {{consists}} of old sedimentary deposits of schist and sandstone. These deposits {{came after the}} <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny, and they were deformed by the tectonic activity.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{rocks are}} Proterozoic, metamorphosed sediments. They have been {{deformed}} by the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny. There are volcanics and further sediments {{from the end}} of the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} radiometric results were, however, {{not confirmed}} by the SHRIMP-method (only Ordovician ages between 477 and 471 million years were found). The <b>Cadomian</b> origin of the basement is therefore uncertain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{approach}} of Gondwana from the South onto the <b>cadomian</b> microcontinent Armorica (and farther east onto the Saxothuringian Mid-German Crystalline Rise) induced a continental collision slicing the basement into several large-scale nappes and thrusting them into southerly directions.|$|E
50|$|A further {{consequence}} of the intrusive character of the orthogneisses resides in the fact, that the underlying paragneisses, once considered to be also of <b>Cadomian</b> age, now have to {{be attributed to the}} Canaveilles Group. Most likely these metagreywackes only have undergone a higher degree of metamorphism.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{rocks of}} the massif are Neoproterozoic sediments of the Brioverian Supergroup which were {{deformed}} and metamorphosed during the <b>Cadomian</b> orogeny. These are overlain by lower Paleozoic (Cambrian to Devonian) (meta-)sediments. The whole sequence was deformed, metamorphosed and intruded by felsic magmas during the Hercynian orogeny.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cadomian</b> {{magmatism}} {{has been}} dated in the intrusions and volcanics as [...] Foliated quartz diorite occur at Baie de St Brieuc, at Coutances, La Hague, Guernsey, Alderney and Sark. These are only roughly dated [...] The last magmatism identified is the Jersey Dyke Swarm from [...]|$|E
5000|$|The La Hague {{area has}} precambrian granite and gneiss cliffs, several coves and small fields {{surrounded}} by hedges. France's oldest rocks {{are to be}} found on its coast in Jobourg. Other rocky outcroppings on the coast include <b>Cadomian</b> granite in Auderville [...] and Variscan granite in Flamanville ...|$|E

50|$|Since several {{revisions}} of the intrusion age of the orthogneisses now all find a lower Ordovician age of 474 million years for the last cristallisation on zircons, {{the concept of a}} <b>Cadomian</b> basement has become highly questionable. This also casts doubts on the presumed isoclinal fold structure, yet the nappes and later deformations rest established.|$|E
50|$|Tectonostratigraphically, gneisses (high-grade {{metamorphic}} rocks) and granites {{are found}} under these metasediments. They crop {{out as the}} competent massifs of the Ore Mountains and Saxonian Granulite Massif. They were deformed and recrystallized during the <b>Cadomian</b> orogeny (in the Ediacaran, 650-550 million years ago) and intruded by felsic plutons during the Cambrian and Ordovician (540-420 million years ago).|$|E
50|$|The geology of Jersey is characterised by the Late Proterozoic Brioverian volcanics, the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny, {{and only}} small signs of later {{deposits}} from the Cambrian and Quaternary periods. The kind of rocks go from conglomerate to shale, volcanic, intrusive and plutonic igneous rocks of many compositions, and metamorphic rocks as well, thus including most major types.|$|E
5000|$|The Iberian plate {{came into}} {{existence}} during the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny of the late Neoproterozoic, about 650-550 Ma, on {{the margin of the}} Gondwana continent, involving the collisions and accretion of the island arcs of the Central Iberian Plate, Ossa-Morena Plate, South Portuguese Plate. The three plates have never separated substantially from each other since that time [...]|$|E
5000|$|The massif is {{composed}} of crystalline basement (metamorphic and igneous rocks) with Proterozoic to early Paleozoic ages. It was deformed and metamorphosed during the <b>Cadomian</b> orogeny (Ediacaran, about [...] ago) and Caledonian orogeny (Silurian, about [...] ). This basement is almost everywhere overlain by younger sedimentary rocks, except for some places in the southwest of England and in Wales.|$|E
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of metamorphosed crystalline {{rock in the}} Western Carpathians is known from the Tatric, Veporic, Gemeric, and Zemplinic zones. Existing research has clearly demonstrated traces of the Hercynian and Alpine orogeny. Although some authors suggest the possible presence of the older <b>Cadomian</b> or Caledonian metamorphic cycles, existence of the Precambrian metamorphic cycles was not confirmed because of the later metamorphic overprint.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basement}} {{consists of}} folded rocks, {{some of which}} are metamorphic rocks, mostly of marine-sedimentary and submarine-volcanic origin, intruded by granitoid plutons. Most of these rocks are of late Carboniferous age or older. Folding and metamorphism of these sedimentary and volcanic rocks, and the emplacement of the granitoids, occurred mainly in two Paleozoic orogenies: the Caledonian Orogeny in the Late Ordovician and the Variscan Orogeny in the early Carboniferous. In the oldest folded Variscan rocks, evidence exists of an older orogeny, the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny, which occurred before the accretion of the crustal blocks of Proto-Europe (Baltica) (German: [...] ). The folded basement rocks originated in the Proterozoic, but even older relics of continental crust are found in a paragneiss of the Bavarian Forest, the protolith of which was probably deposited subsequent to the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny. A sample of this paragneiss contains a detrital zircon grain, whose core crystallised from a magma during the Archean eon, before about 3.48 billion years ago.|$|E
50|$|In Gondwana, England and Wales {{were near}} a {{subduction}} zone. Both countries were largely submerged under a shallow sea studded with volcanic islands. The remains of these islands underlie much of central England with small outcrops visible in many places. Around 600 Ma, the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny (mountain building period) caused the English and Welsh landscape {{to be transformed}} into a mountainous region, along with much of north west Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} edge of the Gulf of Saint-Malo between Tregor and Cancale shows the deformational structures of the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny. These are East-west to North East trending upright folding. Schistosity is developed parallel to the axial plane of the folds. Prehnite-pumpellyite facies to mid-amphibolite facies have been produced by metamorphism. Movement was concentrated in shear belts such as at St Cast. The movement on the belts was sinistral and horizontal.|$|E
5000|$|The Timan Ridge (Тиманский кряж [...] - [...] Timansky Kryazh) lies {{west of the}} Northern Ural mountains. It strikes northwest-southeast, {{extending}} from the settlement of Troitsko-Pechorsk to the Kanin Peninsula. This ridge can be correlated with outcrops on the Varanger Peninsula which together form the Timan-Varanger belt.The Timan-Varanger belt consists of Neoproterozoic (late Precambrian) sediments that were metamorphosed and deformed during the Timanian (or Baikalian) orogeny, a late Neoproterozoic mountain-building event coincident with the <b>Cadomian</b> orogeny in western Europe.|$|E
50|$|Its {{name comes}} from the old Armorica, a Gaul area between the Loire and the Seine rivers. The massif is {{composed}} of metamorphic and magmatic rocks that were metamorphosed and/or deformed during the Hercynian or Variscan orogeny (400 to 280 million years ago) and the earlier <b>Cadomian</b> orogeny (650 to 550 million years ago). The region was uplifted when the Bay of Biscay opened during the Cretaceous period. The Cantabrian Mountains and the Armorican Massif were then rift shoulders of the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5000|$|The {{southern}} part is largely composed of Icart Gneiss. The Icart Gneiss is an augen gneiss of granitic composition containing potassium feldspar. This was formed from a granite dated at [...] using U-Pb dating on zircon grains. A foliated Perelle quartz diorite (also called Perelle Gneiss), {{occurs in the}} centre and west of the island. This is a calc-alkaline tonalitic rock. The foliation was formed at around [...] during the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny. Rafts of metamorphosed sediments, older than the Foliated Perelle Diorite are embedded between them.|$|E
50|$|Fougères is {{situated}} in the <b>Cadomian</b> chain. The oldest buildings use readily available stone: la cornéenne. A metamorphic rock, difficult to cut and of very different appearance, it is very solid. Later came the use of Louvigné granite, which is more homogeneous. Most of the buildings of the town are built with these local materials. It took {{the arrival of the}} railway to import other stones (late 19th century). In military strategy, note that the castle is not on high, but on a deposit of la cornéenne, which prevents the risk of attacks by mining and from underground.|$|E
50|$|Later, when plate {{tectonics}} became generally accepted, the term Pan-African {{was extended to}} all of the supercontinent Gondwana. Because the formation of Gondwana encompassed several continents and extended from the Neoproterzoic to the early Palaeozoic, Pan-African could no longer be considered a single orogeny, but rather an orogenic cycle that included the opening and closing of several large oceans and the collisions of several continental blocks. Furthermore, the Pan-African events are contemporaneous with the <b>Cadomian</b> orogeny in Europe and the Baikalian orogeny in Asia, and crust from these areas were probably part of Pannotia (i.e. Gondwana when it first formed) during the Precambrian.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next stage}} of {{geological}} history was the intrusion of the Central Diorite Complex that makes up the north and centre of the island. This belongs to the <b>Cadomian</b> Orogeny time at [...] Embedded in the diorite {{are a couple of}} large gabbro inclusions, as well as a picrite on the east of Braye Bay. Some of the diorite has orbicular structure, concentric spheres of plagioclase and hornblende rich zones form balls up to 20 cm in diameter. A pale coloured granite intruded on the north: the Bibette Head Granite. This contains many xenoliths. Sodium rich dykes then were intruded.|$|E
50|$|Nantes {{is built}} on the Armorican Massif, a range of {{weathered}} mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching {{from the end of}} the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the sedimentary Paris Basin, are composed of several parallel ridges of Ordovician and <b>Cadomian</b> rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays. The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark 38 m above sea level; its foothills are at an elevation of 15 m.|$|E
