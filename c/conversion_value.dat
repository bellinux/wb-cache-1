Furthermore the final conversion (polymerization degree) of PAI was determined under isothermal conditions, simulating three programs with the post-curing temperatures set as 215, 240 and 270 °C.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} about the reliability of using the Exothane monomers as polymeric matrix of dental adhesive materials. So, experimental adhesive systems containing these monomers were prepared. It is already known that a satisfactory performance of polymeric dental materials is directly correlated to a proper polymerization reaction of monomers in polymer [7, 12, 14]. Interestingly, within the degree of conversion results obtained from each resin bond formulated it is possible to verify that some Exothanes acquired excellent <b>conversion</b> <b>values</b> (Figure  1). In fact, adhesives containing the Exothanes 8, 9, and 32 showed almost full polymerization, and according to Ferracane (2006) [7] how greater the degree of conversion, higher the material’s stability to the hydrolysis degradation phenomena. This will probably generate a long-durable material with improved physic-mechanical properties [15].

Located beside the NaI(Tl) detector in Ottawa is a radioxenon analyzer [2] that measures the activity concentration of 131 m, 133 m, 133, 135 Xe directly. The ICRU-accepted KERMA to activity concentration conversion factor for 133 Xe, for a semi-infinite cloud measured 1 m off the ground, is 9. 68 pGy/hr per Bq/m 3 [3]. However, on various dates, the two detectors in Ottawa reported a <b>conversion</b> <b>value</b> of 2. 6 ± 0. 2 pGy/hr per Bq/m 3; we have resolved this discrepancy [4] and have expanded {{on the study}} of other isotopes by focusing on the NaI(Tl) detector.

40|$|The photopolymerization of {{multifunctional}} acrylates {{leads to}} the formation of a complex and insoluble network due to cross-linking. This characteristic is a useful property for stereolithography applications, where solid parts of the desired shape are cured using a pre-determined energy exposure profile. Traditionally, the required energy exposure is determined using a critical energy [...] depth of penetration, or Ec [...] Dp, model. The parameters Ec and Dp, are usually fit to experimental data at a specific resin composition and cure intensity. As a result, since the Ec [...] Dp model does not explicitly incorporate cure kinetics, it cannot be used for a different set of process conditions without first obtaining experimental data at the new conditions. Thus, the Ec [...] Dp model does not provide any insight when a new process needs to be developed, and the best processing conditions are unknown. The kinetic model for multifunctional acrylate photopolymerization presented here is based on a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which can be used to predict part height versus exposure condition across varying resin compositions. Kinetic parameter information used in the model is obtained by fitting the model to double bond conversion data from Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements. An additional parameter, the critical <b>conversion</b> <b>value,</b> is necessary for determining the formation of a solid part of the desired height. The initial rate of initiation, Ri, combines all the factors that impact part height, and therefore, it is an important quantity that is required in order to find the critical <b>conversion</b> <b>value.</b> The critical <b>conversion</b> <b>value</b> is estimated using the Ri and Tgel value from microrheology measurements. Information about network connectivity, which can be used to get properties such as molecular weight, cannot be derived from models using traditional mass-action kinetics for the cross-linking system. Therefore, in addition to modeling the reaction using the ODE based model, the results from a statistical model based on Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) principles are also shown here. The KMC model is applicable in situations where the impact of chain length on the kinetics or molecular weight evolution is of interest. For the present project, the detailed information from network connectivity was not required to make part height predictions, and the conversion information from the ODE model was sufficient. The final results show that the kinetic ODE model presented here, based on the critical <b>conversion</b> <b>value,</b> captures the impact of process parameters such as initiator concentration, light intensity, and exposure time, on the final part height of the object. In addition, for the case of blanket cure samples, the part height predictions from the ODE model make comparable predictions to the Ec [...] Dp model. Thus, the ODE model presented here is a versatile tool {{that can be used to}} determine optimum operating conditions during process development. M. S.

40|$|A {{network of}} {{connected}} catalytic reactors with periodically switched inlet and outlet sections is numerically studied for reversible exothermic reactions. The methanol synthesis is selected as representative process example and two different switch strategies are {{compared with the}} objective of overcoming the conversion limits imposed by thermodynamic equilibrium. The first strategy, which is the most considered in literature, consists of periodically switching the feed to the second reactor of the current reactor sequence while the second strategy is implemented by periodically switching the feed to the last reactor of the current sequence. Periodic regimes corresponding to single square-like temperature waves travelling over the catalytic bed and characterized by comparable methanol <b>conversion</b> <b>values</b> are detected for both the considered strategies. These regimes exhibit, however, a significantly larger domain of existence for the second strategy. Moreover, the second strategy gives rise to other periodic regimes corresponding to spatiotemporal temperature patterns characterized by different spatial and temporal periodicity.
