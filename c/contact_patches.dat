5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
25|$|To {{straighten}} {{back out}} of the turn, the rider simply reverses the procedure for entering it: cause the bike to lean farther to the left; this causes it to steer farther to the left, which moves the wheel <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> farther to the left, eventually reducing the leftward lean and exiting the turn.|$|E
50|$|Because {{pneumatic}} {{tires are}} flexible, the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> is different when {{the vehicle is}} in motion from when it is static. Because {{it is so much}} easier to make observations of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> without the tire in motion, it is more common to conduct studies of the static <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} analysis of <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> length-rolling resistance, <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> width-rolling resistance and tire deflection-rolling resistance at different wheel load and inflation pressure levels is presented. The experiments were planned in a randomized block design and {{were conducted in}} the controlled conditions provided by a soil bin environment utilizing a well-equipped single wheel-tester of Urmia University, Iran. The image processing technique was used for determination of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> length and <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> width. Analysis of covariance {{was used to evaluate}} the correlations. The highest values of contact length and width and tire deflection occurred at the highest wheel load and lowest tire inflation pressure. <b>Contact</b> <b>patch</b> width is a polynomial (order 2) function of wheel load while there is a linear relationship between tire contact length and wheel load as well as between tire deflection and wheel load. Correlations were developed for the evaluation of <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> length-rolling resistance, <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> width-rolling resistance and tire deflection-rolling resistance. It is concluded that the variables studied {{have a significant effect on}} rolling resistance. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{size and}} shape of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> as well as the {{pressure}} distribution within the <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> are important to the ride qualities and handling characteristics of a vehicle. Since the wear characteristics of tires is a highly competitive area between tire manufacturers, a lot of the research done concerning the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> is considered highly proprietary and, therefore, very little is published on the subject.|$|R

50|$|To {{straighten}} {{back out}} of the turn, the rider simply reverses the procedure for entering it: cause the bike to lean farther to the left; this causes it to steer farther to the left, which moves the wheel <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> farther to the left, eventually reducing the leftward lean and exiting the turn.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycle tyres (tires in American English) are {{the outer}} part of {{motorcycle}} wheels, attached to the rims, providing traction, resisting wear, absorbing surface irregularities, and allowing the motorcycle to turn via countersteering. The two tyres' <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> are the motorcycle's connection to the ground, and so are fundamental to the motorcycle's suspension behaviour, and critically affect safety, braking, fuel economy, noise, and rider comfort.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|R
50|$|The tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> {{is readily}} changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may {{increase}} the wear on the center <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.|$|R
50|$|Because of asymmetries in the {{side-slip}} {{along the}} length of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> the resultant force of this side-slip occurs away from the geometric center of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the single}} wheel {{is in the}} front (the [...] "delta" [...] form, as in a child's pedal tricycle), the vehicle is {{inherently}} unstable in a braking turn, as the combined tipping forces {{at the center of}} gravity from turning and braking can rapidly extend beyond the triangle formed by the <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> of the wheels. This type, if not tipped, also has a greater tendency to spin out ("swap ends") when handled roughly.|$|E
50|$|As {{the truck}} {{features}} a straight-axle arrangement, the TXT-1 is particularly adept at RC-scale rock crawling. In short, the straight-axle system allows the entire axle and chassis to better articulate itself over obstructions while efficiently conforming tire <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> to the ground. As an aside, the wide gear <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> and durable axle construction make the TXT-1 a very durable platform for either high-torque crawling applications or overall high-power brushed or brushless applications. The truck performs {{very well with}} no modifications required {{on a variety of}} surfaces, however some choose to lock differentials, change tire and wheel packages, reduce motor shaft-mounted pinion gear tooth count, mount the shock absorbers directly to the chassis and axle (thereby deleting the cantilever assembly), and reducing parts count and relocating electronic components to reduce weight and make the vehicle's weight distribution more advantageous for rock crawling. Advanced setups include cutting the lower portion of the chassis, changing the motor arrangement significantly (single motor setup with an external gear reduction unit), or changing the length of suspension links to modify caster angles and distances between axles and the chassis.|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to {{the plane of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> or footprint, of the tire, is {{the area}} of the tread that is in contact with the road surface. This area transmits forces between the tire and the road via friction. The length-to-width ratio of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> affects {{steering}} and cornering behavior.|$|R
50|$|All forces {{occurring}} {{between the}} motorcycle {{and the road}} (such as accelerating, decelerating and steering) are transmitted by friction occurring in the <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b> There is {{a limited amount of}} force the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> can transmit before the tire begins to slide. Typically, the forces reduce slightly upon sliding.|$|R
50|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required.

50|$|Motorcycles {{benefit from}} narrow tires with round, canoe-shaped <b>contact</b> <b>patches.</b> Narrow tires are less {{vulnerable}} to aquaplaning because vehicle weight is distributed over a smaller area, and rounded tires more easily push water aside. These advantages diminish on lighter motorcycles with naturally wide tires, {{like those in the}} supersport class. Further, wet conditions reduce the lateral force that any tire can accommodate before sliding. While a slide in a four-wheeled vehicle may be corrected, the same slide on a motorcycle will generally cause the rider to fall. Thus, despite the relative lack of aquaplaning danger in wet conditions, motorcycle riders must be even more cautious because overall traction is reduced by wet roadways.|$|E
5000|$|As with {{deformation}} of a spring, {{deformation of}} the tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> generates a reaction {{force in the}} tire; the cornering force. Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> length gives the total cornering force. Although the term, [...] "tread element" [...] is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the rubber within the <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b> The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance {{is a factor in}} tire construction and inflation pressure.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the problem of {{determining}} the tire-road interaction forces for vehicle dynamic simulations. The work is an attempt to develope a numerical scheme that is universally applicable to all possible running conditions. The tire-road <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> is approximated as a two-dimensional array of nodal points. Properties such as distribution of normal pressure, deflection and stresses over the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> are expressed as sets of the respective nodal values rather than analytical functions. Such a representation enables the treatment of any arbitrary, two-dimensional variation of <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> properties. The representation of non-rectangular <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> shapes and trapezoidal pressure distributions is also discussed. For steady state running conditions the performance of the scheme is compared with that of an existing analytical model. The applicability of the scheme to transient running conditions is also shown...|$|R
5000|$|The {{larger the}} {{inflation}} pressure, {{the smaller the}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Torque {{steering}} is {{the influence}} of engine torque on the steering, especially in front-wheel drive vehicles with transversely mounted engines. For example, during heavy acceleration the steering may pull to one side, which may be disturbing to the driver. The effect is manifested either as a tugging sensation in the steering wheel, or a veering of the vehicle from the intended path. Torque steer {{is directly related to}} differences in the forces in the <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> of the left and right drive wheels. The effect becomes more evident when high torques are applied to the drive wheels either because of a high overall reduction ratio between the engine and wheels, high engine torque, or some combination of the two. Torque steering is distinct from steering kickback.|$|E
50|$|Suspension is {{the system}} of tires, tire air, springs, shock {{absorbers}} and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allows relative motion between the two. Suspension systems must support both roadholding/handling and ride quality, which {{are at odds with}} each other. The tuning of suspensions involves finding the right compromise. It is important for the suspension to keep the road wheel in contact with the road surface as much as possible, because all the road or ground forces acting on the vehicle do so through the <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> of the tires. The suspension also protects the vehicle itself and any cargo or luggage from damage and wear. The design of front and rear suspension of a car may be different.|$|E
50|$|The major {{forces that}} {{accelerate}} a vehicle {{occur at the}} tires' <b>contact</b> <b>patches.</b> Since these forces are not directed through the vehicle's CoM, one or more moments are generated whose forces are the tires' traction forces at pavement level, the other one (equal but opposed) is the mass inertia located at the CoM and the moment arm is the distance from pavement surface to CoM. It is these moments that cause variation in the load distributed between the tires. Often this is interpreted by the casual observer as a pitching or rolling motion of the vehicles body. A perfectly rigid vehicle without suspension that would not exhibit pitching or rolling of the body still undergoes load transfer. However, the pitching and rolling {{of the body of}} a non-rigid vehicle adds some (small) weight transfer due to the (small) CoM horizontal displacement with respect to the wheel's axis suspension vertical travel and also due to deformation of the tires i.e. contact patch displacement relative to wheel.|$|E
5000|$|One {{item that}} is often raised is tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> size and shape. All else being equal, such as tire width, rim width, {{inflation}} pressure and rider weight, the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> of a 29" [...] wheel has the same area and is slightly longer (~5%) {{than that of a}} 26" [...] wheel.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic {{trail is}} caused by the {{progressive}} build-up of lateral force {{along the length of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> such that lateral forces are greater towards the rear of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> (though less so when the rear of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> begins sliding) and this creates a torque on the tire called the self aligning torque. Because the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of a turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, {{these two}} {{properties}} are not linearly {{proportional to the}} area of the contact. For example, a 10% change in load or inflation pressure usually does not result in a 10% change in the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> area. because the load or pressure on a tire can be altered freely, and the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> area is limited by the tire geometry. Further, the size of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> cannot be simply calculated as load divided by inflation pressure, and the average contact pressure a tire has with the road surface is not equal to the inflation pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Spiegel disagrees {{that only}} those who have [...] "gone over", that is, crashed or died, know the {{location}} of the boundary line. He says that if motorcycle racers, or even non-professional advanced riders who ride modern sport bikes near their performance limits, were approaching the limits of traction blindly, they would be like a group of blind men wandering around the top of a building, and most of them would wander off the edge and fall. In fact, Spiegel says, crashes among skilled high speed riders are so infrequent that it must be the case that they can feel where the limit of traction is as they approach the limit, before they lose traction. Spiegel's physiological and psychological experiments helped explore how it is possible for a good rider to extend his perception beyond the controls of his motorcycle out to the interface between the <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> of his motorcycle and the road surface.|$|E
5000|$|Sim {{racing is}} {{generally}} acknowledged to have really taken off in [...] {{with the introduction}} of Papyrus Design Group's Indianapolis 500: The Simulation, designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari on 16-bit computer hardware. The game is often generally regarded as the personal computer's first true auto racing simulation. Unlike most other racing games at the time, Indianapolis 500 attempted to simulate realistic physics and telemetry, such as its portrayal {{of the relationship between the}} four <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> and the pavement, as well as the loss of grip when making a high-speed turn, forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle-to-brake interaction. It also featured a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle, including adjustments to the tires, shocks and wings. With Indy 500, players could race the full 500 mi, where even a blowout after 450 mi would take the player out of the competition. The simulation sold over 200,000 copies. It was around this time that sim racing began distinguishing itself from arcade-style racing.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Atari {{released}} Hard Drivin', another arcade driving {{game that}} used 3D polygonal graphics. It also featured force feedback, where the wheel fights the player during aggressive turns, and a crash replay camera view. That same year, the now defunct Papyrus Design Group produced their {{first attempt at}} a racing simulator, the critically acclaimed Indianapolis 500: The Simulation, designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari. The game is generally regarded as the first true auto racing simulation on a personal computer. Accurately replicating the 1989 Indianapolis 500 grid, it offered advanced 3D graphics for its time, setup options, car failures and handling. Unlike most other racing games at the time, Indianapolis 500 attempted to simulate realistic physics and telemetry, such as its portrayal {{of the relationship between}} the four <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> and the pavement, as well as the loss of grip when making a high-speed turn, forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle-to-brake interaction. It also featured a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle, including adjustments to the tires, shocks and wings. The damage modelling, while not accurate by today's standards, was capable of producing some spectacular and entertaining pile-ups.|$|E
5000|$|The {{larger the}} {{load on the}} tire, the larger the <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forces {{occurring}} {{between the}} motorcycle {{and the road}} (such as those that result in accelerating, decelerating and turning) occur at the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> through friction and normal forces. There is {{a limited amount of}} force tangential to the road that the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> can transmit before the tire begins to lose traction, and therefore slide or skid.|$|R
50|$|Cornering {{force is}} {{generated}} by tire slip and is proportional to slip angle at low slip angles. The rate at which cornering force builds up is described by relaxation length. Slip angle describes the deformation of the tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> and this deflection of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> deforms the tire in a fashion akin to a spring.|$|R
