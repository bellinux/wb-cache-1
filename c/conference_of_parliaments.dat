5000|$|In June 1977 the European Centre for Parliamentary Research and Documentation {{was founded}} in Vienna by the European <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Presidents <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> as a hub of {{parliamentary}} cooperation. The conference entrusted the presidents <b>of</b> the European <b>Parliament</b> and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Emilio Colombo and Karl Czernetz respectively, to take measures {{to set up the}} Centre. Klaus Pöhle, the first co-director of the Center, served the longest term to date between 1977 and 1994.The development of the Centre was structured into three stages:1978 - 1989: This stage was characterised by the development of standards for the information provided by national parliaments. In addition, working structures were developed; a correspondent was appointed in each national parliament; and working groups for the various fields of activities of parliamentary administration were developed.1990 - 1996: During this stage the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe were subsumed into the work of the Centre; Electronic Data Processing was intensified in the national parliaments; parliamentary homepages were created.1997 - 2009: This period saw an unprecedented growth in reciprocal enquiries, reflecting increased cooperation between national parliaments. A comprehensive seminar program was provided for the members of staff <b>of</b> the national <b>parliaments.</b> In May 2006 new statutes were accepted by the secretaries general at the European <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Presidents <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> in Tallinn.Four areas within the Centre's remit, each overseen by one correspondent, are of special importance for inter-parliamentary exchange: ...|$|R

50|$|Since 1977 the ECPRD has {{developed}} {{into one of}} the most important platforms of inter-European parliamentary cooperation. Every two years an official report on the activities <b>of</b> the European <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Presidents <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> is presented. The publications of the ECPRD are published on the homepage of the Centre. The Centre's web presence serves as a communication platform for the administrations <b>of</b> the <b>parliaments.</b> If a parliament submits an enquiry to at least four European parliaments, both the enquiry and a template response are sent to the secretariat in Brussels and forwarded to the parliamentary assemblies. In the majority of cases all 27 EU-parliaments, or all participating parliaments, are polled. Even though the working languages of the ECPRD are English, French and German in practice most of the enquiries and responses are conducted in English.Often there is very limited time available to produce responses to the enquiries. All enquiries and responses since the year 2000 are saved in the ECPRD database, even those which arrive after the time limit has expired. Topics which, from experience, can become relevant again are therefore available in the database at any time.The topics of enquiry are numerous, e.g. parliamentary rights of verification, financing political parties, or the use of the European flag in the European parliaments. Other topics have included the regulation of the protection of minors and questions regarding the committees on human rights.Once a year the ECPRD hosts a <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Correspondents to enable networking and direct multinational cooperation. Both the Centre and the <b>Conference</b> <b>of</b> Correspondents are managed by two co-directors and co-secretaries appointed by the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.|$|R

[...] Many national parliaments, however, are currently not members of the IPU.|$|R
