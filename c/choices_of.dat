40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to analyse the {{institute}} <b>of</b> the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law in european context and to indicate related pros and cons. Because {{of the fact that}} rootes for party autonomy are deepest in contractual obligations, special attention is paid to the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law in contractual obligations and differences between the adjustment of questions connected with <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law in Rome Convention and Rome I regulation. The thesis itself is composed of seven chapters. Chapter One is introductory. Chapter Two is devoted to description <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law generally and determination of this legal institut. Chapter Three deals with adjustment <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law in legal resources and attention is given to their mutual relations and application. Chapter Four, which deals with contractual obligations, explores the basic principle for <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law - party autonomy, range of this principle, limitations on <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law, the opportunity of parties to choose non-state legal system or CISG, aspects connected with <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law, possibilities to make explicit, implicit or hypothetical <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law, aspects related to agreement <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law (such as form, validity and interpretation) and the relationship between <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> law na <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> court.

40|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> and no <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> {{preferred}} and non preferred {{instructional activities}} on the academic behavior of 3 students with disabilities were investigated.

Results indicate that all 3 participants had higher levels of task engagement when working with preferred tasks, regardless <b>of</b> a <b>choice</b> or no choice format. The findings from this investigation contribute to the growing body of research that focuses on developing interventions that are responsive to individual student preferences...|$|R

5|$|In Jainism, Kubera is the {{attendant}} Yaksha of the 19th Tirthankar Mallinath. He is usually called Sarvanubhuti or Sarvahna, {{and may be}} depicted with four faces, rainbow colours and eight arms. The Digambara sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads; while the Svetambaras portray him with four to six arms, numerous <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> weapons, though his attributes, the money bag and citron fruit are consistent. He may ride a man or an elephant. He {{is related to the}} Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.|$|E

The matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> bases give rise to different, but equivalent matrices. Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in this light, for example, the transpose matrix AT describes the transpose of the linear map given by A, with respect to the dual bases.|$|E

For the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> control, under discretion maximum degree of control is the only equilibrium. For the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> transparency, under commitment, a sufficiently patient bank with sufficiently low average inflation bias will always choose minimum transparency.

Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
