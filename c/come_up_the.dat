Bread, produced in cottage bakeries, is available, as is locally grown and imported rice, although neither of these products is comparable to cassava in popularity.|$|E

25|$|The global American and European weather models {{encountered}} exceptional {{difficulty in}} portraying {{the path of}} the storm. The main issue that the models were trying to resolve was whether or not the upper-level low pressure system from Central Canada was going to phase in time with the southern stream energy, thereby revealing if the resulting storm would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Seaboard or simply continue to move east out to sea in the Atlantic Ocean. The latter solution would have only caused the storm to affect the Mid-Atlantic states of Virginia and North Carolina with a modest winter storm instead of the entire Eastern coastline up to Atlantic Canada. As such, it was only 24 hours prior to the storm's arrival in the Northeastern states when all the European and American models were in agreement that the storm would turn up the entire coastline. The National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center and many other private forecasters were skeptical of the storm impacting the Northeastern states until about 24 hours of the storm's arrival as well; although, some models depicted the storm delivering a full-blown blizzard to the New York City metropolitan area as early as a week in advance. The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center even issued a statement on Christmas Eve, 48 hours prior to the storm, that they suspected the American models of having model initialization errors; thus, they believed these errors may have forced the storm to be erroneously modeled to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Northeastern coast.|$|E
25|$|For example, in {{a series}} of coin tosses, a {{perfectly}} ordered system would be one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails. This means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin tosses, there is only one set of toss outcomes possible: the set in which 100% of tosses <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> same. On the other hand, there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems, where some fraction are heads and the rest tails. A disordered system can be 90% heads and 10% tails, or it could be 98% heads and 2% tails, et cetera. As the number of coin tosses increases, the number of possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases. For {{a very large number of}} coin tosses, the combinations to ~50% heads and ~50% tails dominates and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 50/50 becomes extremely unlikely. Thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy.|$|E

2500|$|Three-way coin flips {{are also}} possible, by a {{different}} process – {{this can be done}} either to choose two out of three, or to choose one out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, either reverse this (the odd coin out is the winner), or add a regular two-way coin flip between the remaining players as a second step. Note that the three-way flip is 75% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, which occurs 1/4 of the time, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that [...] "heads" [...] or [...] "tails" [...] be called.|$|E

2500|$|The multi-battalion {{reconnaissance}} toward Saint Côme-du-Mont {{jumped off}} at 0430 as planned, {{but without the}} full-strength glider infantry battalion, which had not yet <b>come</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> town was defended by a line of troops of the 3rd Battalion 1058th Grenadier Regiment (III./1058) in prepared positions from les Droueries to Basse-Addeville, who had stopped the advance of the 2/501st on D-Day. In the town itself was the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment (FJR6), which had dug in on {{the north and east}} since returning from Sainte Mère Eglise during the night. [...] Its 1st Battalion was in Sainte Marie-du-Mont but cut off from contact with the main body. As the battle developed during the day, the commander of FJR6, Oberstleutnant Friedrich von der Heydte, brought up half of his 3rd Battalion from Carentan to reinforce the III./1058 and took over defense of the highway.|$|E
2500|$|Little German {{resistance}} was encountered on the right, except from a German pillbox at Egypt House, whence the Guards pulled their right flank back under sniper fire, {{as they waited}} for Newfoundland troops of 29th Division to <b>come</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> left brigade bypassed a German strongpoint and reached the final objective, taking the strongpoint later in the afternoon.

On the left of the Guards Division, German troops massing at the junction with the French 2nd Division to the north, were dispersed by machine-gun fire from gunners, who had advanced to the final objective with the infantry and by British artillery fire.|$|E

2500|$|A large {{migration}} of Garifuna had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coast from Honduras in 1832, to what became Punta Gorda and Dangriga {{in the south}} of Belize. Their ancestry, of African and Carib Indian mix, traces to Saint Vincent. There they rebelled against the British in 1797 and were expelled to Roatán, from which they spread along the Honduran coast. By the 19th century they were settling along the southern coastline of Belize. They had been catechized by Spanish priests while on St. Vincent, as evidenced in “makeshift beads and crosses to ward off evil and danger." [...] They would be sought after by the British as strong warriors and sturdy workers. But it was as good students and educators that they impacted Catholicism in Belize, with several priests and the first native bishop coming from their number. The Holy Family Sisters would come in 1898 specifically to minister to Garifuna communities, and within a century 45 Belizeans had joined these sisters.|$|E

2500|$|Large undeveloped {{private and}} federally owned coal {{deposits}} are located along Otter Creek, {{a tributary of}} the Tongue River. These coal deposits are located south of Ashland, which is at the junction of the Tongue River and Otter Creek. These coal deposits are sufficiently thick, and are located under sufficiently thin overburden, as to be economically viable. Drawbacks for production are the lack of a rail spur to transport the coal, and the lack of an established community of sufficient size in the area to support the work force needed to develop the coal mines. A railroad spur line, if built, would have to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Tongue River from Miles City, a distance of some 65 to 70 miles. Extensive infrastructure improvements would have {{to be added to the}} community of Ashland before it could support the number of worker's families that the mine would draw to the area. These deposits on Otter Creek are the source of much debate over the future of energy development in southeastern Montana. [...] Arch Coal has submitted an application to develop a coal mine in the area, but it has not, as of 2015, been approved by state regulators. [...] The Tongue River Railroad project, planned to move coal from the mine to Colstrip, is also in the permitting stage.|$|E

2500|$|They {{performed}} Paul Claudel's L’Échange ("The Exchange"); {{dating from}} 1894 {{when he was}} in [...] "exile" [...] as a diplomat in Boston, the play deals in a poetic way with the relationship between spouses. Again Dullin showed his talent for character creation and Copeau too took a major role bringing to the text an inspired interpretation. A popular revival of the Copeau-Croué adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov saw Dullin once again as Smerdiakov, Jouvet as Feodor, and Copeau as Ivan. In May, the troupe, exhausted but buoyed by its artistic and sometimes critical successes, staged an adaptation of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night or Nuit des rois to close the season. Both in its preparation and mise-en-scène, Nuit de rois has entered into legend. Stories abound of Copeau and Jouvet working forty-eight hours non-stop to set the lighting and of Duncan Grant, the English artist who created the costumes, chasing after actors to apply one last dab of color just before the curtain was to <b>come</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> play garnered both critical and public acclaim. With Jouvet as Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Suzanne Bing as Viola, Blanche Albane as Olivia, and Romain Bouquet as Sir Toby Belch, in a startling simple stage setting, the play called upon the audience's imagination in a way that had not been seen on a Paris stage since Paul Fort, an earlier reformer who had worked in the theatre in the 1890s. Enthusiastic crowds finally queued up to see this rendition of [...] "real Shakespeare" [...] (Kurtz, pg. 31), but the run closed as scheduled for the troupe was off to Alsace on tour.|$|E
