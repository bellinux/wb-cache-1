40|$|Abstract Synchronous <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias</b> {{are defined}} as 2 or more primary tumors {{identified}} in the same patient {{and at the same}} time. The most voluminous synchronous cancer is called "first primitive" or "index" cancer. The aim of this work is to describe our experience of minimally invasive approach in patients with synchronous <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias.</b> Since January 2001 till December 2009, 557 patients underwent colectomy for colorectal cancer at the Department of General and Emergency Surgery of the University of Perugia; 128 were right colon cancers, 195 were left colon cancers while 234 patients were affected by rectal cancers. We performed 224 laparoscopic colectomies (112 right, 67 left colectomies and 45 anterior resections of rectum), 91 Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgical Excisions (TEM) and 53 Trans Anal Excisions (TAE). In the same observation period 6 patients, 4 males and 2 females, were diagnosed with synchronous <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias.</b> Minimal invasive treatment of colorectal cancer offers the opportunity to treat two different neoplastic lesions at the same time, with a shorter post-operative hospitalization and minor complications. According to our experience, laparoscopy and TEM may ease the treatment of synchronous diseases with a lower morbidity rate. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS—Computed tomographic (CT) colonography or virtual {{colonoscopy}} (VC) is a non-invasive {{imaging method}} proposed for screening patients with <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias.</b> Our aims were {{to study the}} diagnostic accuracy and interobserver agreement of VC for correct patient identification compared with conventional colonoscopy (CC).  METHODS—This was a prospective study of 50  patients successively undergoing VC and CC. Multiplanar two dimensional CT images and three dimensional VC were constructed using surface rendering software and interpreted by two independent investigator teams. VC findings were {{compared with those of}} CC. Interobserver agreement was determined using kappa statistics.  RESULTS—CC found 65  polyps in 24  patients. For identification of patients with polyps ⩾ 10 mm, the sensitivity of VC was 38 % and 63 %, and specificity was 74 % and 74 % for teams 1  and team 2.  Interobserver agreement was good (kappa 0. 72). For patients with polyps of any size, the sensitivity of VC was 75 % and 71 %, and specificity was 62 % and 69 % for teams 1  and 2.  Interobserver agreement was fair (kappa 0. 56). Accuracy improved when comparing the results of the first 24  with the last 26  patients.  CONCLUSIONS—In our experience, VC had a low diagnostic value for identification of patients with <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias.</b> Interobserver agreement for VC interpretation was fair. These results may be explained by software imperfections and a learning curve effect.    Keywords: computed tomographic; colonography; colonoscopy; diagnostic accuracy; interobserver agreemen...|$|R

40|$|Goal: To {{determine}} the number of pack-years exposure associated with a 2 -fold increase risk for significant <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and to examine the risk of smoking in younger patients. Background: Cigarette smoking {{has been shown to be}} a significant risk factor for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and may be used to stratify patients for screening or triaging of screening resources. However, more information is needed regarding the amount of exposure required to significantly increase by 2 -fold an individual’s risk for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Methods: Data collected for 2707 patients presenting for screening colonoscopy included tobacco use measured in pack-years and known risk factors for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Our outcome was endoscopically detected significant <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> that included large (> 1 cm) tubular adenomas, villous adenomas, multiple (3 or more) adenomas, high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma. Results: Patients who smoked more than 30 pack-years were more than 2 times more likely to have significant <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> than patients who never smoked (odds ratio: 2. 40; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 65 - 3. 50). For patients aged 40 to 49 years, smokers were more likely than nonsmokers to have significant <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (odds ratio: 2. 71; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 05 - 6. 97).

40|$|Zollinger-Ellison {{syndrome}} (ZES) and acromegaly are two hypersecretory {{states in}} which <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> has been described, but the incidence in the former condition may not be increased. We describe four patients with <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> associated with the ZES and review other published cases. Tissue ELISA with Adnab- 9 antibody, a putative colorectal cancer risk marker, from a patient with ZES and from seven patients with acromegaly was compared to 13 controls at average risk for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> The patient with ZES without detectable colonic neoplasia and seven patients with acromegaly had increased binding of Adnab- 9 in the colonic mucosa by ELISA. The difference was significant for the acromegaly patients compared to the controls (p < 0. 05). The accumulated 34 instances of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in ZES patients suggests that this association may not be rare. Adnab- 9 expression, detectable in both ZES and acromegaly, may reflect predisposition to <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in both hypersecretory states.

40|$|Serrated neoplasias (SN) – {{the sort}} of pre-cancerous {{condition}} of colorectal mucous membrane that have a high oncogenic potential. Aim. of research – to carry out an analysis of SN cases with determination of its detection rate and peculiarities of histological structure. Materials and methods of research. There were analyzed the results of morphological study of material of 187 diagnostic colonoscopies with biopsy. Results and discussion. In 143 of 187 patients 143 (76 %) were detected 531 <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias</b> (CN). In 72 (77 %) men were detected 305 CN, in 72 (76 %) women- 225 CN (the difference is statistically unreliable (р> 0, 1). At assessment of CN localization it was noticed that it was localized in the left part of colon reliably more often (76 %) (р < 0, 01). The detection rate of CN is - 0, 75 (143 / 187), the detection index of CN - 2, 76 (517 / 187). Altogether in 44 % (83 / 187; 95 % CI (confidence interval) 34, 5 - 51, 6) SN was diagnosed; in 64 % (120 / 187; 95 % CI 57, 1 - 70, 7) - papillary -tubular neoplasias. In 33 % (63 / 187; 95 % CI 27, 3 - 40, 7) was observed simultaneous detection in the same patient SN and papillary tubular one. From the 517 CN 195 (38 %) turned out SN, 322 (62 %) – papillary-tubular. SN occur reliably more rarely than papillary-tubular ones (р < 0, 01; chance ratio 2, 73; 95 % CI 2, 12 - 3, 51). On histological structure SN were both polypoid and flat. Conclusions. SN is a frequent pathology of colorectal mucous membrane although it occur reliably more rarely than papillary-tubular neoplasias.

40|$|Zur Detektion von neuen potentiellen Biomarkerkandidaten für das KRK sowie dessen Vorstufen wurde Blutplasma von gesunden Kontrollen und von Patienten mit kolorektalen Adenomen und Karzinomen untersucht. Mit Hilfe immunoaffinitäts-basierter Chromatographiesäulen wurde das Blutplasma mit einer automatisierten Methode von hoch und moderat abundanten Proteinen entfernt und daraufhin massenspektrometrisch analysiert. Hierfür wurde eine labelfreie {{quantitative}} und datenunabhängige Methode angewendet. Nach Auswertung der Daten kristallisierten sich mehrere potentielle Biomarkerkandidaten heraus, wobei das Augenmerk auf solchen Proteinen lag, die sowohl bei Adenompatienten als auch bei Karzinompatienten vermehrt im Plasma vorlagen. Nach Western Blot Experimenten und einer weiteren Validierung mittels eines ELISAs an einem größeren Patientenset zeigte sich, dass die beiden Proteine AMBP und CRP als potentielle Biomarker zur Detektion von Adenomen und Karzinomen herangezogen werden konnten. Receiver Operating Charakteristik (ROC) -Analysen ergaben einen AUC-Wert von 0, 79 für AMBP und 0, 77 für CRP für das Erkennen von Adenomen und Karzinomen. Dies resultierte in einer Sensitivität von 72, 5 % für AMBP bzw. 60 % für CRP bei einer Spezifität von 80 %. Durch die Kombination beider Markerproteine erhielt man sogar eine noch höhere Sensitivität von 80 % bei 80 % Spezifität für das Aufdecken kolorektaler Neoplasien. Ebenso zeigte sich in der histochemischen Analyse, dass AMBP direkt von intestinalen Epithelzellen exprimiert wird. Currently available biomarkers for {{the detection}} of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are of limited value {{for the detection}} of premalignant lesions in the colon prior to screening endoscopy. To identify novel plasma markers for colorectal adenomas, we purified low-abundance proteins from 30 plasma samples of healthy controls and patients with colonic adenomas/CRC. For the unbiased identification of potential biomarker candidates, we then applied a data-independent-acquisition based label-free quantitative proteomic approach. We could identify several upregulated proteins in fractionated plasma samples of adenoma and cancer patients. Western blot and ELISA analysis confirmed that the proteins AMBP and CRP were significantly increased in the plasma of adenoma and cancer patients compared to healthy controls. The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0. 79 for AMBP and 0. 77 for CRP alone when colonic neoplasias were compared to controls. This resulted in a sensitivity of 72. 5 % for AMBP and 60 % for CRP at a specificity of 80 %. For both proteins together an AUC value of 0. 85 could be achieved, which lead to a sensitivity of 80 % and specificity of 80 % for detection of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias.</b> Immunohistochemistry showed that AMBP is expressed by EpCAM+ intestinal epithelial cells in <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias...</b>|$|R

We introduce a new marker formula-tion (V 2) that includes detection of de novo variation in APC, PIK 3 CA, and CTNNB 1, hypermethylated se-quences within SMARCA 3 and VIM, and a single-base variation within BRAF.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of colorectal adenomas, in particular those that lack an elevated growth component, continue to escape detection during endoscopic surveillance. Elevation of the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a large family of zinc endopeptidases, in adenomas serves as a biomarker of early tumorigenesis. The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the feasibility of using a newly developed near-infrared bioactivatable probe (MMPSense 680) that reports the activity of a broad array of MMP isoforms to detect early colorectal adenomas. Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) +/Min-FCCC mice that spontaneously develop multiple colorectal adenomas were injected with MMPSense 680, and the colons were imaged in an IVIS Spectrum system ex vivo. Image analyses were correlated with histopathologic findings for all regions of interest (ROIs). The biochemical basis of fluorescent signal was investigated by immunohistochemical staining of MMP- 7 and - 9. A strong correlation (Kendall = 0. 80) was observed between a positive signal and the presence of pathologically confirmed colonic adenomas; 92. 9 % of the 350 ROIs evaluated were classified correctly. The correlation between two independent observers was 0. 87. MMP- 7 expression was localized to epithelial cells of adenomas and microadenomas, whereas staining of MMP- 9 was found in infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes within the adenomas. MMPSense 680 identifies colorectal adenomas, both polypoid and nonpolypoid, in Apc+/Min-FCCC mice with high specificity.

40|$|Activation of RAS {{signalling}} {{induced by}} K-ras/BRAF mutations is {{a hallmark of}} colorectal tumours. In addition, Ras association domain families 1 and 2 (RASSF 1 and RASSF 2), the negative regulators of K-ras, are often inactivated by methylation of the promoter region in those tumours. However, reports showing differences in the occurrence of these alterations {{on the basis of}} tumour characteristics have been scarce. We analysed K-ras/BRAF mutations and the methylation status of RASSF 1 and RASSF 2 promoter regions in 120 colorectal adenomas with respect to their clinicopathological features. K-ras/BRAF mutations and RASSF 2 methylation were observed in 49 (41 %) and 30 (25 %) of the samples, respectively, while RASSF 1 methylation was observed in only 3 (2. 5 %). Adenomas with RASSF 2 methylation often carried K-ras/BRAF mutations simultaneously (22 out of 30, P< 0. 01). Multivariate analysis revealed that the concomitance of these alterations was frequently observed in serrated adenomas (odds ratio (OR) 11. 11; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 96 – 63. 00), but rarely in adenomas located in the sigmoid or descending colon (OR 0. 13; 95 % CI 0. 03 – 0. 58). A comparison between adenomas and cancers showed a significantly higher prevalence of these alterations in cancers than in adenomas in the proximal colon (58 vs 27 %, P= 0. 02).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a novel scoring system to screen {{subjects}} who have a high risk for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> We retrospectively analyzed 1061 subjects undergoing total colonoscopy (TCS) for the first time at Gihoku Kosei Hospital. The characteristics and habits of the subjects were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The risk score was established according to each odds ratio of the individual risk factors, and the correlations between the sum of the risk scores and the prevalence of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> for each individual were evaluated. Age 45 - 59 (risk score: 2 points) and ≥ 60 (3 points), male gender (1 point), and habitual alcohol consumption ≥ 21 g daily (1 point) were extracted as the significant risk factors for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> When the risk groups were determined by summing up these risk scores, the prevalence rates of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> were 8. 8 % for the low risk group (0 - 2 points), 30. 5 % for the low-moderate risk group (3 points), 39. 1 % for the high-moderate risk group (4 points), and 57. 6 % for the high risk group (5 points). In comparison with the low risk group, the odds ratio of the low-moderate risk, the high-moderate risk, and the high risk groups were 4. 6, 6. 7, and 14. 1 folds, respectively. Our scoring system, which linearly correlates with the prevalence rate of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> may be an effective tool for screening the subjects who have a high risk for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> These subjects, therefore, should be recommended to undergo TCS...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Sporadic {{duodenal}} adenomas are {{an uncommon}} finding. It {{is not clear}} whether patients with sporadic duodenal adenoma have a greater risk for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and should undergo colonoscopy. The aims of the present study were to estimate the prevalence of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in patients with sporadic duodenal adenoma, and to compare <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> rates in patients with sporadic duodenal adenomas versus those without them. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted to identify sporadic duodenal adenoma patients using the databases of two academic and one regional hospital in the Netherlands. Colonoscopic findings in the sporadic duodenal adenoma patients were compared with those of a control group of patients who underwent both gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Furthermore, the frequency of colorectal cancer in the sporadic duodenal adenoma patients was compared with the population incidence of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: During the period 1991 - 2006, 102 patients in total with sporadic duodenal adenomas were identified. Colonoscopy was performed in 49 patients (48 %), and <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> was present in 21 of these patients (43 %). There was a significantly higher rate of both <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (43 %vs 17 %, odds ratio [OR] 3. 6, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 7 - 7. 4) and advanced colorectal adenoma (18 %vs 3 %, OR 7. 8, 95 % CI 2. 1 - 29. 4) in the patients with sporadic duodenal adenoma compared to that in the control group. Also, the incidence of colorectal cancer was higher in sporadic duodenal adenoma patients compared to that in the population (P= 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with sporadic duodenal adenomas appear to be at a significantly higher risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> and therefore should undergo colonoscop...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder with skin (fibrofolliculomas or trichodiscomas), lung (cysts and pneumothorax) and kidney (renal cell carcinoma) tumours. Although <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> was reported initially {{to be part}} of the BHD phenotype, some recent studies have not confirmed this association. METHODS A series of clinical and laboratory studies was undertaken to investigate possible relationships between <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and the BHD gene (FLCN). The studies investigated whether individuals with familial colorectal cancer of unknown cause might have unsuspected germline FLCN mutations, looked for somatic FLCN C(8) tract mutations in microsatellite unstable sporadic colorectal cancers, and assessed the risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and possible genotype-phenotype correlations in BHD patients. RESULTS Although it was found previously that germline FLCN mutations can be detected in approximately 5 % of patients with familial renal cell carcinoma, germline FLCN mutations were not detected in 50 patients with familial non-syndromic colorectal cancer. Analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations for two recurrent FLCN mutations identified in a subset of 51 families with BHD demonstrated a significantly higher risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in c. 1285 dupC mutation (within the exon 11 C(8) mononucleotide tract) carriers than in c. 610 delGCinsTA mutation carriers (chi(2) = 5. 78, p= 0. 016). Somatic frameshift mutations in the FLCN exon 11 C(8) mononucleotide tract were detected in 23 % of sporadic colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability, suggesting that FLCN inactivation might contribute to colorectal tumourigenesis. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the previously reported clinical heterogeneity for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> may reflect allelic heterogeneity and the risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in BHD syndrome requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{events that}} make colonic epithelial cells proceed along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence {{are not well}} understood. The phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway {{is involved in the}} regulation of cell growth and differentiation. To determine its role in colonic neoplasias we performed mass measurements of its second messenger sn- 1, 2 -diacylglycerol in biopsy specimens from normal mucosa and neoplasias of the colon. Normal colonic mucosa was also investigated in patients without colonic abnormalities (n = 10). Compared with pooled diacylglycerol values from five colonic sites (100 %), values in patients with a normal colon were highest in the ascending colon (120 (5) %, p less than 0. 05) and lowest in the rectum (81 (5) %, p less than 0. 01). Absolute diacylglycerol values in patients with normal colons (2. 62 (0. 16) nmol/mg protein) were not significantly different from those found in the normal mucosa of patients with <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias</b> (2. 45 (0. 17) nmol/mg protein). Both colonic adenomas (n = 15) and colorectal carcinomas (n = 14) showed significantly decreased diacylglycerol values compared with the adjacent normal mucosa of each patient (72 (4) %, p less than 0. 001, and 71 (4) %, p less than 0. 001 respectively). The appreciable decrease in mass diacylglycerol values clearly distinguishes adenomas and carcinomas of the colon from the surrounding normal mucosa. This finding suggests that profound metabolic changes of the phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway occur early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and may be important in colonic carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Epidemiological {{evidence}} has been presented for {{an increased risk of}} development of colon cancer after chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol is degraded by cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenases that also are capable of retinol oxidation. Inhibition of retinol oxidation to retinoic acid has been shown to occur in parallel with profound impairment of intracellular retinoid signal transduction and loss of cell differentiation control.  AIMS—In the present study, the change in cytosolic retinol oxidation and retinoic acid formation by ethanol concentrations that occur in body tissues in humans after social drinking was measured in cells from the liver, and small and large intestine of the rat.  RESULTS—The specific catalytic efficiency Vmax/Km (ml/min/g) of cytosolic retinol oxidation in the large intestine (28. 9) was found to be distinctly higher than that in the liver (3. 4), while the efficiency in the small intestine was negligible (0. 20). In the presence of increasing ethanol concentrations (9,  17, and 34  mM), Vmax/Km for retinol oxidation decreased in a dose dependent manner to 7. 8 % of the initial value in the large intestine and to 12 % in the liver. The Vmax/Km of retinoic acid formation in the liver cytosol decreased to 15 %.  CONCLUSIONS—Our data demonstrate impairment of hepatic and intestinal cytosolic retinol oxidation and retinoic acid formation by ethanol at concentrations in body tissues after social drinking in humans. The results suggest that the increased risk of developing <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias</b> after alcohol abuse may, at least in part, be caused by impaired retinoid signal transduction.    Keywords: retinol; retinoic acid; ethanol; alcohol; alcohol dehydrogenases; intestin...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} genetic events and pathway of {{carcinogenesis}} in the <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasias,</b> fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH), which could detect chromosomal numerical aberrations, is applied to tissue sections of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas using pericentromere specific repetitive DNA probes. When FISH was applied to tissue sections, it would be easy for investigators to distinguish between certain glands and the others in comparison with a hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining section in the same specimens. As a fundamental study forward to clinical applications of this new method, then, it was tried to study the feasibility of FISH on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of a spleen, which was surgically resected at operation, driven by necessity. The adequate thickness of the sections was determined as five μ m in the study, so the method was applied to the clinical materials, which were collected and fixed in formalin from operative or polypectomy specimens. Biotinylated DNA probes for the centromeric regions of chromosomes 11 and 17 were used. These probes worked well, demonstrating one copy (monosomy) in 26. 5 ± 9. 7 %, and two copies (disomy) in 66. 4 ± 9. 9 %, and three copies (trisomy) in 7. 1 ± 5. 6 % for chromosome 11, and monosomy in 18. 4 ± 9. 7 %, disomy in 64. 3 ± 12. 8 %, and trisomy in 17. 3 ± 16. 6 % for chromosome 17 in the adenomas. And the probes demonstrated more than three copies of chromosome 17 in 23. 6 to 24. 6 % in polypoid cancers and the carcinoma component of carcinoma in adenomas. In applying the FISH on tissue section, it should be taken into account that whole nuclei of about ten μ m in size could not be encompassed in a five μ m thickness section, and that a certain percentage of the cells showed lower copy numbers as a result of truncation. The disadvantage of underestimating the copy numbers due to the nuclear truncation always existed, however, FISH on the tissue section allowed to detect the copy numbers of tumor cells among stromal and inflammatory cells, and to detect intratumor heterogeneity in comparison with the H-E staining sample. The auther emphasized that applying FISH to the paraffin sections enabled to achieve the retrospective study using archival paraffin-embedded specimens...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{hypertrophy}} of the retinal {{pigment epithelium}} (CHRPE) and multiple mandibular osteomata are markers of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We have assessed their prevalence in non-polyposis familial <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Multiple mandibular osteomata were present in 1 / 29 (3 %) patients with familial <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> CHRPE was present in 11 / 33 (33 %) patients with familial <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> compared with 3 / 36 (8 %) with sporadic disease (P = 0. 01) and 4 / 32 (12. 5 %) control subjects (P = 0. 04). Seven patients with familial <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> had multiple areas of CHRPE compared with one with sporadic disease (P = 0. 02) and one control subject (P = 0. 02). There was no obvious correlation between calculated familial colorectal cancer risk {{and the presence of}} multiple areas of CHRPE. A proportion of patients with familial colorectal cancer have a marker found in FAP and may therefore have a constitutional genetic defect, at least in part responsible for their cancer, making them an interesting group for genetic study.

40|$|Abstract Background Prostate {{stem cell}} antigen (PSCA) has {{been implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of several solid tumours, either due to changes in protein expression, or through association with the rs 2294008 polymorphism in the PSCA gene. To our knowledge, the role of PSCA {{in the development of}} <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> has not been explored. We performed a genotyping study to assess for associations between the rs 2294008 polymorphism and risk of adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer. DNA samples were available from 388 individuals with <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and 496 controls, all of whom had undergone screening colonoscopy. In addition, we performed immunohistochemical staining for PSCA in colonic tissue representing all stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Results No genotypic associations were found between the rs 2294008 polymorphism and the risk of colorectal adenomata or cancer. Immunohistochemical staining did not reveal any alteration in PSCA expression accompanying the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Conclusion From these data it seems unlikely that PSCA has a role in the initiation or progression of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found that common genetic {{variants}} on chromosome 8 q 24 are associated with the risk of developing <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> We conducted a hospital-based case-control study, including 435 cases and 788 unrelated controls to investigate the associations between common variants on 8 q 24 and the risk of colorectal cancer in a Chinese population. We also evaluated the association of rs 6983267 with <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in the published literature via a meta-analysis study. We found that rs 6983267 was significantly associated with the risk of colorectal cancer in the Chinese population, with an adjusted odds-ratio (OR) for the GT heterozygotes and GG homozygotes of 1. 30 (95 % CI  =  0. 98 – 1. 71, P =  0. 069) and 1. 66 (95 % CI  =  1. 18 – 2. 34, P =  0. 004), respectively, compared to the TT homozygotes, with a P-trend value of 0. 003. No association was found for the other three loci (rs 16901979, rs 1447295 and rs 7837688). In the meta-analysis of the published genetic association studies, the rs 6983267 variant was found to be associated with an increased risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> The heterozygous GT carriers showed a 20 % increased risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (OR  =  1. 20, 95 % CI  =  1. 16 – 1. 25; random effects model) with a summary OR for homozygous GG carriers of 1. 39 (95 % CI  =  1. 32 – 1. 48; random effects model) compared to the TT genotype carriers. We found {{no significant differences between the}} association of rs 6983267 and colorectal cancer and colorectal adenomas. In summary, our study confirms that the variant rs 6983267 is a risk factor for <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in various populations, including the Chinese population...|$|E
40|$|Although some {{molecular}} {{differences between}} flat-depressed neoplasias (FDNs) and protruding neoplasias (PNs) have been reported, {{it is uncertain}} if the BRAF mutations or the status of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MAPK) are different between theses two groups. We evaluated the incidence of BRAF and KRAS mutations, high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H), and the immunohistochemical status of p-MAPK in the nonserrated neoplasias (46 FDNs and 57 PNs). BRAF mutations were detected in four FDNs (9 %) and none of PNs (P= 0. 0369 by Fisher's exact test). KRAS mutations were observed in none of FDNs and in 14 PNs (25 %; P= 0. 0002 by Fisher's exact test). MSI-H was detected in seven out of 44 FDNs (16 %) and in one out of 52 of PNs (2 %) (P= 0. 022 by Fisher's exact test). Type B and C immunostaining for p-MAPK was observed in 34 out of 46 FDNs (72 %), compared with 24 out of 55 PNs (44 %; P= 0. 0022 by χ 2 test). There {{was no significant difference}} in the type B and C immunostaining of p-MAPK between FDNs with and without BRAF mutations. BRAF and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive in the morphological characteristics of <b>colorectal</b> nonserrated <b>neoplasia.</b> Abnormal accumulation of p-MAPK protein is more likely to be implicated in the tumorigenesis of FDNs than of PNs. However, this abnormality in FDNs might occur via the genetic alteration other than BRAF or KRAS mutation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Streptococcus bovis (S. bovis) {{bacteria}} {{are associated with}} colorectal cancer and adenoma. S. bovis is currently named S. gallolyticus. 25 to 80 % of patients with S. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant <b>colorectal</b> tumors. Colonic <b>neoplasia</b> may arise years after the presentation of bacteremia or infectious endocarditis of S. bovis/gallolyticus. The presence of S. bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia and/or endocarditis is also related {{to the presence of}} villous or tubular-villous adenomas in the large intestine. In addition, serological relationship of S. gallolyticus with colorectal tumors and direct colonization of S. gallolyticus in tissues of colorectal tumors were found. However, this association is still under controversy and has long been underestimated. Moreover, the etiological versus non-etiological nature of this associationis not settled yet. Therefore, by covering the most of up to date studies, this review attempts to clarify the nature and the core of S. bovis/gallolyicus association with colorectal tumors and analyze the possible underlying mechanisms. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although the chemopreventive {{effect of}} 5 -aminosalicylates on {{patients}} with ulcerative colitis {{has been extensively}} studied, the results remain controversial. This updated review included more recent studies and evaluated the effectiveness of 5 -aminosalicylates use on <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> prevention in patients with ulcerative colitis. Methods: Up to July 2013, we searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and SinoMed of China for all relevant observational studies (case-control and cohort) {{about the effect of}} 5 -aminosalicylates on the risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> among patients with ulcerative colitis. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of studies. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were extracted from each study. A random-effects model was used to generate pooled ORs and 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI). Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed. Results: Seventeen studies containing 1, 508 cases of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and a total of 20, 193 subjects published from 1994 to 2012 were analyzed. 5 -aminosalicylates use was associated with a reduced risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in patients with ulcerative colitis (OR 0. 63; 95 %CI 0. 48 – 0. 84). Pooled OR of a higher average daily dose of 5 -aminosalicylates (sulfasalazine $ 2. 0 g/d, mesalamine $ 1. 2 g/d) was 0. 51 [0. 35 – 0. 75]. Pooled OR of 5 -aminosalicylates use in patients with extensive ulcerative colitis was 1. 00 [0. 53 – 1. 89].

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Although {{abdominal}} {{obesity and}} related metabolic abnormalities are hypothesized to promote colorectal carcinogenesis, direct confirmation of {{this effect is}} required. Here, we examined the relation of early-stage <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> to visceral fat area and markers of insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Subjects were participants in a comprehensive health screening conducted at the Hitachi Health Care Center, Ibaraki, Japan. During a 3 -year period (2004 – 2007), a total of 108 patients with early-stage <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> including 22 with early cancer, were identified among individuals who received both colorectal cancer screening and abdominal computed tomography scanning. Three control subjects matched to each case subject {{were randomly selected from}} those whose screening results were negative.

40|$|Background: Insulin {{resistance}} {{has been}} linked with <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> {{through a number of}} mechanistic and observational studies. Allelic variants of genes encoding components of the insulin pathway, including insulin (INS), insulin receptor (INSR), and insulin receptor sub-strate- 1 and insulin receptor substrate- 2 (IRS 1 and IRS 2) have been associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance and may, therefore, predict susceptibility to <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Methods: We investigated whether single nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNP) in the INS, INSR, IRS 1, and IRS 2 genes are associated with risk of advanced left-sided colorectal adenoma, a cancer precursor.

40|$|Patients with {{acromegaly}} are {{at increased}} risk of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and, by analogy with high-risk nonacromegalic patients, may require regular colonoscopic screening. However, it is unknown whether the risk is equal in all patients or whether some should be regarded as carrying a particularly high risk. The aims of this study were: 1) to establish the natural history of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in acromegaly; 2) to establish which patients are {{at increased risk}} of developing neoplasia; and 3) to elucidate the influence of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in adenoma formation. A prospective colonoscopic evaluation of the development of new premalignant adenomas in the colon was performed in 66 patients with biochemically proven acromegaly who had previously undergone colonoscopic screening and removal of all visible polyps. Twenty-five patients (38 %) had a total of 37 polyps detected at the second colonoscopy: nine (14 %) had at least one adenoma, and 18 (27 %) had one or more hyperplastic polyps (2 patients had both). The development of new adenomas, but not hyperplastic polyps, was associated both with elevated serum IGF-I (P < 0. 005) and, to a lesser extent, with a previous adenoma at the original colonoscopy (P < 0. 07). In summary, patients with acromegaly and in whom serum IGF-I remains elevated and/or who have had a previous adenoma should be regarded as having an especially high risk for the development of subsequent <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Serum IGF-I seems to be implicated in the development of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in acromegaly, although the exact mechanisms remain uncertain...|$|E
40|$|METHODS AND AIMS: For the {{detection}} of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> 192 consecutive patients had colonoscopy to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of three faecal occult blood tests (FOBT). Of 160 evaluable patients (96 female, mean age 51. 9), 21 patients (13. 1 %) had adenomas and three patients (1. 9 %) had colorectal carcinoma. RESULTS: When comparing all three faecal occult blood tests for {{the detection}} of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> the sensitivity of Monohaem (43. 8 %) was superior to both Hemoccult II (25 %) and to BM-Test colon albumin (25 %). The specificity of Monohaem (94. 6 %) was greater than both Hemoccult II (88 %) and BM-Test colon albumin (89 %). Using McNemar's test, Monohaem was a more accurate FOBT than Hemoccult II and BM-Test albumin (p < 0. 05). In the 21 patients with adenomatous polyps, FOBT sensitivity seemed to be dependent on polyp size, but not polyp site. CONCLUSIONS: Monohaem, a feacal occult blood test that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specific for human haemoglobin, is a more accurate test in {{the detection of}} <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and should possibly be used in colorectal cancer screening programmes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> {{is still}} unresolved {{but has been}} associated with alterations in epithelial clearance of xenobiotics and metabolic waste products. The aim {{of this study was to}} functionally characterize the transport of cyclic nucleotides in colonic biopsies from patients with and without <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Methods Cyclic nucleotides were used as model substrates shared by some OATP- and ABC-transporters, which in part are responsible for clearance of metabolites and xenobiotics from the colonic epithelium. On colonic biopsies from patients with and without <b>colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> molecular transport was electrophysiologically registered in Ussing-chamber set-ups, mRNA level of selected transporters was quantified by rt-PCR, and subcellular location of transporters was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results Of four cyclic nucleotides, dibuturyl-cAMP induced the largest short circuit current in both patient groups. The induced short circuit current was significantly lower in neoplasia-patients (p[*]=[*] 0. 024). The observed altered transport of dibuturyl-cAMP in neoplasia-patients could not be directly translated to an observed increased mRNA expression of OATP 4 A 1 and OATP 2 B 1 in neoplasia patients. All other examined transporters were expressed to similar extents in both patient groups. Conclusions OATP 1 C 1, OATP 4 A 1, OATP 4 C 1 seem to be involved in the excretory system of human colon. ABCC 4 is likely to be involved from an endoplasmic-Golgi complex and basolateral location in goblet cells. ABCC 5 might be directly involved in the turnover of intracellular cAMP at the basolateral membrane of columnar epithelial cells, while OATP 2 B 1 is indirectly related to the excretory system. <b>Colorectal</b> <b>neoplasia</b> is associated with lower transport or sensitivity to cyclic nucleotides and increased expression of OATP 2 B 1 and OATP 4 A 1 transporters, known to transport PGE 2. </p...|$|E
