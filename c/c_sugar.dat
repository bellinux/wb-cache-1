50|$|Z-DNA is a {{relatively}} rare left-handed double-helix. Given the proper sequence and superhelical tension, it can be formed in vivo but its function is unclear. It has a more narrow, more elongated helix than A or B. Z-DNA's major groove {{is not really a}} groove, and it has a narrow minor groove. The most favored conformation occurs when there are high salt concentrations. There are some base substitutions but they require an alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence. The N2-amino of G H-bonds to 5' PO, which explains the slow exchange of protons and the need for the G purine. Z-DNA base pairs are nearly perpendicular to the helix axis. Z-DNA does not contain single base-pairs but rather a GpC repeat with P-P distances varying for GpC and CpG. On the GpC stack there is good base overlap, whereas on the CpG stack there is less overlap. Z-DNA's zigzag backbone is due to the <b>C</b> <b>sugar</b> conformation compensating for G glycosidic bond conformation. The conformation of G is syn, C2'-endo and for C it is anti, C3'-endo.|$|E

First, D-manno-heptulose is a potent inhibitor {{of plant and animal}} hexokinase and second, nothing is known about the role of 7 C sugars in avocado fruit growth and development. In this paper the contribution of avocado 7 C sugars was explored. Results show that D-manno-heptulose and perseitol are major soluble sugars in phloem sap, leaf petiole exudates, and in seed and mesocarp of avocado. Whereas levels of perseitol remained constant throughout fruit growth, D-manno-heptulose levels increased linearly until maturity. D-manno-heptulose {{does not appear to be}} a precursor of perseitol in fruit tissue. However, exogenous D-manno-heptulose increased the endogenous pool of perseitol in avocado seed and enhanced activity of microsomal 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR, EC 1. 1. 1. 34). Although perseitol did not affect seed HMGR when applied to whole fruit, this 7 <b>C</b> <b>sugar</b> effectively negated the deleterious effects of tert-butylhydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide in in vitro assays.

Prediabetes was assessed according to two criteria: obesity (based on body mass indexand peritoneal fat content) and impaired glucose tolerance (assessed by the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and expressed as area under the curve). Results: Group invert sugar control gained significantly more weight (p= 0. 035) and visceral fat (p< 0. 001) than groups vitamin C control and vitamin <b>C</b> plus invert <b>sugar.</b> Consequently, groups vitamin C control and vitamin <b>C</b> plus invert <b>sugar</b> had gained as little body mass index as group C {{by the end of the}} experiment.

40|$|Growth rate {{dispersion}} (GRD) {{has long}} been observed in industrial sugar vacuum pan operation and is a principal cause in broadening crystal size distributions. This is the phenomenon where seeds with an initially narrow size distribution spread their size distribution because each sugar crystal grows at a different rate. These rate differences are maintained as crystals grow towards shipment size. There is a special case of GRD termed common history (CH) crystals, where the crystal size is proportional to its relative growth rate. As CH crystals grow, {{the shape of the}} size distribution on a log size scale is unchanged. Also dimensionless measures of spread, such as the coefficient of variation (CV), are constant. The CV of material in the high grade pan stage in Gunung Madu Plantation sugar factory, Indonesia, which produces plantation white sugar, has been measured. The seed materials were prepared in high grade graining, without washing, using the dissolved intermediate products (B sugar and <b>C</b> <b>sugar).</b> A similar measurement also has been carried out at the Broadwater sugar mill that adopts the classical three massecuite boiling formula, in which <b>C</b> <b>sugar</b> is prepared into magma and serves as footing material for A and B strikes.

This occurred in graining as well as in growth pans. Furthermore, the coefficient of variation values remained constant throughout the boiling process.

30|$|In recent years, ethanol {{production}} from renewable sources has received increased attention {{in a world}} of dwindling fossil fuels reserves along with the environmental concerns. Commercial production of bioethanol is mostly driven by starch- or sucrose-containing feedstocks such as corn, sugarcane, wheat by fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Wheals et al. 1999). Non-food feedstocks, however, such as lignocellulosic materials including agricultural wastes such as bagasse hold significant potential and have been identified as suitable feedstock sources for {{ethanol production}} (Lynd et al. 1991). Lignocellulose based ethanol processes require pretreatment as a first step followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates (Ahring et al. 1996; Margeot et al. 2009).

Among the classes of organic compounds found in meteorites are keto acids (pyruvic acid, etc.), hydroxy tricarboxylic acids (1), amino acids, amides, purines and pyrimidines. The Murchison and Murray meteorites {{are the most}} studied for soluble and insoluble organic compounds and organic carbon phases. The majority of (indigenous) meteoritic compounds are racemic, (i. e., their D/L enantiomer ratios are 50 : 50). However, {{some of the more}} unusual (non-protein) amino acids contain slightly more of one enantiomer (usually the L) than the other. This presentation focuses on the enantiomer analyses of three to six-carbon (3 C to 6 C) meteoritic sugar acids. The molecular and enantiomer analysis of corresponding sugar alcohols will also be discussed. Detailed analytical procedures for sugar-acid enantiomers have been described. Results of several meteorite analyses show that glyceric acid is consistently racemic (or nearly so) as expected of non-biological mechanisms of synthesis. Also racemic are 4 -C deoxy sugar acids: 2 -methyl glyceric acid; 2, 4 -dihydroxybutyric acid; 2, 3 -dihydroxybutyric acid (two diastereomers); and 3, 4 -dihydroxybutyric acid. However, a 4 C acid, threonic acid, has never been observed as racemic, i. e., it possesses a large D excess. In several samples of Murchison and one of GRA 95229 (possibly the most pristine carbonaceous meteorite yet analyzed) threonic acid has nearly the same D enrichment. In Murchison, preliminary isotopic measurements of individual threonic acid enantiomers point towards extraterrestrial sources of the D enrichment.
