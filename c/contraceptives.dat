5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} <b>contraceptives</b> {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal <b>contraceptives</b> more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal <b>contraceptives</b> (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal <b>contraceptives</b> may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Globally, as of 2009, {{approximately}} 60% {{of those}} who are married and able to have children use birth control. How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries. The most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral <b>contraceptives,</b> while in Africa it is oral <b>contraceptives</b> and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization. In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral <b>contraceptives,</b> 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.|$|E

A total of 230 participants (23 %) had prior sexual experience, 13 % (30) of whom reported being involved in their girlfriends' pregnancies. Of the participants, 45 % recognized the use of condoms as the most favorable <b>contraceptive</b> method for future sexual intercourse. Second to condom use, {{the combination of the}} calendar method and condom use was also popular (13. 1 %). Multiple stepwise regression indicated that better <b>contraceptive</b> attitudes, higher <b>contraceptive</b> self-efficacy, no prior sexual experience, more perception of peers' <b>contraceptive</b> behavior, and higher perception of support from significant others were predictors of higher <b>contraceptive</b> intention. The above predicting factors explained 31. 9 % of the total variance for <b>contraceptive</b> intention among adolescents.

5|$|By 1938, over 400 {{contraceptive}} manufacturers were in business, over 600 {{brands of}} female <b>contraceptives</b> were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250million per year. Condoms {{were sold in}} vending machines in some public restrooms, and men spent twice as much on condoms as on shaving.Tone, p. 136. Although condoms had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the birth control pill decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality <b>contraceptives,</b> birth control advocates established the Holland–Rantos company to manufacture contraceptives– primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female <b>contraceptives</b> accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.|$|E
5|$|Religions {{vary widely}} in {{their views of}} the ethics of birth control.

Among Protestants {{there is a wide}} range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods of birth control. Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial <b>contraceptives.</b> A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. In Islam, <b>contraceptives</b> are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral <b>contraceptives</b> since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Birth control {{methods include}} barrier methods, {{hormonal}} birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency <b>contraceptives</b> are effective {{for up to}} a few days after sex.

5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of <b>contraceptives</b> or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to prescribe <b>contraceptives</b> for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E

Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe medicalization and clinic-based {{distribution}} of <b>contraceptive</b> {{methods have been}} criticized as barriers to increasing levels of <b>contraceptive</b> use in Nigeria and other settings; however, {{our understanding of how}} clients themselves perceive the <b>contraceptive</b> method decision-making process is very limited. MethodsFocus group discussions among men and women in Ibadan and Kaduna, Nigeria, were used to examine attitudes and norms surrounding <b>contraceptive</b> method decision-making in September and October of 2010. ResultsChoosing a family planning method was presented as a medical decision: best done by a doctor who conducts clinical tests on the client to determine the best, side effect free, <b>contraceptive</b> method for each client. An absolute trust in health professionals, hospitals, and governments to provide safe contraception was evident. ConclusionThe level of medicalization placed on <b>contraceptive</b> method choice by urban Nigerians is problematic, especially since a test that can determine what <b>contraceptive</b> methods will cause side effects in an individual does not exist, and side effects often do occur with <b>contraceptive</b> method use.

In specific, the study determined the trend of modern <b>contraceptive</b> use for women in the past ten years (from 2004 / 2005 to 2013 / 2014); women’s preference to modern <b>contraceptive</b> methods and institutional determinants of women’s decision on modern <b>contraceptive</b> use. A cross-sectional study design adopted. Purposive sampling approaches through snow-ball approach was relevant to obtaining the study sample of 120 respondents in which 60 were users of modern <b>contraceptive</b> and 60 women were non-users of modern <b>contraceptive</b> methods. Structured questionnaire and interview methods were used for data collection. The study used descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression model for quantitative data while content analysis was used for qualitative data collected through interview. The study revealed that the trend of modern <b>contraceptive</b> use for women has improved during the past 10 years. The number of women using modern <b>contraceptive</b> method has almost doubled from 20549 women in 2004 / 2005 to 48647 women in 2013 / 2014. <b>Contraceptive</b> pills (50 %) and condoms (41. 7 %) were the most preferred modern <b>contraceptive</b> methods by women. Other <b>contraceptive</b> methods preferred by women are injectable <b>contraceptive</b> drugs (23. 3 %), intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> devices (15 %) and sterilization method (8. 3 %). Socio-economic determinants identified to have influence on women’s decision towards modern <b>contraceptive</b> use were income (β 1 = 0. 001, p= 0. 047), education (β 1 = 1. 354, p= 0. 046) and partner’s acceptance (β 1 = 4. 830, p= 0. 038), (β 1 = - 4. 258, p= 0. 042) and women’s desire to have more children (β 1 = - 7. 302, p= 0. 035).

5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} <b>contraceptives</b> work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
