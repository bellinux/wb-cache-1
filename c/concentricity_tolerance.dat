The integration of spot-joining by forming operations into hydroforming processes and a new method of spot-joining by forming are introduced. Contrary to state-of-the-art technology in both of the introduced technologies no die with a cavity is used and therefore a high <b>concentricity</b> <b>tolerance</b> between punch and die is obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper are new {{developments}} in the field of joining by forming. The possibilitiy of reducing the setting force in spot-joining operations by modifying the kinematics of the punch is described. This reduction of the setting force is not only an advantage because of the possible weight reduction of the joining equipment but also because it allows the integration of spot-joining by forming operations into hydroforming processes at comparable low fluid-pressure. Furthermore a new method of spot-joining by forming shall be introduced, where contrary to standard technologies like clinching or self-pierce riveting the die has no cavity and therefore a high <b>concentricity</b> <b>tolerance</b> between punch and die is obtained...|$|E

50|$|Glass {{fiber optic}} {{connector}} performance is affected {{both by the}} connector and by the glass fiber. <b>Concentricity</b> <b>tolerances</b> affect the fiber, fiber core, and connector body. The core optical index of refraction is also subject to variations. Stress in the polished fiber can cause excess return loss. The fiber can slide along its length in the connector. The shape of the connector tip may be incorrectly profiled during polishing. The connector manufacturer has little control over these factors, so in-service performance may well be below the manufacturer's specification.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a prototype liquid hydrogen boll-off recovery system. Perform analyses to finalize recovery system cycle, design detail components, fabricate hardware, and conduct sub-component, component, and system level tests leading to the delivery of a prototype system. The design point and off-design analyses identified cycle improvements to increase the robustness of the system by adding a by-pass heat exchanger. Based on the design, analysis, and testing conducted, the recovery system will liquefy 31 % of the gaseous boil off from a liquid hydrogen storage tank. All components, including a high speed, miniature turbocompressor, were designed and manufacturing drawings were created. All hardware was fabricated and tests were conducted in air, helium, and hydrogen. Testing validated the design, except for the turbocompressor. A rotor-to-stator clearance issue was discovered {{as a result of a}} <b>concentricity</b> <b>tolerance</b> stack-up...|$|E
40|$|Circular {{feature is}} one of the most common part {{features}} used in machines. Since it is practically impossible to make a part with perfect geometry, tolerances are specified to ensure the functionality of a final product while maintaining a low cost. This study presents fundamental treatments for circularity tolerance modeling, analysis, and design. First, a roundness profile model is presented. At present, the standard for geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, ASME Y 14. 5 M, specifies a circularity tolerance based on the tolerance zones defined by two concentric circular boundaries. To represent profile variation within the tolerance zones, a harmonic roundness model using Fourier series expansions is proposed. A cutting profile simulation model has also been developed to illustrate the relationship between the radial error motion of a machine tool spindle and the resultant part profiles. The profile model has been verified statistically by a large number of real profiles produced by turning and cylindrical grinding. Second, the effect of out-of-roundness on positioning accuracy is investigated for various cylindrical fit conditions. Analytical approaches and computer simulations are used together to facilitate more extensive investigations. Systematic procedures are also proposed for assigning circularity tolerance by prescribing a fit condition and a desirable process capability of assembly. As a result, new circularity tolerance guidelines are suggested for fit conditions. Third, the study is further extended to spindle design analysis. The geometrical accuracy of a machine tool spindle has been investigated to examine the effect of circularity and <b>concentricity</b> <b>tolerance</b> on spindle running accuracy. The study is verified through real spindle design data obtained from a custom-built Purdue High Speed Spindle. Finally, an experimental study is provided to verify the simulation routines used in the analysis of positioning accuracy. ...|$|E
