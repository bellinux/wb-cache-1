The analytical methodology is based on a sample treatment (fat extraction and soybean protein solubilization) prior to chromatographic analysis. Fat extraction with acetone and soybean protein solubilization with a buffer solution at basic pH (pH 10 or 9) were necessary to obtain selective and sensitive conditions. Use of water-acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid or water-tetrahydrofuran-trifluoroacetic acid linear binary gradients at a flow rate of 3 mL/min, a temperature of 50 degrees C, and UV detection at 280 nm enabled chromatographic analysis of soybean proteins in <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> in less than 3 min.

40|$|By definition, “cured <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> ” contain <b>curing</b> salts, usually salt (sodium chloride) {{and either}} nitrites or nitrates. The use of nitrites as a curing agent {{provides}} the <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> colour, the <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> flavour, and, {{in combination with}} other factors, slows or prevents growth of bacterial pathogens. Nitrites exert a concentration-dependent antimicrobial effect in <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> including inhibition of the outgrowth of spores of putrefactive and pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium botulinum. Their antimicrobial effects are pH-dependent, increasing ten-fold for each unit fall in pH. In most <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> the addition of nitrites (or nitrates) is necessary to prevent the growth and toxin production by C. botulinum. The extent of protection provided to <b>cured</b> <b>meats</b> against microbial growth has been attributed by different researchers to many factors including the input concentration of nitrite, the residual nitrite concentration, the salt concentration of the product, the addition of sodium ascorbate (or isoascorbate / erythorbate), the heat treatment applied, the storage temperature, the initial pH of the meat, and the spore load initially present.

40|$|Because {{natural and}} organic <b>cured</b> <b>meats</b> {{including}} frankfurters are not permitted, by regulation, to utilize preservatives, {{these products may}} be {{at greater risk for}} growth of bacterial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. Several natural ingredients have been reported to have significant antimicrobial properties and may offer a means of increasing the safety of natural and organic <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> relative to bacterial pathogens. In this study, powdered concentrates from cranberries, cherries, lime and a blend of cherry, lime and vinegar were evaluated alone and in various combinations for antimicrobial impact on the growth of L. monocytogenesfollowing the inoculation of naturally cured frankfurters. The results showed that cranberry powder at 3 % of the formulation achieved inhibition of L. monocytogenes in the naturally cured frankfurters that was equivalent to that of conventionally cured frankfurters during 49 days of refrigerated storage. Cranberry powder at 1 % and 2 % in combination with other natural antimicrobials inhibited growth for up to 35 days while the naturally cured frankfurters without additional antimicrobial ingredients showed growth after 28 days. However, quality assessment of the products showed that 3 % cranberry powder was detrimental to color, sensory and textural attributes of the frankfurters, probably due to the acidic nature of the cranberry concentrate. Addition of phosphate to the formulation increased the product pH but also lessened the antimicrobial impact of the cranberry powder. Consequently, cranberry concentrate has potential as a natural antimicrobial for natural and organic <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> but {{it will be necessary to}} develop a means of compensating for the acidic nature of this ingredient in order to achieve practical applications in naturally <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of Listeria monocytogenes in a sliced cooked, <b>cured</b> ham-like <b>meat</b> <b>product</b> was quantitatively assessed.

40|$|The <b>curing</b> of <b>meat</b> is a {{conservation}} technique widely used since ancient times to prolong shelf-life.

40|$|Nitrite {{has been}} used for centuries to preserve, color, and flavor meat. Today, about 10 billion pounds of <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> are {{produced}} annually, accounting for some one-tenth of the American food supply. Regulators became concerned about the safety of using nitrite in the early 1960 s when studies showed the presence of carcinogenic nitrosamines in <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> In the early 1970 s, a study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology implicated nitrite itself as a carcinogen. As studies have raised concern over the safety of nitrite, regulators have had to weigh the potential risk from cancer against nitrite's proven role in protecting consumers from deadly food poisoning bacteria. Today there is little scientific support for the theory that nitrite is a direct carcinogen. To deal with the nitrosamine problem, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) lowered the permissible amount of nitrite in <b>cured</b> <b>meats</b> to that level considered necessary for botulism protection. Regulators, however, found it necessary to take additional steps with bacon because nitrosamines were found consistently in fried bacon samples. In addition to lowering the amount of nitrite that could be added to "pumped bacon" (cured by injecting liquid curing agents in the pork belly), USDA required the addition of nitrosamine inhibitors and began an intensive monitoring program in processing plants to ensure that fried bacon did not contain confirmable nitrosamines. The cooperative effort between Government and industry resulted in the virtual elimination of confirmable nitrosamines in pumped bacon by 1980. USDA is continuing its efforts to reduce nitrite in meats wherever possible. It is involved in active research programs in the Federal Government, academia, and industry...|$|R

40|$|Because {{one of the}} {{alternative}} processes for production of natural or organic <b>cured</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> utilizes a slow release of nitrite from nitrate to achieve the cure, the reaction rates of nitrite with myoglobin and cysteine in a model system were assessed {{to determine if the}} rate of addition of nitrite has potential to alter the end products produced by curing.
