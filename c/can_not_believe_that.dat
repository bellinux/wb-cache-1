After you left, he called upon me several times, and we walked out together; and my {{interest}} in him increased every day. But you don't know how dull are the times here, and what multitudes of young men, well qualified, are seeking employment in counting-houses. I did my best; but could not get Harry a place. However, I cheered him. But he grew more and more melancholy, and at last told me, that he had sold all his clothes but those on his back to pay his board. I offered to loan him a few dollars, {{but he would not}} receive them. I called upon him two or three times after this, but he was not in; at last, his landlady {{told me that he had}} permanently left her house the very day before. Upon my questioning her closely, as to where he had gone, she answered, that she did not know, but from certain hints that had dropped from our poor friend, she feared he had gone on a whaling voyage. I at once went to the offices in South-street, where men are shipped for the Nantucket whalers, and made inquiries among them; but without success. And this, I am heartily grieved to say, is all I know of our friend. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his melancholy could bring him to the insanity of throwing himself away in a whaler; and I still think, that he must be somewhere in the city.

60|$|But {{the houses}} need not both {{be of the}} same composition; they may be {{intended}} as a check on one another. One being supposed democratic, the other will naturally be constituted {{with a view to}} its being some restraint upon the democracy. But its efficacy in this respect wholly depends on the social support which it can command outside the House. An assembly which does not rest on the basis of some great power in the country is ineffectual against one which does. An aristocratic House is only powerful in an aristocratic state of society. The House of Lords was once the strongest power in our Constitution, and the Commons only a checking body; but this was when the barons were almost the only power out of doors. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> in a really democratic state of society, the House of Lords would be of any practical value as a moderator of democracy. When the force on one side is feeble in comparison with that on the other, the way to give it effect is not to draw both out in line, and muster their strength in open field over against one another. Such tactics would insure the utter defeat of the less powerful. It can only act to advantage by not holding itself apart, and compelling every one to declare himself either with or against it, but taking a position among the crowd rather than in opposition to it, and drawing to itself the elements most capable of allying themselves with it on any given point; not appearing at all as an antagonist body, to provoke a general rally against it, but working as one of the elements in a mixed mass, infusing its leaven, and often making what would be the weaker part the stronger, by the addition of its influence. The really moderating power in a democratic constitution must act in and through the democratic House.|$|E

Now shall we, because a good nature inclines us to virtue's side, say, There are no doubts,--and lie for the right?

60|$|And now, {{with regard}} to this tedious war, of which {{from day to day}} we are still, in this month of May, 1862, hearing details which teach us to think that it can hardly as yet be near its end. To what may we rationally look as its result? Of one thing I myself feel tolerably certain, that its result will not be nothing, as some among us have seemed to suppose may be probable. I cannot believe that all this energy {{on the part of the}} North will be of no avail, more than I suppose that Southern {{perseverance}} will be of no avail. There are those among us who say that a secession will at last be accomplished; the North should have yielded to the South at once, and that nothing will be gained by their great expenditure of life and treasure. I can by no means bring myself to agree with these. I also look to the establishment of secession. Seeing how essential and thorough are the points of variance between the North and the South, how unlike the one people is to the other, and how necessary it is that their policies should be different; seeing how deep are their antipathies, and how fixed is each side in the belief of its own rectitude and in the belief also of the other's political baseness, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the really Southern States will ever again be joined in amicable union with those of the North. They, the States of the Gulf, may be utterly subjugated, and the North may hold over them military power. Georgia and her sisters may for awhile belong to the Union, as one conquered country belongs to another. But I do not think that they will ever act with the Union; and, as I imagine, the Union before long will agree to a separation. I do not mean to prophesy that the result will be thus accomplished. It may be that the South will effect their own independence before they lay down their arms. I think, however, that we may look forward to such independence, whether it be achieved in that way, or in this, or in some other.|$|E
60|$|In {{which of}} these two senses does Mr. Spencer employ the term, when he makes it {{a test of the}} truth of a {{proposition}} that its negation is inconceivable? Until Mr. Spencer expressly stated the contrary, I inferred from the course of his argument, that he meant unbelievable. He has, however, in a paper published in the fifth number of the Fortnightly Review, disclaimed this meaning, and declared that by an inconceivable proposition he means, now and always, “one of which the terms can not, by any effort, be brought before consciousness in that relation which the proposition asserts between them—a proposition of which the subject and predicate offer an insurmountable resistance to union in thought.” We now, therefore, know positively that Mr. Spencer always endeavors to use the word inconceivable in this, its proper, sense: but it may yet be questioned whether his endeavor is always successful; whether the other, and popular use of the word, does not sometimes creep in with its associations, and prevent him from maintaining a clear separation between the two. When, for example, he says, that when I feel cold, I can not conceive that I am not feeling cold, this expression can not be translated into “I can not conceive myself not feeling cold,” for it is evident that I can: the word conceive, therefore, is here used to express the recognition of a matter of fact—the perception of truth or falsehood; which I apprehend to be exactly the meaning of an act of belief, as distinguished from simple conception. Again, Mr. Spencer calls the attempt to conceive something which is inconceivable “an abortive effort to cause the non-existence,” not of a conception or mental representation, but of a belief. There is need, therefore, to revise a considerable part of Mr. Spencer’s language, {{if it is to be}} kept always consistent with his definition of inconceivability. But in truth the point is of little importance; since inconceivability, in Mr. Spencer’s theory, is only a test of truth, inasmuch as it is a test of believability. The inconceivableness of a supposition is the extreme case of its unbelievability. This is the very foundation of Mr. Spencer’s doctrine. The invariability of the belief is with him the real guarantee. The attempt to conceive the negative is made in order to test the inevitableness of the belief. It should be called, an attempt to believe the negative. When Mr. Spencer says that while looking at the sun a man can not conceive that he is looking into darkness, he should have said that a man <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he is doing so. For it is surely possible, in broad daylight, to imagine one’s self looking into darkness.(94) As Mr. Spencer himself says, speaking of the belief of our own existence, “That he might not exist, he can conceive well enough; but that he does not exist, he finds it impossible to conceive,” i.e., to believe. So that the statement resolves itself into this: That I exist, and that I have sensations, I believe, because I can not believe otherwise. And in this case every one will admit that the impossibility is real. Any one’s present sensations, or other states of subjective consciousness, that one person inevitably believes. They are facts known per se: it is impossible to ascend beyond them. Their negative is really unbelievable, and therefore there is never any question about believing it. Mr. Spencer’s theory is not needed for these truths.|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} policy, three new aspects are important in the current context of globalization which brings forward new strategies regarding the outsourcing and offshoring of activities and functions of the value chain. These aspects refer to the instant appearance of an offshore transferable function, to the unpredictability of winning and losing functions and to the lowering of competition from the levels of sector, company or professional qualification category to an individual level. Of the three features, the most problematic for policy makers is the unpredictability {{of the impact of}} globalization. For example, in Europe we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> reasonably <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> workers in the most competitive sectors will be in a position of winners, nor that these winners will be the most prepared or trained in analytical functions. Many European workers currently work at prices fixed by the local market and not covered by productivity. But when the competition on functions will expand through globalization outside the country or area, their choices will be either a job loss or a reduction in salary. The question that will be raised ever insistently will be the following: what jobs are more exposed to this new competition? On the one hand, offshoring is on balance positive for Western economies, because it makes domestic companies more competitive. At the same time the material outsourcing is, for most developed economies, much more important than the outsourcing of services and the implications for labor market must be objectively differentiated in the two sectors. On the other hand, if we take into account the amplification of the effects that offshoring already has on the structure and distribution of labor, the socio-economic European policy of labor orientation to the coordinates of a "knowledge based" economy and to the jobs of the "information society" could be wrong...|$|R

My Lords, I must admit, perhaps against my private judgment, (but that is of no consideration for your Lordships, when opposed to {{the judgment of the}} House of Commons,) or, at least, not contest, that a first minister of state, in a great kingdom, who had the benefit of the administration, and of the entire and absolute command of a revenue of fifteen hundred thousand pounds a year, had been guilty of a paltry forgery in Calcutta; that this man, who had been guilty of this paltry forgery, had waited for his sentence and his punishment, till a body of English judges, armed with an English statute, came to Calcutta; and that this happened at the very happy nick and moment when he was accusing Mr. Hastings of the bribery with which we now {{in the name of the}} Commons charge him; that it was owing to an entirely fortuitous concurrence of circumstances, in which Mr. Hastings had no share, or that it was owing to something beyond this, something that is rather pious than fortuitous, namely, that, as Mr. Hastings tells you himself, [...] "all persuasions of men were impressed with a superstitious belief that a fortunate influence directed all my actions to their destined ends."

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, the {{underlying}} argument of the thesis indicates that Smith was {{very familiar with}} the Bible. His written work that reflects the scriptural nature of the Bible and is today canonized by Mormons is argued that it 2 ̆ 2 extends the Bible 2 ̆ 7 s text and fills [many of] its [doctrinal] silences. 2 ̆ 2 A complete reading of this thesis could make some readers think that the doctrine of a plurality of Gods is integral {{to the sense of}} the Bible and a novel explanation for the existence of the universe. The second chapter indicates that many have grappled with the summary doctrine of the Mormon Godhead, the plurality of Gods teaching, as taught by Joseph Smith (1805 - 1844) in last weeks of his life. This doctrine was accepted by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) during the lifetime of those who knew Joseph Smith personally. First Presidency leader Franklin Richards championed the teaching in his writings. Church president John Taylor is quoted supporting the teaching. At the beginning of the twentieth-century, leaders felt uneasy with the plural Gods doctrine. The teaching began to be left out of the Mormon discourse and to this day is not mentioned in official writings, meetings, and conferences of the church. The final two chapters contain a detailed listing of and commentary on the concepts within Joseph Smith 2 ̆ 7 s unique explanation for the nature of God. While Smith said that he had ever been teaching the ideas relative to this final doctrine throughout his ministry, their summary presentation in two final discourses caused his listeners to find his teachings surprisingly unconventional. Two sermons contain Smith 2 ̆ 7 s teachings, the better known 2 ̆ 2 King Follett Discourse 2 ̆ 2 and the lessor known 2 ̆ 2 Sermon in the Grove. 2 ̆ 2 While the first discourse is familiar to many, the complete doctrine cannot be understood without the supplementary information in the second lessor known sermon. In his last discourse, Smith taught of a hierarchal progression of Gods, indicating endless Gods. The nature of the Gods is for the Son to become a Father and produce a new God the Son, who will in turn become a Father. Smith explained, 2 ̆ 2 Hence if Jesus had a Father, <b>can</b> we <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> He had a Father also? 2 ̆ 2 Smith further paraphrased the concept by saying, 2 ̆ 2 where was there ever a son without a father? And where was there ever a father without first being a son? 2 ̆...|$|R

[...] Augustine: [...] "If you do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Christ; if you do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Son of God; if you do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the Word of the Father; if you do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the author of the world; if you do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am that, you will die in your sins.
