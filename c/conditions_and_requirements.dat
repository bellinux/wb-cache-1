Because a design for the Capitol had not been chosen, he was allowed to compete upon his return to Philadelphia. Between July and November 1792, the Washington administration examined closely the designs submitted by the French émigré architect Etienne Sulpice Hallet, (1755-1825), and Judge George Turner. Hallet and Turner had been summoned to the Federal City in August 1792 to present their ideas to the [...] "Commissioners of the District of Columbia" [...] and local landholders.

Here the change that new <b>conditions</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> had wrought was more immediately noticeable {{than anywhere else in the}} West End. Most of the shops on the western side had been cleared away, and in their place had been installed an [...] "open-air" [...] cafe, converting the long alley into a sort of promenade tea-garden, flanked on one side by a line of haberdashers', perfumers', and jewellers' show windows. The patrons of the cafe could sit at the little round tables, drinking their coffee and syrups and aperitifs, and gazing, if they were so minded, at the pyjamas and cravats and Brazilian diamonds spread out for inspection before them. A string orchestra, hidden away somewhere in a gallery, was alternating grand opera with the Gondola Girl and the latest gems of Transatlantic melody. From around the tightly-packed tables arose a babble of tongues, made up chiefly of German, a South American rendering of Spanish, and a North American rendering of English, with here and there the sharp shaken-out staccato of Japanese. A sleepy-looking boy, in a nondescript uniform, was wandering to and fro among the customers, offering for sale the Matin, New York Herald, Berliner Tageblatt, and a host of crudely coloured illustrated papers, embodying the hard-worked wit of a world-legion of comic artists. Yeovil hurried through the Arcade; it was not here, in this atmosphere of staring alien eyes and jangling tongues, that he wanted to read the news of the Imperial Aufklarung.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{integration}} of wireless sensors with mobile phones is gaining momentum as an enabling platform for numerous emerging applications. These mobile systems face dynamic environments where both application <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> ambient wireless <b>conditions</b> change frequently. Despite {{the existence of}} many MAC protocols, none can provide optimal characteristics along multiple dimensions, especially when the conditions are frequently changing. Instead of pursuing a one-MAC-fitall approach we present the Self-Adapting MAC Layer (SAML) that dynamically selects and switches MAC protocols to gain the desired characteristics in response to changes in ambient <b>conditions</b> <b>and</b> application <b>requirements.</b> SAML comprises (1) a Reconfigurable MAC Architecture (RMA) that can switch to different MAC protocols at run time and (2) a learning-based MAC Selection Engine that selects the protocol most suitable for the current <b>condition</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements.</b> To the application SAML appears as a traditional MAC layer and realizes its benefits through a simple API for the mobile applications. We have implemented SAML in TinyOS 2. x and built three prototypes containing up to five MACs. We evaluate the system in controlled tests and real-world environments using a new gateway device that integrates a 802. 15. 4 radio with Android phones. Our experimental results show that SAML can effectively adapt MAC layer behavior to meet varying application requirements in dynamic environments through judicious selection and efficient switching of MAC protocols.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} method for {{checking}} global conditions for object systems {{in a way that}} avoids state space explosion. The objects referred to in a global condition are checked step by step against local <b>conditions</b> <b>and</b> communication <b>requirements</b> derived from the global condition. The derivation is automatic, based on information about the system structure contained in the global condition. The approach is demonstrated using model checking, but the idea works for other approaches to verification or testing as well. In our current investigation, a multi-object variant of CTL is used for expressing global conditions. The local <b>conditions</b> <b>and</b> communication <b>requirements</b> can be verified independently using standard model checkers. The method is illustrated by a large example (about 10 24 states) where our method shows a spectacular speedup over global model checking.

40|$|Multiple Description (MD) and Layered Coding (LC) are two source-coding {{approaches}} {{proposed for}} adaptive and robust video streaming over lossy networks. Both streaming methods aim {{to improve the}} streaming quality by transmitting the generated multiple sub-bitstreams over partially link-disjoint paths. However, the achieved qualities heavily depend on the media characteristics, path <b>conditions</b> <b>and</b> application <b>requirements.</b> In order to attain the highest quality, we study optimal multi-path selection methods for both MD and LC streaming. The simulations run over an overlay infrastructure show 9. 0 - 12. 5 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvement when the video is streamed over intelligently selected multiple paths instead of the shortest path or maximally link-disjoint paths.
