40|$|In this paper, a new online {{evolving}} <b>clustering</b> <b>approach</b> for {{streaming data}} is proposed, named Dynamically Evolving Clustering method. The <b>clustering</b> <b>approach</b> attempts {{to meet the}} following three key requirements of data stream clustering: (i) fast and memory efficient (ii) adaptive (iii) robust to noise. The proposed <b>clustering</b> <b>approach</b> processes one sample {{at a time and}} makes necessary changes to the model and then forgets the processed sample. This feature naturally makes it adaptive to changes in the data pattern. The clustering method considers both distance and weight before generating new clusters. This avoids generation of large number of clusters. Further, to capture the dynamics of the data stream, the weight uses an exponential decay model. Since in data streaming environment, a low density cluster can be outlier points or seed of actual cluster, DEC applies a strategy that enables detecting and removing only those low density clusters that are real outliers. To evaluate the performance of the proposed <b>clustering</b> <b>approach,</b> experiments were conducted using benchmark dataset.

50|$|The <b>cluster</b> <b>approach</b> {{operates}} {{on the global}} and local levels. At the global level, the approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key ‘gap’ areas by developing better surge capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At the field level, the <b>cluster</b> <b>approach</b> strengthens the coordination and response capacity by mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies {{at the global level}} both participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as ‘providers of last resort’, which represents the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response in their respective areas of responsibility. The <b>cluster</b> <b>approach</b> was part of a package of reforms accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.|$|E

In order to benchmark the variational <b>cluster</b> <b>approach,</b> results for the phase boundary delimiting the first Mott lobe are compared with essentially exact density matrix renormalization group data. Furthermore, static quantities, such as the ground state energy and the one-particle density matrix are compared with high-order strong coupling perturbation theory results.
