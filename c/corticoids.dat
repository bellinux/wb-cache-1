25|$|A {{variety of}} {{synthetic}} glucocorticoids, some far more potent than cortisol, {{have been created}} for therapeutic use. They differ in both pharmacokinetics (absorption factor, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance) and pharmacodynamics (for example the capacity of mineralocorticoid activity: retention of sodium (Na+) and water; renal physiology). Because they permeate the intestines easily, they are administered primarily per os (by mouth), but also by other methods, such as topically on skin. More than 90% of them bind different plasma proteins, though with a different binding specificity. Endogenous glucocorticoids and some synthetic <b>corticoids</b> have high affinity to the protein transcortin (also called corticosteroid-binding globulin), whereas all of them bind albumin. In the liver, they quickly metabolize by conjugation with a sulfate or glucuronic acid, and are secreted in the urine.|$|E
40|$|The use of fecal <b>corticoid</b> assays {{to measure}} stress in North American cranes {{has been limited}} to {{laboratory}} validation and a single field project involving reintroduced sandhill cranes (Ludders et al., 1998, 2001; Hartup et al., 2004). In 2001, we documented trends in <b>corticoid</b> concentrations among a cohort of ten costume-reared whooping cranes subjected to ultralight aircraft training and migration. All samples were analyzed by a validated corticosterone 125 I radioimmunoassay for determination of <b>corticoid</b> levels. Fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations in chicks exhibited a logarithmic decline over the first 14 days after hatching (r = 0. 86, p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations then stabilized at baseline levels (median 68 ng/g, range 17 – 186 ng/g, n = 116) during the subsequent six weeks of costume-rearing and aircraft habituation in captivity. Fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations of eight cranes increased 8 - 34 fold during shipment in crates to Wisconsin for field training. Increases in fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations were positively correlated with age (r = 0. 81, p = 0. 01), but not body weight (r = 0. 44, p = 0. 28) {{at the time of}} shipping. Fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations returned to baseline levels within seven days, and were sustained throughout the remainder of the training period (median 77 ng/g, range 22 – 292 ng/g, n= 190). Elevations in fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations were observed one (p = 0. 035) and four days (p = 0. 003) following physical examination and placement of leg bands compared to three days prior to the procedures (median 176 ng/g, range 116 – 553 ng/g, n = 19). Fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations decreased to pre-procedure levels within seven days. Fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations and variation during the 50 day migration period were similar to training levels in Wisconsin, except for a one day increase observed following a violent storm and escape from the temporary holding pen the preceding night (median 243 ng/g, range 228 – 280 ng/g, n = 7). There was an overall decline in fecal <b>corticoid</b> concentrations from the cranes during the migration (r = 0. 42, p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Acute stressors such as capture and restraint and severe storms were associated with stress responses by the cranes that varied in accordance with lasting physical or psychological stimuli.

These observations suggest that tyrosine hydroxylase inducibility in the adrenal medulla is optimal during periods of low <b>corticoid</b> synthesis (the adrenal medulla is exposed to excessively high <b>corticoid</b> concentrations directly originating from the adjacent cortex), whereas in sympathetic ganglia an induction is only possible during the period of high plasma <b>corticoid</b> concentrations.

However, after administration of glycocorticoids initiation of tyrosine hydroxylase induction by short-term cold stress is also possible in newborn animals and in adults during the morning hours. The importance of glucocorticoids as modulators for the initiation of trans-synaptic tyrosine hydroxylase induction can also be deduced from the observation that in sympathetic ganglia kept in organ cultures and induction of the hydroxylase by cholinomimetics is only possible when glycocorticoids are added to the culture medium...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that low {{dominance}} status within a social group is associated with elevated glucocorticoid hormone production, a common index of physiological stress. However, the reverse may be true among cooperatively breeding female mammals with high reproductive skew; that is, high dominance status is associated with elevated glucocorticoid levels. Elevated glucocorticoid levels in these dominant females may be a product of their being the only breeder within a group or may result from other challenges associated with high status. To test this difference, we studied fecal <b>corticoid</b> levels in cooperative breeding females with low reproductive skew (i. e., where reproduction is not limited to dominant group members) : ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta).
