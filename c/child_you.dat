25|$|The then {{deputy head}} of the IDF, Ehud Barak, disavowing any desire to fire at {{children}} stated at the time that, 'when you see a <b>child,</b> <b>you</b> don't shoot'. A new military device which hurled out pebbles at high speed was also deployed. IDF forces were permitted to respond to stone-throwing with lethal fire even when it posed no risk to their lives. From the outset, in Gaza, tire-burning and stone throwing was answered with fire from M16 assault rifles. Those caught were given exemplary punishments: 4 teenagers in Gaza alone were given prison sentences of 10–14 years for throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, compared to 13 years for Sheikh Yassin, the leader of Hamas at the time, for having creating clandestine weapon caches in Gaza back in 1983. Where earlier, disturbances by schoolchildren such as raising the Palestinian flag, had been negotiated by the IDF, harsh measures under the new policy led to immediate quelling by military force.|$|E

500|$|During {{the fall}} session {{in which the}} {{offending}} bills were proposed, police raided an Edmonton office of the Social Credit League and confiscated 4,000copies of a pamphlet called [...] "The Bankers' Toadies", which urged its readers as follows: [...] "My <b>child,</b> <b>you</b> should NEVER say hard or unkind things about Bankers' Toadies. God made snakes, slugs, snails and other creepy-crawly, treacherous and poisonous things. NEVER, therefore, abuse them—just exterminate them!" [...] The pamphlet also listed eight alleged toadies, including Conservative leader Duggan, former Attorney-General John Lymburn, and Senator William Antrobus Griesbach. Powell and Social Credit whip Joe Unwin were charged with criminal libel and counsel to murder. Both were convicted of the former charge. Unwin was sentenced to three months hard labour; Powell was sentenced to six months and deported.|$|E
500|$|According to Maple's research, various {{accounts}} of Murrell's astrological activities {{continued to be}} told in the community after the latter's death. One held {{that he was able}} to predict the death of a man to the [...] "very day and hour" [...] while another was that he also predicted the time of his own death to the very minute. It was claimed that on one occasion he was asked to provide the horoscope of a newborn child, but that he refused, stating that [...] "Make the most of the <b>child,</b> <b>you</b> will not have it for long", after which the child soon died, while when an old lady asked him to predict the future for her, he refused to do so for more than nine years ahead, with her dying in the eighth.|$|E

500|$|Brosgol {{conceived}} {{the character of}} Anya when {{she was working on}} Put the Book Back on the Shelf (2006), a comics anthology based on the music of the Scottish indie pop band Belle and Sebastian. [...] She wrote a short story about a disaffected schoolgirl to accompany the song [...] "Family Tree" [...] (from the band's 2000 album Fold Your Hands <b>Child,</b> <b>You</b> Walk Like a Peasant). [...] Brosgol didn't finish the story, but enjoyed drawing [...] "that character with her fat little legs and cigarettes." [...] Then, after reading Haruki Murakami's novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, she decided her unnamed character should fall down a well. [...] The rest of the story came later, drawn from the author's own life and other inspiration. [...] Brosgol started work on Anya's Ghost in 2007.|$|E
500|$|After enrolling Kaliokalani as a {{permanent}} student, his step-grandmother and hānai mother Kaiahua removed him from the school. She was initially supportive of his enrollment. But after learning {{that he was being}} asked to do chores such as watering the plants in the school yard which she considered servant's work, Kaiahua detained him at her home when he and the other children visited her home during a school outing, on November 7, 1841. In order to bring Kaliokalani back to school, kahu John Papa ʻĪʻī openly confronted the high chiefess, stepped on her lap and seized the boy from her hands. ʻĪʻī told the chiefess: [...] "Not only is it asked of your moʻopuna [...] but of all the boys, of me, and of their teachers. This strengthens the body like all other kinds of exercise, to the benefit of the <b>child.</b> <b>You</b> have no right in this matter, as the children are placed in my care by the king, and only the personal needs of the child are your affair." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} {{in the book is}} the {{characterization}} of child abuse. The story follows Bruce Wayne as he learns about the different categories of child abuse, from the ignorant to the incapable and to those who do it for pleasure. Batman, whose motivation is to prevent crimes like the murder of his parents, is contrasted against a social worker whose motivation is protecting children; Batman realizes that throughout his career he had been fighting criminals, not crime. Vachss asserts that [...] "child protection and crime prevention are the same thing"; he believes that child abuse is never just a random crime but is done with intent. While Vachss warns that those abused can become future abusers, he also states that [...] "abuse can push two similarly maltreated children in opposite directions. One incest victim becomes a promiscuous adult, another never engages in sex again. ... If you excuse a serial killer because he was tortured as a <b>child,</b> <b>you</b> disrespect the thousands of children who were treated worse and never imitated their oppressor." ...|$|E

500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a <b>child,</b> <b>you</b> had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E
500|$|The Crows' {{insistence that}} reading is useless, even {{dangerous}} for Scarecrow because it only leads to discontentment takes on an especially haunting {{reminder of the}} ways in which the residues of slavery continue to injure contemporary African Americans. The Crows reinforce Scarecrow's subjection at their hands through a song whose refrain [...] "you can't win <b>child,</b> <b>you</b> can't get out of the game" [...] that aims to disabuse Scarecrow of any aspirations toward freedom... Their insistence that [...] "reading is stupid" [...] suggests that a Eurocentric education does not promise liberation from [...] "the game" [...] that race and racism create... The Crow's dismissal of education and western thought fails because they do not offer Scarecrow an alternative that will emancipate him. The Crow's attempt to discipline Scarecrow by displacing his hope with nihilism. For The Crow's so-called book of knowledge is less valuable than what they perceive to be real knowledge-street smarts. Though they are not tethered to a pole, they are seemingly unable or as their commandments and anthem suggests, unwilling to find opportunities than their present location provides. The Crow's chorus to Scarecrow's song is revealing for what it says about their loss of hope... The Crow's are even more disadvantaged than Scarecrow because, unlike him, they are hopeless. The Crow's chorus, like The Crow Commandments, reflects their disillusionment with their inability to realize the promise of upward mobility.|$|E
2500|$|William Shaw {{suggests}} that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people, who need not concern us, and actual future people, who should concern us. He says, [...] "utilitarianism values the happiness of people, not the production of units of happiness. Accordingly, one has no positive obligation to have children. However, if you have {{decided to have a}} child, then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest <b>child</b> <b>you</b> can." ...|$|E

That same year, the band hosted their own festival, the Bowlie Weekender. Tigermilk was also given a full release by Jeepster before the band started work on their next LP. The result was Fold Your Hands <b>Child,</b> <b>You</b> Walk Like a Peasant, which became the band's first top 10 album in the UK.

[...] and strikes {{him to the floor}} with a blow to the face. Following this event, Octavia runs away and Octavian leaves to convince her to come back. Atia takes revenge on Servilia by having Timon and her slaves publicly humiliate her: they pull Servilia from her litter, strip and beat her in the forum and cut her hair.|$|E

2500|$|According to Rajneesh, one has {{no right}} to knowingly inflict a {{lifetime}} of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, [...] "If a child is born deaf, dumb, and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep" [...] rather than [...] "take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child." [...] He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: [...] "Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the <b>child,</b> <b>you</b> will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band left Jeepster in 2002, {{signing a}} four-album deal with Rough Trade Records. Their first album for Rough Trade, Dear Catastrophe Waitress, was {{released}} in 2003, and was produced by Trevor Horn. The album showed a markedly more [...] "produced" [...] sound compared to their first four LPs, as the band was making {{a concerted effort to}} produce more [...] "radio-friendly" [...] music. The album was warmly received and is credited with restoring the band's [...] "indie cred". The album also marked the return of Murdoch as the group's primary songwriter, following the poorly received Fold Your Hands <b>Child,</b> <b>You</b> Walk Like a Peasant and Storytelling, both of which were more collaborative than the band's early work. A documentary DVD, Fans Only, was released by Jeepster in October 2003, featuring promotional videos, live clips and unreleased footage. A single from the album, [...] "Step into My Office, Baby" [...] followed in November 2003; it would be their first single taken from an album.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life.

Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her <b>child,</b> <b>you</b> just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E
