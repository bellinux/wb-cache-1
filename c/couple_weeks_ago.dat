500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Will Be" [...] {{was shot in}} New York City on 18 December 2008, and {{features}} Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford {{as one of the}} characters. A reporter for People explained how the inclusion of Crawford in the video came to fruition, writing that [...] "Chace went to London a couple months ago for meetings and to promote Gossip Girl. He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [...] hit it off and talk {{every once in a while}} and have become fast friends. A <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> Leona called Chace and asked if he would be in her next video. He obviously said yes." [...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E

Their defense was shaky, as they allowed 13 {{points in the first}} half of the game, and 18 points in the second half. This put the Bucs outside the playoff picture, and left them {{requiring}} victory in week 17 as well as hoping for the Washington Redskins and the Green Bay Packers to both lose.

The plan is to record at least 75% of each disc at a time, and then have time to come back and re-evaluate, start mixing, and tie up any loose ends. Right now we have done a large amount of the Air disc and have just started up on Earth, which we’ve given ourselves only to the end of next week since we want it to have a pretty stripped down vibe and we don’t want to have time to over- think it. We moved the recording gear into an empty living room with hardwood floors and are recording the whole earth disc in here which is sounding very cool." ...|$|E

5000|$|We {{were in our}} {{rehearsal}} {{room and}} Robert and Dean were playing acoustic guitar with each other, playing this line, and Eric grabbed a couple microphones and started tapping {{in some kind of}} rhythmic pattern. It was coming through the monitor, and there was a single Indian drum made out of stretched leather, and we just started a little interplay between us. We recorded onto cassette tape, I took it home, and the melody came into my head for the verse, and it became a song. It's a special song, personally, one of those songs you write because of some form of defense mechanism that's subconscious. I wrote it third person and I only realized a <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> when I finally listened to the whole album that it was actually an introspective thing. It's easier to write in an allegorical sense third-person when it's something you have a hard time looking at. It's probably one of my favorite songs on the album.

5000|$|The Norwood Football Club {{entered the}} 1997 SANFL season with purpose and rage that {{would see it}} {{dominate}} the years competition. During the home and away season the club lost only three games during the minor round with a percentage of 64.82%, second to only that of Port Adelaide's 1914 season percentage of 68.78%. The dominance of Norwood during this year was highlighted on ANZAC day when Norwood played the second placed team of the year, Port Adelaide, winning by 122 points. However, during the second semi-final Norwood lost to Port Adelaide. The loss {{proved to be a}} wake up call for a side seemingly winning with ease. The following week a win over Central District saw them make the Grand Final, where again they would play Port Adelaide, this time in front of 44,161 eager spectators. Norwood were no longer complacent like they had been a <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> and dished out Port Adelaide's greatest ever grand final defeat in the SANFL winning by 73 points, 19.12 (126) to 7.11 (53). With midfielders Anthony Harvey (Jack Oatey Medallist), John Cunningham and Andrew Jarman playing superbly, the Redlegs had their Magpie opponents chasing shadows all afternoon. Norwood's victory, which came during the same season Port Adelaide's controversial bid to enter the AFL came to fruition, meant the satisfaction it generated amongst Redleg supporters was euphoric.|$|E

I would like to express my relief that the modellers did not take on board Chris ’ suggestions to put all of the cross equation restrictions in place at that time.
