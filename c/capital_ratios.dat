The Fund's estimated value rose dramatically in 1999, prompting proposals to spend current resources or reduce net cash flows into the Fund.

This <b>capital</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3. 20 percent of the unamortized insurance-in-force exceeded the minimum required <b>capital</b> <b>ratio</b> of two percent.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the interrelationships among default risk, capital and {{efficiency}} of the Indian banking system over 1990 - 2011. This study also took into account the impact of ownership on these interrelationships Design/methodology/approach - This paper employed Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Windows Analysis to estimate efficiency levels and trends of individual banks. This paper then used a model of seemingly unrelated regression equations (SURE) to examine the interrelationships among default risk, capital and efficiency. Findings - This study found a two-way negative association between efficiency and default risk, and between <b>capital</b> <b>ratio</b> and default risk. However, this study found a two-way positive relationship between <b>capital</b> <b>ratio</b> and only profit efficiency. Public banks behaved differently from private banks regarding the association between capital and efficiency. Moreover, public banks had greater probability of default risk, lower <b>capital</b> <b>ratio</b> but higher efficiency level than private banks. Further, default risk, <b>capital</b> <b>ratio</b> and efficiency of the Indian banking system increased over time, but the two formers were driven by public banks while the latter was driven by private banks. Practical implications - The findings of this study appear to favour <b>capital</b> <b>ratio</b> as an efficient tool to improve efficiency and reduce default risk of the Indian banking system. Originality/value - This paper is the first investigating the interrelationships between bank risk, capital and efficiency of the Indian banking system, where bank risk is measured by Z-score value and efficiency is captured by cost, revenue and profit efficiencies, and then considering the impact of agency issues on these interrelationships...|$|R
