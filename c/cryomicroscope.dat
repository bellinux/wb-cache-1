40|$|The alpine {{cockroach}} Celatoblatta quinquemaculata {{is common}} at altitudes of around 1500 m on the Rock and Pillar range of Central Otago, New Zealand where it experiences freezing {{conditions in the}} winter. The cockroach is freeze tolerant, but only,to C. - 9 degreesC. The cause of death at temperatures below this is unknown but likely {{to be due to}} osmotic damage to cells (shrinkage). This study compared the effect of different ice nucleation temperatures (- 2 and 4 degreesC) on the viability of three types of cockroach tissue (midgut, Malpighian tubules and fat body cells) and cooling to three different temperatures (- 5, - 8, - 12 degreesC). Two types of observations were made (i) <b>cryomicroscope</b> observations of ice formation and cell shrinkage (ii) cell integrity (viability) using vital stains. Cell viability decreased with lower treatment temperatures but ice nucleation temperature had no significant effect. <b>Cryomicroscope</b> observations showed that ice spread through tissue faster at - 4 than - 2 degreesC and that intracellular freezing only occurred when nucleated at - 4 degreesC. From temperature records during cooling, it was observed that when freezing occurred, latent bleat immediately increased the insect's body temperature close to its melting point (c. - 0. 3 degreesC). This "rebound" temperature was independent of nucleation temperature. Some tissues were more vulnerable to damage than others. As the gut is thought to be the site of freezing, it is significant that this tissue was the most robust. The ecological importance of the effect of nucleation temperature on survival of whole animals under field conditions is discussed...|$|E

All-gold supports improve cryo-EM images by reducing radiation-induced motion and image blurring. Here we compare the mechanical and electrical properties of all-gold supports to amorphous carbon foils. Gold supports are more conductive, and have suspended foils that are not compressed by differential contraction when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures. These measurements show how the choice of support material and geometry can reduce specimen movement by more than an order of magnitude during low-dose imaging. We provide methods for fabrication of all-gold supports and preparation of vitrified specimens. We also analyse illumination geometry for optimal collection of high resolution, low-dose data.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of intracellular freezing in cells was investigated by designing experiments with cultured mouse fibroblasts on a <b>cryomicroscope</b> to critically assess the current hypotheses describing {{the genesis of}} intracellular ice: (a) intracellular freezing {{is a result of}} critical undercooling; (b) the cytoplasm is nucleated through aqueous pores in the plasma membrane; and (c) intracellular freezing is a result of membrane damage caused by electrical transients at the ice interface. The experimental data did not support any of these theories, but was consistent with the hypothesis that the plasma membrane is damaged at a critical gradient in osmotic pressure across the membrane, and intracellular freezing occurs {{as a result of this}} damage. An implication of this hypothesis is that mathematical models can be used to design protocols to avoid damaging gradients in osmotic pressure, allowing new approaches to the preservation of cells, tissues, and organs by rapid cooling...|$|E

With protoplasts isolated from leaves of non-acclimated Arabidopsis seedlings, intracellular freezing was observed even when protoplasts were frozen to - 10 ℃ at rates of 0. 5 to 1. 0 ℃/min, and the frequency increased significantly at 2. 5 to 10 ℃/min. After cold acclimation for 1 day at 2 ℃, the intracellular freezing did not occur at cooling rates of 1. 0 ℃ or slower. Cold acclimation for 2 to 7 days further resulted in a shift of the temperature range over which intracellular freezing occurred to lower temperatures.

The objectives were to observe the morphological changes of red seabream (Pagrus major) embryo during the cooling-thawing process, and to examine the effect of cryoprotectant and cooling rate on the temperatures of oil globule ice formation (T-OIF), extra-cellular ice formation (T-EIF) and intracellular ice formation (T-IIF) using <b>cryomicroscope.</b> After thawing, the morphological changes of embryos were observed and recorded by the video attachment and monitor under the microscope. During the cooling process, three representative phenomena were observed: oil globule gradually turned bright firstly, then the whole field of view flashed and the embryo blackened. Cooling rate affect the temperature of both extra- and intra-cellular ice formations. T-EIF and T-IIF at high cooling rate were much lower than that at low cooling rate. And the value of T-EIF - T-IIF increased from 0. 45 to 11. 11 degrees C with the increase of cooling rate from 3 to 130 degrees C/min. Taken together, our results suggested that high cooling rate with proper cryoprotectant would be a good option for red seabream embryo cryopreservation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Frozen, {{hydrated}} acrosomal bundles from Limulus sperm were imaged with a 400 kV electron <b>cryomicroscope.</b> Segments of {{this long}} bundle {{can be studied}} as a P 1 crystal with a unit cell containing an acrosomal filament with 28 actin and 28 scruin molecules in 13 helical turns. A novel computational procedure was developed to extract single columns of superimposed acrosomal filaments from the distinctive crystallographic view. Helical reconstruction was used to generate a three-dimensional structure of this computationally isolated acrosomal filament. The scruin molecule is organized into two domains which contact two actin subunits in different strands of the same actin filament. A correlation of Holmes' actin filament model to the density in our acrosomal filament map shows that actin subdomains 1, 2, and 3 match the model density closely. However, actin subdomain 4 matches rather poorly, suggesting that interactions with scruin may have altered actin conformation. Scruin makes extensive interactions with helix-loop-beta motifs in subdomain 3 of one actin subunit and in subdomain 1 of a consecutive actin subunit along the genetic filament helix. These two actin subdomains are structurally homologous and are closely spaced along the actin filament. Our model suggests that scruin, which is derived from a tandemly duplicated gene, has evolved to bind structurally homologous but non-identical positions across two consecutive actin subunits...|$|E

This study set out to investigate the effects induced by cryopreservation on cultured sheepskin fibroblasts (CSSF) through cryomicroscopy and gene expression analysis after subsequent in vitro culture. CSSF cells were cryopreserved in a <b>cryomicroscope</b> (CM) or in a straw programmable freezer (SPF) using a similar thermal profile (cooling rate - 5 Â°C/min to - 120 Â°C, then - 150 Â°C/min to - 196 Â°C). CSSF volume and intracellular ice formation (IIF) were monitored by a CM, while gene expression levels were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction in SPF-cryopreserved cells immediately after thawing (T 0) and after 24 or 48 hours (T 24, T 48) of post-thaw in vitro culture. No significant difference in cell viability was observed at T 0 between CM and SPF samples, while both CM and SPF groups showed lower viability (p < 0. 05) compared to the untreated control group. Gene expression analysis of cryopreserved CSSF 24 and 48 hours post-thawing showed a significant upregulation of the genes involved in protein folding and antioxidant mechanisms (HPS 90 b and SOD 1), while a transient increase (p < 0. 05) in the expression levels of OCT 4, BCL 2, and GAPDH was detected 24 hours post-thawing.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2011. Major: Mechanical engineering. Advisor: Dr. John Bischof. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxi, 192 pages. Freezing of biological systems is generally intended to maximize cell survival (cryopreservation) or injury (cryosurgery) {{depending on the}} application. The biophysical contribution to cellular freeze injury is generally described by the “two factor” injury hypothesis. Slow freezing is associated with “solution effects” injury while rapid freezing {{is linked to the}} lethality of intracellular ice formation (IIF). The “two factor” hypothesis has been actively investigated for cell suspensions. While cell suspensions provide a fundamental understanding of cellular biophysics and injury, more complex systems (featuring cell attachment) are needed to potentially link to tissues. The effect of cell attachment {{in the context of the}} “two factor” hypothesis has not been extensively investigated especially for water transport biophysics. In addition, the “two factor” injury hypothesis implicates changes to cellular macromolecules (e. g. lipids and proteins) as potential freezing injury mechanisms. Currently very little is known about the molecular events associated with the biophysics of freezing cells. The specific aims (SA) of the dissertation are listed below, and it addresses some of the limitations identified. SA 1 : Study the effect of cell attachment on the “two factor” hypothesis during freezing SA 2 : Investigate the molecular events (lipids and proteins) associated with the “two factor” biophysics of freezing The effect of cell attachment (SA 1) was studied using two mammalian cell types – human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), and porcine smooth muscle cells (SMC). The cellular systems that were evaluated include suspensions, monolayer (cell-cell interactions), and tissue equivalents (cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions). Cell based biophysical models were then used to compare the predicted biophysics as a function of the attachment state. The molecular events associated with the “two factor” biophysics (SA 2) were studied using three different mammalian cell types – HDF, SMC, and human LNCaP prostate tumor cells. Changes to membrane lipids and proteins during controlled freezing were evaluated using Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR). The molecular events were then linked to cellular freezing biophysics assessed using <b>cryomicroscope.</b> The important findings of this dissertation are included below: 1. Cell attachment affects the “two factor” biophysics of freezing. Experimental data shows that IIF is enhanced for cells in the attached state as compared to suspensions. In addition, the results suggest that water transport is enhanced for cells in the attached state as compared to suspensions. However, the impact of increased water transport on cell survival for attached cells is unclear. 2. The study of molecular events shows that slow freezing affects membrane phase transition (liquid crystalline to gel phase), whereas rapid freezing is observed to maintain the high conformational disorder of the membranes. 3. Molecular events (i. e. membrane phase transition) measured using FTIR are linked to cellular biophysics measured using <b>cryomicroscope.</b> 4. The results show a link between cell and lipid membrane dehydration events. It is suggested that membranes can only tolerate dehydration to a certain extent. This connection is suggested as a potential link to a molecular mechanism of cell injury due to “solution effects”...|$|E

Mizusaki, K. Morikawa, H. Aoki, H. Kihara, and Y. Harada. 1991. Ultramicroscopy. 38 : 241 – 251). The excimer method {{is based on the}} fact that the ratio of excimer to monomer fluorescence intensity (E/M) of pyrene PC is lowered in the membrane in the interdigitated gel structure (L beta I), because structural restriction of L beta I structure largely decreases collisions of pyrene rings of the pyrene PCs in the membrane. E/M of pyrene PC in DPPC LUV decreased largely at high concentrations of ethanol, which indicated the induction of L beta I structures in DPPC LUV. Frozen-hydrated DPPC LUVs in a vitreous ice were observed at 4 K with HiRECM, and these images were characterized by a pair of concentric circles. The membrane thickness of DPPC LUV which was estimated from the distance between the two concentric lines decreased largely at high concentration of ethanol. The mean value of membrane thickness of the LUV in the absence of ethanol was 3. 8 nm, while at 15 % (w/v) ethanol was 3. 0 nm. These values were almost same as those obtained from the electron density profile of DPPC MLV by the x-ray diffraction analysis in each structures, L beta' and L beta I structures, respectively.
