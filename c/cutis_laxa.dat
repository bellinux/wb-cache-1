5000|$|Many {{features}} of gerodermia osteodysplastica (GO) and another autosomal recessive form of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa,</b> wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS, [...] ), {{are similar to}} such an extent that both disorders were believed to be variable phenotypes of a single disorder.|$|E
50|$|Deletions and {{mutations}} in this gene {{are associated with}} supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and the autosomal dominant <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa.</b> Other associated defects in elastin include Marfan syndrome, emphysema caused by α1-antitrypsin deficiency, atherosclerosis, Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome, Menkes syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and Williams syndrome.|$|E
50|$|De Barsy {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Symptoms include <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> (loose hanging skin) {{as well as other}} eye, musculoskeletal, and neurological abnormalities. It is usually progressive, manifesting side effects that can include clouded corneas, cataracts, short stature, dystonia, or progeria (premature aging).|$|E
50|$|Occipital horn {{syndrome}} (sometimes called X-linked <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> or Ehlers-Danlos type 9) is a mild form of Menkes syndrome {{that begins}} in early to middle childhood.

50|$|The leading {{symptoms}} of Transaldolase Deficiency are coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic fibrosis and dysmorphic features. The dysmorphic features can include antimongoloid slant, low-set ears, and <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa.</b> Those {{affected by this}} disease have abnormal polyol concentrations in urine and other bodily fluids, this can determined by an abnormal liver function tests.|$|E
50|$|Patterson {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} the patient's having an unusual facial look, similar to that caused by Leprechaunism. It primarily affects the connective tissue and the neuroendocrine system, giving rise to bronzed hyperpigmentation, <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> of the hands and feet, bodily disproportion, severe mental retardation, and major bony deformities. Radiographs reveal a characteristic generalised skeletal dysplasia.|$|E
50|$|But {{perhaps the}} most notable feature, {{differentiating}} GO from WSS and similar <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> disorders, is the age-specific metaphyseal peg sometimes found in GO-affected long bone, near the knee. Not appearing until around age 4 - 5, then disappearing by physeal closure, this oddity of bone is thought to represent a specific genetic marker unique to GO {{and its effects on}} bone development.|$|E
5000|$|In recent years, these {{approaches}} {{have played in}} important role in studies of human disease genes. The mechanism of action for several genes mutated in human cystic kidney disorders (e.g. nephronophthisis) have been extensively studied in Xenopus embryos, shedding {{new light on the}} link between these disorders, ciliogenesis and Wnt signaling. [...] Xenopus embryos have also provided a rapid test bed for validating newly discovered disease genes. For example, studies in Xenopus confirmed and elucidated the role of PYCR1 in <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> with progeroid features.|$|E
50|$|Elastins, in {{contrast}} to collagens, give elasticity to tissues, allowing them to stretch when needed {{and then return to}} their original state. This is useful in blood vessels, the lungs, in skin, and the ligamentum nuchae, and these tissues contain high amounts of elastins. Elastins are synthesized by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Elastins are highly insoluble, and tropoelastins are secreted inside a chaperone molecule, which releases the precursor molecule upon contact with a fiber of mature elastin. Tropoelastins are then deaminated to become incorporated into the elastin strand. Disorders such as <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> and Williams syndrome are associated with deficient or absent elastin fibers in the ECM.|$|E
50|$|It is {{characterized}} by skin that is loose, hanging, wrinkled, and lacking in elasticity. The loose skin is often most noticeable on the face, resulting in a prematurely aged appearance. The affected areas of skin may be thickened and dark. In addition, the joints are loose (hypermobile) because of lax ligaments and tendons. When <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> is severe, it can also affect the internal organs. The lungs, heart (supravalvular pulmonary stenosis), intestines, or arteries may be affected {{with a variety of}} severe impairments. In some cases, hernias and outpouching of the bladder can be observed. Patients also present with whites of the eyes that are blue.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1967 by De Barsy et al. and, as of 2011, {{there have been}} 27 cases reported worldwide. The genes that cause De Barsy syndrome have not been identified yet, although several studies have narrowed down the symptoms' cause. A study by Reversade et al. has shown that a mutation in PYCR1, the genetic sequence that codes for mitochondrial enzymes that break down proline, are prevalent in cases of autosomal recessive <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> (ARCL), a condition very similar to De Barsy syndrome. A study by Leao-Teles et al. has shown that De Barsy syndrome {{may be related to}} mutations in ATP6V0A2 gene, known as ATP6V0A2-CDG by the new naming system.|$|E
5000|$|Ardalan-Shoja-Kiuru {{syndrome}} is a clinical syndrome featuring hereditary gelsolin [...] amyloidosis and retinitis pigmentosa. This syndrome was first recognized by two Iranian physicians, Mohammad Ardalan and Mohammadali Shoja and Finnish neurologist Sari Kiuru-Enari in an Iranian family. Hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis has originally {{been reported by}} Finnish ophthalmologist Jouko Meretoja and is known as Meretoja syndrome or Familial Amyloidosis, Finnish type. In addition to the classic manifestations of Finnish type Familial Amyloidosis, <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa,</b> progressive peripheral neuropathy and corneal lattice dystrophy, some of the afflicted members of the Iranian family have retinitis pigmentosa. This feature had not been previously reported {{with this type of}} amyloidosis. Ardalan-Shoja-Kiuru syndrome or hereditary gelsolin amyloidosis plus retintis pigmentosa has not been found outside this single Iranian family.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{disorders}} that share some characteristics with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. For example, in <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> {{the skin is}} loose, hanging, and wrinkled. In EDS, the skin can be {{pulled away from the}} body but is elastic and returns to normal when let go. In Marfan syndrome, the joints are very mobile and similar cardiovascular complications occur. People with EDS tend to have a [...] "Marfanoid" [...] appearance (e.g., tall, skinny, long arms and legs, [...] "spidery" [...] fingers). However, physical appearance and features in several types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome also have characteristics including short stature, large eyes, and the appearance of a small mouth and chin, due to a small palate. The palate can have a high arch, causing dental crowding. Blood vessels can sometimes be easily seen through translucent skin, especially on the chest. The genetic connective tissue disorder, Loeys-Dietz Syndrome, also has symptoms that overlap with EDS. In the past, Menkes disease, a copper metabolism disorder, was thought to be a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. It is not uncommon for patients to be misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia, bleeding disorders or other disorders that can mimic EDS symptoms before a correct diagnosis is made. Because of these similar disorders and complications that can arise from an un-monitored case of EDS, a correct diagnosis is very important. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is worth consideration in diagnosing a patient.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> is an {{inherited}} or acquired disease characterized by redundant, sagging and inelastic skin. In inherited <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> an abnormal synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins occurs due to genetic defects coding for diverse extracellular matrix components. Recently, different inborn errors of metabolism {{have been found}} to be associated with <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> as well. In some of these metabolic conditions the pathomechanism of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> remains unknown. <b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. Besides the skin abnormalities, in most inherited forms multiple organ systems are involved, leading to a severe, in some forms even lethal, multisystem disorder. To date no effective treatment is available for <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa.</b> This chapter focuses on inherited forms of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa,</b> offering a practical guideline for clinicians, biochemist and geneticist to diagnose and differentiate between the different forms of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa,</b> and providing a concise theoretical reference...|$|E
40|$|Collagen {{metabolism}} was {{studied in}} <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> by analyzing collagen and collagenase gene expression in three dermal fibroblast strains from patients with congenital <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> and comparing them with fibroblasts obtained from age-matched healthy subjects. Normal collagen synthetic activity {{was observed in}} the <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> fibroblasts. An increased level of collagenase mRNA and unaltered levels of α 1 (I) and α 1 (III) collagen mRNA were found in all <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> cell strains by dot blot hybridization. Reduced levels of elastin mRNA were also detected in these strains. However, no qualitative differences in these mRNA transcripts were detected between the control and <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> fibroblasts by Northern blot analysis. Collagenase activity in fibroblast culture supernatants was then measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled type I collagen. Increased collagenolytic activity in <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> fibroblast culture supernatants was also found. These data suggest that increased collagenase expression of fibroblasts {{is related to the}} structural abnormality of dermal connective tissue in <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> is a {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases, with loose, wrinkled skin folds and hyperelasticity of the skin.

40|$|<b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> {{is a rare}} skin {{disorder}} characterized by wrinkled, redundant, inelastic and sagging skin due to defective synthesis of elastic fibers and other proteins of the extracellular matrix. Wrinkled, inelastic skin occurs in many cases as an acquired condition. Syndromic forms of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa,</b> however, are caused by diverse genetic defects, mostly coding for structural extracellular matrix proteins. Surprisingly a number of metabolic disorders have been also {{found to be associated}} with inherited <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa.</b> Menkes disease was the first metabolic disease reported with old-looking, wrinkled skin. <b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> has recently been found in patients with abnormal glycosylation. The discovery of the COG 7 defect in patients with wrinkled, inelastic skin was the first genetic link with the Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). Since then several inborn errors of metabolism with <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> have been described with variable severity. These include P 5 CS, ATP 6 V 0 A 2 -CDG and PYCR 1 defects. In spite of the evolving number of cutis laxa-related diseases {{a large part of the}} cases remain genetically unsolved. In metabolic <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> syndromes the clinical and laboratory features might partially overlap, however there are some distinct, discriminative features. In this review on metabolic diseases causing <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> we offer a practical approach for the differential diagnosis of metabolic <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> syndromes...|$|E
40|$|A {{rare case}} of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> is presented. Cutis I= enjoys more {{popularity}} {{as compared to}} other synonyms; though dermatomegaly or generalised elastosis is appropriate. <b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> is a specific entity and must be differentiated from cutis hyperelastica and neurofibromatosis. Whether the disease is congenital or acquired it involves the connective tissue throughout the body. In {{view of the fact}} that the mother developed spontaneous pneumothorax it would be debatable to conclude whether our patient has a congenital or acquired variety of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa.</b> Authors have postulated a hypothesis towards the relation of cause and effect of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> to enteric fever...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> (CL) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} {{and acquired}} disorder characterized by loose and redundant skin with reduced elasticity. Three types of congenital <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> have been recognized. Other findings are pulmonary emphysema, bronchiectasia, hernia and diverticulosis. We describe a female neonate involved by <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> syndrome and a positive family history.

40|$|A case of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> acquisita was {{studied with}} the aim of {{defining}} the molecular defects involved and comparing them with those of an inherited form of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa.</b> In the acquisita form of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> ultrastructural and biochemical observations confirmed a dramatic reduction of dermal elastin, whereas collagen content was normal. Elastin mRNA expression as well as tropoelastin production by dermal fibroblasts, in vitro, were normal compared with control cells, as revealed by in situ hybridization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Lysyl oxidase activity, measured on cultured fibroblasts, was reduced to 60 % compared with age-matched control subjects. Unlike control skin fibroblasts or fibroblasts from inherited <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa,</b> the affected skin cells from <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> acquisita predominantly expressed an elastolytic activity identified as cathepsin G. Patient serum also has reduced elastase inhibitory capacity and reduced levels of alpha 1 -antiproteinase inhibitor (alpha 1 -antitrypsin). Although <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> acquisita is a heterogeneous group of disorders, findings in this patient were consistent with excessive loss of cutaneous elastin due to the combined effects of several factors, such as low lysyl oxidase activity together with high levels of cathepsin G and reduction of circulating proteinase inhibitor(s) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> is {{characterized}} by dramatic wrinkling of skin that is lacking in elasticity due to inherent defects in dermal elastic fibers. <b>Cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> {{can be caused by}} genetic and metabolic disorders.

This report describes a 26 -year old woman who developed acquired <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> and cutaneous mastocytosis leading to premature aging. She represents a unique co-occurrence of these two separate disease entities. To our knowledge, there has been only one published case report of acquired <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> occurring in association with urticaria pigmentosa in a 4 -year old girl.

40|$|AbstractBased on our {{preliminary}} {{observation of}} abnormal glycosylation in a <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> patient, nine <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> patients were analyzed for congenital defects of glycosylation (CDG). Isoelectric focusing of plasma transferrin and apolipoproteinC-III showed that {{three out of}} nine patients had a defect in the biosynthesis of N-glycans and core 1 mucin type O-glycans, respectively. Mass spectrometric N-glycan analyses revealed a relative increase of glycans lacking sialic acid and glycans lacking sialic acid and galactose residues. Mutation analysis of the fibulin- 5 gene (FBLN 5), which {{has been reported in}} cases of autosomal recessive <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa,</b> revealed no mutations in the patients' DNA. Evidence is presented that extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins of skin are likely to be highly glycosylated with N- and/or mucin type O-glycans by using algorithms for predicting glycosylation. The conclusions in this study were that the clinical phenotype of autosomal recessive <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> seen in three patients is not caused by mutations in the FBLN 5 gene. Our findings define a novel form of CDG with <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> and neurological involvement due to a defect in the sialylation and/or galactosylation of N- and O-glycans. Improper glycosylation of ECM proteins of skin may form the pathophysiological basis for the <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> {{comprises}} {{a heterogeneous}} group of connective tissue disorders characterized by loose skin and variable systemic involvement. Autosomal dominant and recessive {{as well as}} X-linked forms have been described. Some dominant forms are caused by mutations in the elastine gene (ELN). The X-linked form is now classified {{in the group of}} copper transport diseases. The genetic defect underlying the autosomal recessive (AR) forms of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> is not known. The phenotypic abnormalities recently observed in a fibulin- 5 knockout mouse model are reminiscent of human AR <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> type I. Both share <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa,</b> lung emphysema and arterial involvement. Molecular study of the fibulin- 5 (FBLN 5) gene in a large consanguineous Turkish family with four patients affected by AR <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> type I demonstrated the presence of a homozygous missense mutation (T 998 C) in the FBLN 5 gene resulting in a serine-to-proline (S 227 P) substitution in the fourth calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain of fibulin- 5 protein. This amino acid substitution is predicted to have important structural and functional consequences for normal elastogenesis. As such, we provide evidence that a genetic defect in fibulin- 5 (FBLN 5, also known as EVEC or DANCE) is responsible for a recessive form of <b>cutis</b> <b>laxa</b> in humans...|$|E
