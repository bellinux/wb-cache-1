The property {{included many}} related buildings {{such as a}} <b>casting</b> <b>house</b> and a stove house, twenty-one log homes, a wagon shop, smoke house, stable, sawmill, boarding house, and store. The employees were often paid in kind rather than in cash. The furnace {{was never able to}} achieve a profit and was forced to close for several reasons: the Pennsylvania Railroad chose the Conemaugh Valley for its new route rather than the Blacklick, the furnace utilized outdated technologies, and the cost of hauling iron to the Canal was high. David Ritter experienced financial problems, losing property in Armagh as payment when sued by former partner George Rodgers for $350. In July 1848, the property was seized and sold at sheriff's sale to Soloman Alter and Joseph Replier of Philadelphia. After being purchased by Alter and Replier, the property passed hands many times before ultimately passing from Manor Realty of the Pennsylvania Railroad to the Cambria County Historical Society.|$|E

The storm destroyed equipment and facilities at the nearby Colbert Colliery, putting hundreds of miners out of work. In Reading, two men {{died in the}} collapse of an iron furnace <b>casting</b> <b>house</b> which left five others badly injured. Six children lost their lives to a storm-induced fire in tenement housing belonging to a mining company in Natalie. Hundreds of trees were blown down or broken on the historic battlefield at Gettysburg National Park, largely on Culp's Hill and Big Round Top. The 66th Ohio Infantry monument on Culp's Hill was destroyed by a fallen tree, and the nearby monument to the 78th and 102nd New York Volunteer Infantries sustained minor damage. In addition to the winds, several inches of rain fell in parts of the state; Altoona recorded [...] of precipitation. Flash flooding along the Juniata River rushed through Huntingdon, washing out streets and railways, inundating homes, and drowning livestock. Washouts and landslides plagued railroads throughout western Pennsylvania. Overall, the storm caused over $2 million in damage in the state.|$|E

[...] A large waterwheel powered the bellows. Carts loaded with charcoal passed to and fro between the coal barn and the furnace under a protective roof designed to keep the charcoal dry. Other wagons hauled the ore from the mine {{to the top of}} the furnace on the hillside. Workers then manually transported the charcoal and ore to the furnace. The guttermen worked at the base of the furnace. They raked the cooling sand and dug channels for the molten pig iron. Next, they stacked the bars of pig iron outside.

In order to identify and prioritise areas in the <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> where greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced {{it is necessary to}} quantify CO 2 e (CO 2 equivalent tonnes) emissions for the various <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> operations.

40|$|Primary {{aluminum}} production {{brings about}} severe environmental burden {{due to its}} energy intensive process.   Secondary aluminum production contributes to cutting off high energy demand around 90 - 95 % and greenhouse gas emission by remelting scraps. However, previous research indicates melting furnace’s energy efficiency in secondary plant is still very low, which is around 26 - 29 % and more than 70 % heat is lost in different way. The objective of this project is to investigate energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in secondary aluminum <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> through process analysis. The result offers a comprehensive overview to aid decision-maker to compare energy consumption and environmental impacts caused by different product or process. This project {{has been done in}} collaboration with SAPA Heat Transfer. This project consists of two tasks. First task is aimed to give an overview of annual energy distribution and carbon footprint of per ton aluminum slab in SAPA <b>cast</b> <b>house.</b> In order to analyze energy distribution, mass and energy conservation has been applied for calculation. Meanwhile, International standard method, life cycle assessment, has been used to evaluate greenhouse gas contribution of the whole production process. The second task intends to investigate two effects (melting furnace type, raw material type) on products’ energy consumption and carbon footprint.  Melting furnace’s effect is compared by selecting electric induction furnace and oxy-fuel furnace. On the other hand, raw material’s effect is studied by comparison of four different <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> products which have different raw material recipe. Calculation and analysis results indicates that per ton Sapa <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> aluminum slab consumes energy 3826 MJ and contributes to 306 kgCO 2 eq. green house gas. Meanwhile, comparison results show that oxy-fuel melting furnace has higher energy efficiency than electric induction furnace, however, it contributes much more GHG due to consumption of propane fuel. In addition, primary ingot has been concluded as distinct carbon footprint contribution than others contributors (i. e. fuel) for Sapa <b>cast</b> <b>house’s</b> slab...|$|R

50|$|Between 1837 and 1839, {{the company}} built an iron furnace in Lonaconing, Maryland. The furnace, fueled by coke, went into blast in 1839.

This paper assesses a few different approaches to reducing hot tearing in the <b>cast</b> <b>house.</b> Grain refinement is one commonly used approach, including dosing at cast start. Another technique is to control the alloy content, through the additions of Si, Mg, Mn or Fe which can influence the type and amount of intermetallics present during {{the final stages of}} solidification when hot tearing occurs. This paper summarizes experimental findings which assess the influence of additions on a hot tear rating, particularly in 6 xxx series alloys. Strategies which could be used in the <b>cast</b> <b>house</b> are discussed. While changes to the bulk metal can have consequences for alloy specification and quality control, additions at cast start could be used to reduce scrap from hot tearing without changing the composition of the saleable product...|$|R
