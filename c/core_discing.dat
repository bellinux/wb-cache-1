Aiming at the {{complexity}} of rock discing mechanics, and the theory being not mature, the paper carried out three-dimensional numerical simulation for rock <b>core</b> <b>discing</b> based on strain soft model. The strain soft theory is introduced firstly, then numerically simulated how the depth of lug boss and original stress affect the rock core destroy pattern(discing if occurs, the thickness of disk), obtained the characters of rock <b>core</b> <b>discing.</b> Along with the drilling depth increases, the stress concentration scope below lug boss also increases, {{as well as the}} pressure stress concentration degree of side corner below of lug boss. Rock <b>core</b> <b>discing</b> can be induced respectively by shear action and tension action, sometimes it is combined by both of them. The destroy pattern of them especially destroy sequence are different. The strain soft numerical simulation could be used in original stress feedback analysis, has significant meaning...|$|E
40|$|<b>Core</b> <b>discing</b> {{is common}} in gas wells in the Cooper Basin, central Australia. The {{occurrence}} of discing {{is consistent with the}} high in situ horizontal stresses that prevail in the basin. Thin sections in intervals of disced core reveal the occurrence of pre–existing, clay–filled, horizontal tensile microfractures in the same interval. This association implies that, although discing is a drilling–induced phenomenon in a high in situ stress environment, it utilizes pre–existing weaknesses presented by the microfractures. The development of the horizontal, tensile microfractures suggests that the basin must have been subject to a reverse fault stress state consistent with observed Tertiary thrusting. Indeed, regions exhibiting the greatest amount of Tertiary exhumation are most prone to horizontal microfracturing and associated <b>core</b> <b>discing.</b> Microfracture development is interpreted to be due to stress concentrations at grain contacts and microfractures are most prevalent in fine–to medium–grained, well–sorted sandstones. The presence of horizontal microfractures can complicate hydraulic fracture stimulations in the area. Hence an understanding of the origin of and controls on these fractures has a profound influence on strategies for well completions during field development. Together, grain size and amount of exhumation can be used as key criteria to successfully predict the occurrence of horizontal microfractures in sandstone reservoirs...|$|E

Aiming at the limitation of conventional methods, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) arithmetic is introduced to be combined with numerical simulation, so as to identify the ground stress based on rock core disicing observation. The objective function of optimization is constructed by combing Mohr-Coulomb criterion and tension criterion. Adopts dynamically adjusting momentum term method and steric compression method so as to improve the PSO in convergence velocity and globally searching property. The proposed method is mentioned and used to identify the ground stress of Bakken formation in USA. The arithmetic has good convergence speed and the identified results are coincident with the former reported results...|$|E
