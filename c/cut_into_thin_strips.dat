25|$|Dolphin meat is {{dense and}} such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat {{is located in a}} layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either {{horseradish}} or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver.|$|E

Because of this, only cheese in which the maggots are still alive is usually eaten, although allowances are made for cheese that has been refrigerated, which can kill the maggots. When the cheese has fermented enough, it is often <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> and spread on moistened Sardinian flatbread (pane carasau), to be served with a strong red wine. Casu marzu {{is believed to be}} an aphrodisiac by Sardinians. Because the larvae in the cheese can launch themselves for distances up to [...] when disturbed, diners hold their hands above the sandwich to prevent the maggots from leaping. Some who eat the cheese prefer not to ingest the maggots. Those who do not wish to do so place the cheese in a sealed paper bag. The maggots, starved for oxygen, writhe and jump in the bag, creating a [...] "pitter-patter" [...] sound. When the sounds subside, the maggots are dead and the cheese can be eaten.|$|E

5000|$|Toponymist George R. Stewart {{writes about}} the origin of the name [...] "Tug Fork". In 1756 a small army of Virginians and Cherokees {{conducted}} war raids against the Shawnee. At one point they killed and ate two buffaloes and hung their hides on a tree. Later they returned and, being out of provisions, took the hides and <b>cut</b> them <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> called [...] "tugs". These they roasted and ate. For this reason, the story goes, the stream was given the name [...] "Tug." [...] Stewart also points out another possible origin. Even if the story is true, the second explanation may have reinforced the name. In the Cherokee language [...] "tugulu" [...] refers to the forks of a stream, as in the Tugaloo River and other streams in former Cherokee lands named [...] "tug".|$|R
50|$|Papyrus is {{made from}} the stem of the papyrus plant, Cyperus papyrus. The outer rind is first removed, and the sticky fibrous inner pith is <b>cut</b> {{lengthwise}} <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> of about 40 cm long. The strips are then placed {{side by side on}} a hard surface with their edges slightly overlapping, and then another layer of strips is laid on top at a right angle. The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for decomposition to begin, perhaps increasing adhesion, but this is not certain. The two layers possibly were glued together. While still moist, the two layers are hammered together, mashing the layers into a single sheet. The sheet is then dried under pressure. After drying, the sheet is polished with some rounded object, possibly a stone or seashell or round hardwood.|$|R
5000|$|On {{his arrival}} in Burma, Roberts {{obtained}} grudging permission from the Burmese king, Thibaw Min, to build a school and educate the Kachins. The king, a devout Buddhist, granted Roberts [...] "land {{the size of a}} buffalo skin". Roberts bought a buffalo skin, <b>cut</b> it <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> and used it to measure out the mission compound. Although his wife soon died from Malaria, Roberts was to carry out his mission for 34 years. His daughter, Dora, and his son-in-law, John E. Cummings, also became missionaries to Burma.Roberts was followed by the Swedish-American missionary Ola Hanson, who arrived in 1890 and did much work in compiling a grammar and dictionary for their Jinghpaw language, and in translating hymns and the Bible into Jingpaw. In 1892 George J. Geis arrived, establishing a mission at Myitkyina, to the North of Bhamo.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{manufacture}} of pasta such as tagliatelle, dough is rolled and then <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips,</b> producing noodles. The excess parts of the dough, generally the edges, are left with irregular shape and thickness, therefore [...] "poorly cut" [...] or in Italian, maltagliati. Maltagliati are therefore cut from such scrap pieces of pasta, and differ in shape, size and thickness.|$|E

When the table was cleared, Janet assisted her to arrange her hair, to put on her nightcap, which was of a smarter construction than usual ('in case of fire', my aunt said), and to fold her gown back over her knees, these being her usual preparations for warming herself before going to bed. I then made her, according to certain established regulations from which no deviation, however slight, could ever be permitted, a glass of hot wine and water, and a slice of toast <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> long <b>thin</b> <b>strips.</b> With these accompaniments we were left alone to finish the evening, my aunt sitting opposite to me drinking her wine and water; soaking her strips of toast in it, one by one, before eating them; and looking benignantly on me, from among the borders of her nightcap.|$|R
5000|$|Called shiso (...) in Japanese, P. frutescens var. crispa leaves, seeds, and sprouts {{are used}} {{extensively}} in Japanese cuisine. Green leaves, called aojiso ( [...] ; [...] "blue shiso") {{is used as}} herb in cold noodle dishes (hiyamugi and sōmen), cold tofu (hiyayakko), as well as tataki and namerō. Aojiso is also served fresh with sashimi. Purple leaves, called akajiso ( [...] ; [...] "red shiso"), are used to dye pickled plums (umeboshi). Shiso seed pods are salted and preserved {{to be used as}} a spice, while the germinated sprouts called mejiso (...) are used as garnish.

30|$|An {{earlier study}} {{reported}} that the most popular methods of processing and preservation in the pastoral regions of sub-Saharan Africa are deep-frying and sun-drying (Gichure et al. 2014). These methods are considered part of traditional heritage in provision of high energy and protein diets (Lokuruka 2006). In the past decade, {{studies have been conducted}} on optimization of the quality traits of these products, but most of the studies have been limited to sun-dried products. However, as earlier stated, this practice only exists in the rural areas. In sub-Saharan Africa, pastoralists <b>cut</b> lean meat <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips,</b> which are exposed to direct sunlight for drying. Depending on the community, the stripes may be marinated, salted or even grilled during the process while drying may take up to five days (Fonkem et al. 2010). In the last two decades, solar driers are increasingly replacing sun-drying as they improve quality and safety of dried products, in addition to significantly reducing the drying time.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the Moors' occupation, the Lord of the region was a rich Moor who had three {{children}}; two boys and a girl. As he grew old and neared death, he called for his children and told them he wished to share his wealth, asking them to do so harmoniously between themselves. Following custom, the eldest son took the lands he desired and the second son acted in the same way with the remaining land. There still remained a vast area of land and wealth for the daughter. The elderly father asked her if she was satisfied with what remained, to which she replied: - Yes, father. But I do not wish for property. I think it is more important for us to have a castle to defend ourselves. Therefore, I only desire the bare land which can be covered by this ox-hide. Before the admiration of her father and brothers, she showed them the ox-hide with which she would delineate the territory of her inheritance. She then <b>cut</b> the skin <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips</b> and proceeded to mark the perimeter of the chosen area. Three days of heavy fog followed, {{at the end of which}} appeared to all as, if by magic, the Castle of Santiago do Cacém. (Adapted from Suplemento Litoral Alentejano, December 1998) ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Mali Empire, an evident {{example of}} oral {{history is the}} Sunjata Keita or Sundiata Keita story. The Sunjata Keita story remains a strong {{representation}} of oral history. Because there are a plethora of versions of the Sunjata story, this exemplifies how oral history can change slightly depending on the griot reciting the history. Also, oral history {{can be traced back}} to Sunjata because in the story Sunjata’s griots play a major part to his success. Bamba Suso in his version of Sunjata writes: [...] After that had happened they went into the circumcision shed. After they had come out of there, It was not long before his father died. Sunjata announced, ‘As for myself, However extensive my father’s property may be, [...] I want no part of it except the griots.’ They asked him, ‘Do you want the griots?’ They said, Leave it; [...] A person who has nothing will not have griots for long.’ The griots said, ‘Since he has let all his inheritance go, [...] And says that it is only us that he wants, We will not abandon him. If he does not die, we shall not desert him.’ The griots were at his side. [...] Suso’s story of Sunjata shows how griots often remain within the family lineage. When Sunjata’s father died, like other parts of his father’s estate, Sunjata was able to choose griots from his father’s estate as well. The Sunjata story shows that in the Mali Empire, noble families needed griots in order to spread family history. Sunjata states, “I want no part of it property except the griots”. Sunjata’s need for a griot emphasizes how noble families and griots were often seen as undividable. In the Mali Empire, griots were associated with noble families because such families needed oral historians to accompany them in order to tell the history of their life. Emperors and great warriors often had griots and with such griots, oral history in Mali spreads. The oral historians who were “assigned” to or rather “chosen” for a family were set to remain loyal to that family for life. Loyalty was an important quality a griot must have. In Suso’s version of the Sunjata story says: “We griots will not abandon him”. In the Mali Empire, the bond between griots and the emperor, warrior-king, or family they served was meant to be a lifelong bond. In Sunjata, Sunjata’s griot, Bala Faaseega Kuyate acted as both the oral historian for Sunjata and his advisor at times. Throughout Suso’s version of Sunjata, Bala Faaseega Kuyate accompanies Sunjata. Suso writes: [...] "A day will come When bush fowls will lay their eggs on the site of your deserted town. He says here is your gold.’ When he had done that, Sunjata buried his mother; [...] Then he and Nyakhaleng Juma Suukho, And his younger brother, And Bala Faaseega Kuyate Rose up and went. When he and Bala Faaseega Kuyate were on their way, They had gone far into the bush, And they had been travelling for a long time when Bala said, ‘I Am terribly hungry.’ Sunjata said, ‘Wait here.’ He went into a clump of thick bush, He examined the calf of his leg where there was plenty of flesh and he cut some off. When he had <b>cut</b> it <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>strips,</b> he cooked it, Then he pounded the leaves of a medicinal shrub and then tied up his leg, He came back, And he said to Bala, ‘Here is some meat’".The relationship between Sunjata and Bala Faaseega Kuyate describes the relationship between oral historians and emperors or aristocrats in the Mali Empire. Sunjata was very protective of Kuyate, in turn; Kuyate was extremely loyal to Sunjata. It is the job of the griots to be loyal to the family or person they “work” for. Griots did not merely work for the nobility, griots in the Mali Empire also worked for villages. Such griots were used to recite history of births and deaths, battles and marriages in the village.|$|R
