5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise his pace, ball control, technical skills and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, he can also play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a more central position, as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} players in the world in his {{position}} during his prime, Evra is a fast, energetic and athletic left back, who, despite his size, is physically strong, and good in the air, which also allows him to be deployed as a centre-back on occasion; in addition to his physical attributes, he is also <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> the ball and adept at getting into attacking positions as a wing-back, where he can deliver crosses to teammates, having functioned as a winger earlier on in his career. An aggressive, tactically intelligent, versatile and hard-working player, he is also renowned for his leadership and tenacity on the pitch. These attributes make him effective both offensively and defensively.|$|E

5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E
5|$|The {{build up}} to Euro 1988 in West Germany was far from ideal, as key player Mark Lawrenson was forced to retire after {{injuring}} his Achilles tendon, Liam Brady picked up a serious knee injury and Mark Kelly was also injured. The first match of the tournament was against England at the Neckarstadion, and Charlton reasoned that {{the threat posed by}} English wingers Chris Waddle and John Barnes could be nullified by allowing the English defence to feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> the ball without allowing them a pass; this made the build-up play slow and containable. His game-plan worked and Ireland claimed a 1–0 win after Ray Houghton secured an early lead. He then compensated for a series of injuries by playing Ronnie Whelan and Kevin Sheedy in central midfield, and was rewarded with a great performance and a good point in a 1–1 draw with the Soviet Union at the Niedersachsenstadion, Whelan scoring the goal. To qualify they only needed a point against the Netherlands at the Parkstadion, and Charlton devised a time-wasting plan with goalkeeper Packie Bonner that he was forced to abandon after referee Horst Brummeier was less than impressed. Ireland lost the game 1–0 after Wim Kieft scored an 82nd-minute goal. England and Ireland were eliminated whilst Netherlands and the Soviet Union qualified – both teams would go on to contest the final.|$|E
5|$|The show's title {{character}} is {{portrayed in the}} two pilots by Pal, the MGM film Lassie. Thereafter, five of his male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again. His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> the set after an overhead light crashed to the floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work. Spook played the role {{in the spring and}} fall of 1960. Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.|$|E

5|$|As {{the teams}} {{returned}} to Asia, the focus {{shifted to the}} championship race. Lewis Hamilton put himself in the ideal position to take the fight to Fernando Alonso, qualifying on pole whilst Alonso could only manage fifth place. In the physically most demanding race of the year, the teams jostled for position through {{the first phase of}} the Grand Prix, trying to position themselves for the final ten laps. Just as the drivers established a rhythm, Hamilton's gearbox failed, forcing him out of the race and handing the lead to Sebastian Vettel. The race was shortened by two laps to fit the two-hour time limit for a Grand Prix following a pair of lengthy safety car interventions; first, Narain Karthikeyan understeered into the barriers under the grandstands on lap 30, forcing the safety car to be deployed. The drivers had little opportunity to get <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> the restart, as Michael Schumacher misjudged his braking point at the end of the Esplanade Bridge, careening into the back of Jean-Éric Vergne and triggering the safety car for the second time in an accident that was a near mirror-image of his collision with Sergio Pérez in 2011. He was later given a ten-place grid penalty for the Japanese Grand Prix. Vettel controlled the race from the second restart, beating Jenson Button to the line, for his second win of the season and his first since the Bahrain Grand Prix five months previously. Alonso completed the podium, retaining his championship lead after defending from Paul di Resta late in the race. Elsewhere, a string of retirements – including a late engine problem for Bruno Senna, which left the Brazilian with minor burns to his back – and a series of altercations involving Mark Webber, Nico Hülkenberg, Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Pérez as they fought over the minor points positions allowed Timo Glock to finish twelfth, the result seeing Marussia retake tenth position in the World Constructors' Championship from Caterham.|$|E

25|$|Sevareid always {{considered}} himself a writer first and often felt uneasy behind a microphone, even less <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> television. Nonetheless, he worked extensively for CBS News {{on television in}} the years following the war and the decades after. During the mid to late 1950s, Sevareid found himself on television as the host and science reporter of CBS's Conquest. He also served {{as the head of the}} CBS Washington bureau from 1946 to 1954 and became one of the early critics of Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communism tactics. It was during the early 1950s that Sevareid caught the attention of the FBI in its attempts to identify and root out American communists.|$|E
25|$|He {{was most}} <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> either wing in midfield, {{though he could}} play {{centrally}} in a 4–5–1 formation or as a second striker.

For several seasons he played a major role for the club including {{being a member of the}} unbeaten 49 game run for Arsenal. He had to fight with constant injury problems and occasionally severe bouts with migraines; in 2005 a persistent hip injury led to fears he may have contracted cancer, which were unfounded. It transpired that he was suffering from blood poisoning caused by his large tattoos.|$|E
25|$|Hershey {{lost their}} next three games, {{starting}} with a home-and-home series against the Penguins on November 1 and 2, dropping the first after winger Matt Watkins missed a penalty shot in overtime, and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton scored with 25 {{seconds left in the}} extra period. The Bears lost the second game despite Leggio making 38 saves and Hershey scoring twice in their first three shots, just two minutes apart. In their 4–3 loss against Norfolk on November 3, the Bears scored three goals in three minutes during regulation, but failed to connect on the shootout. Orlov, having just returned from Washington, scored a goal and assist, leaving him tied for eighth in the league for defensemen with eight points, and first for shooting at 40 percent. He was sent back to the Capitals after one day back with Hershey. The Bears were successful in all 10 penalty kills over their past two games, bringing it to sixth-best in the league at 85.7 percent, although their power play was ranked 27th of 30 at 12 percent. Having won only one of five home games so far, Mike Haviland believed the team needed to stop feeling so <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> home ice.|$|E

500|$|The Stork Club was a {{television}} series hosted by Billingsley, who circulated among the tables interviewing {{guests at the}} club.

The program began on CBS Television with the network having built a replica of the Cub Room on the Stork Club's sixth floor to serve as the set for the show.

500|$|Dutch {{journalist}} Michiel Jongsma {{suggests that}} Kieftenbeld's position {{of choice is}} as a holding midfielder {{in front of the}} defence, where he can best use his energy in recovering the ball. He is <b>comfortable</b> <b>on</b> the ball and able to distribute it, but can be careless in possession, and [...] "he really tries to shake up things when the play has gone dormant. In that lies his weakness as wellhe can pick up silly fouls and cards from time to time." [...] With Groningen, he averaged eight yellow cards a season. According to Groningen's technical director Henk Veldmate, speaking in 2014, his battling style and never-say-die attitude made him the sort of player with whom supporters could identify. In a 2011 interview, Kieftenbeld described himself as a perfectionist who always wanted to improve, and said that he sometimes put too much pressure on himself.|$|E

He felt the event was [...] "fun", and praised his team for improving his car which allowed them to challenge Red Bull.

500|$|Myrie-Williams is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, and can play on either flank. He is predominantly left-footed, {{and has been}} used on the wing {{for the majority of}} his career.

He has been described as being [...] "blessed with searing pace and an impressive left foot", causing defenders [...] "countless problems". Myrie-Williams believes that his strongest attribute is that he [...] "loves running at defenders", as well as being [...] "pretty confident with the ball at his feet" [...] and [...] "not being afraid to take anyone on due to his pace". He also states that he can [...] "spot a good pass", and gets as much enjoyment assisting goals as he does scoring them.
