60|$|Later.--I want to {{know when}} you are coming, so as {{to get you a}} room. You will {{toboggan}} and skate your head off, and I will talk it off, and briefly if you don't come pretty soon, I will <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> with a shilling.|$|E

'If it weren't for the jelly, and the natural {{affections}} always engendered by shoemaking, I think I should almost feel inclined to <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> with a shilling, Artie, my boy--to <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> with a shilling. Well, Artie, I'm quite convalescent now (don't you call it? I'm afraid of my long shoemaker's words before you, nowadays, you've grown so literary; for I suppose parsons are more literary than even shoemakers). I'm quite convalescent now, and I think, my boy, I must get to work again this week, and have no more of your expensive soups and jellies. If I didn't keep a sharp look-out upon you, Artie, lad, I believe you'd starve yourself outright up there at Oxford to pamper your poor old useless father here with luxuries he's never been accustomed to in his whole life.' ...|$|E

5000|$|This is the beginning—from [...] "I" [...] to [...] "we". If you who own {{the things}} people must have could {{understand}} this, you might preserve yourself. If you could separate causes from results, if you could know that Paine, Marx, Jefferson, Leninwere results, not causes, you might survive. But that you cannot know. For the quality of owning freezes you forever into [...] "I", and <b>cuts</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> forever from the [...] "we". Chapter 14 ...|$|R
60|$|Frank. Jack, thy answer savors of self-will. If it is ordained that thou shouldst {{advance the}} ends of the Brotherhood by being shark-bitten, or flea-bitten, or bitten by sharpers, to the {{detriment}} of thy carnal wealth, or, shortly, to suffer any shame or torment whatsoever, even to strappado and scarpines, thou art bound to obey thy destiny, and not, after that vain Roman conceit, to choose the manner of thine own death, which is indeed only another sort of self-murder. We therefore consider thee as a cause of scandal, and a rotten and creaking branch, to be excised by the spiritual arm, and do hereby excise <b>thee,</b> and <b>cut</b> <b>thee</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{understand}} better now,' said Mrs. Moss. 'Perhaps {{it would have}} been more advisable if there had been no intermingling of ranks, yet I can hardly regret, when I see you, my Violet. It has raised your whole tone of mind, but it has <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> from us, and we cannot conceal it from ourselves.

60|$|POTHINUS. I {{will deal}} plainly. I know not by what strange gods {{you have been}} enabled to defend a palace and a few yards of beach against a city and an army. Since we <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> from Lake Mareotis, and you dug wells in the salt sea sand and brought up buckets of fresh water from them, we have known that your gods are irresistible, and {{that you are a}} worker of miracles.

6000|$|Dear Colvin, please {{remember}} {{that my life}} passes among my [...] "blacks or chocolates." [...] If I were to do as you propose, {{in a bit of}} a tiff, it would <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> entirely from my life. You must try to exercise a trifle of imagination, and put yourself, perhaps with an effort, into some sort of sympathy with these people, or how am I to write to you?

'No, Bertha, I did not shudder at {{the wild}} {{delusion}} and indiscretion, {{which may be}} lived down and redeemed, but at the fearful act that would have <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> from all hope, and chained you to yourself, and such a self, for ever, never to part from the shame whence you sought to escape.

"Having, therefore, {{considered}} {{all these}} things, and fully reflected upon them, as I see I {{have not been}} able to engage you by any motives to do as you ought, I have come to the conclusion to lay before you, in writing, this my last determination, resolving, however, to wait still a little longer before I come to a final execution of my purpose, in order to give you one more trial to see whether you will amend or no.

60|$|Eighth, They that profess {{the name}} of Christ, or that name that name religiously, should depart from iniquity, because of the {{ordinances}} of Christ, for they are holy. (Ex. 30:17-31) Men of old before they went in to meddle with holy things, were to wash their hands and their feet in a vessel prepared for that purpose. Now since they that name that name religiously do also meddle with Christ's appointments, they must also wash and be clean; cleanse your hands ye sinners, if you mean to meddle with Christ in his appointment; wash lest God <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off</b> for your not departing from iniquity.|$|E

Then methought I {{should see}} as if both Peter, and Paul, and John, {{and all the}} writers, did look with scorn upon me, and hold me in derision; and as if they said unto me, All our words are truth, one of as much force as another.

If they come on in spite of the fire, I should say that you had best all retire at the double. It will be of no use trying to hold the houses; they would only outflank you and <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>off.</b> I have already {{arranged}} with the volunteers that they shall make a stand at Royal Street.

60|$|Exam. 3. Art thou born again? Then thou seest that thy great sin was want {{of faith}} in the Son of Mary. Then thou seest that it is he that was sent of God to die for the sins of the world (John 1:29, 3:16-19; Acts 13:38,39) and that thou art {{complete}} in him, without any works of the law (Rom 4:5), then thou rejoicest in Christ Jesus, and puttest no confidence in the flesh (Phil 3:3) yet thou rejoicest in the flesh and blood of the Son of Mary, knowing that his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed (John 6:55) out of which thou wouldest very willingly make thy life all thy days; out of his birth, obedience, death, resurrection, ascension, and glorious intercession, now at the right hand of his Father (Heb 7:24,25), but if thou art wavering in these things, know that thou art but a babe at the best, and for ought thou knowest, God may <b>cut</b> <b>thee</b> <b>off</b> in thy unbelief, and cast thee into utter darkness, where there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.|$|R
