The committee's Training and Research <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session. During August 1998, the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be followed for the selection of names. It was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and that a single objection would be enough to veto a name. A list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the Typhoon Committee's 32nd session, who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on January 1, 2000. It was also decided that the Japan Meteorological Agency would name the systems rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although {{coordination}} of concurrent objects {{is a fundamental}} aspect of object-oriented concurrent programming, there is only little support for its specification and abstraction at the language level. This is a problem because coordination is often buried in the code of the coordinated objects, leading {{to a lack of}} abstraction and reuse. Here we present CoLaS, a coordination model and its implementation based on the notion of <b>Coordination</b> <b>Groups.</b> By clearly identifying and separating the coordination from the coordinated objects CoLaS provides a better abstraction and reuse of the coordination and the coordinated objects. Moreover CoLaS’s high dynamicity provides better support for {{coordination of}} active objects. ...|$|R
