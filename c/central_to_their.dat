He helped popularize major poets such as Guido Cavalcanti and Du Fu, and brought Provençal and Chinese poetry to English-speaking audiences. He revived interest in the Confucian classics and introduced the west to classical Japanese poetry and drama. He translated and championed Greek, Latin and Anglo-Saxon classics, and helped keep them alive {{at a time when}} poets no longer considered translations <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> craft.|$|E
5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{discipline of}} the legions was quite harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and {{a broad array of}} punishments could be inflicted upon a legionary who broke them.

30|$|Second, we {{have found}} that the {{evolution}} of the eigenvector centrality of a department reveals more than just the relative size of the department. We emphasize that a department’s centrality does not necessarily correspond to its individual importance, but rather its importance in connecting the college as a whole. For instance, while mathematics has a moderate number of majors compared to the other quantitative sciences, it is highly <b>central</b> due <b>to</b> both its high number and diversity of double majors. Additionally, we can differentiate departments that are <b>central</b> due <b>to</b> <b>their</b> major influence (e.g., economics and political science) from those that are <b>central</b> due <b>to</b> <b>their</b> minor influence (e.g., language and culture studies).|$|R

25|$|The loss of Bower was a {{blow that}} {{threatened}} to end the band's career as it was taking off. Bower was <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> success, having written (or co-written) all their singles and all original tracks on their debut album. His forced departure left the group floundering, and they continued with de facto leadership passing to Keays. At the end of September, Keays and Webb chose Bower's replacement, guitarist Rick Harrison (ex-The Others) from Adelaide.|$|E

25|$|Arguably, {{the artistic}} {{frictions}} between Cale and Reed are what shaped the group's early sound {{much more than}} any other members. The pair often had heated disagreements about the direction of the group, and this tension was <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> later collaborations. When Cale left, he seemed to take the more experimentalist tendencies with him, as is noticeable in comparing the proto-noise rock of White Light/White Heat (which Cale co-created) to the comparatively dulcet, folk rock-influenced The Velvet Underground, recorded after his departure.|$|E

25|$|Following a phenomenological {{study of}} nine {{individuals}} involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain as <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> experience, sexual masochism {{was described as}} an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much {{as described in the}} descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern presented in this study suggests an association with behavioral spin as found in problem gamblers.|$|E

They also believe the destruction of those who reject their message and thus willfully refuse to obey God will shortly take place at Armageddon, ensuring that {{the beginning of the}} new earthly society will be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Dharma traditions do {{not hold}} history <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> faith. Gautama Buddha {{emphasized}} that his enlightenment was merely a discovery of a reality that is always there. He was not bringing any new covenants from any God. The history of the Buddha is not necessary for Buddhist principles to work. In fact, Buddha stated that he was neither the first nor {{the last person to}} have achieved the state of enlightenment. He also asserted that he was not God nor sent by any God as a prophet, and whatever he discovered was available to every human to discover for himself. This makes Buddhism not History-Centric.|$|E
25|$|For some Pagan groups, {{ethnicity}} is <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> religion, {{and they}} often restrict membership {{to those who are}} of the same ethnic group as themselves. Critics of this position have described this exclusionary approach as a form of racism. Alternately, other Pagan groups allow individuals of any ethnicity to join them, expressing the view that the gods and goddesses of a particular region can call anyone to their worship. Sometimes such individuals express the view that they feel a particular affinity for the pre-Christian belief systems of a particular region with which they have no ethnic link because they themselves are the reincarnation of an individual from that society.|$|E
25|$|Camels are the {{backbone}} of the Rashaida pastoralists' economy and are also <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> culture. Camel milk is a key ingredient in their diet and, since sorghum is their only other staple, it represents their almost exclusive source of protein and vitamins. Cash is received at town markets for male camels sold for slaughter at the age of six to seven years. They are collected at regular intervals into large herds and driven to the meat markets in Egypt, where they bring in profits ranging from LSd 7 000 to LSd 12 000, i.e. approximately US$600 to US$1000, per head. Some male animals though are kept for riding and to carry their burden for their migrations. A separate strain, the Anafi, is bred for the racing camel market in the Persian Gulf area, where prices reach up to LSd 1 million.|$|E

25|$|Howe retired for {{the first}} time in 1971 and was {{immediately}} inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame that same year. He was then inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame the next year. However, he came back two years later to join his sons Mark and Marty on the Houston Aeros of the WHA. Although in his mid-40s, he scored over 100 points twice in six years, although it's recognized that goal scoring was approximately 25% higher in the WHA than in the NHL. He made a brief return to the NHL in 1979–80, playing one season with the Hartford Whalers, then retired at the age of 52. His involvement with the WHA was <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> brief pre-NHL merger success and forced the NHL to expand their recruitment to European talent and to expand to new markets.|$|E
25|$|Federal Actions {{to address}} the disproportionate health and {{environmental}} disparities that minority and low-income populations face through Executive Order (E.O) 12898, required federal agencies to make environmental justice <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> programs and policies. Superfund sites {{have been shown to}} impact minority communities the most. Despite legislation specifically designed to ensure equity in Superfund listing, marginalized populations still experience a lesser chance of successful listing and cleanup than areas with higher income levels. After the executive order had been put in place, there persisted a discrepancy between the demographics of the communities living near toxic waste sites and their listing as Superfund sites, which would otherwise grant them federally funded cleanup projects. Communities with both increased minority and low-income populations were found to have lowered their chances of site listing after the executive order, while on the other hand, increases in income led to greater chances of site listing. Of the populations living within 1 mile radius of a Superfund site, 44% of those are minorities despite only being around 37% of the nation's population. It has also been shown that the government responds slower to community demands from minority communities than from white communities. Superfund sites near white communities have seen better clean up and harsher penalties for the polluters than minority communities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had slung over his shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E

500|$|According to Lisa Tetrault, a {{professor}} of women's history, the Seneca Falls Convention was <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> rendition of the movement's history. Neither Stanton nor Anthony {{had been at the}} 1850 convention, which was associated with their rivals. Stanton, however, had played a key role at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, at which Stone had not been present. In the early 1870s, Stanton and Anthony began to present Seneca Falls as the beginning of the women's rights movement, an origin story that downplayed Stone's role. Pointing out that the women's rights movement could be said to have begun even earlier than Seneca Falls, Tetrault said the History of Woman Suffrage dealt with these earlier events relatively briefly in its first three chapters, the first of which is titled [...] "Preceding Causes." ...|$|E
500|$|In Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington {{traces the}} Mormon pioneer {{practices}} of [...] "central planning, organized cooperation, and the partial socialization of investment implicit in Mormon theory" [...] {{to the democratic}} theory of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Arrington also noted that pioneers found religious significance in creating farms out of previously wild land, making irrigation <b>central</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> way of life. The way Mormons freely distributed irrigation water—through a central canal and diverted when needed—reflected their communal values. While the Mormon cooperative economy died out in the 1880s, their cooperative spirit anticipated later governmental planning. Great Basin Kingdoms thorough documentation called attention to previously hidden sources in the LDS Church Archives. Dean L. May and Donald Worster criticized Great Basin Kingdom for overreaching its thesis that organized irrigation could rejuvenate a culture. One biographer attributes Arrington's overvaluing Mormon achievements {{to a lack of}} empirical studies on pioneer settlements at the time. Still, the book was received as an instant classic that raised the standard for Mormon scholarship. Dale L. Morgan, though critical of the lack of attention to the Gentile (i.e., non-Mormon) influence on Mormons, said that it was an indispensable ordering of Mormon data. The book is still considered one of the significant books on Mormon history.|$|E
