With more and more endeavors being made in the field of laparoscopy, more and more complicated cases which were relatively contraindicated a few years ago, are now being tackled laparos copically. AIM: Aims of this study is assessment of risk factors, diagnostic approach and management of cases undergoing difficult cholecystectomies on basis of clinical, USG, preoperative, intra operative findings, duration of surgery, rate <b>of</b> <b>conversion,</b> <b>post</b> op complications and duration of stay in hospital. MATERIAL & METHODS: Prospective study done from J une 2012 to N ov. 2014, 192 cases undergoing laproscopic cholecystectomy included in study at tertiary care hospital.
