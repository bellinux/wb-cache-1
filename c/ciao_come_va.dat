40|$|AbstractIntroduction“Partners in Dementia Care” (PDC) {{tested a}} care-coordination program based on {{partnerships}} between Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and Alzheimer's Association chapters. The hypothesis posited PDC {{would reduce the}} likelihood and number of veterans' hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits, particularly for those with more cognitive impairment or behavioral symptoms. MethodsThe sample included 328 veterans with dementia and their primary family or friend caregivers from five matched sites (two randomly selected treatment sites). Data <b>came</b> from <b>VA</b> records; supplemented by caregiver research interviews. Regression analyses using the likelihood and number of hospital and ED visits as outcomes tested for overall treatment-comparison group differences and statistical interactions with cognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms. ResultsConsistent with the hypothesis, three significant interactions showed treatment-group veterans, with more cognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms, had fewer hospital admissions and ED visits than comparison-group veterans. There were no differences in the likelihood of hospital or ED use. DiscussionPDC, a low-cost program for veterans and caregivers, was effective in reducing the number, but not the likelihood, of hospital admissions and ED visits. Reductions in service use were greater when caregivers reported more difficulties with veterans' symptoms, which {{in the absence of}} PDC would place veterans at risk of being high-volume, high-cost service users.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{men and women}} veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD). Women in the general public {{have been found to}} be at greater risk for a diagnosis of PTSD with life-long symptoms. Current literature involving military men and women veterans is at odds over which gender is more likely to have both PTSD and SUD. This study assessed the variables of gender and diagnosis. It also studied whether the age of female veterans affects their likelihood of having both PTSD and SUD. Archival data were gathered from the Veterans Administration (VA) for veterans seeking care at the VA during Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012. These data were stored on the VA Information Resource Center database; data <b>came</b> from <b>VA</b> medical diagnoses using the International Classifications of Diseases - 9 (ICD- 9). Participants were 38, 656 women veterans and 785, 052 male veterans. A chi-square test for goodness of fit revealed that male veterans were more likely than were female veterans to have the comorbid diagnosis of PTSD and SUD. This analysis revealed that women veterans in the 45 â?? 54 age groups were at greatest risk for the comorbid diagnosis. Women may not seek treatment at the VA because they lack childcare, it is dominated by mainly male veterans, and/or they may have a misconception of services for women. Part of social justice is including women veterans because they have historically been underserved by mental health and research. This study highlights the need for more research into improving health and mental healthcare for women at VA facilities...|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s Perniola {{offers some}} of his most {{insightful}} contributions to continental philosophy. In Dopo Heidegger. Filosofia e organizzazione della cultura (After Heidegger. Philosophy and Organization of Culture 1982), drawing on Martin Heidegger and Antonio Gramsci, Perniola includes a theoretical discourse on social organization. He in fact argues the possibility of establishing a novel relationship between culture and society in Western civilization. As the former interrelations between metaphysics and church, dialectics and state, science and profession have been deconstructed, philosophy and culture provide a way to overcome nihilism and populism which characterize today’s society. Ritual Thinking. Sexuality, Death, World (2001) is a composite volume in English containing sections of two works published in Italian in the 1980s, i.e. La società dei simulacri (The Society of Simulacra 1980) and Transiti. <b>Come</b> si <b>va</b> dallo stesso allo stesso (Transits. How to go from the Same to the Same 1985). Perniola’s theory of simulacra deals with the logic of seduction which was also pursued by Jean Baudrillard. Although seduction is empty, it is nevertheless rooted in a concrete historical context. Simulation, however, provides images which are valued as such regardless of what they actually represent or refer to. “Images are simulations in that they seduce and yet out of their emptiness they have effects”. Perniola then illustrates the role of such images {{in a wide range of}} cultural, aesthetic and social contexts. The notion of transit seems to be more suitable to capture the cultural aspects of technology which have altered today’s society.Transit - i.e. going from the same to the same - avoids falling into the opposition of dialectics “that would precipitate thinking in the mystification of metaphysics”.|$|R
40|$|This study {{contrasts}} the {{determinants of}} community hospital utilization with Veterans Administration (VA) hospital utilization using traditional planning variables. The comparisons had some expected and some unanticipated findings. Regional differences in non-VA hospital admissions and bed days are fairly well explained by measures of medical need, provider supply, community alternatives, and sociodemographic characteristics (other than those used as proxies for case mix). However, regional variations in the VA are explained less well by the same classes of variables and the unexplained {{differences between the two}} systems do not correspond geographically. This suggests that the two systems have different reasons for regional variation. Further, contrary to expectation, when other predictors are held constant, excess bed capacity in the area does not correlate with lower VA utilization. The study is important as the <b>VA</b> <b>comes</b> under increasing pressure to contain costs. It may well be that the rational planning model attributed to the public sector is less likely to overcome maldistribution than the private sector 'invisible hand'. Policy analysts need to give more attention to the political, bureaucratic determinants of resource allocation before changing eligibility criteria or merging the two systems. small area variation veterans/civilian utilization resource distribution planning...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary trade {{analysis}} {{indicates the}} necessity of calculating trade in value added (TiVA) which is created through global value chains (GVCs). This paper aims to determine the characteristics and importance of GVC trade in the EU new member states (EU NMS) with special emphasis placed on the industry level. The results demonstrate different levels of GVC participation of the EU NMS, where Hungary is the most integrated country and Croatia the least integrated. Regional GVCs exist because {{a huge part of}} value added (<b>VA)</b> <b>comes</b> from EU member states, as in gross export as well as in final demand (Europe as a hub). The most important source countries are Germany and Italy and there is also evidence of geographical and historical relations between the countries. The domination of backward participation has been found in the analysis made on the industrial level, i. e. the EU NMS are highly dependent on the import of intermediates for the production and export of final products. Strong interconnections between imports of intermediate products and exports of final products have been found in the manufacture of computers, electronics and optical products; manufacture of wood, paper, printing and reproduction. This research has contributed to the scarce literature concerning GVC (TiVA) in EU NMS and has opened up new possibilities for further research and analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF), {{have demanded}} {{unprecedented}} service {{at every level}} of the U. S. Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines. For the first time in our military history, active duty, reservists, and guard servicemen and women have been required to complete multiple deployments. These repeated, lengthy deployments combined with limited family "dwell" time in between have deteriorated the stability of many military families. Of the almost two million Americans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, many arrive home with serious mental health conditions and injuries that increase relationship stress, marital strain, and family violence. The first large-scale, nongovernmental assessment of the psychological needs of OIF/OEF service members, released by the Rand Corporation in 2008, revealed that 38 percent of these combat veterans suffered from Post Traumatic Stress (PTS), major depression, traumatic brain injury, or some combination of the three [...] yet less than half had sought treatment. Figures from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) suggest that these numbers have almost doubled; Forty-four percent of those who <b>came</b> to the <b>VA</b> for help have been diagnosed with one or more mental health issue.

This update 1 paper provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, through revised results for the period 1997 - 2003. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, it also provides some information about the financial situation of a few vital sectors in each port. A global indication concerning the financial health of the companies studied is also provided, using the NBB bankruptcy prediction model. In addition, it includes figures with respect to the ongoing growth of several cargo traffic segments and provides an overall picture of social developments in the Flemish maritime ports. The indirect effects of these port activities are estimated in terms of value added and employment. Annual account data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. The indirect effects were estimated on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. In the Flemish maritime ports, direct <b>VA</b> <b>came</b> to almost 11. 5 billion euro and total VA - the sum of direct and indirect VA - to 22 billion euro in 2003. In the same year direct and total employment reached respectively 105, 000 and 239, 000 full-time equivalents, while direct investment reached 2. 5 billion euro. The ongoing developments in the maritime ports sector in the Hamburg - Le Havre range continue to affect the port operations: concentration of capital, privatisation of port logistic services, expansion and dispersion of foreign trade, internationalisation of production and consumption patterns, increase in containerised shipments, etc. Production, trade and transport are no longer considered as individual and isolated activities, but are integrated within a single system, while economies of scale continue. Therefore, ports are becoming real logistic centres: ports able to add value to the goods passing through the port area have a major advantage in a climate of increasing international competition. Flemish ports are following this trend, and that is also reflected in the analysis presented in this report. branch survey, maritime cluster, subcontracting, indirect effects, transport intermodality, public investments. ...|$|R
