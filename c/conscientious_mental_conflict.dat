40|$|This {{book is not}} {{available}} through ChesterRep. Many <b>conscientious</b> <b>mental</b> health professionals caring for disturbed patients have either unscientifically formulated for themselves notions of 'evil' to explain the behavior of their patients, or have been given patients described by judges and the press as 'evil'. Although such notions may be deemed unscientific, beyond the purview of medicine, and better suited for discussion by theologians and moral philosophers, {{the fact remains that}} these notions of 'evil' have a definite impact on the practice of psychiatry, if not all medical fields...|$|R

50|$|According to psychoanalytic theory, many {{cognitive}} modules are {{unconscious and}} repressed, to avoid <b>mental</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Defenses {{are meant to}} be cognitive modules used to suppress the awareness of other cognitive modules. Unconscious cognitive modules may influence our behaviour without our being aware of it.|$|R

Manisha Koirala also plays a leading role.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mental</b> <b>conflicts</b> were {{analyzed}} {{from the viewpoint}} that the patients, initially, did not understand how such feelings were occurring at a subconscious level, hidden inside their minds. 'It is free association within language {{that is the key}} to representing the prohibited and forbidden desire...to access unconscious affective memory'.|$|R
50|$|Freud's {{eventual}} {{practice of}} psychoanalysis focused {{not so much}} on the recall of these memories as on the internal <b>mental</b> <b>conflicts</b> which kept them buried deep within the mind. However, the technique of free association still plays a role today in therapeutic practice and {{in the study of the}} mind.|$|R
60|$|Most of {{the spectators}} had {{gathered}} {{in one or}} two groups--one a little crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of Chobham. Evidently they shared my <b>mental</b> <b>conflict.</b> There were few near me. One man I approached--he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine, though I did not know his name--and accosted. But it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation.|$|R
60|$|The {{temptation to}} consult his chief, to talk over the weighty fact, {{and get his}} opinion on it, was great indeed.

It's not the situation, it's the <b>mental</b> <b>conflict.</b> Why am I pulled about? She has got into my imagination. How? I haven't the remotest idea." ...|$|R
50|$|Psychoanalysis, {{a school}} of thought founded by Sigmund Freud that {{emphasizes}} the resolution of unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>conflicts,</b> is used by its practitioners to treat clients presenting with major depression. A more widely practiced technique, called psychodynamic psychotherapy, is loosely based on psychoanalysis and has an additional social and interpersonal focus. In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials, psychodynamic psychotherapy {{was found to be}} as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.|$|R

5000|$|In 1939, Hartmann, in what Otto Fenichel called [...] "a very {{interesting}} paper, {{tried to show}} that adaptation has been studied too much {{from the point of}} view of <b>mental</b> <b>conflict.</b> He points out that there is also a 'sphere without conflict' [...] " [...] - something that would be repeatedly emphasized in ego-psychology. In the same year, in [...] "Psychoanalysis and the Concept of Health", he made an impressive contribution to defining normality and health in psychoanalytic terms.|$|R
40|$|An avatar is {{the other}} self in a virtual space. This paper {{discusses}} the relationship between an avatar and the self in today's adolescents. First, the author considered communication between avatars. It is {{pointed out that the}} other's presence is weak in communication and that an avatar has a one-sided character, which is projected {{from one side of the}} user's personality. Next, the author considers the virtual space where avatars exist, and claims that the space is almost unlimited spatially and temporally, and that the boundary between the self and others is vague in this space. These features are related to the characteristics of dissociative disorder and developmental disorder, which are often discussed in today's clinical psychology. People who have these disorders are said to find it hard hold a <b>mental</b> <b>conflict</b> within themselves, and it seems that the same applies to an avatar. An avatar in a virtual space has an aspect that functions as a system that makes adolescents evade <b>mental</b> <b>conflict</b> by artificially diffusing their own selves. However, it is important to understand an avatar and the self of today's adolescents themselves, and not to regard them as something pathological or different from us...|$|R

Very quickly, Clara begins dating black American resident physician Price Trainor (Peter DeAnda). ABC received several angry letters decrying the portrayal of a black man dating a white woman.|$|R
50|$|Many {{authors have}} criticized Hartmann's {{conception}} of a conflict-free sphere of ego functioning as both incoherent and inconsistent with Freud's vision of psychoanalysis as a science of <b>mental</b> <b>conflict.</b> Freud believed that the ego itself takes shape {{as a result of}} the conflict between the id and the external world. The ego, therefore, is inherently a conflicting formation in the mind. To state, as Hartmann did, that the ego contains a conflict-free sphere may not be consistent with key propositions of Freud's structural theory.|$|R
60|$|The {{decision}} which Cavanagh {{made between}} love and duty distinguished the officer from the man, the soldier from the civilian. He {{did not hesitate}} to act, and yet he suffered a <b>mental</b> <b>conflict</b> as he rode back toward the scene of that inhuman sacrifice on the altar of greed. His heart went out to Lee Virginia in longing. Her appealing voice still lay in his ear with an effect like the touch of her soft lips, and his flagging horse suffered from the unconscious pressure of his haste.|$|R
50|$|Persaud’s novels {{deal with}} the intricacies of Caribbean {{identity}} and individual and communal memory. Her first novel Butterfly in the Wind was published by Peepal Tree Press in 1990, and in it Persaud records the <b>mental</b> <b>conflicts</b> that attending a Catholic school caused for a Hindu girl. The novel deals in an imaginatively autobiographical way with the first 18 years of her life. Persaud records that her reading of Edmund Gosse’s Father and Son: A Study of Two Temperaments and Laurie Lee’s Cider with Rosie were significant influences in writing this book.|$|R
50|$|As {{shared in}} Olson’s {{speaking}} engagements and radio interviews, his passion {{is to help}} bring a greater measure of peace to this planet by reducing the level of conflict through greater self-understanding. Olson believes that <b>mental</b> <b>conflict</b> is initiated in the brain/mind complex, the result of profound differences in the polar left hemisphere and the non-polar right hemisphere as expressed though the unique perspectives and ideas that they generate. According to Olson, the perceptual and ideological conflicts that arise can often be consciously eliminated by understanding the two hemispheres as a complementary whole rather than as parts.|$|R
50|$|Psychoanalysis is {{a school}} of thought, founded by Sigmund Freud, which {{emphasizes}} the resolution of unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Psychoanalytic techniques are used by some practitioners to treat clients presenting with major depression. A more widely practiced therapy, called psychodynamic psychotherapy, is {{in the tradition of}} psychoanalysis but less intensive, meeting once or twice a week. It also tends to focus more on the person's immediate problems, and has an additional social and interpersonal focus. In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, this modification was found to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.|$|R
40|$|My {{aim is to}} {{investigate}} Aristotle's arguments regarding what roles desire and other parts, capacities, or powers of the soul – such as perception and reason – have in causing animal locomotion, as presented in De Anima. This will require an investigation into parts and powers of soul, for Aristotle sometimes talks of {{the parts of the}} soul while setting forth his own views, while at times he seems highly critical of theories of the soul that assume the soul to be partitioned. My claim is that in De Anima III. 9 - 10 Aristotle is attempting to account for locomotion in a way that allows for cases of <b>mental</b> <b>conflict,</b> without appealing to distinct or independent parts of the soul. I hope to show that Aristotle's arguments are best understood as a rejection of a Platonic account of <b>mental</b> <b>conflict,</b> which does appeal to distinct parts (pulling in different directions). However, in order for Aristotle's rejection of Plato's account to be successful we must consider in what way Aristotle conceived the soul to be partitioned, if at all. My claim will be that Aristotle did not think the soul to be partitioned, and that recent attempts at clarifying Aristotle's talk of parts and capacities of the soul commit Aristotle to a view similar to Plato's. This requires an investigation into the various places in De Anima where Aristotle talks of the soul's parts and its capacities. </p...|$|R
50|$|Even {{though he}} learned {{in a school}} of thought which {{considered}} mental illness mainly as an individual and biological problem, he later regarded it basically as a social one. He took {{the view that the}} <b>mental</b> <b>conflicts</b> of the neurotic are in large part induced by the sick society in which he or she lives. Thus, he felt that the efficiency of industry cannot be weighed solely in terms of the amount goods it produces or its financial profits, but also considering at what cost of human health and happiness the goods were produced. He expressed this view in his work The Social Psychology of Industry (1954).|$|R
50|$|As {{frequently}} occurs after a Christianization, people {{reconcile the}} <b>mental</b> <b>conflict</b> {{in their minds}} after changing their religion, substituting heathen gods with Christian saints,making {{it easier for them}} to virtually adhere to the old cult, traditions, symbolism and values without betraying the Christian religion. In the case of Novgorod, the imago of Perun was substituted with the figures of God the Father and Elias the Prophet. In the first case it is plays the role of Perun with the head of a pantheon; in the second, Elias the Prophet carries the attributes of Perun: he moves across the sky on a chariot, thundering and flashing (lightning) like Perun.|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} children’s cognitive role-taking {{in relation to}} their mothers’ choices of techniques to solve domestic dilemmas involving children’s misbehavior, social skills, and logical reasoning. Results showed that a mother’s preference for the childrearing strategy known as distancing, which uses a Socratic or dialectical inquiry to create cognitive conflict in the child, bore a significant association to her child’s advancement in cognitive role-taking skill. This finding is discussed in relation to theories of cognitive development that postulate that <b>mental</b> <b>conflict</b> or tension stimulates cognitive growth. Practical factors that might inhibit mothers from making effective use of the distancing technique are also considered...|$|R
40|$|There can be {{different}} intentions with brackets in mathematical expressions. It {{has previously been}} suggested that mathematically useless brackets can be educationally useful when learning the order of operations in expressions with mixed operations. This paper reports how students (12 - 13 years) deal with the implicit <b>mental</b> <b>conflict</b> between brackets as {{a necessary part of}} the order of operations and brackets to emphasize precedence. The students taking part in this quasi-experimental study were instructed on the order of operations, but were also indirectly exposed to different use of brackets. It is concluded that emphasizing brackets impede the transfer from a left-to-right computation strategy to the use of precedence rules...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{conflict}} theory, {{a variation}} of ego psychology, is a revised version of structural theory, most notably different by altering concepts related to where repressed thoughts were stored(Freud, 1923, 1926). Modern conflict theory addresses emotional symptoms and character traits as complex solutions to <b>mental</b> <b>conflict.</b> It dispenses with the concepts of a fixed id, ego and superego, and instead posits conscious and unconscious conflict among wishes (dependent, controlling, sexual, and aggressive), guilt and shame, emotions (especially anxiety and depressive affect), and defensive operations that shut off from consciousness {{some aspect of the}} others. Moreover, healthy functioning (adaptive) is also determined, to a great extent, by resolutions of conflict.|$|R

The very energetic expression, 'strike with our spirit's knife invulnerable nothings,' is worthy of remark. It will be remembered that, according to Shelley's belief, 'nothing exists but as it is perceived': see p. 56.

Numerous studies on the OPD indicate areas of possible improvement, for example for clinical purposes the OPD should be more practically formulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} {{raised in}} this chapter is why Aristotle portrays the bad person as being in a miserable state. It is argued that the bad person suffers from a <b>mental</b> <b>conflict,</b> which consists of a clash between two different kinds of desire, and that fulfilling one of the desires violates values that she also desires. But {{in contrast to the}} akratic person, the bad person has no proper conception of the good. Nevertheless, although the bad person may succeed in achieving what she thinks is good, she feels miserable not only on account of failing to fulfil her desire for the truly good life, but also on account of doing things that she finds degrading for her...|$|R

Until this thesis, the psychological ballet as a genre has been overlooked and left undefined. The Psychological Ballet can be defined by: (1) using Antony Tudor's "Pillar of Fire" as a model example and (2) analyzing the term "psychological ballet" into its two components "Psychological," and "Ballet," respectively.
