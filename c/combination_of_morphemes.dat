40|$|Compositionality is a {{critical}} and universal characteristic of human language. It is found at numerous levels, including the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>morphemes</b> into words and of words into phrases and sentences. These compositional patterns can generally be characterized by rules. For example, the past tense of most English verbs (“regulars”) is formed by adding an-ed suffix. However, many complex linguistic forms have rather idiosyncratic mappings. For example, “irregular ” English verbs have past tense forms that cannot be derived from their stems in a consistent manner. Whether regular and irregular forms depend on fundamentally distinct neurocognitive processes (rule-governed combination vs. lexical memorization), or whether a single processing system is sufficient to explain the phenomena, has engendered considerable investigation and debate. We recorded event-related potentials while participants read English sentences that were either correct or had violations of regular past tense inflection, irregular pas...|$|E

50|$|Upper Necaxa dynamic verbs are inflected {{for three}} tenses (past, present, future), four aspects (imperfective, perfective, perfect, progressive), and four moods (indicative, optative, potential, irrealis). The tenses are marked {{exclusively}} by prefixes {{in the past}} and future and by a zero in the present, while three of the fours aspects (imperfective, perfective, and perfect) are marked by suffixes. The fourth aspect, the progressive, is realized through the use of inflectional compounds formed on the stative verb ma ‘be lying’. The indicative mood is zero-marked while the optative and potential are marked by the prefixes ka- and t-, respectively; the fourth mood, the irrealis, is marked by idiomatic <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>morphemes</b> borrowed {{from other parts of the}} TAM paradigms. Stative verbs are marked for tense and mood, but lack aspectual inflections.|$|R
40|$|Heritage {{language}} speakers {{struggle in}} European classrooms with insufficient material provided for second language (SL) learning and assessment. Considering {{the amount of}} instruments and pertinent studies in English SL, immigrant students are better prepared than their peers in Romance language settings. This study investigates how factors such as age and home language {{can be used in}} the teaching environment to predict and examine the development outcomes of SL students in verbal reasoning and vocabulary tasks. Hundred and six Portuguese participants, SL learners, between 8 and 17 years old, were assessed in vocabulary frequency, verbal analogies and morphological extraction tasks. In alphabetic languages (Romance languages), immigrant students (in a SL learning situation) with a strong linguistic distance (a home language with a very different orthographic foundation) are expected to struggle in language learning in spite of being aware of strategies that can improve their skills. The storage and <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>morphemes</b> can be a demanding task for individual speakers at different levels. Cognitive mapping is strongly based on linguistic features of L 1 development. Results show that home language, not age, {{was a significant predictor of}} variation in student’s outcomes.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} phonologically motivated gaps in inflectional paradigms. A {{model is}} offered {{in which the}} appearance of gaps {{is based on a}} tension between markedness constraints, faithfulness constraints, and constraints which require the expression of morphological categories. After presenting the model, additional implications are analyzed. Situations in which the same problem has different solutions in different morphological contexts are predicted insofar as constraints requiring the expression of different categories can vary in their ranking relative to some faithfulness constraint. Hence, the same phonotactic problem can yield a gap in one situation and a repair in another. This prediction is illustrated and further details of the prediction are explored, including the identification of a situation requiring a more restrictive version of the model. This is achieved by drawing on Smith’s (2001) proposal that faithfulness constraints can be indexed to lexical categories to model this situation. 1. I NTRODUCTION Any word generated by the morphology of a language must be reviewed by the phonology to determine whether it is well-formed. When the output of the morphology is not phonologically well-formed, the phonology will most often kick in to repair the word, perhaps by changing a feature specification, or by inserting a segment, or perhaps by shifting the location of stress. But there is another option which the grammar might take. Instead of repairing the offending output, the grammar may simply leave the word unformed, declaring instead that a particular <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>morphemes</b> is for phonological reasons unutterable. The attempt at word-formation fails [1] For helpful feedback on various aspects of this work, I’m grateful to audiences at th...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{semantic}} and conceptual {{potential of the}} literary portmanteau word, with a view, more specifically, to examining {{the ways in which}} the term works to highlight questions of critical, ethical and disruptive activity. Formed from the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>morphemes</b> from two or more existing words (i. e., “human” + “document” = “humument”), the portmanteau word is a neologism that exists both within and beyond the frame of the authorised lexicon. Exploring this dynamic by way of three main areas of focus—“creating”, “mediating” and “activating”— this thesis adopts a thoroughgoing approach to portmanteau word functioning and logic, considering the term not only in relation to frame-stretching difference, semantic uncertainty and (potentially) mediative/ethical critical practice (as existing scholarship has tended mainly to do), but also with regard to the effortful and precarious activating of these concerns across different literary and geographical contexts. Up to now, academic work on the literary portmanteau word has generally considered the term in relation to two, largely non-overlapping sites of interest: Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass (1871) and James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake (1939) —a pair of texts that remain central here in developing a working theorization of the portmanteau (“creating”), and in the explication of a Wakean critical ethics (“mediating”). Through exploring different responses to both Carrollian and Joycean portmanteau words, the first of these focuses approaches the term in relation to the semantic and critical effects of frame-stretching difference, contingency and structural uncertainty. In the second, the possible mediative ethics of this uncertainty is considered with reference to the ethics of deconstruction and to an analysis of selected passages from the Wake. The extension in this thesis, though, into the writing of Édouard Glissant, Kamau Brathwaite and Ivan Vladislavić works to further interrogate and complicate this Carrollian-Joycean understanding of the portmanteau word, making it less (but still) a matter of structural uncertainty and mediative ethics, and more a question of effort, risk and resistance. With Glissant and Brathwaite, this “activating” of portmanteau uncertainty in the (post) colonial Caribbean translates in different ways into a form of hard-fought, aesthetic opacity, the effortful creation (and interpretation) of which requires an always precarious, (re) cyclical mediation between structure and difference, self and other. With Vladislavić, in (post) apartheid South Africa, this “activating” of the portmanteau expresses itself as a complicatedly material concern with the necessary folly (and urgency) of ethical (re) construction following the collapse of apartheid socio-political structures. It is the contention of this thesis, then, that it is through such contextual, mess-making, “activating” elaborations as these that we arrive at a richer, more resistant understanding of the portmanteau word (in both linguistic and conceptual terms), and that, in a manner not at all unlike the creation of a portmanteau word itself, we help to enact a frame-stretching move into new and uncertain exploratory frames. published_or_final_versionEnglishDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a dysgraphic aphasic individual-S. G. W. -who, in writing to dictation, produced high rates of formally related errors consisting of both lexical substitutions and what we call morphological-compound errors involving legal or illegal <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>morphemes.</b> These errors were produced {{in the context of a}} minimal number of semantic errors. We could exclude problems with phonological discrimination and phonological short-term memory. We also excluded rapid decay of lexical information and/or weak activation of word forms and letter representations since S. G. W. 's spelling showed no effect of delay and no consistent length effects, but, instead, paradoxical complexity effects with segmental, lexical, and morphological errors that were more complex than the target. The case of S. G. W. strongly resembles that of another dysgraphic individual reported in the literature-D. W. -suggesting that this pattern of errors can be replicated across patients. In particular, both patients show unusual errors resulting in the production of neologistic compounds (e. g., "bed button" in response to "bed"). These patterns can be explained if we accept two claims: (a) Brain damage can produce both a reduction and an increase in lexical activation; and (b) there are direct connections between phonological and orthographic lexical representations (a third spelling route). We suggest that both patients are suffering from a difficulty of lexical selection resulting from excessive activation of formally related lexical representations. This hypothesis is strongly supported by S. G. W. 's worse performance in spelling to dictation than in written naming, which shows that a phonological input, activating a cohort of formally related lexical representations, increases selection difficulties. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

5000|$|None {{of these}} systems is purely logographic. This can be {{illustrated}} with Chinese. Not all Chinese characters represent morphemes: some <b>morphemes</b> are composed <b>of</b> more than one character.

5000|$|<b>Morphemes</b> {{were one}} <b>of</b> the constructors {{explored}} by Facundes (2000). Morphemes are grammatical fragments put together to generate one final product, often a word. It is the minimal unit of word-building {{in a language}} and thus cannot be broken down any further (Facundes 19, 2000). For example, the word ‘unbreakable’, composed of three morphemes: un, break and able. ‘Un’ is a prefix preceding the base morpheme, break. Finally, ‘able’ is a suffix, a morpheme following the base <b>morpheme.</b> Although the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>morphemes</b> yields a word with a meaning, individual morphemes do not always have a recognizable meaning.

Within morphemes and word-structure, Facundes (122, 2000) mentions that although the meaning of word is not always transparent, they exist in two separate classes in Apurina language. The first, phonological word. These are the words that allow pauses to occur at the two boundaries of another word.|$|R

40|$|Arabic inflectional {{morphology}} requires infixation, prefixation and suffixation, {{giving rise}} to a large space of morphological variation. In this paper we describe an approach to reducing the complexity of Arabic morphology generation using discrimination trees and transformational rules.

We focus on hollow verbs but discuss the wider applicability of the approach. Introduction Morphologically, Arabic is a non-concatenative language. The basic problem with generating Arabic verbal morphology is the large number of variants that must be generated. Verbal stems are based on triliteral or quadriliteral roots (3 - or 4 -radicals).
