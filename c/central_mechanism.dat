5|$|The {{carousel}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} oldest surviving Dentzel menagerie carousels. Thirty-one of its 42wood-carved animals are horses, 17 standing and 14 jumping. There are also three goats, three giraffes, three deer, one lion, and one tiger. The single lion and tiger are typical of Dentzel-created carousels, as are the three giraffes; Gustav Dentzel's love of that animal resulted in all of his carousels including at least one row of giraffes. The animals are arranged in three circles around the <b>central</b> <b>mechanism,</b> alternating leaping or jumping horses with stationary animals. Typical for a Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, there are 18jumping animals, all but one of which is original; the horse that could not be found in 1975 was replaced with another Dentzel horse. Although the animals were not originally carved to display jewels, at some point they were so displayed at the amusement park, and thus the museum restored the animals on the outside circle with jewels.|$|E

40|$|<b>Central</b> pain <b>mechanisms</b> {{are deeply}} {{embodied}} in the psychophysical problem of pain. They {{are located in the}} brain and spinal cord and are becoming increasingly recognised as playing {{a major role in the}} generation and maintenance of pain and disability associated with neuromusculoskeletal problems. <b>Central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> participate in all pain states, acute and chronic. They are universally influenced by psychological and physical factors, whether or not a specific pathology can be identified. Misconceptions are that manual therapy operates on peripheral mechanisms without influencing the central ones and that when a central problem exists, psychological management is preferable. In reality, as key players in the healing process, <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are profoundly affected by manual therapy even when it is directed at a peripheral problem. Treatment of peripheral mechanisms can be performed through central techniques because both peripheral and <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are always part of the same clinical problem. Consequently, manual therapy must change its mindset from a peripheralist standpoint and integrate <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> into clinical practice as a means of improving therapeutic efficacy and to prevent the descent of acute pain into chronic...|$|R

Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{caste system}} {{as it exists}} today {{is thought to be}} the result of {{developments}} during the collapse of the Mughal era and the British colonial regime in India. The collapse of the Mughal era saw the rise of powerful men who associated themselves with kings, priests and ascetics, affirming the regal and martial form of the caste ideal, and it also reshaped many apparently casteless social groups into differentiated caste communities. The British Raj furthered this development, making rigid caste organisation a <b>central</b> <b>mechanism</b> of administration. Between 1860 and 1920, the British segregated Indians by caste, granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to the upper castes. Social unrest during the 1920s led to a change in this policy. From then on, the colonial administration began a policy of positive discrimination by reserving a certain percentage of government jobs for the lower castes.|$|E

60|$|That {{outer world}} of {{universal}} anarchy that lay beyond Christendom heaved another of its colossal and almost cosmic waves and swept everything away. Through all the eastern gates, left open, as it were, {{by the first}} barbarian auxiliaries, burst a plague of seafaring savages from Denmark and Scandinavia; and the recently baptized barbarians were again flooded by the unbaptized. All this time, it must be remembered, the actual <b>central</b> <b>mechanism</b> of Roman government had been running down like a clock. It was really a race between the driving energy of the missionaries {{on the edges of}} the Empire and the galloping paralysis of the city at the centre. In the ninth century the heart had stopped before the hands could bring help to it. All the monastic civilization which had grown up in Britain under a vague Roman protection perished unprotected. The toy kingdoms of the quarrelling Saxons were smashed like sticks; Guthrum, the pirate chief, slew St. Edmund, assumed the crown of East England, took tribute from the panic of Mercia, and towered in menace over Wessex, the last of the Christian lands. The story that follows, page after page, is only the story of its despair and its destruction. The story is a string of Christian defeats alternated with victories so vain as to be more desolate than defeats. It is only in one of these, the fine but fruitless victory at Ashdown, that we first see in the dim struggle, in a desperate and secondary part, the figure who has given his title to the ultimate turning of the tide. For the victor was not then the king, but only the king's younger brother. There is, from the first, something humble and even accidental about Alfred. He was a great understudy. The interest of his early life lies in this: that he combined an almost commonplace coolness, and readiness for the ceaseless small bargains and shifting combinations of all that period, with the flaming patience of saints in times of persecution. While he would dare anything for the faith, he would bargain in anything except the faith. He was a conqueror, with no ambition; an author only too glad to be a translator; a simple, concentrated, wary man, watching the fortunes of one thing, which he piloted both boldly and cautiously, and which he saved at last.|$|E

40|$|Background: Acupuncture is an {{component}} of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) {{that has been}} used for three thousand years to treat diseases and relieve pain. Pain is found to be the most common reason for people to use acupuncture. Due to recent scientific findings, acupuncture treatment has been accepted worldwide. Numerous trials have been conducted especially in analgesia. The mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia has been widely investigated, however, the underlying mechanism still not clear. This article summarizes the <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of acupuncture analgesia and reviews recent studies on the topic. Method: We have focused on examining the recent literature on acupuncture analgesia. The <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of acupuncture analgesia and reviews recent studies on the topic. We focused on the studies related to <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of acupuncture analgesia from these aspects: (neurophysiology, neurochemistry and neuroanatomy). Result: The result revealed that acupuncture act on various parts of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, brain stem, cerebral ganglia and cerebral cortex to alleviate pain. The <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> underlying the effects of acupuncture include neurohumors and neurotransmitters, which are involved in analgesia. At spinal level, Spinal opioids, glutamate, norepinephrine and serotonin are the key elements acupuncture-induced analgesia. At brain level, Endogenous opioid peptides, limbic system play essential roles in mediating the analgesia. Conclusion: Acupuncture is an effective approach to pain management. There is good evidence in both experimental and clinical research that supports acupuncture efficacy in management of chronic pain through central nervous system. Acupuncture should be strongly used as a part of pain management plans. This work helps in improving our understanding of the scientific basis underlying acupuncture analgesia...|$|R

The chemo-receptors involved in olfactory nervous cascade involve using G-protein receptors to send their chemical signals down said cascade. The <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include the convergence of olfactory nerve axons into glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, where the signal is then transmitted to the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex, the medial amygdala, and the entorhinal cortex, all of which make up the primary olfactory cortex.|$|R

40|$|Using the {{psychological}} refractory period (PRP) paradigm, we examined whether visual stimulus encoding {{is subject to}} <b>central</b> capacity-limited <b>mechanisms.</b> There is consistent empirical evidence suggesting that the stage of response selection requires <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (e. g.

The first task was a speeded 2 AD task consisting of pure tones. The second task was a same-different matching task consisting of patterns of different stimulus complexity and intensity. Both tasks were performed temporally overlapping at varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). Main effects for SOA, intensity and complexity, but no interaction between these factors were found. From the intensity effect it is concluded that visual stimulus encoding does require <b>central</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Furthermore, mechanisms sensible to stimulus complexity are interpreted as to use limited capacity as well.
