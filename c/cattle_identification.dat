40|$|This paper {{describes}} first {{results in}} the development of a machine vision system that estimates the liveweight of cattle based on objective body measurements (i. e. body length and area). The apparatus has potential use in pasture and feedlot situations with application to automated drafting. A trial conducted at Bengalla Station (42 km east of Goondiwindi, Queensland) consisted of video collection for thirty pasture-fed Bos indicus steers for one day in August 2009. Video apparatus was installed in a laneway enclosed in a shed through which the animals walked enroute to a watering point. Video recording was motion-triggered and indexed by <b>cattle</b> <b>identifications</b> from an electronic ear tag reader at the entry of the laneway. The animals were stationary-weighed the day before the video collection occurred. The video apparatus comprised a single camera view of the laneway. The laneway was backlit with nearinfrared (NIR) floodlights such that a silhouetted side view of the animal was acquired as the animal walked through the laneway. A camera fitted with a NIR optical filter logged video to a personal computer. NIR wavelengths were used so the floodlights could be powered on and off automatically without disturbing the animals. Image processing algorithms were written to automatically extract body length and area from the images. Firstly, dark pixels in the image were assigned as animal pixels and light pixels were assigned as the background. Body length was estimated as the distance between the approximate tailhead and shoulder positions in imagery. Body area was estimated using the body height and length. Body length and area measured by the developed method was linearly related to body weight with coefficients of correlation of 0. 52 and 0. 53, respectively. The results agree with the finding of Wanderstock and Salisbury (1946) that body length is correlated with liveweight. Further work includes improving the weight estimation by incorporating other body measurements and camera views, extending the system to estimate condition score and trialing different breeds...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Rare {{diseases}} in livestock animals are traditionally poorly diagnosed. Other than clinical description and pathological examination, {{the underlying causes}} have, for the most part, remained unknown. A single case of congenital skin fragility in cattle was observed, necropsy, histological and ultrastructural examinations were carried out and whole genome sequencing was utilized to identify the causative mutation. RESULTS A single purebred female Charolais calf with severe skin lesions was delivered full-term and died spontaneously after birth. The clinical and pathological findings exactly matched the gross description given by previous reports on epitheliogenesis imperfecta and epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in cattle. Histological and ultrastructural changes were consistent with EB junctionalis (EBJ). Genetic analysis revealed a previously unpublished ITGB 4 loss-of-function mutation; the affected calf was homozygous for a 4. 4  kb deletion involving exons 17 to 22, and the dam carried a single copy of the deletion indicating recessive inheritance. The homozygous mutant genotype did not occur in healthy controls of various breeds but some heterozygous carriers were found among Charolais cattle belonging to the affected herd. The mutant allele was absent in {{a representative sample of}} unrelated sires of the German Charolais population.

Hence in this study, isolation and evaluation of Mycobacterial genomic patterns obtained from rodents of infected farms by RFLP method was conducted. Material and Method: Fifteen mice submitted from infected cattle farms with BTB that were collected in four provinces of IRAN were used in this study. Culture of Mycobacterium and RFLP–PGRS and RFLP–DR analysis of bovine isolates from the same areas were performed in the usual manner. Following the detection of different patterns between mice and <b>cattle</b> isolates, <b>identification</b> by PCR of IS 6110 and RV 0577, RD typing and sequencing of 16 SrRNA and rpoB was conducted. Result: Three isolates were obtained out of the 15 mice samples cultured from 2 out of the 4 separate provinces. RFLP analysis with PGRS and DR probes identified 2 different patterns from 5 cattle isolates and 1 single pattern from 2 mice isolates located at Ahwaz province, and 2 different patterns from 9 bovine isolates and 1 pattern from 1 mouse isolates located at West Azerbaijan were identified. Two mice isolates from Ahwaz province were negative at the above PCRs and sequencing of 16 SrRNA and rpoB revealed that these isolates are Mycobacterium kansasii. Another mouse identified as belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex by PCRs and RD typing revealed that this isolate must be Mycobacterium microti. Discussion: This study was unable to track tangible evidence of tuberculosis transmission by mice. Hence to prove this hypothesis, further studies are advised.

40|$|Bovine {{respiratory}} disease (BRD) {{continues to be}} the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in feedyard <b>cattle.</b> Accurate <b>identification</b> of those animals that will not finish the production cycle normally following initial treatment for BRD would provide feedyard managers with opportunities to more effectively manage those animals. Our objectives were to assess the ability of different classification algorithms to accurately predict an individual calf’s outcome based on data available at first identification of and treatment for BRD and also to identify characteristics of calves where predictive models performed well as gauged by accuracy. Data from 23 feedyards in multiple geographic locations within the U. S. from 2000 to 2009 representing over one million animals were analyzed to identify animals clinically diagnosed with BRD and treated with an antimicrobial. These data were analyzed both as a single dataset and as multiple datasets based on individual feedyards and partitioned into training, testing, and validation datasets. Classifiers were trained and optimized to identify calves that did not finish the production cycle with their cohort. Following classifier training, accuracy was evaluated using validation data. Analysis was also done to identify sub-groups of calves within populations where classifiers performed better compared to other sub-groups. Accuracy of individual classifiers varied by dataset. The accuracy of the best performing classifier by dataset ranged from a low of 63 % in one dataset up to 95 % in a different dataset. Sub-groups of calves were identified within some datasets where accuracy of a classifiers were greater than 98 %; however these accuracies must be interpreted in relation to the prevalence of the class of interest within those populations. We found that by pairing the correct classifier with the data available, accurate predictions could be made that would provide feedlot managers with valuable information...|$|R
40|$|Access to {{genotyping}} assays {{enables the}} identification of informative markers that discriminate between <b>cattle</b> breeds. <b>Identification</b> of these markers can assist in breed assignment, improvement and conservation. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify breed informative markers to discriminate between three South African indigenous cattle breeds. Data from BovineSNP 50 and GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP- 80 K) assays were generated for Afrikaner, Drakensberger and Nguni, and were analysed for their genetic differentiation. Hereford and Angus were included as outgroups. Breeds were differentiated using principal component analysis (PCA). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the breeds were determined when minor allele frequency (MAF) was ≥ 0. 05. Breed-specific SNPs were identified using Reynolds Fst and extended Lewontin and Krakauer's (FLK) statistics. These SNPs were validated using three African breeds, namely N’Dama, Kuri and Zebu from Madagascar. PCA discriminated among the breeds. A larger number of polymorphic SNPs was detected in Drakensberger (73 %) than in Afrikaner (56 %) and Nguni (65 %). No substantial numbers of informative SNPs (Fst ≥ 0. 6) were identified among indigenous breeds. Eleven SNPs were validated as discriminating the indigenous breeds from other African breeds. This is because the SNPs on BovineSNP 50 and GGP- 80 K assays were ascertained as being common in European taurine breeds. Lower MAF and SNP informativeness observed in this study limits the application of these assays in breed assignment, and could have other implications for genome-wide studies in South African indigenous breeds. Sequencing should therefore be considered to discover new SNPs that are common among indigenous South African breeds and also SNPs that discriminate among these indigenous breeds.

40|$|Canchim is a {{composite}} cattle breed developed in Brazil for beef production. One of the breeding objectives is to increase fat deposition. QTLs for fat thickness and/or marbling have been reported on BTA 4 and BTA 14. The IGFBP 3 and DDEF 1 genes, mapped to BTA 4 and BTA 14, respectively, affect adipogenesis. We looked for SNPs in the IGFBP 3 and DDEF 1 genes that could be associated with backfat thickness in Canchim beef <b>cattle.</b> For SNP <b>identification,</b> sires with the highest accuracy were ranked according to expected breeding value for fat thickness; the 12 extremes (six sires with the highest and six with the lowest expected breeding value for the trait) were chosen. Six regions of the IGFBP 3 and 14 regions of the DDEF 1 were sequenced using the Sanger method. Nine SNPs were identified in IGFBP 3 and 76 in the DDEF 1. After an initial analysis, two SNPs were selected to be genotyped for the whole population;these were DDEF 1 g. 279401 A>G and IGFBP 3 c. 4394 T>C(Trp>Arg). We found a significant effect (P ? 0. 05) of allele substitution on backfat thickness; however, the IGFBP 3 SNP did not significantly affect this trait. 201...|$|R
