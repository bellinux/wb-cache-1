25|$|Early {{study of}} the Northern Thai Chronicles by Western {{scholars}} was focused on searching for factual and historical details within the texts to <b>compare</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> {{with those of other}} documents and inscriptions. Little attention was given to the cultural implications such as religious, mythological or legendary significance. For example, George Cœdès criticized the Camadevivamsa for its lack of verifiable historical facts. However, modern scholarship recognizes the text as a 15th-century religio-cultural work written primarily as a foundation myth for the ancient Mon Hariphunchai to establish its connection and cultural continuity with the Thai city of Lamphun in the Lanna kingdom, as well as to substantiate the legendary visit of the Buddha to the region and legitimize both the Buddha relic and the temple in which it is housed.|$|E

What made the research particularly useful and interesting is that Collins <b>and</b> Porras <b>compared</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrasted</b> these visionary companies with a control set of rivals. For instance, Boeing was <b>compared</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrasted</b> with Douglas Aircraft, Marriott was <b>compared</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrasted</b> with Howard Johnson's, <b>and</b> Merck was <b>compared</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrasted</b> with Pfizer. The findings are {{based on what the}} visionary companies do that is different than close competitors who have achieved a high level of success, but not to the extent of the visionary companies. From 1926 through 1990 the comparison companies outperformed the general stock market by 2 times whereas the visionary companies outperformed the market by 15 times.|$|R

25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} the loose seal is that the pipette that is used can be repeatedly removed from the membrane after recording, and the membrane will remain intact. This allows repeated measurements {{in a variety of}} locations on the same cell without destroying the integrity of the membrane. This flexibility has been especially useful to researchers for studying muscle cells as they contract under real physiological conditions, obtaining recordings quickly, and doing so without resorting to drastic measures to stop the muscle fibers from contracting. A major disadvantage is that the resistance between the pipette and the membrane is greatly reduced, allowing current to leak through the seal, and significantly reducing the resolution of small currents. This leakage can be partially corrected for, however, which offers the opportunity to <b>compare</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> recordings made from different areas on the cell of interest. Given this, {{it has been estimated that}} the loose patch technique can resolve currents smaller than 1 mA/cm2.|$|E
500|$|Elements of Homerun <b>compare</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> Singapore's {{situations}} in 1965 and in 2003. For example, while Mrs Chew is giving birth, Lee Kuan Yew's voice {{can be heard}} on a radio in the background, announcing Singapore's separation from Malaysia. Other events in the film parallel those in Singapore's history, such as the riot at the rubbish dump alluding to the labour strikes and riots of the 1960s, {{as well as the}} threat of terrorism in the new millennium. One of Kiat Kun's friends is nicknamed [...] "Little Red Dot", a phrase used by former Indonesian president Jusuf Habibie to disparage Singapore. The final scene in the film shows the Chew siblings standing before a long muddy path, which symbolises the uncertainly faced by both the newly independent nation in 1965 and the country in transition in 2003.|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into four sections: one for each {{biography}} and one to provide background context for the conflicts in Rwanda and Bosnia. There are also sections entitled Introduction, Conclusion, Acknowledgments, Source Notes, and Index. The three biographies of the Canadians focus on their involvement in international conflicts through the United Nations, but also includes aspects of their backgrounds and follow events after they leave the UN. In the profiles Off avoids describing places and events but provides a chapter to [...] "a Grapes of Wrath-style description of her two locales". The biographies <b>compare</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> the strategy and effect of each person's approach to their mission. One reviewer compared the profiles of Dallaire and MacKenzie to Suetonius's biographies of Athenian generals Nicias and Alcibiades. Suetonius portrayed Nicias as honourable, moderate, and effective but over-shadowed by the more vocal and polarizing Alcibiades. Likewise, Off portrayed Dallaire as the more honourable commander but over-shadowed by the more media savvy and callous MacKenzie. Off's focus on moral choices was called [...] "a feminist approach" [...] by {{several members of the}} Department of National Defence.|$|E
500|$|Infamous was {{released}} {{a few weeks}} before Radical Entertainment's Prototype, a game with many similar concepts including a character finding himself with super powers, a large open-world environment that can be traveled by climbing up buildings and gliding about the city, and several other comparisons. This led many game critics to <b>compare</b> <b>and</b> <b>contrast</b> the games. In his sarcastic Zero Punctuation review of Prototype, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw (who had initially praised Infamous as [...] "huge, creative and fun,") compared the two games point for point, and determined that he could not tell which was the better game, and challenged the respective studios to [...] "produce the best image of the rival game's main character wearing a women's bra" [...] as a tiebreaker. To his surprise, both development teams rose to the challenge, producing said images, and forcing Croshaw to call it a near-tie, edging out in favor of Infamous, though still noted that, like their games, both images created independently were nearly equal in the assets that they included. This rivalry highlighted {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} exclusivity over a multiplatform release. Gaming analysts Jesse Divnich had this to say [...] "Due to near identical game play and quality scores, the Infamous vs. Prototype case study presents interesting data to publishers when considering the sales bump a title could receive by choosing exclusivity over a multiplatform release." ...|$|E
