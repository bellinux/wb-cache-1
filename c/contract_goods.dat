This contribution considers whether a manufacturer of luxury goods, who operates a selective distribution system, may lawfully ban its appointed dealers from selling the <b>contract</b> <b>goods</b> via third-part online platforms under the EU competition rules. On {{the basis of an}} analysis of the relevant legal provisions and the existing case law, it is suggested that, while the aim of protecting a luxury image should in principle be considered a legitimate objective under Article 101 TFEU, a blanket ban that {{does not take into account}} the characteristics of the third-party platform should be deemed disproportionate. However, a ban on the use of third-party platforms should not be seen as a hardcore restriction within the meaning of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) no 330 / 2010, as long as the distributor has other viable options of selling the goods via the Internet.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse {{the scope of}} {{application}} of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("CISG"). The reason for my research is the wide use of the CISG in international trade. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} know exactly when the CISG is applicable. The thesis is composed of four chapters, each of them dealing with a different aspect of international sales contracts. Chapter One is introductory and defines the basic concept of regular and international sales contract in Czech law and legal literature, taking into account the upcoming recodification of the Czech Civil Code. Chapter Two examines the basic approaches of legal regulation in private international law. After a brief theoretical introduction, special attention is paid to various Czech and international legal instruments governing contracts for the international sale of goods. In Chapter Three, I explore the basic requirements for application of the CISG. Using scholarly literature as well as case law, I characterise the concepts of sales <b>contract,</b> <b>goods,</b> place of business, contracting states and party autonomy. Consideration is also given to the material scope of application of the CISG. The existence of controversial issues related to this question is shown on the topic of interest for any sum [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The Proposal for a Common European Sales Law (CESL) and the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (SGA) {{have adopted}} {{different}} approaches toward {{the calculation of}} damages. Under the SGA, the ‘market price’ rule is preferred over the rule governing ‘making a substitute transaction’. Where there is a market price for the <b>contract</b> <b>goods,</b> a higher or lower price at which the buyer has made a cover purchase for the similar goods is generally irrelevant to the assessment of damages. Conversely, under the CESL, the ‘market price’ rule for calculation of damages is subsidiary, even if the ‘market price’ rule {{would have been more}} advantageous for the buyer. This paper will compare these different mechanisms for calculating damages within the context of international sales of manufactured goods. This comparison is based on a novel normative framework. This normative framework consists of four criteria: 1) legal certainty, an essential requirement of international sales transactions; 2) performance interest, reflecting the specific needs of a buyer entering a commercial transaction; 3) efficiency, concerning whether the remedy can minimize transaction costs facing the disputants; and 4) satisfying the norms of relational theory, as international sales of manufactured goods requires a continuing relationship between the parties in different stages of contract. This comparison aims to identify which legal regime has adopted the more appropriate approach in accordance with the normative framework. Finally, proposals for improving the rules of monetary damages under the CESL, which seems to have some defects, are suggested...|$|E
40|$|If the {{contract}} is avoided {{and there is a}} current price for the goods, the party claiming damages may recover the difference between the price fixed by {{the contract}} and the current price at specific time and at specific place. Abstract calculation of loss is possible only when the <b>contract</b> <b>goods</b> have current price. Current price is the price generally charged for such goods sold under comparable circumstances in the trade concerned. According to the CISG and Serbian Law of Obligations, for the determination of the current price is relevant time of avoidance. This general rule is not applicable in international sales law when the party claiming damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods. In that case, the current price at the time of taking over shall be applicable instead of the current price at the time of avoidance. Current price rule contained in the Art. 76 (2) of the CISG presupposes that the current price is the price prevailing at the place where the delivery of the goods should have been made, or if there is no current price at the place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods. Pursuant to Art. 524 (2) Of Serbian Law of Obligations, however, relevant is the price in the market of the place of effecting the transaction. Formulation place of effecting the transaction is unclear and vague and can create different problems. Therefore, this rule should be amended and the relevant place should be the place of delivery...|$|E

Furthermore, buyers place a premium on obtaining the item exclusively, i. e., if no competitors obtain the item at the same time. We show that the seller limited to offering posted price contracts should inflate the price in order to maximize revenues and capture the value buyers put on exclusivity. However, posted prices are not revenue-maximizing and there are theoretical barriers to discovering generic {{optimal allocation}} and pricing schemes, stemming both from mechanism design theory and computational complexity theory. We present an easy-to-implement hybrid auction-pricing procedure which revenue-dominates posted prices and is optimal in a perfect competition setting...|$|R
