These professionals should also be trained {{so that they}} are aware of the current position as regards the economy and limited energy resources, and they must be creative, knowledgeable and committed if they are to rethink the current model. The Departments of Architectural Technology II and Applied Physics, in collaboration with the Interdisciplinary <b>Centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>Technology,</b> Innovation and Education for Sustainability (CITIES), believed that students could {{be given the opportunity to}} specialise in the area of sustainable development by means of their final theses [2]. With this objective in mind, a line of theses called Energy Assessments was created as part of the Plan for Resource Consumption Efficiency (PECR). The line was based on a learning strategy that focused on the student. The teaching staff was able to observe that, in terms of cognitive aspects, the students improved their knowledge of environmental issues and the associated skills, and that they were more able to solve problems in the area of sustainability and had greater concerns about this subject matter after having completed their theses...|$|E

Following {{to the previous}} Conferences held in 2006 and 2009, the Third International Conference on Contaminated Sites Remediation, Bosicon 2012, aims at presenting recent scientific and technical contributions in characterization, risk assessment, innovative process design and new technologies {{in the field of}} contaminated sites, as well as brownfield restoration. Recent events have shown the important role that environmental monitoring and remediation play in responding to man made and natural disasters. As a result of the need for authorities and the environmental community to better plan for future emergencies, the Conference scope has been expanded to address issues related to both planning for and conducting the environmental monitoring that is necessary to protect {{public health and the environment}} from releases of chemical, biological and radiological contaminants; and remediation technologies needed to address the releases. Bosicon 2012 will gather stakeholders from industry, as well as researchers and engineers from universities and institutions, to present recent advances and new ideas in remediation tools, design, technologies and management. The conference will be scheduled in three headlines: Characterization, monitoring and risk assessment System design and management Treatment and remediation Each above mentioned topic will be exploited with respect to polluted groundwater and soil, and marine and freshwater sediments.

40|$|AbstractTri-dharma {{of higher}} {{education}} {{is the foundation of}} culture development within the university organization to improve the quality and relevance of education based on industrial needs. POLMAN Bandung as one of the applied higher education has a unique approach in developing and implementing manufacturing technologies through partnerships with industry for the purpose of increasing added value and benefits for both parties. The uniqueness of POLMAN Bandung is in process of learning, especially in the practice carried out in accordance to the character of applied technology that emphasizes on mastery of skills through production approach. That approach named Production Based Education (PBE) which has been designed to effectively transferring knowledge and technology to the students by solving industrial cases as a problem media, simultaneously. The student will gain experience through their involvement in manufacturing of industrial product development. With this concept, a lot of application technology can be used and improved by polytechnic and industry in developing industrial product which are needed by the market, thus it will be many national products that can be made locally to increase national economic growth and provide an opportunity to have an experience for the students in entrepreneurship based on technology (Technopreneur) directly in school. Polytechnic will gain capacity in handling more innovative and creative products finding through industrial solution competitively under time, cost and the quality measures, while the industry will get the support of R&D processes that {{do not have to be}} done or provided in the company but can utilize an existing technology capabilities in polytechnic as a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> (COT) ...|$|E
