50|$|<b>Chlorine-based</b> <b>bleaches</b> {{are found}} in many {{household}} cleaners. The concentration of <b>chlorine-based</b> <b>bleaches</b> is often expressed as percent active chlorine where one gram of a 100% active chlorine bleach has the same bleaching power as one gram of chlorine. These bleaches can react with other common household chemicals like vinegar or ammonia to produce toxic gases. Labels on sodium hypochlorite bleach warn about these interactions.|$|R

40|$|Aim : The {{aim of this}} ex vivo {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of in-office bleaching agents,- 35 % and 38 % hydrogen peroxide containing <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents,</b> on the phosphate concentration of the enamel evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. Materials and Methods : Forty noncarious, craze-free human maxillary incisors, extracted for periodontal reasons, were used in this study. Baseline Raman spectra from each specimen were obtained before {{the application of the}} <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> to assess the phosphate content present in the teeth. The teeth were divided into two groups: Group A - bleached with pola office bleach (35 % hydrogen peroxide, potassium nitrate) (light activated). Group B - bleached with opalescence Xtra bleach (38 % hydrogen peroxide potassium nitrate and fluoride) (chemical activated). After the bleaching procedure, the treated specimens were taken to obtain Raman spectra to assess the phosphate loss after bleaching treatment. Results : The results showed that the chemically activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> showed less phosphate loss when compared with the light activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent.</b> Conclusion : Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the chemically activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> showed minimal phosphate loss when compared to light activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent.</b> The chemically activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> was better than the light activated <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> when values were evaluated statistically...|$|R

50|$|After <b>chlorine-based</b> <b>bleaches,</b> the {{peroxide}} bleaches {{are most}} commonly encountered. Peroxides are compounds that contain an oxygen-oxygen single bond, O-O. This {{is a fairly}} weak bond so reactions of peroxides often involve breaking this bond, giving very reactive oxygen species. Most peroxide bleaches are adducts of hydrogen peroxide. They contain hydrogen peroxide, HOOH in combination with another material like sodium carbonate or urea. An exception is sodium perborate, which has a cyclic structure containing two O-O single bonds. All peroxide-based bleaches release hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water. Peroxide bleaches are often used with catalysts and activators, e.g., tetraacetylethylenediamine or sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> on composite restorations. Publications were searched in PubMed and Lilacs databases and the analyzed papers were published between 2002 and 2012. The <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> evaluated were the hydrogen peroxide and the carbamide peroxide in different concentrations and techniques. The main characteristics of the composite resins were microhardness, roughness and color. The literature review revealed {{that most of the}} changes in the surface hardness of the composite occur due to the action of peroxides on the resin matrix of the restorative material. It was also observed that <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> increase the surface roughness of composite resin restorations, and this effect was dependent on the concentration and composition of the <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> used, the chemical characteristics of the composite resin and the period of the treatment. Finally, the color of the restorative material can also be changed after its contact with peroxides. It can be concluded that <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> change the physical characteristics of composite resin restorations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{in vitro}} study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} two 10 % carbamide peroxide <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> - a commercial product (Opalescence PF; Ultradent Products, Inc.) and a <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> prepared in a compounding pharmacy - on the chemical degradation of a light-activated composite resin by determining its release of ions before and after exposure to the agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty composite resin (Filtek Z 250; 3 M/ESPE) samples were divided into three groups: group I (exposed to Opalescence PF commercial <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent),</b> group II (exposed to a compounded <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent)</b> and group III (control - Milli-Q water). After 14 days of exposure, with a protocol of 8 h of daily exposure to the <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> and 16 h of immersion in Milli-Q water, the analysis of ion release was carried out using a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The values were analyzed statistically by ANOVA, Tukey's test and the paired t-tests. The significance level was set at 5 %. RESULTS: After 14 days of the experiment, statistically {{significant difference was found}} between group II and groups I and III, with greater ion release from the composite resin in group II.

40|$|Introduction: Discolored teeth can {{be treated}} by various techniques, {{including}} direct composite resin veneers, indirect porcelain veneers, ceramic crowns and <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of at-home and in-office <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> on the surface microhardness of one microhybrid (Point 4) and two nanofilled (Filtek Supreme and Premise) composite resins. Materials and methods: Opalescence PF with 20 % carbamide peroxide and Opalescence Quick with 35 % carbamide peroxide were used as at-home and in-office <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents,</b> respectively. Fifty samples from each composite resin, including Point 4 microhybrid, Premise and Filtek Supreme nanofilled composites resins were prepared and exposed to <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents.</b> For each composite resin the samples were randomly divided into five groups of 10 and designated as: control, two-week at-home, four-week at-home, one-time in-office and two-times in-office bleaching groups with two-week intervals. After the appropriate bleaching procedures on samples of each group, microhardness measurements were carried out on each sample. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and post hoc Tukey HSD test (p value < 0. 05). Results: There were significant differences in mean surface microhardness values of each composite resin type. No significant differences were observed in mean microhardness values of Point 4 between four-week at-home and one-time office, Filtek Supreme between two-week at-home and four-week at-home, and Premise between one-time in-office and two-time in-office bleaching groups.
