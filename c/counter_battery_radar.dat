50|$|Each Marine {{artillery}} battalion has a 199-member battalion headquarters battery {{that contains}} the battalion headquarters, an operations platoon, a service platoon, a communications platoon, and the battery headquarters (T/O 1142G). A Marine artillery regiment has a 380-member regimental headquarters battery consisting of the regimental headquarters, an operations platoon, a communications platoon, the battery headquarters, an artillery electronic maintenance section, an engineer equipment platoon, a motor transport section, and a <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> <b>radar</b> platoon (T/O 1101H).|$|E
50|$|The {{next step}} forward was European when in 1986 France, Germany and UK agreed the 'List of Military Requirements' {{for a new}} counter-battery radar. The {{distinguishing}} feature was that instead of just locating individual guns, etc., the radar was able to locate many simultaneously and group them into batteries with a centre point, dimensions and attitude of the long axis of the battery. This radar eventually reached service as Euro-ART's <b>COunter</b> <b>Battery</b> <b>RAdar</b> (COBRA) AESA system. 29 COBRA systems were produced and delivered in a roll-out which was completed in Aug. 2007 (12 to Germany - out of which two were re-sold to Turkey, 10 to France and 7 to the UK). Three additional systems were ordered in Feb. 2009 by the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. Simultaneous {{with the development of}} COBRA, Norway and Sweden developed a smaller, more mobile counter-battery radar known as ARTHUR. It was taken into service in 1999 and is today used by 7 NATO countries and The Republic Of South Korea. New versions of ARTHUR have twice the accuracy of the original.|$|E

50|$|The system {{consists}} of three or more unmanned sensor positions, each with four microphones and local processing, these deduce the bearing to a gun, mortar, etc. These bearings are automatically communicated to a central processor that combines them to triangulate {{the source of the}} sound. It can compute location data on up to 8 rounds per second, and display the data to the system operator. HALO may be used in conjunction with COBRA and ArtHur <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> <b>radars,</b> which are not omnidirectional, to focus on the correct sector.|$|R

50|$|To {{defend against}} <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> fire {{there are two}} points of attack: either remove the enemy's ability to observe or make his {{observations}} irrelevant/obsolete.|$|R
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery with <b>Counter</b> <b>battery</b> fire. British Army researchers under Lieutenant William Lawrence Bragg developed sound ranging, a method of determining the location of hostile artillery from the sound of its guns firing. A <b>Counter</b> <b>Battery</b> Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> effort, collating reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers. By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more effective than the weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary towed guns {{can take}} a while to emplace and re-limber and are not armoured, so they are {{vulnerable}} to <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> fire and {{take a while to}} engage when at a new location.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> work in Vietnam {{was with}} {{artillery}} spotting done using radar or aircraft. Australia deployed a sound ranging detachment from 1967 to 1970 in Vietnam, which operated a cross-base to provide all-round observation.|$|R
25|$|On July 31, the Helena {{engaged in}} a gunnery duel, she was hit one time before {{delivering}} <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> fire which destroyed seven gun emplacements and an ammunition dump. There were no casualties caused by the shell striking the ship but near misses wounded two men.|$|R

Best score: 50-5V. Common smoothbore cannon include the 12pdr. Napoleon and the 6pdr. Smoothbore Field Gun.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} highly {{networked}} combat systems allows for data from multiple sources to be cross referenced very quickly. As a result, modern <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> fire is generally {{as a result}} of a wide array of different possible information sources working together to provide targets in close to real time.|$|R

Today part of the National Park Service, Fort Cronkhite is a former US Army post that served as part of the coastal artillery defenses of the San Francisco Bay Area during World War II.

50|$|An {{additional}} {{issue for}} the use of <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> fire is the finite artillery resources available for use in a given situation. Firing on enemy artillery is one use of those resources, but more traditional uses such as shelling the enemy as they advance are often much more attractive simply because while artillery is an effective weapon, it cannot directly capture territory or destroy forces en masse.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new arrivals}} get their first, sudden taste of war when a quiet spell beside a river is {{interrupted}} by an enemy mortar barrage. Frantz calls for <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> fire ending the attack. Several civilians are killed in the exchange {{and one of the}} replacements, Galvan, is decapitated by a shell fragment.

Raytheon and Kongsberg are offering this system as an upgrade to the existing Hawk system. This proposal is aimed particularly at Hawk operating countries that also have AIM-120 AMRAAM in their inventory. Norway is currently operating this type of system as NASAMS.|$|R
50|$|At 19:00, the Germans {{blanketed}} {{both sides}} of the crossing with a hail storm of mortar fire as a prelude to their final counter-attack. However, their attempt was thwarted and the counter-attack was beaten back. Due to the fire, the engineers had to halt bridge construction yet again. However, by midnight, Canadian <b>counter</b> <b>battery</b> fire finally suppressed the German shelling of the bridge site. The Argylls lost seven killed, 22 wounded and 12 POW during the day.|$|R

Israeli missile boats {{utilized}} their 76mm cannons and other armaments to strike targets along the Egyptian and Syrian coastlines, including wharves, oil tank farms, coastal <b>batteries,</b> <b>radar</b> stations, airstrips, and other targets of military value. The Israeli Navy even attacked some of Egypt's northernmost SAM batteries. The Israeli Navy's attacks were carried out with minimal support from the Israeli Air Force (only one Arab naval target was destroyed from the air during the entire war).|$|R

The radar is now developed by SAAB Electronic Defence Systems (after EMW was sold to SAAB in June 2006) and Saab Technologies Norway AS.|$|R
