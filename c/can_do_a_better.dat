25|$|Social philosopher Jürgen Habermas {{disagrees with}} Luhmann {{and argues that}} the law <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job as a 'system' institution' by {{representing}} more faithfully the interests of everyday people in the 'lifeworld'. Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of Pierre Bourdieu and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital {{and in so doing}} develop the reproductive professional habitus of the lawyer. In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of Adam Podgórecki and his associates (often influenced by Petrazycki's ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by Per Stjernquist, and in Norway by Vilhelm Aubert.|$|E

60|$|L. No; of bronze, or copper, or some {{of their}} foul patent metal--it is no matter what. I meant a model of our chief British eagle. Every feather was made separately; and every {{filament}} of every feather separately, and so joined on; and all the quills modelled of the right length and right section, and at last the whole cluster of them fastened together. You know, children, I don't think much of my own drawing; but take my proud word for once, that when I go to the Zoological Gardens, and {{happen to have a}} bit of chalk in my pocket, and the Gray Harpy will sit, without screwing his head round, for thirty seconds,--I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> thing of him in that time than the three years' work of this industrious firm. For, during the thirty seconds, the eagle is my object,--not myself; and during the three years, the firm's object, in every fibre of bronze it made, was itself, and not the eagle. That is the true meaning of the little Pthah's having no eyes--he can see only himself. The Egyptian beetle was not quite the full type of him; our northern ground beetle is a truer one. It is beautiful to see it at work, gathering its treasures (such as they are) into little round balls; and pushing them home with the strong wrong end of it,--head downmost all the way,--like a modern political economist with his ball of capital, declaring that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its virtues. But away with you, children, now, for I'm getting cross.|$|E
