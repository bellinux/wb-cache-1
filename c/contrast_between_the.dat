5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Duncan and Fogarty (1984) {{argued that}} the key {{difference}} lies in the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E

5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell {{and colleagues}} in their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and monotremes, but argued that Ambondro was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E

In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea.

When Vinea submitted his poem Doleanțe ("Grievances") {{to be published by}} Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the {{emergency}} medicine systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some practitioners {{to focus on}} developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international emergency medicine as a subspecialty began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals {{had taken place in}} the late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad. One was the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as emergency medicine.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is {{the first}} such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia {{ratified}} the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics, while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics. This led the media to highlight the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes. The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.|$|E
5|$|The poem is a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> lives of the people living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.|$|E

5|$|William Monahan's screenplay, {{based on}} the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, {{examines}} contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> gold and dust of the desert and Arab cities, and the blue and gray of bureaucracy and Washington. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 David {{returned}} to England, where food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained in force. Dismayed by the <b>contrast</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food {{to which she}} had become used in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, {{at the age of}} 36, she published A Book of Mediterranean Food. Her recipes called for ingredients such as aubergines, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973. Her reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on.|$|E

40|$|Diffuse-interface method Two-phase flows Hele–Shaw flows {{independent}} of the diffuse-interface width, regardless {{of the magnitude of}} the density and viscosity <b>contrasts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> phases. This two-phase approach is coupled with a phase-field equation for calculating the interface motion. The model is applied to a buoyancy-driven two-phase flow involving a Rayleigh–Taylor instability and validated through a comparison with available sharp-interface results. The flows and interface topology changes are investigated for large density and viscosity <b>contrasts</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> phases. The convergence of the results with respect to the interface width is examined in detail. It is shown that the two-phase model converges better than a standard diffuse-interface model that assumes the presence of a single velocity inside the diffuse interface. Remaining interface width dependencies {{can be attributed to the}} capillary stress term in the momentum equation. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. 1...|$|R
