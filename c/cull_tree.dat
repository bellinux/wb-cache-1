40|$|A {{new measure}} of the forest {{resource}} {{has been added to}} the fourth forest inventory of Maryland. The inventory, which was conducted in 1985 - 86, included estimates of aboveground tree biomass on timberland. There are approximately 265 million green tons of wood and bark in the aboveground portion of all trees, an average of 109 green tons per acre statewide. Approximately 63 percent or 167 million green tons is in growing stock, and nearly 37 percent or 98 million green tons is nongrowing-stock (growing-stock tops, saplings, <b>cull</b> <b>trees,</b> and salvable dead trees) material. FOREWORD The fourth inventory of Maryland was under the overall direction of John R. Peters, Project Leader of the Forest Inventory and Analysis Unit. Thomas W. Birch assisted in the development and administration of the operating plan. Charles T. Scott was responsible for the design of the inventory and sample selection. David J. Alerich supervised the interpretation of aerial photos and collection of data. He was assisted by Joseph G. Reddan. Members of the field staff were...|$|R
50|$|Decay {{is common}} {{only in a}} few old-growth stands. The {{distinctive}} conks can be large, {{as much as two}} feet long, hoof-shaped or columnar. They are soft, yellow-white when young, soon becoming white and chalky throughout. The decay is brown, cubically cracked, with thick white felts in large cracks. The taste of both conks and felts is bitter and distinct for this species. A single conk usually indicates complete <b>cull.</b> Infected <b>trees</b> can be habitat for snag-nesting species.|$|R
40|$|An area of dry {{eucalypt}} {{forest on}} dolerite in southeastern Tasmania was clearfelled in 1981. A {{portion of this}} area was subsequently slash-burnt and aerially sown in 1982, whilst {{the rest of the}} area was left unburnt and unsown. A monthly bird census was conducted during 1983 - 1984 in surrounding uncut, mature forest and also on the clearfelled area. Species were recorded together with the habitat in which they occurred and the particular plant species being utilised. A total of 46 avian species were recorded during the monthly censuses, with most species and individuals being observed in the spring months. The numbers of species and individuals recorded on the burnt and unburnt clearfelled areas were low in comparison with those observed in the uncut forest. In general, those species able to utilise open-ground habitats tended to be the least affected by dearfelling followed by slash-burning. However, the unburnt clearfelled area provided foraging sites for certain species, in preference to the nearby slash-burnt area. Many individuaH 'recordedin the clearfelled areas made use of trees left standing after logging.

40|$|Among {{the various}} forms of {{renewable}} energy, the utilization of surplus wood poses a possible alternative energy supplement for the state of Michigan. Surplus wood is available from unutilized industrial wood wastes, logging residues, underutilized species, and <b>cull</b> <b>trees.</b> It has been conservatively estimated that during the next 30 years, 450 million t of surplus wood fiber in the state will be available for energy usage, capable of supplying approximately 1300 MW of installed electric generating capacity or around 4000 million 1 /year of methanol. This paper examines the potential of producing liquid fuels and fuel wood for electric generation from surplus wood. The need to carefully remove surplus wood from forests has long been recognized by forest management experts. Proper removal of these materials will make the forests healthier, more productive and will simultaneously add to Michigan's energy supply. Until now, the lack of a market for this wood and the high cost of harvesting it, has resulted in over-exploitation of high quality trees, followed by a lack of forest management to regenerate high productivity stands. The growing and future opportunities of wood for energy can open markets which will allow for the intensive forest management practices that have been relatively ignored in the past. This paper discusses the expanding wood market and how it will directly and indirectly influence other economic markets. The paper concludes that the use of wood by-products from all wood related industries, and the utilization of more trees with improved forest management, can not only supplement the present energy sources, but can actually improve the state's forest productivity, thereby contributing to the overall economic viability of the concept...|$|R

50|$|Woodboring beetles {{most often}} attack dying or dead trees. In forest settings, they are {{important}} in the turnover of <b>trees</b> by <b>culling</b> weak <b>trees,</b> thus allowing new growth to occur. They are also important as primary decomposers of trees within forest systems, allowing for the recycling of nutrients locked away in the relatively decay-resilient woody material of trees. To develop and reach maturity woodboring beetles need nutrients provided by fungi from outside of the inhabited wood. These nutrients are not only assimilated into the beetles' bodies but also are concentrated in their frass, contributing to soil nutrients cycles. Though {{the vast majority of}} woodboring beetles are ecologically important and economically benign, some species can become economic pests by attacking relatively healthy trees (e.g. Asian longhorn beetle, emerald ash borer) or by infesting downed trees in lumber yards. Species such as the Asian longhorn beetle and the emerald ash borer are examples of invasive species that threaten natural forest ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|Cacao swollen shoot virus (CSSV) {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of cacao (Theobroma cacao) in Africa, and long-standing {{efforts to}} limit its spread by <b>culling</b> infected <b>trees</b> have had very limited success. CSSV {{has proved to be}} a particularly difficult virus to study, since it has a very narrow host range, limited to several tropical tree species. Furthermore, the virus is not mechanically transmissible, and its insect vector can only be used with difficulty. Thus, the only efficient means to infect cacao plants that has been experimentally described so far are by particle bombardment or agroinoculation of cacao plants with an infectious clone. We have genetically transformed three non-host species with an infectious form of the CSSV genome: two experimental hosts widely used in plant virology (Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana) and the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. In transformed plants of all three species, the CSSV genome was able to replicate, and in tobacco, CSSV particles could be observed by immunosorbent electron microscopy, demonstrating that the complete virus cycle could be completed in a non-host plant. These results will greatly facilitate preliminary testing of CSSV control strategies using plants that are easy to raise and to transform genetically...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Since few {{forest tree}} gene {{conservation}} activities {{have been carried}} out in the Azores islands with its unique flora, it is urgent to develop a strategy for the management of the Azorean forest tree genetic resources. Safeguarding the potential for adaptation was identified as the prime objective for gene conservation of tree species in the Azores. Three species were identified of potential interest for tree genetic improvement. Prunus lusitanica spp azorica was selected due to its rarity and is close to extinction. Piconia azorica and Juniperus brevifolia spp azorica were selected based on their high wood quality and the interest in these trees by the Azorean Forest Service. Combined gene conservation and breeding was suggested for these species. The breeding of all of these species will follow the Multiple Population Breeding System concept. Open-pollinated seed will be collected for establishment of seedling seed orchards for each ecogeographic zone (cf Figure 4). <b>Culling</b> of <b>trees</b> with undesired characteristics will be carried out before seed collection. Seeds will be used for establishment of new progeny plantations. For Prunus lusitanica spp azorica only 1 - 2 seedling seed orchards are suggested. For the two other species several seedling seed orchards are suggested. For tree species not included in the breeding programme, in situ subpopulations are recommended...|$|R

In present study, selection practiced in first-generation progeny trial of jabon merah (Anthocephalus macrophyllus Roxb. Havil.) was observed. The study was aimed to find out a criteria selection accompanied with the effective coefficient weight for predicting genetic gain in the first-generation progeny trial of jabon merah. The trial was established in Wonogiri which was laid out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) using 55 families, 4 replications, 4 tree-plot with a spacing of 4 x 2 meter. Measurement was conducted at 40 months after planting covering tree height, diameter at breast height, stem straightness, stem volume. First within-plot selection by <b>culling</b> 2 poorer <b>trees</b> within each plot was practiced at 46 months age. Selection differential from within-plot selection was used to derive coefficient weight which was then applied to predict genetic gain.
