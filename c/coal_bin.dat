25|$|Coal {{provided}} {{the bulk of}} the US energy needs well into the 20th century. Most urban homes had a <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> and a coal fired furnace. Over the years these were replaced with oil furnaces, not because of it being cheaper but because it was easier and safer. Coal remains far cheaper than oil. The biggest use of oil has come from the development of the automobile.|$|E

[...] Around April 3, 1942, Dick visited his father at the [...] "Quartermaster Corps" [...] {{before going to the}} front lines of the Battle of Bataan. [...] This was the last time they would meet. [...] After the surrender to the Japanese, Dick marched from Mariveles, Bataan to [...] "Kilometer 69", and then was sent by cattle train to Camp O'Donnell in Tarlac. [...] Because he was relatively healthy he was moved to [...] "Camp #1" [...] in Cabanatuan, and from there was on assignment, constructing the airport in Las Piñas from 1943 to 1944. [...] He was near Corregidor when the Americans/Allies conducted the airstrike. [...] Two days later, Dick was put in the <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> of a hell ship and spent 38 days there before landing in Formosa. [...] From Formosa they sailed the China Sea to Muji, Japan. [...] From Muji he was sent by train to Tokyo and then to Odati for the winter 1944–1945 where he worked in an open pit lead mine until the war ended. [...] He weighed about 87lbs. at the end.|$|E

2500|$|While {{working in}} the Chemical Bank {{building}} on Dearborn Street, Holmes met and became close friends with Benjamin Pitezel, a carpenter with a criminal past who was exhibiting, in the same building, a <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> which he had invented. Holmes used Pitezel as his right-hand man for several criminal schemes; a district attorney later described Pitezel as [...] "Holmes' tool ... his creature". In early 1893, a one-time actress named Minnie Williams moved to Chicago; Holmes claimed to have met her in an employment office, though there were rumors that he had met her in Boston years earlier. He offered her {{a job at the}} hotel as his personal stenographer, and she accepted. Holmes was able to persuade Williams to transfer the deed to her property in Fort Worth, Texas, to a man named Alexander Bond (an alias of Holmes). In April 1893, Williams transferred the deed, with Holmes serving as the notary (Holmes later signed the deed over to Pitezel, giving him the alias [...] "Benton T. Lyman"). The next month, Holmes and Williams, presenting themselves as man and wife, rented an apartment in Chicago's Lincoln Park. Minnie's sister, Nannie, came to visit, and in July, she wrote to her aunt that she planned to accompany [...] "Brother Harry" [...] to Europe. Neither Minnie nor Nannie was seen alive after July 5, 1893.|$|E

5000|$|Coal {{was carried}} in side-dump cars, {{from which it}} was dumped into a hopper below each customer's boiler room. A {{conveyor}} then carried the coal up from the trackside hopper to the customer's boiler room. [...] The details of the latter connection depended on {{the depth of the}} building's basement. Chicago's new City building on the corner of Washington and LaSalle had a subbasement 38 ft below sidewalk level, so the tunnel connection was made by a 10 ft trench. [...] The Commercial National Bank's <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> were under the sidewalk on Clark Street. There, coal was lifted from the tunnel by a vertical bucket conveyor running in a small shaft.|$|R
25|$|River North was {{previously}} named Smokey Hollow, {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, due to the many factories and forges in the area. Smoke from the factories was often so thick that it blocked the sunlight. At the time, Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub, with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River to the surrounding areas. The now mixed-use Merchandise Mart was once a major storage warehouse for goods, and it still has railroad tracks underneath its sprawling structure. Former major retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North. Massive <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> were formerly located throughout the neighborhood, for storage of coal transported by ship.|$|R
50|$|Immediately to {{the north}} and south of the boilers are low brick structures, {{approximately}} 1m in height. These comprise the remains of a <b>coal</b> <b>bin,</b> (north) and the condensers and brick flue associated with the boilers (south).|$|E
50|$|Since the Class 19B {{was heavy}} on coal, a {{ground-level}} concrete <b>coal</b> <b>bin</b> was built at Graaff-Reinet especially to replenish these locomotives on through runs while {{standing in the}} platform road. There was no standpipe alongside the platform road, however, so even though coal was taken here, through-working engines took water at Charlwood and Pretoriuskloof.|$|E
50|$|By February, 1914, a Ferro-cement {{building}} 80 by 40 ft, {{with an iron}} {{roof and}} a 40 ft smokestack was completed.

Detached from the main building was a store room and <b>coal</b> <b>bin.</b>|$|E
50|$|With the {{construction}} of the coal facility, railroad hopper cars loaded with coal could be brought directly by way of carfloat, where a locomotive hauled the hopper car(s) off the carfloat and brought it up an incline and placed it in the elevated coal facility. The hopper car had chutes on its underside and these chutes where placed over the <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> by locomotive, and when opened, the coal would discharge into the storage bins (silo) below. These storage bins themselves were elevated above street level, and at such time when the retailers wagon or truck, located under the silo chute; the coal could be dispensed directly into the coal retailers vehicle.|$|R
50|$|LaVannes father, Arthur, {{died when}} LaVannes was only 3 {{years old and}} he also lost three of his {{siblings}} due to poor health issues; his mother had only received an education as far as the fifth grade. Squires said his mother had immense pride which showed in her stern opposition toward handouts of any nature; she continued to work harder and harder, eventually their lives got better. His mother remarried but later divorced and moved to Plainview, Kansas from Oklahoma to work in manufacturing plants during World War II to produce war supplies; after the war they moved to Wichita, Kansas. Attributing to his mother and her hard work ethic, LaVannes developed hard working skills through filling <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> for people, working in a wheat field, doing construction, and digging graves in a cemetery.|$|R
50|$|Palmer also {{constructed}} a consolidated coal facility on Kent Avenue and North 9th Street. This coal facility which was {{state of the}} art at that time, and greatly reduced the amount of physical labor required for the coal wholesale suppliers in the area. Prior to the construction of this facility, these coal suppliers had to employ large amounts of labor to manually unload the coal barges at the waterfront, where men in the coal barge would shovel the coal into buckets and hoist it up to the dock. The coal would be dumped into wheelbarrows, and wheeled two blocks east to the <b>coal</b> <b>bins.</b> Where it was dumped into street level bins. To load into a coal retailers wagon or truck, {{it would have to be}} shoveled again.|$|R

50|$|On June 26, 1988, about 15 {{percent of}} the town, {{including}} many historic buildings, were burned down in {{what became known as}} The Great Perkasie Fire. This massive fire was started by two 12-year-old boys who were playing with a lighter near the <b>coal</b> <b>bins</b> behind the Shelley & Sons lumberyard at Seventh and Market Streets. The fire was fought by about 300 firefighters who came from over 50 fire companies in three counties. Among the historic buildings lost were the American House and the Moyer-Kantner Funeral Home, both dating from 1870, and the Herstine Building. One of the buildings was the J.G. Moyer building. The building graced the cover of the July 7, 1945 edition of The Saturday Evening Post. It depicted an artistic rendition of a Fourth of July parade by artist John Falter. Despite the size of the fire, no fatalities were reported.|$|R
5000|$|Until about 1900, {{nearly all}} coal {{breaking}} {{facilities in the}} United States were labor-intensive. The removal of impurities was done by hand, usually by breaker boys {{between the ages of}} eight and 12 years old. The use of breaker boys began around 1866. For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass on to the next breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into [...] "clean" [...] <b>coal</b> <b>bins.</b>|$|R
