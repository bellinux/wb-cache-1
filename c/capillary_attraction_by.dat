40|$|To {{investigate}} the water mobility mechanism of agarose gel, a consolidmeter was {{to prepare the}} foods. Dehydration time was shorter and also the value of void ratio was higher as the concentration of agarose increased. However, permiability was almost constant and dehydration ratio was lower. These result indicated that the holding capacity of water increased {{with the increase in}} concentration of agarose. The absorption ratio of water to the gel after dehydration was higher as the concentration of agarose increased. The reason was that the total <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction</b> caused <b>by</b> the dense network structure of gel increased. The rupture stress of gel when maxium loading weight was applied showed a higher value. The rupture stress of the gel after water absorption was lower than that of maxium loading weight...|$|R
40|$|When {{identical}} soft ferromagnetic {{particles are}} suspended at some water-air interface, <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction</b> is balanced <b>by</b> magnetic repulsion induced by a vertical magnetic field. By adjusting {{the magnetic field}} strength, the equilibrium interdistance between particles can be tuned. The aim {{of this paper is}} to study the ordering of particles for large assemblies. We have found an upper size limit above which the assembly collapses due to capillary effects. Before reaching this critical number of particles, defects are always present and limit the perfect ordering expected for that system. This is due to the curvature of the interface induced by the weight of the self-assembly. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous {{dielectric}} multilayer films exhibit {{an optical}} response (Bragg resonance) {{that is highly}} sensitive to the chemical environment. Using sol–gel preparation and spin-coating deposition method, titania/silica mesoporous layers were alternatively deposited and consolidated to form a Bragg stack on a glass substrate. Tuning of the effective refractive index of titania layers through the control of their porosity allowed us to tailor the optical response of the multilayer film, and in particular its color, to infiltrate liquids and/or molecules dissolved in a solvent. Selective grafting of hydrophobic molecules on the pore surfaces of titania mesoporous layers {{was likely to be}} at the origin of unusual behavior of the Bragg resonance spectral shift and intensity variation. The pore accessibility of the different layers forming the stack was investigated through the infiltration of Rhodamine 6 G fluorescent dye.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of an initially prepared distribution of micron sized colloidal particles, trapped at a fluid interface {{and under the}} action of their mutual <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction,</b> is analyzed <b>by</b> using Brownian dynamics simulations. At a separation λ given by the capillary length of typically 1 mm, the distance dependence of this attraction exhibits a crossover from a logarithmic decay, formally analogous to two-dimensional gravity, to an exponential decay. We discuss in detail the adaption of a particle-mesh algorithm, as used in cosmological simulations to study structure formation due to gravitational collapse, to the present colloidal problem. These simulations confirm the predictions, as far as available, of a mean-field theory developed previously for this problem. The evolution is monitored by quantitative characteristics which are particularly sensitive {{to the formation of}} highly inhomogeneous structures. Upon increasing λ the dynamics show a smooth transition from the spinodal decomposition expected for a simple fluid with short-ranged attraction to the self-gravitational collapse scenario.

25|$|Colbeck {{offers an}} {{overview}} of the five friction processes of skis on snow. They are the: 1) resistance due to plowing of snow out of the way, 2) deformation of the snow over which the ski is traveling, 3) lubrication of the ski with a thin layer of melt water, 4) <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction</b> of water in the snow to the ski bottom, and 5) contamination of the snow with dust and other non-slippery elements. Plowing and deformation pertain to the interaction of the ski, as a whole, with the snow and are negligible on a firm surface.

40|$|The present {{theoretical}} and experimental investigations concern static and dynamic properties of capillary bridges (CB) without gravity deformations.

The numerical calculations, presented as isogones (lines connecting points, characterizing constant contact angle) reveal some unexpected features in the behavior of the bridges.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} colloids at a fluid interface driven by attractive capillary interactions. At submillimeter length scales, the <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction</b> is formally analogous to two-dimensional gravity. In particular it is a non-integrable interaction {{and it can be}} actually relevant for collective phenomena in spite of its weakness {{at the level of the}} pair potential. We introduce a mean-field model for the dynamical evolution of the particle number density at the interface. For generic values of the physical parameters the homogeneous distribution is found to be unstable against large-scale clustering driven <b>by</b> the <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction.</b> We also show that for the instability to be observable, the appropriate values for the relevant parameters (colloid radius, surface charge, external electric field, etc.) are experimentally well accessible.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation [20703016]; Ministry of Education of China; U. S. Department of EnergyBy {{utilizing}} the strong <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction</b> between interfacial nanoparticles, large-scale one-dimensional Au nanochain networks were fabricated at the n-butanol/water interface, {{and could be}} conveniently transferred onto hydrophilic substrates. Furthermore, {{the length of the}} nanochains could be adjusted simply by controlling the density of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) at the n-butanol/water interface. Surprisingly, the resultant Au nanochains could further transform into smooth nanowires by increasing the aging time, forming a nanowire network. Combined characterization by HRTEM and UV-vis spectroscopy indicates that the formation of Au nanochains stemmed from a stochastic assembly of interfacial AuNPs due to strong <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction,</b> and the evolution of nanochains to nanowires follows an Ostwald ripening mechanism rather than an oriented attachment. This method could be utilized to fabricate large-area nanochain or nanowire networks more uniformly on solid substrates than that of evaporating a solution of nanochain colloid, since it eliminates the three-dimensional aggregation behavior.

40|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>attraction</b> between {{identical}} millimeter sized spheres floating at a liquid-air interface and {{the resulting}} aggregation is investigated at low Reynolds number. We show that the measured capillary forces between two spheres {{as a function of}} distance can be described by expressions obtained using the Nicolson approximation at low Bond numbers for far greater particle sizes than previously assumed. We find that viscous hydrodynamics interactions between the spheres needs to be included to describe the dynamics close to contact. We then consider the aggregates formed when a third sphere is added after the initial two spheres are already in contact. In this case, we find that linear superposition of capillary forces describes the observed approach qualitatively but not quantitatively. Further, we observe an angular dependence of the structure due to a rapid decrease of capillary force with distance of separation which has a tendency to align the particles before contact. When the three particles come in contact, they may preserve their shape or rearrange to form an equilateral triangle cluster - the lowest energy state - depending on the competition between attraction between particles and friction. Using these observations, we demonstrate that a linear particle chain can be built from frictional particles with <b>capillary</b> <b>attraction.</b> Comment: accepted for Physical Review...|$|R
