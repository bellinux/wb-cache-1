5|$|In late 1994, {{the power}} station was flooded to a foot deep of sea water, after a freak high tide and strong winds. This {{led to a}} sea defence system being {{constructed}} to protect the building. The problems came about because of the temporary closure of Ellington <b>Colliery.</b> Tipped waste from the <b>colliery</b> had {{been used as a}} coastal defence measure, but as the <b>colliery</b> had closed, waste was no longer being tipped. The <b>colliery</b> was reopened by RJB Mining, and in July 1999 the station ensured the future of the <b>colliery</b> by signing a contract with RJB Mining to be provided with 3,000,000 tonnes of coal from Ellington <b>Colliery</b> and opencast mines in Northumberland, over the course of three years. The <b>colliery</b> closed for good in 2005, leading to problems with coastal defence again, threatening the station's coal stocking area. This required a Â£2.5 million new coastal defence scheme be put in place, involving the use of large rocks as a defence wall.|$|E
5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree <b>Colliery</b> on 11 December 1858 when an explosion of firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys <b>Colliery</b> cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson <b>Colliery</b> in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the <b>colliery</b> manager and undermanager died at Shakerley <b>Colliery</b> after an explosion of firedamp.|$|E
5|$|When {{the station}} opened, the {{majority}} of the coal burned was from local collieries in Yorkshire, including Kellingley <b>Colliery,</b> Prince of Wales, Ackton Hall, Sharlston <b>Colliery,</b> Fryston <b>Colliery,</b> Askern <b>Colliery</b> and Bentley <b>Colliery.</b> Following the miners' strike in the mid-1980s, by 2006, all but Kellingley have closed. (Kellingley closed at the end of 2015.) UK Coal had a five-year contract to supply coal, which ended at the end of 2009, from Kellingley, Maltby and, until its closure in 2007, Rossington. Coal was also brought from Harworth <b>Colliery</b> until it was mothballed, and was supplied by Daw Mill in Warwickshire.|$|E

5|$|As of 2009, a {{business}} park {{is planned for}} the former Gibfield <b>Colliery</b> site.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{disasters}} in Leigh included {{the explosion of}} firedamp which caused the deaths of 38miners at Bedford <b>Colliery</b> on 13 August 1886. There were several accidents at Bickershaw <b>Colliery,</b> but the most serious was in 1932, when 19men were drowned in the sump {{at the bottom of}} the shaft after an overwind of the cage.|$|E
5|$|The Vobster Breach <b>colliery</b> had {{a unique}} system of long coking ovens which, {{along with the}} other buildings, have been {{designated}} as a Scheduled monument. The boiler chimney of Oxley's <b>Colliery</b> near Buckland Dinham which operated for a few years in the 1880s is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5000|$|Numbers 678 and 683 went to Tweefontein United <b>Collieries.</b> No. 678 later went to Witbank Consolidated <b>Collieries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>collieries</b> {{had access}} to {{considerable}} coal reserves but the workings were subject to flooding. Ram Pit sunk in 1901 never went into production because of flooding. Some <b>collieries</b> were connected underground to rationalise winding operations and facilitate ventilation. In 1890 eight <b>collieries</b> were working.|$|R
50|$|Simlong and Chatkam <b>collieries</b> {{and other}} nearby <b>collieries</b> of Rajmahal {{coalfield}} are operated by Eastern Coalfields Limited in Littipara CD Block.|$|R
5|$|The Writhlington Collieries, {{close to}} the Waldegrave Collieries, were further east of Radstock and under {{different}} ownership. In 1896 they were owned by the Writhlington, Huish and Foxcote <b>Colliery</b> Co., and in 1908 by the Writhlington Collieries Co. Ltd. The Upper and Lower Writhlington, Huish & Foxcote pits were merged into a single <b>colliery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>colliery</b> {{became known}} as the Bradford <b>Colliery</b> Company, and by 1896 {{employed}} 404 underground and 125 surface workers producing house coal and coal for manufacturing from the Parker mine. The high price of coal {{at the end of the}} 19th century persuaded the newly created Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association to mitigate the effects on its members by purchasing the <b>colliery</b> in 1900, thus ensuring a cheap supply of fuel for their steam-powered mills.|$|E
5|$|The <b>colliery</b> was {{situated}} {{south of the}} Ashton Canal, built in 1797, and north of Ashton New Road. A short arm of the canal, now filled in, was built to the <b>colliery</b> from between Lock No. 6 and Lock No. 7, Beswick Lock.|$|E
50|$|Indwe <b>Collieries,</b> {{which was}} located in the {{north-eastern}} part of the Cape of Good Hope, owned the branch line from Sterkstroom via Dordrecht to the <b>collieries</b> and supplied coal to the Cape Government Railways (CGR). The branch line had been constructed for the <b>collieries</b> by George Pauling in 1896.|$|R
50|$|In 1935, Powell Duffryn {{merged with}} the Welsh Associated <b>Collieries,</b> who owned 34 <b>collieries,</b> and formed the joint venture company Powell Duffryn Associated <b>Collieries,</b> which had an output of 20 million tons p.a.

5|$|A retail park {{developed}} {{on the old}} Parsonage <b>Colliery</b> site is {{within walking distance of}} the town centre.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme to}} cover the moors with ash from {{coal-fired}} power stations, and possibly municipal rubbish, was proposed in 1962, and again in 1969. Another plan of the 1960s was to build a regional airport on the moors; this proposal was revived in 1971. Further ash-tipping schemes were voiced in 1974, as was a third plan for an airport in 1976. There were also {{plans to use the}} moor as a dump for <b>colliery</b> waste in 1978, when Thorne <b>Colliery</b> was upgraded and reopened.|$|E
5|$|Another {{regeneration}} {{project on}} the site of the former Bickershaw <b>Colliery</b> complex which closed in 1992 will redevelop the site and canal side with a country park and housing.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined in Ashton {{since at least}} the 17th century. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries demand for coal increased, which led to an {{expansion}} of the town's coal industry. The produce of the collieries was transported by canal to Manchester. The industry began to decline during the late 19th century, and by 1904 only the Ashton Moss <b>Colliery</b> was still operational, the last <b>colliery</b> to be opened in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a railway}} linking the <b>colliery</b> {{to the main}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was constructed, and sidings laid in 1905 and 1907 which were reconstructed in 1953.|$|E

The Fletchers built company housing at Hindsford and a model village at Howe Bridge which included pit head baths and a social club for its workers. The company became part of Manchester <b>Collieries</b> in 1929. The <b>collieries</b> were nationalised in 1947 {{becoming part of the}} National Coal Board.|$|R
5|$|Mining around Farrington Gurney {{has been}} {{undertaken}} since the 17th century where, by 1780 the pits {{were known as}} Farrington <b>Colliery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Radstock had {{a second}} railway station on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway {{extension}} to Bath, which closed to passengers in 1966. The stations were {{adjacent to each other}} in the centre of the town, and each had level crossings across the busy A367 road, causing long tailbacks at busy periods. The S line also carried substantial coal traffic. A spur from the Great Western line on to the S and continuing to Writhlington <b>Colliery</b> remained open for a few years after the railway's closure to passenger traffic, until the <b>colliery</b> closed in 1973.|$|E
