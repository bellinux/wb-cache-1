500|$|The oil spill, located {{immediately}} {{north of}} Refugio State Beach in Santa Barbara County, California, originated in a [...] diameter underground pipeline named Line 901 owned by Plains All American Pipeline. <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>produced</b> by offshore platforms was transported from onshore receiving plants to another pipeline that transported the oil inland for processing. The oil pipeline operators in Midland, Texas had turned off an alarm {{that would have}} notified them of the leak as {{they were dealing with}} a separate problem with a pump. The 28 year old pipeline was not equipped with an automatic shut-off valve and was eventually shut down by control operators when they were notified of the leak from parties who visually located the spill.|$|E

Government representatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela met in Baghdad to discuss ways to increase the price of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>produced</b> by their countries, and ways to respond to unilateral actions by the MOCs. Despite strong US opposition: [...] "Together with Arab and non-Arab producers, Saudi Arabia formed the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) to secure the best price available from the major oil corporations." [...] The Middle Eastern members originally called for OPEC headquarters to be in Baghdad or Beirut, but Venezuela argued for a neutral location, and so the organization chose Geneva, Switzerland. On 1 September 1965, OPEC moved to Vienna, Austria, after Switzerland declined to extend diplomatic privileges.|$|E

30|$|This study’s {{findings}} further buttress {{the fact}} that oil price uncertainty {{is a major concern}} to oil and gas company stock holders and management. We therefore recommend that Nigerian oil companies embrace the benefits of oil price hedging and energy risk management. Studies such as Jin and Jorison (2006) and Altuntas et al. (2017) highlight a major possible down side of hedging as having a negative relationship with firm value. Altuntas et al. (2017) did note its relevance in mitigating the negative effect of cash flow volatility. Hedging oil prices will therefore allow oil and gas companies to take a position in the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> futures market. <b>Crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>producing</b> companies such as TOTAL or oil servicing firms such as CONOIL can enter <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> futures contracts to purchase or sell <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> at a particular future selling price. Hedging oil prices will allow {{the oil and gas industry}} more flexibility through better cash flow management.|$|R

40|$|Exposure to high {{concentrations}} of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>produces</b> a lethal syndrome of heart failure in fish embryos. Mortality is caused by cardiotoxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), ubiquitous components of petroleum. Here, we show that transient embryonic exposure to very low concentrations of oil causes toxicity that is sublethal, delayed, and not counteracted by the protective effects of cytochrome P 450 induction. Nearly a year after embryonic oil exposure, adult zebrafish showed subtle changes in heart shape and {{a significant reduction in}} swimming performance, indicative of reduced cardiac output. These delayed physiological impacts on cardiovascular performance at later life stages provide a potential mechanism linking reduced individual survival to population-level ecosystem responses of fish species to chronic, low-level oil pollution...|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> effluent (<b>produce</b> water) was tested on Tilapia guinensis and mangrove swamp microbial community (bacteria and fungi) in the aquarium environment. One hundred percent mortality {{occurred in the}} Tilapia sp exposed to 60 % concentration of produce water within 24 hours. Mortality ranged between 50 % and 80 % when the same organism was exposed to 40 % concentration for 96 hours. No mortality was observed below 30 % concentration during 96 hours. Since total hydrocarbon levels in produce water were low with indicated value of ± 2. 19 part per million (ppm), observed mortalities were attributed {{to the presence of}} toxins other than the oil. The bacterial character of the effluent was also confirmed by the marked growth inhibition at 96 hours relative to controls. Inhibition of bacterial growth resulted in competitive advantage to fungi, which show enhancement in growth relative to controls. The effect of produce water on the microbial community clearly showed the extent of ecosystem alteration associated with chronic low-level pollution from <b>oil</b> field <b>produce</b> water. There was no indication that microbial growth affected the {{toxicity of}} effluent to fish. In the light of these results, the discharge of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>produce</b> water, even if it meets the oil and grease limits, must be considered with caution until comprehensive analysis of effluent characteristics and subsequent treatment has been performed...|$|R
