5|$|During 1935, {{he began}} {{work for the}} National Resources Planning Board, which was then working on a large {{consumer}} budget survey. Ideas from this project later {{became a part of}} his Theory of the <b>Consumption</b> <b>Function.</b> Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the <b>consumption</b> <b>function,</b> the {{permanent}} income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E

500|$|Friedman's {{challenges}} {{to what he}} later called [...] "naive Keynesian" [...] theory began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the <b>consumption</b> <b>function.</b> In the 1960s, he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies, and described his approach (along with mainstream economics) as using [...] "Keynesian language and apparatus" [...] yet rejecting its [...] "initial" [...] conclusions. He theorized that there existed a [...] "natural" [...] rate of unemployment, and argued that employment above this rate would cause inflation to accelerate. He argued that the Phillips curve was, in the long run, vertical at the [...] "natural rate" [...] and predicted what would {{come to be known}} as stagflation. Friedman promoted an alternative macroeconomic viewpoint known as [...] "monetarism", and argued that a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy. His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve's response to the global financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} an Euler equation for {{per capita}} consumption to investigate whether social security increases consumption ceteris paribus in seventeen countries. Following the seminal work of Martin Feldstein, the literature has estimated <b>consumption</b> <b>functions</b> to address this question. Unfortunately, <b>consumption</b> <b>functions</b> confound structural and expectational parameters, making their interpretation problematical. Furthermore, if their variables are difference-stationary, least squares may produce inconsistent parameter estimates and must virtually always produce inconsistent standard errors for the estimated parameters. By contrast, under reasonable assumptions, generalized method of moments consistently estimates the parameters and standard errors of Euler equations. Moreover, the parameters are more readily interpretable. The paper finds strong evidence that social security increases consumption ceteris paribus.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{relationships}} between types of wealth components and consumption expenditures were investigated {{as a means}} of better understanding retired elderly household well-being. Specifically, the concept of mental account was used to identify the characteristics of different types of wealth components, and four mental accounts were identified: flow of investment, current asset A, current asset B, and future income. Based on the traditional life-cycle hypothesis, the behavioral life-cycle hypothesis, and neo-classical demand theory, the <b>consumption</b> <b>functions</b> for the total and 17 subcategorical consumption expenditures were formulated. These <b>consumption</b> <b>functions</b> were formulated to study linkages between household portfolio behavior during the working years and household consumption behavior during retirement. A tobit linear regression model was utilized to estimate parameters in <b>consumption</b> <b>functions.</b> The data were drawn from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, Interview Survey, 1990. The flow of investment mental account includes Social Security benefits, pension benefits, and transfer payments from public programs. The current asset A includes balances in checking and savings accounts, and the current assets B includes balances in stocks and bonds. The future income includes market values of home equity and real estate. The findings supported that the total and subcategorical consumption expenditures are the most sensitive to changes in flow of investment and the least sensitive to changes in future income. Further, among retired elderly households, the four mental accounts differ in influence on subcategorical consumption expenditures. The flow of investment was positively related to food at home, food away from home, utilities, household operation, clothing, transportation, entertainment, personal care, and cash contributions. Current asset A was positively related to health care, reading and education, and alcoholic beverages, and negatively related to food at home. Current asset B was positively related to clothing, transportation, entertainment, reading and education, and alcoholic beverages. Future income was positively related to food at home, utilities, household operation, and personal care. The research findings may help public policy makers understand or predict consumption expenditures as wealth components change in retired elderly households. Further, the economic well-being of retired elderly households should be discussed in terms of different types of wealth components rather than in terms of total wealth...|$|R
