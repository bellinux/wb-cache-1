The aim of the present work is both to assess the fertility and acidity levels of Cerrado soils under pasture and compare the variability of the soils characteristics on a regional scale. Two soil depths were sampled in different places within the studied area: (1) a surface horizon (0. 0 - 0. 2 m) in order to evaluate its fertility and acidity status for pasture, and (2) a subsurface horizon (0. 6 - 0. 8 m), used for classification. Most of soils had levels of nutrients below the reference values for adequate pasture development. Whatever the texture, about 90 % of soils had low or very low availability of phosphorus. Only 7 to 14 % of soils had low pH, high exchangeable aluminum, and aluminum saturation above the <b>critical</b> <b>acidity</b> level.

In general, the average water yield derived from IMB is similar to the long-term average runoff; however, IMB results suggest a much larger range in hydrological settings of the lakes, attributed to spatial heterogeneity in watershed characteristics and landcover. The comparison of critical loads estimates from the two methods suggests that use of average regional runoff data in the SSWC model may overestimate critical loads for the majority of lakes due to systematic skewness in the actual runoff distributions.

In order to protect these ecosystems against acidification, tolerance to acid deposition must be quantified. The suitability of the central empirical relationship used in the Steady-State Water Chemistry (SSWC) model to predict historical sulphate (SO 4) concentrations was investigated, and an alternate approach for determining aquatic <b>critical</b> loads of <b>acidity</b> (CL(A)) was employed for the study lakes (n =  260). <b>Critical</b> loads of <b>acidity</b> were often low, with median values of 12 – 16  mmolc m− 2  yr− 1, with the lower value reflecting a region-specific limit for acid-neutralizing capacity identified in this study. Uncertain levels of atmospheric deposition in the region, however, are problematic for characterizing acidification risk. Accurate S and chloride (Cl) deposition are needed to identify catchment sources (and sinks) of these elements in the new approach for CL(A) calculation. Likewise, accurate depiction of atmospheric deposition levels can prove useful for evaluation of lake runoff estimates on which estimates of CL(A) are contingent.

40|$|A {{critical}} load data base {{was developed for}} Europe and Northern Asia using the latest data bases on soils, vegetation, climate and forest growth. <b>Critical</b> loads for <b>acidity</b> and nutrient nitrogen for terrestrial ecosystems were computed with the Simple Mass Balance model. The resulting {{critical load}}s are in accordance with critical loads from previous global empirical studies, but have a much higher spatial resolution. <b>Critical</b> loads of <b>acidity</b> are sensitive to both the chemical criterion and the critical limit chosen. Therefore a sensitivity analysis of critical loads was performed by employing different chemical criteria. A critical limit based on an acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of zero resulted in critical loads that protect ecosystems against toxic concentrations of aluminium and unfavourable Al/Bc ratios, suggesting that ANC could be {{an alternative to the}} commonly used Al/Bc ratio. Critical loads of nutrient nitrogen are sensitive to the specified critical nitrate concentration, especially in areas with a high precipitation surplus. If limits of 3 ¿ 6 mg N l¿ 1 are used for Western Europe instead of the widely used 0. 2 mg N l¿ 1, critical loads double on average. In low precipitation areas, the increase is less than 50 %.

Therefore, it is important to assess the prospects of a regional assessment of forest soil chemistry with dynamic acidification models that can answer questions related to the recovery of forest soils after a drop in the acid atmospheric load. Materials and Methods: We applied the dynamic biogeochemical model SAFE to a forested site in the region of Mt. Medvednica, Croatia, with input data obtained from available national databases and the published literature. Results and Conclusions: Simulation results showed that the soil at the site did acidify, with pH and base saturation decreasing significantly from pre-industrial levels. The simulated soil [Bc]/[Al] molar ratio exceeded the critical limit in the second (Bw) and third (BwC) soil horizon, indicating that the forest at the site will likely encounter adverse effects. However, under the current deposition scenario, the site will recover fully from acidification by 2026. This modelling exercise pointed out that existing national datasets are not sufficient to fully parameterize SAFE. Therefore, the SAFE model might not be currently suitable for a regional assessment of forest soil acidification and recovery in Croatia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNorthwest British Columbia, Canada, a sparsely {{populated}} and largely pristine region, is targeted for rapid industrial growth {{owing to the}} modernization of an aluminum smelter and multiple proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. Consequently, air quality in this region is expected to undergo considerable changes within the next decade. In concert, the increase in LNG capacity driven by gas production from shale resources across North America has prompted environmental concerns and highlighted the need for science-based management decisions regarding the permitting of air emissions. In this study, an effects-based approach widely-used to support transboundary emissions policy negotiations {{was used to assess}} industrial air emissions in the Kitimat and Prince Rupert airsheds under permitted and future potential industrial emissions. Critical levels for vegetation of SO 2 and NO 2 and <b>critical</b> loads of <b>acidity</b> and nutrient nitrogen for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were estimated for both regions and compared with modelled concentration and deposition estimates to identify the potential extent and magnitude of ecosystem impacts. The critical level for SO 2 was predicted to be exceeded in an area ranging from 81 to 251  km 2 in the Kitimat airshed owing to emissions from an existing smelter, compared with < 1  km 2 in Prince Rupert under the lowest to highest emissions scenarios. In contrast, the NO 2 critical level was not exceeded in Kitimat, and ranged from 4. 5 to 6  km 2 in Prince Rupert owing to proposed LNG related emissions. Predicted areal exceedance of the <b>critical</b> load of <b>acidity</b> for soil ranged from 1 to 28  km 2 in Kitimat and 4 – 10  km 2 in Prince Rupert, while the areal exceedance of empirical critical load for nutrient N was predicted to be greater in the Prince Rupert airshed (20 – 94  km 2) than in the Kitimat airshed (1 – 31  km 2). The number of lakes that exceeded the <b>critical</b> load of <b>acidity</b> did not vary greatly across emissions scenarios in the Kitimat (21 – 23 out of 80 sampled lakes) and Prince Rupert (0 out of 35 sampled lakes) airsheds.

In the current study, exceedance of critical levels and loads suggests that industrial emissions from the nascent LNG export sector may require careful regulation to avoid environmental impacts. Emissions management from LNG export facilities in other regions should consider critical levels and loads analyses to ensure industrial development is synergistic with ecosystem protection.

40|$|Abstract. The {{calculation}} of <b>critical</b> loads for <b>acidity</b> and nutrient nitrogen uses {{data from a}} wide range of sources. For many of these inputs, no estimate of uncertainty has been calculated by the UK. This information is required at both the national and international scale for policy negotiations. Within Europe, protocols controlling the emissions of sulphur and nitrogen are being implemented and further reductions in these pollutants have an associated high cost. Consequently, it is imperative that uncertainties in the {{calculation of}} exceedances are quantified before further reductions in pollutants can be justified. The UK uses empirical and mass balance modelling techniques to calculate critical loads. The uncertainties in the inputs to these calculations are therefore required. The aim of this paper is to estimate these uncertainties.

40|$|<b>Critical</b> {{loads of}} <b>acidity</b> and {{nutrient}} nitrogen — simple {{measures of the}} sensitivity of ecosystems to deposition — {{have been widely used}} for setting emission reduction targets in Europe. In contrast to sulfur, the emissions of nitrogen compounds remain high in the future. This is also true for the exceedances of critical loads until 2010. Looking further into the future, climate change is likely to influence ecosystem sensitivity, and thus critical loads. It is shown that higher temperatures, changed precipitation patterns, and modified net primary production mainly increase critical loads, except in mountainous and arid regions. Using consistent scenarios of climate change and air pollution from a recently completed European study (AIR-CLIM), it is shown that the exceedances in 2100 of the critical loads are declining in comparison to 2010. However, exceedances of critical loads of nutrient nitrogen remain substantial, even under the most stringent scenario. This confirms the increasing role nitrogen plays in environmental problems in comparison to sulfur. Thus research should focus on the effects of nitrogen in the environment, especially under conditions of climate change, to support nitrogen-emission mitigating policies.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between average Ellenberg's indicator values per vegetation releve and environmental values {{measured in the}} field shows a large variability. This variability might have a strong impact on critical loads determined by dynamic models (i. e. by modelling the effect of acid deposition on the vegetation composition). To derive <b>critical</b> loads, <b>acidity</b> ranges per vegetation type are determined using Ellenberg indicator values, and subsequently translated into soil pH values. Acidity ranges are here defined as the range in which 80 % of the characteristic species of a vegetation type can potentially occur. In this paper we explore the uncertainty in the modelled pH ranges and discuss the possible implications for critical loads. The effect of an overall translation instead of transfer functions per class on the estimated critical soil pH, and therefore on the critical loads, was calculated {{for a set of}} vegetation types in The Netherlands. The use of these different transfer functions resulted in critical soil pH values that differed by 0. 2 pH units on average. For 12 out of the 17 -investigated vegetation types this effect is of the same magnitude as the modelled effect of a 50 % reduction in acidifying deposition. We also calculated the intrinsic uncertainty in the critical load estimates (i. e. due to the uncertainty in the regression parameters), {{which turned out to be}} even larger than the uncertainty due to the use of different transfer functions. This type of uncertainty was smaller when transfer functions per vegetation class were used (95 % confidence interval c 1. 4 vs c 1. 7 pH units). Although the modelled critical loads have a large amount of uncertainty, they are not much different from experimentally derived critical loads. We conclude that modelled critical loads can be used when no empirical data are present, although they have to be,regarded as less certain. The uncertainty can be reduced by incorporating transfer functions per vegetation class...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate models}} predict {{increased}} temperature and precipitation in the Georgia Basin, British Colmbia; however, {{little is known}} about the impacts on high-elevation regions. In the current study, fifty-four high-elevation lakes (754 – 2005 [*]m a. s. l.) were studied to investigate the potential influence of climate change on surface water acid-sensitivity. Redundancy analysis indicated that the concentration of nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and associated metals was significantly influenced by climate parameters. Furthermore, these components differed significantly between biogeoclimatic zones. Modelled soil base cation weathering for a subset of the study lakes (n= 11) was predicted to increase by 9 % per 1 °C increase in temperature. Changes in temperature and precipitation may potentially decrease the pH of surface waters owing to changes in anthropogenic deposition and organic acid production. In contrast, increased soil base cation weathering may increase the <b>critical</b> load (of <b>acidity)</b> of high-elevation lakes. Ultimately, the determining factor will be whether enhanced base cation weathering is sufficient to buffer changes in natural and anthropogenic acidity. Mountain and high-elevation regions are considered early warning systems to climate change; as such, future monitoring is imperative to assess the potential ramifications of climate change on the hydrochemistry and acid-sensitivity of these surface waters...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation carried out at a permanent plot in spruce stand of the Tatrzański National Park in the years 1998 [...] 2006. Concentrations of phytotoxic gases in the air together with the load of acidifying compounds reaching the forest soil were characterized. The forest ecosystem response was evaluated by analysing the chemistry of the needles, changes in health status of trees and floral composition. Neither exceedances of the critical SO 2 and NO 2 concentration levels in the air nor the <b>critical</b> load of <b>acidity</b> were found. Only ozone concentration level was recognised as a potential threat to the trees. Heavy metal concentrations in spruce needles represented levels concerned as non-hazardous for the health status of the tree stand. The use of the spruce needles as a cumulative bioindicator showed the presence of PAHs with carcinogenic properties in the air. The investigated spruce stand belongs to the slightly damaged class, however in the period of 1998 [...] 2004 a deterioration of the spruce trees condition was observed expressed by a diminishing number of health trees. A comparative investigation carried out in the years 2001 and 2006 proved stability of the floral composition at the permanent plot...|$|R
40|$|National maps {{produced}} In {{response to}} the call for data of October 2005, a new data set of <b>critical</b> loads for <b>acidity</b> and eutrophication was provided. The critical loads (CLs) were updated for forested lands of European Russia on a 5 x 5 km 2 grid. Data processing included combining soil and land use data with GIS layers such as temperature, precipitation amounts, base cations depositions and others. The following maps were produced: • maximum critical loads of sulphur, • maximum critical loads of nitrogen, • minimum critical loads of nitrogen, • critical loads of nutrient nitrogen. Calculation methods In the previous submissions, critical loads of S and N for terrestrial ecosystems of European Russia have been calculated using modified steady-state mass balance equations (Bashkin et al., 1995, 1999). A percentage of coniferous/deciduous forests and arable lands were used to describe a spatial distribution of main input data and to calculate CLs in 50 × 50 km 2 grids. The Russian NFC now updated both the database and calculation methods. In general, critical loads were computed {{in accordance with the}} methods summarized in the Mapping Manual (UBA, 2004). The basic ecosystem map for calculating and mapping was produced by overlaying several maps; it consists of 31, 043 units. A summary of the variables used and methods/approaches applied is given i...|$|R
