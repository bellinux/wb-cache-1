In 1897, he began at Berliner Maschinenbau AG, where he developed the first rotor powered by electricity with <b>cardanic</b> suspension and with that the first external rotor motor.

He {{made significant contributions to}} hypocycloids, published in De proportionibus, in 1570. The generating circles of these hypocycloids were later named Cardano circles or <b>cardanic</b> circles and were used for the construction of the first high-speed printing presses.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a <b>cardanic</b> frame as mechanical-compensation device for a Doppler-wind lidar installed on a floating sea buoy as the “moving” lidar. From the methodological point of view, the horizontal wind speed (HWS) measured by both a reference lidar (i. e., “fixed”) and a floating lidar (i. e., “moving”) {{with and without}} a cardarnic frame is cross-examined by using standard statistical indicators and a compound pendulum model. Performance results are analysed both at laboratory level using a pitch/roll motion-simulation platform and at a sea-test measurement-campaign level some 250 -m offshore Barcelona coast. Finally, simulations of the proposed pendulum-based model enables to tune-in and optimize cardanic-frame design parameters. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|This work {{illustrates}} a methodology for static and dynamic {{analysis of the}} <b>cardanic</b> shaft flexural behaviour; this method even {{takes into account the}} mechanical backlash of the linear compensation device. The static analysis results regarding the effects, due to the backlash, on the axes geometry of the broached and spline shafts, which make the intermediate shaft, are at first illustrated. An angular speed range that guarantees a pressure distribution without critical areas, between the broached shaft and the spline one, is afterwards specified. A model for dynamic analysis of the flexural vibrations that is capable of estimating the deflection and bending moment diagram, is furthermore developed. The way in which this model can forecast the limits of the above-mentioned speed range is finally described...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} to reduce integrable Hamiltonian Systems to action angle variables {{has been well}} {{known for a long}} time. Nevertheless the energy surface in the space of actions, which is an ordinary surface for 3 D systems, has not been presented for many integrable systems. Richter [8] filled this gap for the integrable spinning tops of Lagrange (including a <b>Cardanic</b> suspension) and Euler. In the present work we summarize our results obtained for the Kovalevskaya top. As far as the pictures are concerned we refer to [2]. Here we focus on a new method to reduce the dynamics to a flow on a surface of section. A complete Poincar'e section [4] for the reduced 2 D system is presented. There exists a Poisson structure whose integral curves are the intersection of tori with the surface of section. Bifurcation analyses is done using the flow of the Kovalevskaya constant with respect to this structure. The same section is used for the full 3 D system and a second section is used to obtain a 2 di [...] ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{believed}} that increasing the X-factor (movement of the shoulders relative to the hips) during the golf swing can increase ball velocity at impact. Increasing the X-factor may also {{increase the risk of}} low back pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide recommendations for the three-dimensional (3 D) measurement of the X-factor and lower trunk movement during the golf swing. This three-part validation study involved; (1) developing and validating models and related algorithms (2) comparing 3 D data obtained during static positions representative of the golf swing to visual estimates and (3) comparing 3 D data obtained during dynamic golf swings to images gained from high-speed video. Of particular interest were issues related to sequence dependency. After models and algorithms were validated, results from parts two and three of the study supported the conclusion that a lateral bending/flexion-extension/axial rotation (ZYX) order of rotation was deemed to be the most suitable <b>Cardanic</b> sequence to use in the assessment of the X-factor and lower trunk movement in the golf swing. The findings of this study have relevance for further research examining the X-factor its relationship to club head speed and lower trunk movement and low back pain in golf. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of three fully instrumented instructive test-rigs to study gear box efficiency and fault diagnosis of joints, roller bearings and gears. To analyze gear box efficiency, a back-to-back test-rig with mechanically closed energy loop was developed according to the FZG principle. An electrical motor with adjustable flange coupling was integrated in the loop. The efficiency of the gears can be determined very accurately by measuring the motor power {{that is needed to}} drive the closed loop as a function of speed, locked in torque, type of oil and oil immersion depth. The second test-rig consists of a driven shaft with adjustable motor position and excited bearing house. This enables the analysis of vibrations resulting from bearing defects and shaft misalignment. Bearings with three fault patterns (ball, inner ring or outer ring defect) are analyzed under radial loading conditions and broad speed range (10 - 3000 rpm). Moreover, single and double <b>cardanic</b> joints and torsionally flexible jaw type couplings are tested under radial and angular shaft misalignment. The third test rig is a closed electromechanical loop used for fault diagnosis of gear mesh defects under constant or variable torque loading. The experimental results are consistent with analytical calculations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study how the rider movements change the motorcycle behaviour while executing significant manoeuvres. It is well known how the inertial characteristics of human body are comparable to the motorcycle ones: to describe the dynamical behaviour of the whole system, it is necessary to understand the body-vehicle interactions. At this aim both motorcycle and rider are equipped through sensors. The motorcycle dynamic was measured by means of an inertial platform, the suspensions shaking by linear potentiometer, the steering angle by inductive rotary sensor and the speed by a proximity sensor on the wheel. In order to identify the rider motions - while running on a race track- an original measurement system was developed in a previous work [8]: the pilot is equipped by a rigid ergal staff, constrained to the back by a multi cross belts system. Three target points are defined on the staff; these targets are pointed by six cable extension potentiometers placed on the motorcycle. A set of non linear equations are written to fully identify the translational and the <b>cardanic</b> rotational 3 D movements of the riding body with respect to the motorcycle. To understand the rider-motorcycle interaction, both steady state manoeuvres (steering pad) and transient manoeuvres (Iso lane change, slalom) were performed...|$|E
40|$|In 1817, F. Bohnenberger {{presented}} an apparatus {{consisting of a}} fast spinning rotor with <b>cardanic</b> suspension. His invention {{formed the basis for}} L. Foucault’s epochal studies on gyroscopic sensors {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. The development of instruments like the artificial horizon and the directional gyro is a direct result of this work. Later on, gyro technology led also to stabilized platforms forming the early variants of inertial navigation systems. Foucault’s initial intention of using Bohnenberger’s invention as a sensor was the provision of a device offering an inertial direction reference for surveying and navigation. Due to technical limitations, a gyro is, however, suitable for such a task during only a limited period of time. To enable a long-term usage, additional, complementary measurements are required. An artificial horizon therefore includes levelling sensors, and a directional gyro is typically coupled with a magnetic compass. On the other hand, the main feature of integrated navigation systems is the fusion of data from dis-similar signal sources. Thus, artificial horizons and directional gyros represent elementary forms of such systems. Modern integrated navigation systems of high performance consist of the combination of inertial strapdown systems (being the successor of stabilized platforms) and GPS receivers. In photogrammetry, they have become an essential tool for direct georeferencing. Nevertheless, their system structure is still traceable to the early gyro instruments mentioned. This classical system design being outlined in the following opens perspectives for new developments...|$|E
40|$|Galileo Galilei' (GG) is a {{proposal}} for a small, low-orbit satellite devoted to testing the equivalence principle (EP) of Galileo, Newton and Einstein. The GG report on the phase A study recently carried out with funding from ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) concluded that GG can test the equivalence principle to 1 part in 10 (17) at room temperature. The main novelty is to modulate the expected differential signal of an EP violation at the spin rate of the spacecraft (2 Hz), Compared with other experiments, the modulation frequency is increased by more than a factor of 10 (4), thus reducing 1 /f (low-frequency) electronic and mechanical noise. The challenge for an EP test in space is to improve over the sensitivity of ground-based experiments (about 1 part in 10 (12)) by many orders of magnitude, so as to deeply probe a so Far totally unexplored field; doing that with more than one pair of bodies is an unnecessary complication. For this reason GG is now proposed with a single pair of test masses. At present the best and most reliable laboratory-controlled tests of the equivalence principle have been achieved by the 'Eot-Wash' group with small test cylinders arranged on a torsion balance placed on a turntable which provides the modulation of the signal (a 1 - 2 h rotation period). The torsion balance is not a suitable instrument in space. We have designed and built the GGG ('GG on the Ground') prototype. It is made of coaxial test cylinders weakly coupled (via mechanical suspensions) and quickly rotating (6 Hz achieved so far); in addition, it is well suited to be flown in space-where the driving signal is about three orders of magnitude stronger and the absence of weight is very helpful-inside the coaxial, co-rotating GG cylindrical spacecraft. The GGG apparatus is now operational. Preliminary measurement data indicate that weakly coupled, fast-spinning macroscopic rotors can be a suitable instrument to detect small differential effects. Rotation (up to 6 Hz so far) is stabilized by a small passive oil damper. A finer active damper, using small capacitance sensors and actuators as {{in the design of the}} space experiment, is in preparation. The current sensitivity of the GGG system is of 10 (- 9) m s(- 2) /root Hz at about 300 s, which can be improved because horizontal seismic noise is rejected very well; perturbing effects of terrain tilts (due to microseismicity and tides) will be reduced by adding a passive <b>cardanic</b> suspension. As for the capacitance read-out, the current sensitivity (5 pm displacements in 1 s integration time at room temperature) is adequate to make GGG competitive with the torsion balance. Because of the stronger signal and weaker coupling of the test rotors in space, this sensitivity is also adequate for GG to reach its target accuracy (10 (- 17)). Information, references, research papers and photographs of the apparatus are available on the Web ([URL]...|$|E
