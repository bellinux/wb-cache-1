There was no rule against declaring in one-day cricket, but Rose was aware that his plan was controversial. He discussed it with his teammates and there was no significant opposition–Derek Taylor, the wicket-keeper did not like the idea, but was not vociferous in the discussion. Rose sought clarification from Donald Carr, the chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), who administered cricket in England. Carr told Rose that his plan was legal, but against the spirit of the laws, and that he thought there would be repercussions if they went ahead with the plan. Roy Kerslake, the Somerset chairman, was with the team in Worcester and though he had reservations, he told Rose that he would [...] "support the team whatever their decision".|$|E

500|$|Following Braden's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Most Likely To..." [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests {{attempted}} to correctly guess which clique the viewers felt best fit a certain scenario; when a HouseGuest answered correctly they <b>could</b> <b>eliminate</b> one contestant from the competition, while an incorrect answer led to their own elimination. Ronnie was the winner. Following the eviction, those who evicted Chima began to speculate that Ronnie had been the HouseGuest to change his vote, though he continued to deny this and blamed Michele. Laura, {{being one of the}} first to realize that Ronnie had been the one to change his vote, attempted to turn the other HouseGuests against him, though Chima and Natalie later informed Ronnie of this. On Day 13, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Who Knows The Ugly Truth?" [...] luxury competition. For this competition, former winner Dan Gheesling returned to host the competition, in which the HouseGuests were required to answer questions based on what a member of the opposite sex felt. The male and female winners of the competition would win the opportunity to see the film The Ugly Truth, as well as choose the Have-Nots for the week. Casey and Chima are the winners of the prize, and choose the Popular clique, consisting of Jordan and Laura, to be the Have-Nots for the week. Later that day, Ronnie chose to nominate Jeff and Laura for eviction. Ronnie revealed his intentions to be backdooring Russell that week, though his alliance felt as though Russell would have the votes to stay. Following a confrontation between Lydia and Russell, Lydia and Kevin approached Ronnie about backdooring Russell, and Natalie later debated turning on him as she felt he placed a target on her back. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Casey were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Lydia was selected to host. On Day 14, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Big Brother Mint" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given an amount of money and had two minutes to attempt to get that amount of money in change. HouseGuests competed in rounds, and the HouseGuests farthest away from the goal amount each round was eliminated; the last HouseGuest remaining would win the Power of Veto. Jeff was the winner of the Power of Veto. Despite initially planning on nominating Russell after the Power of Veto was used, Ronnie later began to see Laura as a bigger threat, feeling she was smart enough to figure out his plans. On Day 16, Jeff chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Jordan being nominated in his place. When Ronnie lied and stated that Russell was campaigning to keep Laura in the game, he was confronted by the majority of the HouseGuests and accused of lying and playing both sides of the house. Following these events, Russell followed Ronnie around the house calling him names and taunting him for days afterwards. On Day 19, Laura became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of eight to one.|$|E

2500|$|A gradobranitelj (literally [...] "hail defender") and an oblačar was, in Serbian tradition, {{a man who}} {{protected}} {{his village}} from destructive weather. In Serbia, bad weather {{was believed to be}} brought by various demonic beings, including devils, creatures called ala and aždaja, eagles, black-feathered birds, and the souls of drowned and hanged persons. The gradobranitelj used magic to dissipate hail clouds, and to repel devils and the souls of the drowned and hanged persons, who were thought to bring the clouds. He learned this magic from another gradobranitelj. The oblačar ran to and fro beneath a hail cloud, fighting against an aždaja, a serpentine demon which flew in the cloud spewing hail on the fields of the oblačar's village. The gradobranitelj is recorded in north-western Serbia, and the oblačar is recorded in the region of Syrmia. It was also believed in some areas that there were women who <b>could</b> <b>eliminate</b> the danger from destructive weather using sorcery.

2500|$|Forced {{induction}} {{dates from}} the late 19th century, when Gottlieb Daimler patented the technique of using a gear-driven pump to force air into an internal combustion engine in 1885. The turbocharger was invented by Swiss engineer Alfred Büchi (1879–1959), the head of diesel engine research at Gebrüder Sulzer (now called Sulzer), engine manufacturing company in Winterthur, who received a patent in 1905 for using a compressor driven by exhaust gases to force air into an internal combustion engine to increase power output, but it took another 20 years for the idea to come to fruition. During World War I French engineer Auguste Rateau fitted turbochargers to Renault engines powering various French fighters with some success. In 1918, General Electric engineer Sanford Alexander Moss attached a turbocharger to a V12 Liberty aircraft engine. The engine was tested at Pikes Peak in Colorado at [...] to demonstrate that it <b>could</b> <b>eliminate</b> the power loss usually experienced in internal combustion engines {{as a result of}} reduced air pressure and density at high altitude.|$|E
2500|$|Freud {{in effect}} readopted the {{original}} definition in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, this time applying it {{to a different}} principle. He asserted that on certain occasions the mind acts as though it <b>could</b> <b>eliminate</b> tension entirely, or in effect to reduce itself {{to a state of}} extinction; his key evidence for this was the existence of the compulsion to repeat. Examples of such repetition included the dream life of traumatic neurotics and children's play. In the phenomenon of repetition, Freud saw a psychic trend to work over earlier impressions, to master them and derive pleasure from them, a trend was prior to the pleasure principle but not opposed to it. In addition to that trend, there was also a principle at work that was opposed to, and thus [...] "beyond" [...] the pleasure principle. If repetition is a necessary element in the binding of energy or adaptation, when carried to inordinate lengths it becomes a means of abandoning adaptations and reinstating earlier or less evolved psychic positions. By combining this idea with the hypothesis that all repetition is a form of discharge, Freud reached the conclusion that the compulsion to repeat is an effort to restore a state that is both historically primitive and marked by the total draining of energy: death.|$|E
