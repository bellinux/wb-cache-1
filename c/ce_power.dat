50|$|After Fakhr's {{death in}} 387 H (997 <b>CE),</b> <b>power</b> passed to his infant sons, whose mother Sayyida Khatun acted as regent. Nine-year-old Abu Taleb Rostam (honorific name Majd al-Daula) {{inherited}} Ray, while {{his younger brother}} Abu Taher (Shams al-Daula) had Hamadan. Following the seizure of Khorasan in 388-9 H (999 CE) by the Ghaznavids- Turkic warriors from further east- the exiled Samanid Isma'il ibn Nuh al-Muntasir attempted to capture Ray in 390 H (1000 CE), but failed. By 397 H (1007 CE), the young adult Majd was becoming frustrated by his mother's dominance, and arranged with his vizier to take control. She escaped and sought help from the Kurdish leader Abu Najm ibn Hasanuya. Allying themselves with Shams, they besieged Ray and eventually imprisoned Majd in the hilltop fortress of Tabarak, adjoining the city. After a year, during which Shams was nominal ruler both of Hamadan and Ray, Majd was {{allowed to return to}} purely nominal power, and a life of luxury. As his mother grew older, Shams waited for the ideal moment to take Ray back, striking successfully in 405 H (1014-15 CE). Both Sayyida and Majd escaped, and Shams' troops refused to pursue them, so they were soon able to return and drive him back to Hamadan. Sayyida was also uncomfortably aware that the Ghaznavids, by now well established in Khorasan, had thoughts of westward expansion, and she engaged in a subtle diplomatic standoff with the Ghaznavid Sultan (i.e. emperor, only nominally loyal to the Caliph) Mahmud ibn Sabuktegin- honorific name Yamin al-Daula- who temporarily chose to direct his conquering zeal south-eastwards instead. Some rulers were less perceptive than Mahmud, such as Ibn Fuladh, probably another Daylamite, who began incursions into the province of Ray about 407 H (1016 CE). With help from Tabaristan, Sayyida managed to keep him at bay, but he too sought help in Tabaristan, and received 2,000 troops from the Ziyarid regional overlord Manuchihr. Ray was besieged, and Sayyida (or, nominally, Majd al-Daula) was forced to give Ibn Fuladh the governorship of Isfahan. Ibn Fuladh disappears from the historical record after this, so {{it is likely that the}} incumbent governor of Isfahan made an effective objection after the fashion of the time.|$|E

The CE capillary replaces the central tube of the concentric nebulizer. The tip of the nebulizer tapers slowly to allow uncertainty in the position of the capillary. A platinum wire was inserted into the CE capillary to provide electrical connection to the <b>CE</b> <b>power</b> supply. pH changes inside the capillary due to electrolysis of the background buffer electrolyte was small and has minimal effects on the CE separation. The peak broadening effects due to the nebulizing gas flow, however, were significant. Resolution decreases quickly when the flow-rate of the carrier gas increases. Sample stacking technique was used to improve the resolution of species of opposite charge, e. g., Cr(VI) vs. Cr(III) ions.

The research used field trials data of rice fertilization in Karawang and Kebumen region. Fertilizer treatments consist of fourteen levels of fertilizer type with three replications. In Kebumen region the research was conducted over two growing seasons. The experiment used a randomized complete block design. The results show that for single experiment the best model for Karawang and Kebumen 1 location was RCBCE power isotropic model, whilst for Kebumen 2 location was RCBCE power anisotropic model. In combined experiments the best model was <b>CE</b> <b>power</b> anisotropic model with heterogeneous residual variance across locations.

The MOA was first used in the lab to analyze soil extracts from the Atacama Desert, Chile, detecting amino acids ranging from 10 – 600 parts per billion. Field tests of the MOA in the Panoche Valley, CA, successfully detected amino acids at 70 parts per trillion to 100 parts per billion in jarosite, a sulfate-rich mineral associated with liquid water that was recently detected on Mars.

40|$|Nowadays, {{most of the}} {{ancillary}} services such as reserve capacity, inertia and frequency control relies on large conventional power plants. Approaching future power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) has resulted in imperative need {{for the evaluation of}} {{ancillary services}}. This research focuses on the frequency stability which must be ensured {{in order to maintain the}} grid stability against imbalances between generation and load. This large conventional power plants that provide ancillary services are called “must-run” units. These facilities are generation power plants necessary during certain operating conditions and they are responsible for providing enough ancillary services to ensure a reliable operation of power systems. Given a high RES penetration in the future, must-run units are expected to be reduced or totally decommissioned reducing the power system inertia. This may result in insecure operation threatening the reliability of the power supply. This project investigates the frequency stability support from renewable energy generation such as wind power plants (WPPs) and solar photovoltaic systems (SPVSs) in future power systems with high penetration of RES and without must-run units. Sensitivity studies for frequency stability are performed on a simulated 2030 scenario for western Denmark (DK 1) power system. The objective of this master thesis is to study the DK 1 power system to analyse the ability of modern controllable WPPs to provide frequency stability without must-run units in a future scenario dominated by RES generation. This project examines the primary frequency control in DK 1 simulating an overfrequency event islanding DK 1 from the <b>CE</b> <b>power</b> system with high wind forecast. The main results of this project reveal that the fast deploy of active power by the RES generation counterbalances the reduced inertia in the power system, which can operate without a lack of stability of the power supply for overfrequency events without must-run units. However, there are technical capabilities and limitations that curtail the RES penetration. Recommendations on the parameters of the WPPs frequency control are made according to the droop, the ramp rate and the RES penetration. The virtual inertia is recommended for frequency control of WPPs and increases its importance when the RES penetration is high. The support of HVDC interconnections is an interesting facility to increase the RES penetration allowing the power system to operate with even less inertia online maintaining a stable supply. Although, the measurement and communication delay by the frequency controllers increases its importance when increasing the RES penetration as faster power deploy is needed...|$|E

40|$|DNA microarrays {{open up a}} broad new {{horizon for}} {{investigators}} interested in studying the genetic determinants of disease. The high throughput nature of these arrays, where differential expression for thousands of genes can be measured simultaneously, creates an enormous wealth of information, but also poses a challenge for data analysis {{because of the large}} multiple testing problem involved. The solution has generally been to focus on optimizing false-discovery rates while sacri � <b>cing</b> <b>power.</b> The drawback of this approach is that more subtle expression differences will be missed that might give investigators more insight into the genetic environment necessary for a disease process to take hold. We introduce a new method for detecting differentially expressed genes based on a high-dimensional model selection technique, Bayesian ANOVA for microarrays (BAM), which strikes a balance between false rejections and false nonrejections. The basis of the new approach involves a weighted average of generalized ridge regression estimates that provides the bene � ts of using shrinkage estimation combined with model averaging. A simple graphical tool based on the amount of shrinkage is developed to visualize the trade-off between low false-discovery rates and � nding more genes. Simulations are used to illustrate BAM’s performance, and the method is applied to a large database of colon cancer gene expression data. Our working hypothesis in the colon cancer analysis is that large differential expressions may not be the only ones contributing to metastasis—in fact, moderate changes in expression of genes may be involved in modifying the genetic environment to a suf � cient extent for metastasis to occur. A functional biological analysis of gene effects found by BAM, but not other false-discovery-based approaches, lends support to this hypothesis.
