25|$|On January 1, 1999, Belo {{launched}} Texas Cable News (TXCN), {{a statewide}} cable news channel that initially featured rolling news, weather and sports content, {{as well as}} public affairs, sports-talk and entertainment news programs, utilizing staff and resources from WFAA and sister stations KVUE, KHOU and KENS, and The Dallas Morning News. TXCN switched to a format primarily consisting of repackaged newscasts featuring segments seen on each of Belo's Texas-based stations, and in-house weather segments on January 1, 2005, citing limited <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> in Texas' largest television markets for the format change {{that resulted in the}} layoffs of 45 of the channel's employees. Following its acquisition of Belo, Gannett shut down Texas Cable News on May 1, 2015.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 2015, WISH {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to carry Atlantic Coast Conference college football and basketball games produced by Raycom Sports (via the syndicator's ACC Network service) effective with the 2015–16 ACC football season, as Indianapolis is in the ACC market covered by the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The first ACC game to air on the station through this deal was the September 5 game between the Wofford Terriers and Clemson Tigers. On October 6, Media General announced that WISH would carry NHL games involving the Chicago Blackhawks produced by WGN-TV, with an initial slate of 19 Saturday and Sunday games during the 2015–16 season starting with the team's October 10 match against the New York Islanders. This {{marked the first time}} outside of Canadian <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> quirks involving WGN-TV that WGN's Blackhawks coverage aired outside the Chicago market (WGN America never carried Blackhawks telecasts).|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the series was officially {{announced}} during UPN's broadcast upfront presentations, Ali Landry, Natalie Desselle-Reid, and Brian Hooks were confirmed to be playing Rita, Janie, and Nick respectively. Bumper Robinson was originally scheduled to portray J.T., but was later replaced by Jason George for undisclosed reasons. The role of Donovan was also recast, with the original actor Eddie McClintock removed in favor of Sean Maguire. The supporting cast of Landry, Desselle-Reid, Hooks, and Maguire were described by Tom Jicha of the Sun-Sentinel as [...] "peripheral" [...] since they were written to [...] "servic the highs and lows of the romance between Shelly and J.T." [...] With Shelly and J.T.'s relationship as {{the heart of the}} sitcom, Janollari expressed hopes that the episodes would follow them [...] "from their meeting in the pilot, through the steps of a normal relationship, all the way, hopefully to marriage". In the fall of 2006, TV One began broadcasting the series as part of an agreement with Warner Bros.
