40|$|Background: Preterm birth has {{significantly}} {{increased in the}} last two decades. Preterm infants lack synchrony and coordination in sucking, swallowing, and breathing necessary for oral <b>feeding.</b> <b>Cup</b> <b>feeding</b> has been identified as a safe alternative for preterm infants who are not able to fully breastfeed, yet the practice is limited. One potential reason this alternative is underutilized is lack of health care provider knowledge regarding <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Understanding health care provider knowledge will provide information to guide <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> education efforts. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the relationship between health care team knowledge and the use of <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> in neonatal intensive care units. Methods: A non-experimental cross-cultural correlational design will be used to evaluate study goals. A convenience sample of ~ 350 neonatal nurses and physicians from US and Jordan will be recruited to complete a web-based survey. Recruitment strategies will include Email, website links, and snowballing. To evaluate health care provider knowledge about <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> a questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire includes items asking about demographic data (e. g. Age, ethnicity, occupation, and experience). A 7 -point Likert scale ranging from Always to never was used to assess knowledge regarding feeding type (bottle, breast, NGT, and cup). Multivariate Regression analysis will be conducted to examine the relation between health care provider knowledge and <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> practices. Regressions will control for potential covariates (e. g., provider age, culture, experience, and education). Findings and Conclusions: Research still in process. Preliminary results will be available by May. Nurses and physicians have the authority to decide which feeding method to use for an infant. In addition, parents are influenced by health care provider advice. Identifying health care provider knowledge of <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> can identify misconceptions regarding <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> These findings will lead to educational interventions aimed at improving feeding of preterm infants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{previous}} studies have demonstrated beneficial breastfeeding outcomes when <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> rather than bottle feeding was used for <b>feeding</b> preterm infants, <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> has not been implemented in Egypt. The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the effect of using <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> as an exclusive method of feeding preterm infants during hospitalization on breastfeeding outcomes after discharge. Methods A quasi-experimental design, with the control group studied first, was used to examine the effect of <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> for preterm infants on breastfeeding outcomes after discharge. Sixty preterm infants (mean gestational age was 35. 13 weeks and mean birth weight was 2150 grams) were recruited during Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay. Control group infants (n = 30) received only bottle feedings during hospitalization and the experimental group (n = 30) received only cup feedings during hospitalization. Both groups were followed up after discharge for six weeks to evaluate infant's breastfeeding behavior and mother's breastfeeding practices. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA for testing the differences between the <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> and bottle feeding groups over six weeks after discharge. Results Cup fed infants demonstrated significantly more mature breastfeeding behaviors when compared to bottle fed infants (p Conclusion Cup fed infants were more exclusively breast fed one week after discharge, supporting the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative recommendations for using <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> and avoiding bottle feeding when providing supplementation for preterm infants.

One potential reason this alternative is underutilized is lack of health care providers’ (HCP) knowledge and negative beliefs regarding <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Jordan and the United States have different health systems, languages, cultures, and economies. A cross cultural comparison of HCP’s knowledge and beliefs in these two contrasting countries may yield some interesting and valuable findings that may further inform clinicians and educators. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the impact of country, occupation, neonatal health care experience, and level of education on knowledge, beliefs, preference, and past behavior regarding feeding types. Theoretical Framework: The Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior Model was used as a guidance. Methods: A non-experimental cross-cultural correlational design was used to evaluate study goals. A convenient sample of 160 neonatal nurses and physicians from US and Jordan was recruited to complete a web-based survey. Recruitment strategies included Email, website links, and snowballing. Analysis included descriptive, t-test, crosstabs, and Multiple regression analysis. Results: 178 eligible participants submitted the questionnaire online. Among the respondents, 85 were from Jordan and 70 were from US. The average number of years in neonatal health care experience was 13. 7 (SD = 12. 3), and almost half of the participants (47. 7 %) had at least 10 years of neonatal health care experience. Almost half of the participants had a BSN or less (55. 1 %). US sample had more knowledge and positive beliefs about all feeding types, and reported higher overall <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> use than Jordanian sample. Physicians had more knowledge and positive believes regarding breast- and cup-feeding, and reported higher feeding preference and practice variables scores than nurses. Participants with at least 10 years of neonatal experience had more knowledge and positive beliefs regarding all feeding types and reported higher overall <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> use scores than participants with less than 10 years of neonatal experience. Participants with an advanced degree had more knowledge and positive beliefs regarding all feeding types, and they reported higher <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> preference and practice scores than participants with a BSN degree or lower.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. BACKGROUND: Preterm infants start milk feeds {{by gavage}} tube. As they mature, sucking feeds are {{gradually}} introduced. Women {{who choose to}} breast feed their preterm infant are not always available and an alternative approach to feeding is needed. Most commonly, milk (expressed breast milk or formula) is given by bottle. There is some controversy about whether using bottles during the establishment of breast feeds is detrimental to breastfeeding success. OBJECTIVES: To {{determine the effect of}} avoidance of bottle feeds during the establishment of breastfeeding on the likelihood of successful breastfeeding and to determine if alternatives to bottle feeds are safe. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE in any language. The search was updated in July 2008. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials comparing avoidance of bottles with use of bottles in women who have chosen to breast feed their preterm infant. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When appropriate, we contacted study authors for additional information. Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials of 543 infants were included. Four trials used a <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> strategy and one trial used a tube feeding strategy when supplements to breast feeds were needed. The single study of tube feeding had a high risk of bias. In the analysis of all five trials, significant heterogeneity was evident in two of the primary outcomes. This was reduced when the tube feeding trial was removed from analyses. <b>Cup</b> <b>feeding</b> significantly decreased 'no breastfeeding or only partial breast feeding' on discharge home (summary RR 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 61 to 0. 91). However, <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> significantly increased length of hospital stay by 10 days (95 % CI 3. 87 to 16. 29). There was a high degree of noncompliance in the largest study of <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> indicating dissatisfaction with this method by staff and/or parents. The one trial of a tube alone approach significantly reduced 'no breastfeeding or only partial breastfeeding' and 'no breastfeeding at all' at all time periods but the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing breast <b>feeds</b> by <b>cup</b> confers no breastfeeding benefit beyond discharge home and delays discharge considerably. There is currently insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations for a tube alone approach to supplementing breast feeds. Further research is needed to evaluate a tube alone approach.

Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Two large tertiary hospitals, 54 peripheral hospitals. Participants 319 preterm infants (born at 23 - 33 weeks’ gestation) {{randomly assigned to one of}} four groups: cup/no dummy (n = 89), cup/dummy (n = 72), bottle/no dummy (n = 73), bottle/dummy (n = 85). Women with singleton or twin infants < 34 weeks’ gestation who wanted to breastfeed were eligible to participate. Interventions: <b>Cup</b> or bottle <b>feeding</b> occurred when the mother was unable to be present to breast feed. Infants randomised to the dummy groups received a dummy on entry into the trial. Main outcome measures: Full breast feeding (compared with partial and none) and any breast feeding (compared with none) on discharge home. Secondary outcomes: prevalence of breast feeding at three and six months after discharge and length of hospital stay. Results: 303 infants (and 278 mothers) were included in the intention to treat analysis. There were no significant differences for any of the study outcomes according to use of a dummy. Infants randomised to <b>cup</b> <b>feeds</b> were more likely to be fully breast fed on discharge home (odds ratio 1. 73, 95 % confidence interval 1. 04 to 2. 88, P = 0. 03), but had a longer length of stay (hazard ratio 0. 71, 0. 55 to 0. 92, P = 0. 01). Conclusions: Dummies do not affect breast feeding in preterm infants. <b>Cup</b> <b>feeding</b> significantly increases the likelihood that the baby will be fully breast fed at discharge home, but has no effect on any breast feeding and increases the length of hospital stay.

Whether using bottles during establishment of breast feeds is detrimental to breast feeding success is a topic of ongoing debate. Objectives To identify the effects of avoidance of bottle feeds during establishment of breast feeding on the likelihood of successful breast feeding, and to assess the safety of alternatives to bottle feeds. Search methods We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to July 2016), Embase (1980 to July 2016) and CINAHL (1982 to July 2016). We also searched databases of clinical trials and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing avoidance of bottles with use of bottles in women who have chosen to breast feed their preterm infant. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When appropriate, we contacted study authors for additional information. Review authors used standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results We included seven trials with 1152 preterm infants. Five studies used a <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> strategy, one used a tube feeding strategy and one used a novel teat when supplements to breast feeds were needed. We included the novel teat study in this review, as the teat was designed to more closely mimic the sucking action of breast feeding. The trials were of small to moderate size, and two had high risk of attrition bias. Adherence with <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> was poor {{in one of the}} studies, indicating dissatisfaction with this method by staff and/or parents; the remaining four <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> studies provided no such reports of dissatisfaction or low adherence. Meta-analyses provided evidence of low to moderate quality indicating that avoiding bottles increases the extent of breast feeding on discharge home (full breast feeding typical risk ratio (RR) 1. 47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 19 to 1. 80; any breast feeding RR 1. 11, 95 % CI 1. 06 to 1. 16). Limited available evidence for three months and six months post discharge shows that avoiding bottles increases the occurrence of full breast feeding and any breast feeding at discharge and at six months post discharge, and of full (but not any) breast feeding at three months post discharge. This effect was evident at all time points for the tube alone strategy and for all except any breast feeding at three months post discharge for <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Investigators reported no clear benefit when the novel teat was used. No other benefits or harms were evident, including, in contrast to the previous (2008) review, length of hospital stay. Authors' conclusions Evidence of low to moderate quality suggests that supplementing breast <b>feeds</b> by <b>cup</b> increases the extent and duration of breast feeding.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{minimally}} invasive technique to evaluate respiratory patterns in preterm infants during feeding. Methodology:Respiratory flow was obtained with a pneumotachograph coupled initially to a mask and then to a prong, both with a differential pressure transducer. Respiratory plethysmography was used to measure thoraco-abdominal movements. This recording allowed calibration of thepreterm infant’s tidal volume prior to feeding experiments. Electromyography was used to monitor oral muscle move-ments through electrodes attached to the buccinator, masseter and mentalis mus-cles. A pulse oximeter and cardiac monitor were used for continuous monitoring of vital signs. The infants were positioned vertically in a semi-sitting position in an in-fant seat. Results:The methodology developed here was considered effective in achieving the proposed aims. With the integrationof all these systems, it was possible to evaluate the respiratory patterns of preterm infants during <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Conclusion:This method allows the analysis of respiratory flow, volume, and O 2 saturation during feeding and identification of the moment in which a change in breathing occurs (i. e., pausing or feeding).

40|$|Objective: To {{measure and}} compare the {{activity}} of the masseter, temporalis and buccinator muscles in different infant feeding methods. Method: Cross-sectional study of 60 full-term infants with no intercurrent diseases, aged between two and three months, classified into the following groups: 1) exclusive breastfeeding; 2) breastfeeding plus bottle-feeding; and 3) exclusive breastfeeding plus <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Surface electromyography was performed during infant feeding. The Krushal-Wallis test was used, complemented by multiple paired comparisons of the groups. A 5 % significance level was chosen for the tests. Results: Statistically higher results were verified in the breastfeeding group in relation to the bottle-feeding one, both in the range of movement and the mean contraction of the masseter. With regard to the temporalis muscle, statistically higher results were found in the breastfeeding group comparatively to the bottle-feeding one. As to the buccinator muscle, statistically higher results were observed in the breastfeeding group in relation to the bottle-feeding one, although in this case, the difference concerned only the range of contraction. Conclusion: The similarities between the muscle activity in the breastfeeding and in the cup-feeding groups suggests that cup-feeding can be used as an alternative infant feeding method, being better than bottle-feeding, due to the hyperactivity of the buccinator muscle, which could result in changes to the structural growth and development of the stomatognathic system functions.

The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the knowledge, attitudes and practices of women regarding the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme at a community health centre (CHC), Method. A descriptive study was conducted using an administered, structured questionnaire. Subjects and setting. Thirty-six educated women aged 18 - 39 years and attending the clinic took part. Participants were from informal settlements and mostly unemployed, receiving government grants. Results. The majority (88. 9 %) scored 80 % or more with regard to general HIV knowledge. Although the majority (78 %) were formula feeding, primarily owing to their HIV status and convenience while working, 24 % would not be able to sustain this feeding method after the initial 6 months' free supply provided by the provincial health services. The majority could not define the terms exclusive breastfeeding (89 %), mixed feeding (81 %) or <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> (94 %) correctly. Attitudes were found to be positive with regard to both breastfeeding and formula feeding, but HIV status influenced it significantly (p < 0. 1). Conclusion. In conclusion, certain aspects of the PMTCT programme appear to have been effective at the CHC included in this study. The women were knowledgeable about HIV transmission and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), but they were uninformed about certain essential aspects, i. e. prevention, cure and infant feeding. Attitudes were similar towards breastmilk or formula milk as a feeding choice but were influenced by HIV status. It was indicated that an informed decision-making process was not followed, rather that the women were advised to formula feed.

40|$|Background : Health {{care workers}} are {{important}} in the promotion, protection and support of breast feeding. Their ability to do this {{may be influenced by}} their knowledge, personal experiences and work. Patients and Method: The breast feeding experience of 36 female medical doctors who had babies within the preceding two years and had resumed work was evaluated using a semi-structured self administered questionnaire. Result: All respondents knew that babies should be exclusively breast fed {{for the first six months}} of life but only 60 % knew that breast feeding should continue until two years. The exclusive breast feeding rate for the studied doctors was 11. 1 %. Before their babies were six months old, about 75 % of respondents had resumed work whilst over 50 % had started taking calls. Most could not breast feed during working or call hours. Alternative feeds during working or call hours included expressed breast milk in 34. 4 % and infant formula in 21. 9 %. Feeding bottle was the major method (77. 4 %) for feeding these alternatives. Work schedule was rearranged to allow breast feeding in only 27. 3 % of respondents. Conclusion: Failure to carry out exclusive breast feeding, the use of infant formula and feeding bottles (rather than <b>cup</b> <b>feeding)</b> are practices that may be inimical to the practice of breast feeding in society in general. The suboptimal breast feeding experience in these doctors and the identified knowledge deficits may limit their effectiveness in promoting and supporting breast feeding among their patients and communities.

METHODS: Forty-eight newborn preterm infants with gestational age less than or equal to 36 6 / 7 weeks, weighting < 2500 grams and with stable respiratory pattern participated in this study. The newborns were divided into two groups: group A (35 newborns) with bottle feeding, and group B (13 newborns) with <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Speech-Language Pathology monitoring was organized in Stage 1 (non-nutritive sucking in "gloved finger" or "empty breast" concomitant with enteral feeding); Stage 2 (oral feeding offer - maternal breast, bottle or cup - with complement provided by enteral feeding); Stage 3 (exclusive oral feeding offer - maternal breast, bottle or cup); Stage 4 (effective breastfeeding offer). A comparison was carried out between the groups regarding the number of days in each phase. Data were statistically analyzed using the independent t-test, with significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the studied parameters. Breast feeding was equally accepted by newborns in the cup and the bottle groups. CONCLUSION: Breast feeding can be equally accepted, regardless the alternative <b>feeding</b> form used (<b>cup</b> or bottle), provided that there is adequate Speech-Language Pathology monitoring and encouragement to breastfeeding at an early age...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-The study {{determined}} {{the efficacy of}} protocols employed in replacement/artificial feeding using commercial infant formula. The study {{was carried out in}} the different suburban locations of Harare, Zimbabwe. A sample size of 20 mothers/caregivers giving commercial infant formula to their babies at between 0 - 6 months was targeted; convenience and snowball sampling techniques were used to identify the participants. Interviews using a structured questionnaire were conducted and complemented by direct observation of the participants as they prepared the infant formula. The results were tallied against a checklist of recommended practices and label instructions. The results established that there were short falls in the preparation procedures as employed by the caregivers, mainly the mixing order of powder and water, temperature of the water for reconstitution and handling of left over formula after feed; 50 percent of caregivers were not adhering to the label instructions as given by the manufacturers and to recommendations proposed by World Health Organisation. Poor hand washing was indicative in 80 percent of cases, bottle feeding was predominant (n = 16) compared to <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> (n = 4) and the population practicing artificial feeding were mostly the young (90 %), married (80 %), educated (100 %) and working group (90 %). The researcher recommends that health providers strengthen efforts to ensure that adequate information /counselling and consistent advice of optimal benefit to the infant-mother pair be given and that the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, Nutrition unit must strictly monitor the activities and the information given out by infant formula manufacturers as stipulated by the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and also giving them the responsibility of following up on the appropriate use of their products...|$|R
50|$|The baby nursing {{from his}} or her own mother is the most common way of obtaining breast milk, but the milk can be pumped and then fed by baby bottle, cup and/or spoon, supplementation drip system, or {{nasogastric}} tube. In preterm children who do not have the ability to suck during their early days of life, avoiding bottles and tubes, and use of <b>cups</b> to <b>feed</b> expressed milk and other supplements is reported to result in better breastfeeding extent and duration subsequently. Breast milk can be supplied by a woman other than the baby's mother, either via donated pumped milk (generally from a milk bank or via informal milk donation), or when a woman nurses a child other than her own at her breast, a practice known as wetnursing.|$|R
40|$|Background: Preterm infants have an {{immature}} sucking {{behavior and}} the capacity to be exclusively breastfed may be reduced for a period of weeks or months, depending on gestational age. Nipple shields have been used, not only as a device to help mothers with sore nipples, but also to facilitate the infant’s latch on to the breast. However, the benefits of using nipple shields have been debated. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore perceptions and experiences of using a nipple shield among parents and staff in neonatal units in Sweden and England. Methods: An ethnographic study was undertaken where observations and interviews were conducted in four neonatal units in Sweden and England. The data were analyzed using a thematic networks analysis. Result: The global theme was developed and named, ‘Nipple shield in a liminal time’. This comprised of two organizing themes: ‘Relational breastfeeding’ and ‘Progression’. ‘Relational breastfeeding’ was underpinned by the basic themes, ‘good enough breast’, ‘something in between’ and ‘tranquil moment’. ‘Progression’ was underpinned by the basic themes, ‘learning quicker’, ‘short-term solution’ and ‘rescue remedy’. Although breastfeeding was seen primarily as a nutritive transaction, the relational aspects of breastfeeding were of crucial importance. These two organizing themes show the tension between acknowledging the relational aspects of breastfeeding and yet facilitating or supporting the progression of breastfeeding in the period from tube <b>feeding</b> or <b>cup</b> <b>feeding</b> to breastfeeding. It is a liminal time as mothers and their infants are “in between” phases and the outcome, in terms of breastfeeding, is yet to be realized. Conclusion: This study demonstrates parents’ and staffs’ perceptions of the nipple shield as a short term solution to help initiation of breastfeeding but also as a barrier between the mother and infant. It is important that the mother and baby’s own particular needs are taken into account, in a person-centred way and on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, we need to emphasise the importance of the ‘relational’ whilst understanding the need for ‘progression’. Holding these in balance may be the key to appropriate use of the nipple shield...|$|R

50|$|Newborn parenting, {{is where}} the {{responsibilities}} of parenthood begins. A newborn's basic needs are food, sleep, comfort and cleaning which the parent provides. An infant's only form of communication is crying, and attentive parents will begin to recognize different types of crying which represent different needs such as hunger, discomfort, boredom, or loneliness. Newborns and young infants require feedings every few hours which is disruptive to adult sleep cycles. They respond enthusiastically to soft stroking, cuddling and caressing. Gentle {{rocking back and forth}} often calms a crying infant, as do massages and warm baths. Newborns may comfort themselves by sucking their thumb or a pacifier. The need to suckle is instinctive and allows newborns to feed. Breastfeeding is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations. If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is a common alternative. Other alternatives include feeding breastmilk or formula with a <b>cup,</b> spoon, <b>feeding</b> syringe, or nursing supplementer.|$|R

40|$|Video {{playback}} {{is becoming}} a common method for manipulating social stimuli in experiments. Parid tits {{are one of the}} most commonly studied groups of wild birds. However, it is not yet clear if tits respond to video playback or how their behavioural responses should be measured. Behaviours may also differ depending on what they observe demonstrators encountering. Here we present blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) videos of demonstrators discovering palatable or aversive prey (injected with bitter-tasting Bitrex) from coloured <b>feeding</b> <b>cups.</b> First we quantify variation in demonstrators' responses to the prey items: aversive prey provoked high rates of beak wiping and head shaking. We then show that focal blue tits respond differently to the presence of a demonstrator on a video screen, depending on whether demonstrators discover palatable or aversive prey. Focal birds faced the video screen more during aversive prey presentations, and made more head turns. Regardless of prey type, focal birds also hopped more frequently during the presence of a demonstrator (compared to a control video of a different coloured <b>feeding</b> <b>cup</b> in an empty cage). Finally, we tested if demonstrators' behaviour affected focal birds' food preferences by giving individuals a choice to forage from the same cup as a demonstrator, or from the cup in the control video. We found that only half of the individuals made their choice in accordance to social information in the videos, i. e., their foraging choices were not different from random. Individuals that chose in accordance with a demonstrator, however, made their choice faster than individuals that chose an alternative cup. Together, our results suggest that video playback can provide social cues to blue tits, but individuals vary greatly in how they use this information in their foraging decisions...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Mensurar e comparar a atividade dos músculos masseter, {{temporal}} e bucinador em diferentes métodos de alimentação de lactentes. MÉTODO: Estudo transversal, com participação de 60 lactentes nascidos a termo e sem intercorrências, entre 2 e 3 meses de idade, divididos em três grupos: 1) aleitamento materno exclusivo; 2) aleitamento misto com uso de mamadeira; e 3) aleitamento materno exclusivo com uso de copo. Foi realizada eletromiografia com eletrodos de captação de superfície durante a alimentação. O teste estatístico utilizado é o Kruskal-Wallis, complementado com as comparações múltiplas entre pares de grupos, e todas as discussões são realizadas no nível de 5 % de significância. RESULTADOS: Verificam-se maiores resultados no grupo de aleitamento materno em relação ao grupo de aleitamento por mamadeira, tanto na amplitude quanto na média de contração do músculo masseter. No que se refere ao músculo temporal, há resultados maiores na amplitude do grupo de aleitamento materno e na média de contração do grupo de aleitamento por copo, quando comparados ao grupo de aleitamento por mamadeira. Quanto ao músculo bucinador, observam-se resultados maiores no grupo de aleitamento por mamadeira com relação ao aleitamento materno, sendo que tal diferença ocorre apenas na amplitude de contração. CONCLUSÃO: As semelhanças entre a atividade muscular do grupo de aleitamento materno e aleitamento por copo permitem sugerir o uso do copo como método alternativo na alimentação de lactentes, ao contrário do aleitamento por mamadeira, devido à hiperfunção do músculo bucinador, podendo resultar em alterações motoras orais e das funções neurovegetativas. OBJECTIVE: To {{measure and}} compare {{the activity of the}} masseter, temporalis and buccinator muscles in different infant feeding methods METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 60 full-term infants with no intercurrent diseases, aged between two and three months, classified into the following groups: 1) exclusive breastfeeding; 2) breastfeeding plus bottle-feeding; and 3) exclusive breastfeeding plus <b>cup</b> <b>feeding.</b> Surface electromyography was performed during infant feeding. The Krushal-Wallis test was used, complemented by multiple paired comparisons of the groups. A 5 % significance level was chosen for the tests. RESULTS: Statistically higher results were verified in the breastfeeding group in relation to the bottle-feeding one, both in the range of movement and the mean contraction of the masseter. With regard to the temporalis muscle, statistically higher results were found in the breastfeeding group comparatively to the bottle-feeding one. As to the buccinator muscle, statistically higher results were observed in the breastfeeding group in relation to the bottle-feeding one, although in this case, the difference concerned only the range of contraction. CONCLUSION: The similarities between the muscle activity in the breastfeeding and in the cup-feeding groups suggests that cup-feeding can be used as an alternative infant feeding method, being better than bottle-feeding, due to the hyperactivity of the buccinator muscle, which could result in changes to the structural growth and development of the stomatognathic system functions...|$|R
