There exists a trusted sender Alice who wishes to deliver a message m over a single channel to the <b>correct</b> <b>devices.</b> There also exists a malicious user Carol who controls the t Byzantine devices and uses them to disrupt the communication channel. For a constant k>= 2, the <b>correct</b> and Byzantine <b>devices</b> each possess a meager energy budget of O(n^ 1 /k), Alice and Carol each possess a limited budget of Õ(n^ 1 /k), and sending or listening in a slot incurs unit cost. This general setup captures the inherent challenges of guaranteeing communication despite scarce resources and attacks on the network. Given this Alice versus Carol scenario, we ask: Is communication of m feasible and, if so, at what cost? We develop a protocol which, for an arbitrarily small constant ϵ> 0, ensures that at least (1 -ϵ) n <b>correct</b> <b>devices</b> receive m with high probability. Furthermore, if Carol's devices expend T energy jamming the channel, then Alice and the <b>correct</b> <b>devices</b> each spend only Õ(T^ 1 /(k+ 1)).

40|$|In this paper, an {{information}} theoretic approach {{is applied to}} analyze {{the performance of a}} decentralized control system. The control system plays the role of a <b>correcting</b> <b>device</b> which decreases the uncertainties associated with state variables of a production line by applying an appropriate ``correcting signal' ' for each deviation from the target. In particular, a distributed feedback control policy is considered to govern a transfer production line, which consists of machines and bu€ers and processes a single part type in response to a stochastic demand. It is shown how the uncertainty of the demand propagates dynamically into the production system, causing uncertainties associated with bu€er levels and machine production rates. The paper proposes upper estimates for these uncertainties as functions of the demand variance, parameters of the distributed controllers and some physical properties of the production line. The bounds are based on dynamic entropy measures of the system state and the control variables. Some practical implications into the area of decentralized controller design are proposed, {{an information}}-economical analysis is presented and a numerical study is performed. 1.

40|$|The study {{compared}} {{two types}} of self-correcting feedback commonly found in so-called auto-instructional aids intended to facilitate the acquisition of association responses in young children. To study this effect two manually operated aids, differing only on the covertness or overtness of a physical linkage clue (as in a jigsaw puzzle), were designed and used {{in the teaching of}} eight novel stimulus pairs. The sample consisted of 24 seven year-old grade one subjects (12 M, 12 F) randomly selected from a middle-class socioeconomic infant school. These were randomly allocated to the four cells of the study's 2 x 2 factorial design, independent variables being type of feedback and sex. Dependent variables were the number of errors occurring during learning and the number of criterion responses (6 consecutively correct) to any one stimulus pair during immediate retention testing or delayed retention testing occurring 24 hours later. An investigatory probe was also conducted into the time factor during learning. It was hypothesized that more errors would occur during learning under the covert physical linkage (CPL) condition than under the overt physical linkage (OPL). It was also hypothesized that the CPL <b>correcting</b> <b>device</b> would produce more effective learning than the OPL device when measured during both immediate and delayed retention testing. No significant sex difference in learning for both the CPL and OPL conditions was hypothesized. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance was applied to the results of each independent variable. These analyses showed that, significantly more errors occurred under the CPL condition than under the OPL condition (p = 0. 0000 ****); the CPL condition produced significantly more learning than the OPL condition when measured during immediate retention testing (p = 0. 0195 *) as well as during delayed retention testing (p = 0. 0060 **); a significant interaction effect was evident when measuring learning during immediate retention testing (p = 0. 0382 *). This latter effect was a result of learning by male CPL subjects being significantly higher than that of CPL females (p = 0. 0149 *). Probes conducted on the number of errors during, and time of, each learning trial revealed that female subjects, while following a similar learning pattern to that of males, took longer and made more errors initially during the experiment than males. Possible explanations for this are discussed. It was concluded that auto-instructional aids containing CPL feedback facilitate the acquisition of association responses in both male and female infant school children by forcing attention to the critical stimuli. The assumption that OPL feedback facilitates such learning was not supported by this study. The irrelevant stimulus, the physical linkage clue, was seen as a major distractor to the learning task as almost no learning occurred under this condition for both males and females. Some implications were discussed...|$|E
