40|$|Proteome {{profiling}} of <b>crude</b> <b>serum</b> is {{a challenging}} task {{due to the}} wide dynamic range of protein concentrations {{and the presence of}} high-abundance proteins, which cover > 90 % of the total protein mass in serum. Peptide fractionation on strong cation exchange, weak anion exchange in the electrostatic repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) mode, RP C- 18 at pH 2. 5 (low pH), fused-core fluorinated at pH 2. 5, and RP C- 18 at pH 9. 7 (high pH) stationary phases resulted in two to three times more identified proteins and three to four times more identified peptides in comparison with 1 D nanoChip-LC-MS/MS quadrupole TOF analysis (45 proteins, 185 peptides). The largest number of peptides and proteins was identified after prefractionation in the ERLIC mode due to the more uniform distribution of peptides among the collected fractions and on the RP column at high pH due to the high efficiency of RP separations and the complementary selectivity of both techniques to low-pH RP chromatography.

The quantification of target proteins in complex media such as serum remains a challenge for most technologies such as mass spectrometry, ELISA and western blot.

We report the development of a universal qIPCR-based platform for the reproducible detection of dual affinity-tagged protein analytes in crude complex matrices such as serum and cell culture media or lysates. The system uses a couple of high-affinity antibodies against two affinity tags (GFP and HA) for the detection of dual-tagged proteins.

In this retrospective study of 1, 166 patients with no previous renal insufficiency, who were admitted to a postsurgical intensive care unit (ICU) over a 2 -year period, the incidence of AKI was 7. 5 %. Multivariate analysis identified American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, Revised Cardiac Risk Index, high-risk surgery and congestive heart disease as preoperative AKI risk factors. AKI was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality (odds ratio = 3. 12, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 41 to 6. 93; P = 0. 005), and was associated with higher severity of illness scores (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), longer ICU length of stay, higher ICU mortality, increased hospital mortality and higher mortality at 6 -month follow up.

Despite significant efforts, the lack of fully validated biomarkers enabling diagnosis, classification, and monitoring of disease activity represents significant unmet clinical needs. In this discovery study, we have {{for the first time}} used recombinant antibody microarrays for miniaturized, multiplexed serum protein profiling of SLE and SSc, targeting mainly immunoregulatory proteins.

Further, biomarker signatures differentiating SLE versus SSc were demonstrated, and the observed differences increased with severity of SLE. In contrast, the data showed that the serum profiles of SSc versus healthy controls were more similar.

The CoLaus Study is a cross-sectional examination survey in a random sample of 6067 Caucasians aged 35 - 75 years in Lausanne, Switzerland. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed using a validated oscillometric device. Anthropometric parameters were also measured, including body composition, using electrical bioimpedance. <b>Crude</b> <b>serum</b> levels of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were positively and IL- 1 β (IL- 1 β) negatively (P< 0. 001 for all values), associated with BP. For IL- 6, IL- 1 β and TNF-α, the association disappeared in multivariable analysis, largely explained by differences in age and body mass index, in particular fat mass. On the contrary, hsCRP remained independently and positively associated with systolic (β (95 % confidence interval) : 1. 15 (0. 64; 1. 65); P< 0. 001) and diastolic (0. 75 (0. 42; 1. 08); P< 0. 001) BP. Relationships of hsCRP, IL- 6 and TNF-α with BP tended to be stronger in women than in men, partly related to the difference in fat mass, yet the interaction between sex and IL- 6 persisted after correction for all tested confounders. In the general population, the associations between inflammatory biomarkers and rising levels of BP are mainly driven by age and fat mass.

40|$|Two instrumental/assay schemes {{based on}} {{capillary}} electrophoresis (CE) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection for sensitive and specific analysis of compounds within biosamples were designed and characterized. Ultraviolet (UV) excitation for LIF detection of underivatized compounds, termed laser-induced-native fluorescence (LINF), represents a simple, sensitive and selective method for detecting CE separated compounds that fluoresce appreciably when excited by UV radiation. A major drawback of CE-LINF systems, however, {{has been the}} expense and {{the complexity of the}} laser required for excitation in the deep UV wavelength range of 200 - 300 nm. To this end, the performance of a relatively inexpensive, low-power, pulsed KrF laser operating at 248 nm in a pseudo-continuous wave mode was evaluated as an excitation source for native fluorescence detection of tryptophan. On-column LINF detection limits in the low nanomolar range are obtained for tryptophan with the KrF source, which is similar to that achieved by LINF detectors that use costly large frame frequency-doubled argon ion lasers. The developed CE-LINF instrument is further applied towards the selective profiling of tryptophan-containing proteins and peptides in human serum and saliva, and catecholamines in human urine illustrating the potential use of this system for diagnosing various disease states.

40|$|Mammalian serum and plasma contain {{high levels}} of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific {{phospholipase}} D (GPI-PLD). Previous studies with <b>crude</b> <b>serum</b> or partially purified GPI-PLD have shown that this enzyme is capable of degrading the GPI anchor of several purified detergent-solubilized cell surface proteins yet is unable to act on GPI-anchored proteins located in intact cells. Treatment of intact ROS 17 / 2. 8, WISH or HeLa cells (or membrane fractions prepared from them) with GPI-PLD purified from bovine serum by immunoaffinity chromatography gave no detectable release of alkaline phosphatase into the medium. However, when membranes were treated with GPI-PLD {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 % Nonidet P- 40 substantial GPI anchor degradation (as measured by Triton X- 114 phase separation) was observed. The mechanism of this stimulatory effect of detergent was further investigated using [3 H]myristate-labelled variant surface glycoprotein and human placental alkaline phosphatase reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. As with the cell membranes the reconstituted substrates exhibited marked resistance to the action of purified GPI-PLD which could be overcome by the inclusion of Nonidet P- 40. Similar results were obtained when crude bovine serum was used as the source of GPI-PLD. These data indicate that the resistance of cell membranes to the action of GPI-PLD is not entirely due to the action of serum or membrane-associated inhibitory factors. A more likely explanation is that, in common with many other eukaryotic phospholipases, the action of GPI-PLD is restricted by the physical state of the phospholipid bilayer in which the substrates are embedded. These data may account for the ability of endothelial and blood cells to retain GPI-anchored proteins on their surfaces in spite of the {{high levels of}} GPI-PLD present in plasma...|$|E

The performance of both instruments was evaluated by assessment of the number of peaks detected in the two sample sets, the biomarker potential and reproducibility of generated peak clusters, and the number of peaks detected following serum fractionation. Results We could not confirm the claimed improved performance of the new PCS 4000 instrument, as assessed by the number of peaks detected, the biomarker potential and the reproducibility. However, the PCS 4000 instrument did prove to be of superior performance in peak detection following profiling of serum fractions. Conclusion As serum fractionation facilitates detection of low abundant proteins through reduction of the dynamic range of serum proteins, it is now increasingly applied in the search for new potential biomarkers. Hence, although the new PCS 4000 instrument did not differ from the old PBS-IIc apparatus in the analysis of <b>crude</b> <b>serum,</b> its superior performance after serum fractionation does hold promise for improved biomarker detection and identification. </p...|$|E
40|$|Lower {{intake of}} the {{essential}} trace element selenium may be {{a risk factor for}} prostate cancer and other cancers. In the United States, many racial disparities in cancer incidence, such as the 61 % higher incidence of prostate cancer among Blacks relative to Whites, remain unexplained. Using data from a large, nationally representative survey, the authors explored Black/White differences in serum selenium concentration. Mean serum selenium concentrations, both crude and adjusted for known predictors of serum selenium, were determined for 10, 779 Black and White males and females aged 12 years who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 – 1994). <b>Crude</b> mean <b>serum</b> selenium concentrations were 126. 35 ng/ml for Whites and 118. 76 ng/ml (~ 6 % lower) for Blacks. Adjustment for known serum selenium predictors, including a proxy for residence at the county level, reduced the racial disparity, although concentrations remained approximately 3 % lower in Blacks than in Whites of both sexes (p < 0. 0001). The observation that Blacks had lower unadjusted and adjusted serum selenium concentrations relative to Whites is intriguing, given the racial disparity in incidence of prostate cancer and other cancers.

40|$|SUMMARY The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia spp. and risk factors for exposure in a restricted population of dogs, horses, and humans highly exposed to tick bites in a Brazilian rural settlement using a commercial ELISA rapid test and two indirect immunofluorescent assays (IFA) with E. canis and E. chaffeensis <b>crude</b> antigens. <b>Serum</b> samples from 132 dogs, 16 horses and 100 humans were used. Fifty-six out of 132 (42. 4 %) dogs were seropositive for E. canis. Dogs > one year {{were more likely to be}} seropositive for E. canis than dogs &# 8804; one year (p = 0. 0051). Ten/ 16 (62. 5 %) and 8 / 16 (50 %) horses were seropositive by the commercial ELISA and IFA, respectively. Five out of 100 (5 %) humans were seropositive for E. canis and E. chaffeensis. Rhipicephalus sanguineus (n = 291, 97. 98 %) on dogs and Amblyomma cajennense (n = 25, 96. 15 %) on horses were the most common ticks found. In conclusion, anti-Ehrlichia spp. antibodies were found in horses; however, the lack of a molecular characterization precludes any conclusion regarding the agent involved. Additionally, the higher seroprevalence of E. canis in dogs and the evidence of anti-Ehrlichia spp. antibodies in humans suggest that human cases of ehrlichiosis in Brazil might be caused by E. canis, or other closely related species...|$|R
40|$|The limulus {{gelation}} assay {{was utilized}} to investigate endotoxin inactivation {{by a number}} of antibiotics in vitro. Endotoxin activity was sharply reduced by polymyxin B and sodium colistimethate. The effect of the polymyxin was not significantly inhibited by 0. 001 M calcium or 90 % <b>serum.</b> <b>Crude</b> endotoxins from a variety of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, including several not previously studied, could be inactivated 1 or more logs by as little as 1 μg of polymyxin B per ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis endotoxin was poorly detoxified. A 10, 000 -fold range in the relative susceptibility of different endotoxins to inactivation by polymyxin B was found. The endotoxin most susceptible to polymyxin B was derived from an organism resistant to polymyxin B by disk sensitivity testing, suggesting that the bacteriocidal and endotoxin detoxifying properties of polymyxin need not be directly related...|$|R
40|$|The first {{antivenom}} {{was prepared}} by Calmette in 1894. More {{than a century}} later, {{it is still the}} only specific treatment for envenoming. The methods currently used by almost all antivenom producers worldwide to isolate and concentrate antivenom antibodies and their enzymatically derived fragments are improvements of those originally developed by Pope in 1938. Several new alternatives have been proposed to produce F(ab') 2 or Fab antivenoms to improve their purity, neutralizing potency, and safety and to overcome the problems encountered in the production protocols based on ammonium sulfate precipitation of equine immunoglobulin. These include complete or partial modifications in the antivenom production regarding animal producers (ovine, laying hens [...] .), immunization protocols, <b>crude</b> <b>serum</b> preparation and/or purification procedures concerning antibody extraction (PEG, caprylic acid, ion-exchange chromatography or immunoaffinity chromatography), and cleavage conditions (pepsin, papain [...] .). In Tunisia, antivenom has been produced since the 1950 's. Constant improvements and standardization of all the steps involved in antivenom production, purification, and quality control have resulted in a pure, safe, and efficient F(ab') 2 product with no side effects when used intravenously, and with a high seroneutralization yield, {{as a result of the}} high toxin specific F(ab') 2 concentration. The real impact of the new or modified procedures is a substantial increase in the cost of an antivenom dose. The quality is similar to that of the old procedure when its production was accurately standardized, optimized, correctly conducted and controlled. In addition, severe side effects have been reported after application of either equine F(ab') 2 or ovine Fab antivenoms purified by the new methods (i. e. ion-exchange chromatography and immunoaffinity chromatography). Consequently, the introduction of these methods in developing countries still needs justification...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nonunion is {{a failure}} of healing {{following}} a bone fracture. Its physiopathology remains partially unclear and the discovery of new mediators could promote the understanding of bone healing. Methods: Thirty-three atrophic nonunion (NU) patients that failed to demonstrate any radiographic improvement for 6 consecutive months were recruited for providing serum samples. Thirty-five healthy volunteers (HV) served as the control group. Proteomics studies were performed using SELDI-TOF-MS and 2 D-DIGE approaches, associated or not with Proteominer® preprocessing, to highlight biomarkers specific to atrophic nonunion pathology. Peak intensities were analyzed by two statistical approaches, a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests (univariate approach) and a machine-learning algorithm called extra-trees (multivariate approach). Validation of highlighted biomarkers was performed by alternative approaches such as microfluidic LC-MS/MS, nephelometry, western blotting or ELISA assays. Results: From the 35 HV and 33 NU <b>crude</b> <b>serum</b> samples and Proteominer® eluates, 136 spectra were collected by SELDI-TOF-MS using CM 10 and IMAC-Cu 2 + ProteinChip arrays, and 665 peaks were integrated for extra-trees multivariate analysis. Accordingly, seven biomarkers and several variants were identified as potential NU biomarkers. Their levels of expression {{were found to be}} down- or up-regulated in serum of HV vs NU. These biomarkers are inter-α-trypsin inhibitor H 4, hepcidin, S 100 A 8, S 100 A 9, glycated hemoglobin β subunit, PACAP related peptide, complement C 3 α-chain. 2 D-DIGE experiment allowed to detect 14 biomarkers as being down- or up-regulated in serum of HV vs NU including a cleaved fragment of apolipoprotein A-IV, apolipoprotein E, complement C 3 and C 6. Several biomarkers such as hepcidin, complement C 6, S 100 A 9, apolipoprotein E, complement C 3 and C 4 were confirmed by an alternative approach as being up-regulated in serum of NU patients compared to HV controls. Conclusion: Two proteomics approaches were used to identify new biomarkers up- or down-regulated in the nonunion pathology, which are involved in bone turn-over, inflammation, innate immunity, glycation and lipid metabolisms. High expression of hepcidin or S 100 A 8 /S 100 A 9 by myeloid cells and the presence of advanced glycation end products and complement factors could be the result of a longstanding inflammatory process. Blocking macrophage activation and/or TLR 4 receptor could accelerate healing of fractured bone in at-risk patients. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to develop and evaluate a semi-purified diet suitable for fiber related studies without negative impacts on performance, serum biochemistry and intestinal morphology of growing Japanese quails. Total of 144 Japanese quail chicks were used in a factorial arrangement using completely randomized design with 6 treatments, 4 replicates of 6 quails in each replicate. The levels of dietary crude fiber (3. 37 %, 1. 18 % and 0. 08 %, respectively) viz. high, medium and low crude fiber diets. The dietary supplementation levels of a commercial feed additive concentrate fiber-Arbocel were considered 0 and 3 %. The medium crude fiber semi-purified diet produced acceptable growth performances comparable to conventional high <b>crude</b> fiber diet. <b>Serum</b> triglyceride concentration {{was influenced by the}} levels of dietary crude fiber and the highest level was related to low crude fiber diet which was significantly different from high crude fiber diet (...|$|R
40|$|Miniaturized (Ø 10 μm), {{multiplexed}} (> 5 -plex), and high-density (> 100 000 spots cm(- 2)) antibody arrays {{will play}} a key role in generating protein expression profiles in health and disease. However, producing such antibody arrays is challenging, and it is the type and range of available spotters which set the stage. This pilot study explored the use of a novel microspotting tool, Bioplume(TM) -consisting of an array of micromachined silicon cantilevers with integrated microfluidic channels-to produce miniaturized, multiplexed, and high-density planar recombinant antibody arrays for protein expression profiling which targets <b>crude,</b> directly labelled <b>serum.</b> The results demonstrated that 16 -plex recombinant antibody arrays could be produced-based on miniaturized spot features (78. 5 um(2), Ø 10 μm) at a 7 - 125 -times increased spot density (250 000 spots cm(- 2)), interfaced with a fluorescent-based read-out. This prototype platform was found to display adequate reproducibility (spot-to-spot) and an assay sensitivity in the pM range.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{duration}} of the first and the second lactation, total and daily milk yield and chemical composition in Serbian White goat. Standard examination methods were used. Total and daily milk yields were significantly higher in the second lactation. Total solids, fat, lactose, <b>crude</b> protein, casein, <b>serum</b> protein and ash content in both lactations were similar and did not show statistically differences. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) content was 70. 92 % in the first lactation and 72. 01 % in the second; unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) content was 26. 73 % and 23. 50 %, respectively. Unsaturated and saturated fatty acid relation was 0. 38 in the first lactation and 0. 33 in the second; polyunsaturated (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) relation was 0. 13 and 0. 13, respectively. It was concluded that Serbian White goat in half-intensive breeding system can produce milk of good quality for consumption as well as good raw material for cheese production...|$|R
40|$|Octyl-functionalized hybrid {{magnetic}} mesoporous (Fe(3) O(4) center dot nSiO(2) center dot meso-hybrid-C 8) microspheres were synthesized {{and applied}} in the isolation and pre-concentration of low-concentration peptides prior to direct analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Such microspheres possess high surface area (324 m(2) /g), hydrophobic group (C 8), relatively large pore volume (0. 304 cm(3) /g), uniform pore diameter (similar to 3. 7 nm), and magnetic responsivity, which make them a simple and efficient kind of adsorbent for the enrichment of low-concentration peptides. For bovine serum albumin (BSA, 15 fmol mu L(- 1)) digest, after concentration by Fe(3) O(4) center dot nSiO(2) center dot meso-hybrid-C 8 microspheres, the enrichment performance was evidently better than those obtained by solvent evaporation and C 8 -functionalized magnetic particles, and comparable to those obtained by commercial Anchor chip target and ZipTipC 18 pipette tip. Such microspheres were further {{applied in the}} enrichment of the tryptic digests of rat cerebellum proteins and endogenous peptides of <b>crude</b> human <b>serum,</b> and more peaks with higher signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio were obtained than before pre-concentration. Furthermore, the pre-concentration reproducibility of magnetic microspheres for biological samples was good, and the limit of detection (LOD) for BSA digests by MALDI-TOF MS was decreased {{by at least one}} order of magnitude compared with that obtained without pre-concentration. All the above-mentioned results indicate that the synthesized Fe(3) O(4) center dot nSiO(2) center dot meso-hybrid-C 8 microspheres are promising for the enrichment of low-concentration peptides from complex biosamples.
