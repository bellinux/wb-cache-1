He {{was one of the}} first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely.

This paper describes an approach to <b>cultural</b> <b>systems</b> in {{which can be used}} to frame our understanding of implicit norms with respect to CSR, and demonstrates how these norms result in different practices of communicating CSR in the Wal-Mart and Maersk websites...|$|R

Kulick addresses the need for consideration of the role of sexuality in sexual identity, unlike some lavender linguists who neglect sexuality in favor of linguistic features that might be more likely than sexuality to legitimize gay identity.|$|E

2500|$|While {{coming to}} {{question}} the official ideology, Ornea was already an opponent of the Romanian regime's methods. Around 1970, as nationalism, national communism and Protochronism were being imposed on {{an increasing number of}} publications, Ornea joined the faction of professionals who attempted to promote a different line from within the <b>cultural</b> <b>system.</b> Reviewing this debate, literary critic Pia Brînzeu argued that Ornea, with Manolescu, Andrei Pleșu and Adrian Marino (who [...] "appreciated Western values and favored the acceptance of some advanced social and cultural issues"), represented [...] "the opposition" [...] to communist or nationalist magazines such as Flacăra, Luceafărul and Săptămîna ("which insisted on maintaining Romania's isolation from Europe"). American researcher Katherine Verdery lists Ornea, Iorgulescu, Pleșu, Manolescu and Ștefănescu among those who [...] "took a visible stand" [...] against officially condoned Protochronism (a group also including, in her opinion, Iorgulescu, Ovid Crohmălniceanu, Gheorghe Grigurcu, Norman Manea, Alexandru Paleologu and Eugen Simion). The disadvantage for Ornea's camp, Brînzeu writes, was in that its members generally [...] "could not voice their opinions aloud". Verdery however singles out Ornea's [...] "antiprotochronist" [...] columns, which condemned the practice of prefacing reprints of consecrated scientific works with messages with retrospectively attached them to Protochronist tenets (such as it was with a 1987 edition of Nicolae Iorga's Evoluția ideii de liberatate, [...] "The Evolution of the Idea of Liberty", which the editor Ilie Bădescu had prefaced with a Protochronist manifesto). Nevertheless, literary historian Florin Mihăilescu argues, Protochronist ideologue Edgar Papu abusively cited Ornea's texts, alongside those of many other figures outside the national communist circles, in such manner as to appear that they too supported Protochronist theories.|$|E
2500|$|From that point, {{progress}} proceeded rapidly, {{not only}} in the decipherment of the Maya glyphs, but also towards the construction of a new, historically based understanding of Maya civilization. Scholars such as J. Kathryn Josserand, Nick Hopkins and others published findings that helped to construct a Mayan vocabulary. In 1988, Wolfgang Gockel published a translation of the Palenque inscriptions based on a morphemic rather than syllabic interpretation of the glyphs. The [...] "old school" [...] continued to resist the results of the new scholarship for some time. A decisive event which helped to turn the tide in favor of the new approach occurred in 1986, at an exhibition entitled [...] "". It was organized by InterCultura and the Kimbell Art Museum and curated by Schele and Yale art historian Mary Miller. This exhibition and attendant catalogue—and international publicity—revealed to a wide audience the new world which had latterly been opened up by progress in decipherment of Maya hieroglyphics. Not only could a real history of ancient America now be read and understood, but the light it shed on the material remains of the Maya showed them to be real, recognisable individuals. They stood revealed as a people with a history like that of all other human societies: full of wars, dynastic struggles, shifting political alliances, complex religious and artistic systems, expressions of personal property and ownership and the like. Moreover, the new interpretation, as the exhibition demonstrated, made sense out of many works of art whose meaning had been unclear and showed how the material culture of the Maya represented a fully integrated <b>cultural</b> <b>system</b> and world view. Gone was the old Thompson view of the Maya as peaceable astronomers without conflict or other attributes characteristic of most human societies.|$|E
