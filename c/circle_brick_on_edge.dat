40|$|Abstract: Fly ash brick (FAB) is a {{building}} material, specifically masonry units, containing class C fly ash and water, compressed at 28 MPa and cured for 24 hrs in a 66 °C steam bath, then toughened {{with an air}} entrainment agent, the bricks last for more than 100 freeze-thaw cycles. Owing to the high concentration of calcium oxide in class C fly ash, the brick is described as "self-cementing". The manufacturing method saves energy, reduces mercury pollution, and costs 20 % less than traditional clay brick manufacturing. In the present study three types of FAB masonry referred as Type A (conventional masonry in English bond), Type B (odd course of <b>bricks</b> <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> and even course on bed) and Type C (all <b>bricks</b> <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> in Flemish bond) had been considered. Since Type B and C masonry consist of inside cavity {{that resulted in the}} saving of number of bricks by 25 %. The reduction in the manufacturing cost of fly ash bricks and saving in the number of bricks resulted in the considerable reduction in the overall cost of masonry structure...|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the core are of cavity <b>brick,</b> laid <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> in {{stretcher}} bond with a header brick {{every two or three}} bricks. The brick work pattern is a variation of the Rat-trap or Chinese bond with the <b>bricks</b> laid <b>on</b> <b>edge,</b> and laid with two stretcher bricks then one header brick joining the two skins of the wall together making an approximately 50 millimetre cavity. The walls are painted on the outside and rendered on the inside. Many of the exterior window and door frames are of painted timber but some have been replaced with aluminium frames and flyscreens.|$|R

50|$|There is {{a mostly}} {{complete}} late medieval lime kiln on Ashby Road, Sully. Composed {{of stone and}} brick it is 40 feet long and 18 feet high by 13 feet wide. Buttressed with three <b>brick</b> <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> archways and draught holes on the south elevation. Five iron pegs are inserted {{into the face of}} the kiln. Briarside and Middleton Cottage on Cog Road is a yeoman's cottage built in the mid 16th century with later 18th century additions. The cottage contains a Tudor-style archway and an original circular stone staircase. The remains of the village mill can be found at Hayes Farm on Hayes Road.|$|R
50|$|The regenerators are the {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} furnace and consist of fire-brick flues filled with <b>bricks</b> set <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> and arranged {{in such a way}} as to have a great number of small passages between them. The bricks absorb most of the heat from the outgoing waste gases and return it later to the incoming cold gases for combustion.|$|R
50|$|This was {{designed}} to replace the old charity houses in 1842 which were in very bad repair. The front is symmetrical on either sides with black <b>bricks</b> <b>on</b> the <b>edge</b> it is made of normal sandstone, painted white. The Almshouse was not always white. The original sandstone was crumbling away, so it was rendered. This explains why the white walls {{stand out from the}} cornerstones instead of the other way around.|$|R
50|$|The Hotel Bristol was {{demolished}} in {{the mid-1970s}} in several stages as construction of the 30-story Bristol Center advanced.On 3 May 1974 sanitation workers performing an excavation in Calle Buenos Aires rediscovered the tunnel between the annex and the dining hall. It had been built of <b>bricks</b> laid <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> painted lime yellow.The floor had mosaics, apparently Italian.The passage was soon sealed again.The final stage of the demolition began in August 1974 with removal of the dome at San Martín and Entre Ríos.|$|R
50|$|Bethesda Terrace is on two levels, {{united by}} two grand {{staircases}} and a lesser one that passes under Terrace Drive. They provide passage southward to the Elkan Naumburg bandshell and The Mall {{at the center}} of the park. The upper terrace flanks the 72nd Street Cross Drive and the lower terrace provides a podium for viewing the Lake. The mustard-olive colored carved stone is New Brunswick sandstone, with a harder stone for cappings, with granite steps and landings, and herringbone paving of Roman <b>brick</b> laid <b>on</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bricks {{made from}} adobe are usually made by {{pressing}} the mud mixture {{into an open}} timber frame. In North America, the brick is typically about 25 by 36 cm in size. The mixture is molded into the frame, which is then is removed after initial setting. After drying for a few hours, the <b>bricks</b> are turned <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> to finish drying. Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.|$|R
50|$|The first {{store in}} the village of Pefferlaw was built in August 1833. Soon after, Robert Johnson, brother of William, took over running the store and shortly {{thereafter}} built a large two-story red <b>brick</b> house <b>on</b> the <b>edge</b> of the bank beside the store which still stands today. The second store in Pefferlaw was built by George Johnson, son of Captain William, this in 1856.|$|R

5000|$|This once {{industrial}} town, {{like many}} such towns {{in this area}} of Scotland has seen a sharp decline of traditional industry, which has hit the town hard. In addition to coal mining, iron stone mining and textile manufacturing the town also had clay mines {{to be used in the}} areas various brickworks. To produce common red brick these brickworks were also well supplied with clay extracted from coal mine waste, available from the numerous [...] "bings" [...] throughout the valley, whereas the mined clay was required for higher quality fire <b>brick.</b> <b>On</b> the <b>edge</b> of the town lies a large chemical plant once operated by Roche, but now run by DSM, producing vitamins C and B5.|$|R
5000|$|The wakeup {{call came}} in October 1840, {{when one of the}} lunatics was killed by another in the jail. Bonham, who had become Governor by then, {{immediately}} requested that Montgomerie write [...] "a report on the number and state of the lunatics under treatment, and also suggestions for their better management". Montgomerie reported on 16 November 1840 that there were 22 insane patients and he expected that the yearly average of seventeen patients would increase with growth of the settlement. In the report, he also suggested the Lunatic Asylum be built for 24 patients and should any more room be needed, buildings would be added on. In addition, floors [...] "should be laid with <b>bricks</b> <b>on</b> <b>edge,</b> embedded in good mortar so as to admit of being washed, and prevent the patients lifting the floors, which constructed with tiles as in the Jail, they have been enabled to do so;" [...] and [...] "wood for the walls and bed places in consequence of very bad effects having arisen from patients in the Jail having destroyed the bed places and by squatting on the floor and leaning against cold walls, have in several instances cramped their limbs and stiffened their joints so as to cause lameness". Montgomerie also submitted a plan and estimate for $775.16. He did not suggest sending lunatics to India because he felt that they would feel more comfortable [...] "among their countrymen than among strangers".|$|R
40|$|In the {{standard}} DNA brick set-up, distinct 32 -nucleotide strands of single-stranded DNA are each designed to bind specifically to four other such molecules. Experimentally, {{it has been}} demonstrated that the overall yield is increased if certain <b>bricks</b> which occur <b>on</b> the outer faces of target structures are merged with adjacent bricks. However, it is not well understood by what mechanism such `boundary bricks' increase the yield, as they likely influence both the nucleation process and the final stability of the target structure. Here, we use Monte Carlo simulations with a patchy particle model of DNA bricks to investigate the role of boundary bricks in the self-assembly of complex multicomponent target structures. We demonstrate that boundary bricks lower the free-energy barrier to nucleation and that boundary <b>bricks</b> <b>on</b> <b>edges</b> stabilize the final structure. However, boundary bricks are also more prone to aggregation, as they can stabilize partially assembled intermediates. We explore some design strategies that permit us {{to benefit from the}} stabilizing role of boundary bricks whilst minimizing their ability to hinder assembly; in particular, we show that maximizing the total number of boundary bricks is not an optimal strategy.

500|$|The {{circular}} lower {{platform is}} entered through a single entrance {{on the northern}} side. Four elaborately constructed doorways lead from it to the upper platform, which {{is surrounded by a}} <b>brick</b> wall <b>on</b> its <b>edge.</b> These entrances are oriented to the four cardinal directions. The center of this platform is occupied by the stupa, which has four Buddha statues seated around it, each facing one of the entrances. Each of these statues are [...] high, and are seated on stone seats with a height of [...] each. Three concentric rows of stone columns had existed on the upper platform. Two of these rows, of which nothing remain, were within the brick wall, while the third row is just outside it. The inner row had consisted of 16 columns, the middle row of 20, and the outer row of 32. The existing stone columns of the outer ring are about [...] in height.|$|R

50|$|In 1915, the Drama League of America {{recommended}} {{the construction of}} Shakespeare gardens to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the playwright's death. Noted Chicago landscape architect and Drama League member Jens Jensen designed such a garden, and fellow member Alice Houston suggested that the Garden Club of Evanston adopt the design. Northwestern University agreed to host the garden on its campus in late 1915, and construction and planting began the following spring. To raise funds for the garden, the Garden Club hosted its first garden fair in May 1916; the fair became an annual event and is still held to this day. Planting in the garden was finished in 1920, and in the following decade the Garden Club added the garden's other features. The completed garden was the first Shakespeare garden in the United States. In 1930, the garden was officially given to Northwestern; however, it is still maintained by the Garden Club. The garden {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 1988. A sundial and <b>brick</b> <b>edging</b> <b>on</b> the inner flower beds were added to the garden in 1990.|$|R

6000|$|Various Hamlets lie {{sprinkled}} about: very sleepy, rusty, irregular little places; huts and cattle-stalls huddled down, as if shaken from a bag; much straw, thick thatch and crumbly mud-brick; {{but looking}} warm and peaceable, for the Four-footed and the Two-footed; which latter, if {{you speak to}} them, are solid reasonable people, with energetic German eyes and hearts, though so ill-lodged. These Hamlets, needing shelter and spring-water, stand generally in some slight hollow, if well up the Height, as Rorschach is; sometimes, if near the bottom, they are nestled in a sudden dell or gash,--work of the primeval rains, accumulating from above, and ploughing out their way. The rains, we can see, have been busy; but there is seldom the least stream visible, bottom being too sandy and porous. On the western slope, there is in our time a kind of coal, or coal-dust, dug up; {{in the way of}} quarrying, not of mining; and one or two big chasms of this sort are confusedly busy: the natives mix this valuable coal-dust with water, mould it into bricks, and so use as fuel: one of the features of these hamlets is the strange black <b>bricks,</b> standing <b>on</b> <b>edge</b> about the cottage-doors, to drip, and dry in the sun. For this or for other reasons, the westward slope appears to be the best; and has a major share of hamlets on it: Rossbach is high up, and looks over upon Mucheln, and its dim belfry and appurtenances, which lie safe across the hollow, perhaps two miles off,--safe from Friedrich, if there were eatables and lodging to be had in such a place. Friedrich's left wing is in Rossbach. Bedra where Friedrich's right wing is; Branderode where the Soubise right is; then Grost; Schevenroda, Zeuchfeld, Pettstadt, Lunstadt,--especially Reichartswerben, where Soubise's right will come to be: these the reader may take note of in his Map. Several of them lie in ashes just then; plundered, replundered, and at last set fire to; so busy have Soubise's hungry people been, of late, in the Country they came to [...] "deliver." [...] The Freiburg road, the Naumburg road, both towards Merseburg, cross this Height; straight like the string, Saale by Weissenfels being the bow.|$|R
