5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often <b>constrains</b> people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E
5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also <b>constrains</b> the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E

In a multi-year inversion experiment using pseudo observations {{derived from a}} forward transport simulation with known fluxes, the interval <b>constrained</b> fixed-lag Kalman smoother presents the best results, followed by the interval <b>constrained</b> fixed-lag ensemble Kalman smoother and the interval <b>constrained</b> maximum likelihood ensemble Kalman smoother.

40|$|In a <b>constrained</b> {{pseudorandom}} function (PRF), {{the holder}} {{of the master}} secret key can derive <b>constrained</b> keys {{with respect to a}} boolean circuit C. The <b>constrained</b> key can be used to evaluate the PRF on all inputs x for which C(x) = 1. In almost all existing constructions of <b>constrained</b> PRFs, the <b>constrained</b> key itself reveals its constraints. We introduce the concept of private <b>constrained</b> PRFs, which are <b>constrained</b> PRFs with the additional property that the <b>constrained</b> keys do not reveal their constraints. Our main notion of privacy captures the intuition that an adversary, given a <b>constrained</b> key for one of two circuits C 0 and C 1, is unable to tell which circuit is associated with its key. As a primitive, private <b>constrained</b> PRFs have many natural applications in searchable symmetric encryption, deniable encryption, and more. We then show how to instantiate private <b>constrained</b> PRFs. Our first construction uses indistinguishability obfuscation and achieves our strongest notions of functionality and privacy. We also give two constructions based on concrete assumptions on multilinear maps which achieve slightly weaker notions of privacy and for more limited classes of constraints: namely, for the class of bit-fixing constraints and puncturing constraints. ...|$|R
