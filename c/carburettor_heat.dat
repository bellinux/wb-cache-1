5000|$|... 6 December 2008 - Piper Cherokee aborts {{take-off}} {{after failing}} to reach required airspeed due to the pilot inadvertently leaving the <b>carburettor</b> <b>heat</b> on and overruns the runway. One person suffers minor injuries and the aircraft is significantly damaged.|$|E
50|$|Carburetor, carburettor, carburator, <b>carburettor</b> <b>heat</b> (usually {{abbreviated}} to 'carb heat') {{is a system}} used in automobile and piston-powered light aircraft engines to prevent or clear carburetor icing. It consists of a moveable flap which draws hot air into the engine intake. The air is drawn from the heat stove, a metal plate around the (very hot) exhaust manifold.|$|E
2500|$|The {{compression}} {{ratio of the}} standard version was 5.5:1, but variants had other ratios to cope with fuels with octane ratings between 76 and 95. [...] The G series introduced <b>carburettor</b> <b>heating</b> together with an hydraulically damped mounting system. [...] There were also choices of starting system, from inertial or compressed air systems to the traditional hand swinging.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, Harding was {{informed}} by a Rolls-Royce engineer that his model of aircraft had been upgraded from a MKI unit to MkII status, {{rather than being}} purpose built. As such, the earlier Merlin engine of Harding's aircraft lacked the <b>heated</b> <b>carburettor</b> of subsequent models, rendering it prone to icing of the barrels when running lean at high altitudes. Harding had fallen victim to the common practice of reconnaissance pilots, who tended to run their engines lean in order to conserve fuel for high speed escapes.|$|R
5000|$|Triumph {{launched}} {{the first new}} Bonneville for 15 years, the Bonneville 790, at the Munich Motorcycle Show in September 2000, with a [...] 360Â° crankshaft parallel-twin engine. The T100 Bonneville, styled by John Mockett and David Stride, was launched as an uprated version initially with the 790 cc engine, and from 2005 with the 865 cc engine introduced on the 2004 Thruxton, and fitted to all Bonnevilles from 2007. The designation comes from the T100 models produced by Triumph between 1939 and the mid 1970s [...] and it is sold as part of Triumph's [...] "Modern classics" [...] range. The engine features double electrically <b>heated</b> <b>carburettors.</b> Triumph added an air injection unit near the spark plug to achieve emission regulations introduced in 2007. For 2008 the T100 (like all Bonneville based models) was further updated with fuel injection to meet new Euro 3 emissions legislation. As well as cleaner running than a carburettor engine, the fuel injected system is also easier to start from cold. To retain the 'retro' styling the fuel injectors are hidden behind throttle bodies designed to resemble carburetors.|$|R
