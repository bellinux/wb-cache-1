5|$|The first {{openly gay}} British footballer Justin Fashanu (1961–1998) spent his {{last night in}} Chariots Roman Spa. His suicide was due to press reports that the US {{authorities}} were planning to extradite him and <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> sexual assault (there was in fact no warrant). His suicide note claimed that the sexual encounter had been consensual and that the youth contacted police only after Fashanu refused to pay him blackmail.|$|E
5|$|Giselle was revived in 1863 {{with new}} costumes by Lormier's assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert's costumes {{are closer to}} those of modern {{productions}} than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, believing the critics would <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a lack of imaginative creativity.|$|E

Ian admits to stealing the laptop from The Queen Victoria on Christmas Day, but denies murder. The police <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> murder, but when Janine admits the truth, the charges are dropped.|$|E

5|$|Knox's final {{encounter}} with Mary {{was prompted by}} an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer progress in 1563, a crowd forced its way into her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest's life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, burgesses of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if {{this was not a}} treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox to admit he was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the Privy Council. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> treason.|$|E

However, the Rhode Island Attorney General {{said that their}} prosecution would not go forward until the Boston cases ended.|$|E

25|$|According to Bimba's lawyer, Bimba {{had spoken}} extemporaneously at Lithuanian Hall in Brockton from an outline and no stenographic {{record of his}} remarks existed.

25|$|During this time, {{undercover}} {{officers from}} the RUC had recorded months of discussions with Adair in which he boasted of his activities, producing enough evidence to <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> directing terrorism. He was convicted on 6 September 1995 and sentenced to 16 years in the Maze prison. As is standard practice in the UDA, Adair vacated his position as Brigadier upon entering prison, with his friend Winkie Dodds succeeding him.|$|E
25|$|Bach-Zelewski left {{prison in}} 1949. In 1951, Bach-Zelewski {{claimed that he}} helped Hermann Göring commit suicide in 1946. As evidence, he {{produced}} cyanide capsules to the authorities with serial numbers not {{far removed from the}} one used by Göring. The authorities never verified Bach-Zelewski's claim, however, and did not <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> aiding Göring's death. Most modern historians dismiss Bach-Zelewski's claim and agree that a U.S. Army contact within the Palace of Justice's prison at Nuremberg most likely aided Göring in his suicide.|$|E

Anderson revealed that his wife had borrowed the gun used in the shooting, and that he had escorted her to an indoor shooting range in the weeks prior to the incident.|$|E

500|$|In the complaint, the man {{states that}} when he was 20 or 21 years old, he comprehended what had {{occurred}} and reported the crime to the Kendall County State's Attorney's Office, but that then-state's attorney Dallas C. Ingemunson [...] "threatened to <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a crime and accused him of slandering Hastert's name." [...] Ingemunson denies this allegation, calling it [...] "bogus."

500|$|White was {{initially}} {{a suspect in}} a November laptop theft from a university dorm, but after 3 months of investigation the University of Minnesota police department {{did not have enough}} evidence to <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> theft. [...] He was formally charged with trespassing in January. [...] He left the University of Minnesota in February 2010. He had unofficially announced his departure from Minnesota via YouTube in November, but had not formally notified the athletic department. Despite his legal difficulties, White achieved better than a 3.0 grade point average in his first semester at Minnesota. While suspended from the team, he spent some of his extracurricular time on his passion for music.|$|E
500|$|On October 2, detectives put Bundy in {{a lineup}} before DaRonch, who {{immediately}} {{identified him as}} [...] "Officer Roseland". Witnesses from Bountiful picked him from the same lineup as the stranger lurking about the high school auditorium. There was insufficient evidence linking him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found), but {{more than enough to}} <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents, and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. [...] "When Ted and I stepped out on the porch to go somewhere," [...] Kloepfer wrote, [...] "so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, Aquino {{attracted}} greater {{publicity for}} his Temple through appearances on television talk shows like The Oprah Winfrey Show and Geraldo. In 1987, during the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, the three-year-old {{daughter of a}} Christian clergyman accused Aquino of sexually abusing her during Satanic rites held at his Presidio home. Responding to the allegations, police raided Aquino's home, however—after no evidence was found to substantiate the allegation and {{it was revealed that}} Aquino was living in Washington D.C. {{at the time of the}} alleged abuse—the police decided not to <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> <b>with</b> any felony. Aquino attempted to bring formal charges against the chaplain and psychiatrist who had encouraged the girl's claims, although he was more successful in bringing legal action against two books—Carl A. Raschke's Painted Black and Linda Blood's The New Satanists—that had suggested that he was guilty. He then left Presidio and was transferred to St. Louis. In 1994, Aquino retired from active service in the army, being honourably transferred to the Retired Reserve and awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.|$|E

2500|$|The true {{reason for}} his {{acknowledgement}} of guilt {{is the subject of}} debate, but some authors speculate that it may have been prompted by his sickness, or by a view that through his fame and the greatness of his office he would be spared harsh punishment.
