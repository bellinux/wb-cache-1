40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} and clustering of non-metallic inclusions was investigated by applying a steel <b>casting</b> <b>simulator.</b> In a fully controlled atmosphere, the oxygen {{content of the}} steel melt was intentionally increased. At a specified level, the steel was deoxidized by pure aluminum. After the treatment, the melt was cooled down in the crucible. The effects of the inclusions and the cavities were determined by means of metallography, tensile tests, dynamic fracture toughness tests, and fractography. Metallographic results show that alumina particles have a strong tendency to aggregate at {{the walls of the}} crucible. Neglecting this aggregation, a relatively homogeneous distribution of alumina inclusions was observed. Furthermore, the solidified steel exhibited manganese sulphide inclusions and shrinkage cavities. The results of the tensile tests revealed a relatively low ductility. Fractographic examinations showed that both non-metallic inclusions and shrinkage cavities promoted ductile fracture. Results of dynamic fracture toughness tests revealed a relatively large scatter in the dynamic crack resistance. This was analogously attributed to the damaging effect of the non-metallic inclusions and the shrinkage cavities. Fractographic investigations showed that not only alumina inclusions but preferentially manganese sulphide inclusions affected the failure behavior of the investigated steel...|$|E
40|$|Strips of {{magnesium}} alloy AZ 31 -B were cast {{on a single}} belt <b>casting</b> <b>simulator</b> with moving-mold system. A mixture of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gases {{was used as a}} protective gas during melting and casting of the magnesium alloy. The castability of the magnesium alloy strips was investigated for different types of substrates: smooth low carbon steel substrate, copper with six different roughnesses, graphite-coated smooth steel and graphite-coated copper with different roughnesses. Moreover, the effect of strip thickness on the casting properties were investigated. The heat flux through the copper substrate was higher than that through the steel substrate, while coated substrates showed lower heat fluxes than the uncoated substrates. The highest heat flux was recorded for the grooved (rough) substrate with 0. 15 mm depth, while further increasing the surface roughness (depth) resulted in a decrease in the heat flux. Decreasing the heat flux reduced the quality of the top surface of the strips. However, as the thickness of the strip decreased, although the heat flux decreased, the quality of the top surface increased. As the heat flux increased, the grain sizes of the strips were reduced while the secondary arm spacing (SDAS) decreased. The mechanical properties, TS, YS and HV increased when the heat flux increased. Although magnesium oxide normally appears in white, the black color of the outer MgO layer of the strips formed under unprotected conditions is due to the presence of sub-micron MgO particles...|$|E
40|$|Strip casting is a common, {{low-cost}} {{method to}} cast thin aluminum sheets at gauges {{close to the}} final product gauge. Since this process involves fewer steps than traditionally casting methods, the manufacturing time for aluminum products is reduced considerably. Usually, when surface defects occur during the casting process, the slab is scalped. Since it is impractical to scalp a sheet, the slab should contain a minimal amount of surface defects. To achieve this, {{it is important to}} understand the effect of different processing variables that occur in the casting procedure. The use of a pilot-scale belt-caster for research is expensive, and therefore, a single-belt <b>casting</b> <b>simulator</b> has been constructed. The aim is to study a broad range of casting conditions and the parameters that affect the surface quality and the underlying microstructure in the twin-belt casting process. Running experiments on the simulator also reduces the costs considerably compared to full scale twin-belt casting experiments. To achieve a sensible simulation, the conditions should be as identical as possible to a twin-belt caster. One of the most crucial factors is the heat- flow occurring in the interface between the solidifying metal and its surroundings. This flow is hard to measure. Therefore, a model for interfacial flow calculations was created. The model was developed in Matlab and Abaqus/CAE. Abaqus/CAE could not compute the desired heat-flow automatically, but was used as a control device for the created algorithm. It was showed that the accuracy of the heat-flow computed with the Matlab algorithm was good. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|In casting, {{fluidity}} is {{the measure}} of the distance a metal can flow in a channel before being stopped by solidification. During mold filling, the metal loses heat to the surrounding mold, thereby cooling and becoming more viscous until the leading portion solidifies and no further flow is possible. A coupled heat-transfer and fluid-flow modeling of a spiral, involving the use of thermophysical properties to determine material fluidity, has been conducted. Simulations of these experiments utilized the <b>Casting</b> Process <b>Simulator</b> (CaPS) software developed at Argonne National Laboratory. Two types of spiral geometries with different assumptions were considered: (1) a two-dimensional laterally stretched spiral and (2) a three-dimensional lateral spiral. The computer extent of mold filling is in good agreement with the experimental results. Time required by the metal/gas interface to attain specific positions in the spiral arm also compares favorably with the experimental results. The influence of process variables, especially pour time, is discussed.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the strip {{produced}} in a near-net-shape casting process is strongly linked to the metal feeding system. An alternative metal delivery system was proposed and a comprehensive mathematical model, including heat transfer, fluid flow and stress studies {{was used as a}} tool to perform this task. This model included three-dimensional flows with fully coupled momentum and heat transfer. Turbulence effects as deduced from the standard kappa- 3 equations, macroscopic solidification, as well as flow through porous media were also modeled. A further simple model for stress was employed to calculate the displacements and the stress distribution throughout the forming strip. Besides the mathematical model, an experimental apparatus was developed, reproducing as closely as possible the type of metal-substrate contact occurring in a single-belt caster. Casting of thin strips at high speeds was achieved and a parametric study was carried out. The standard extended nozzle configuration did not provide a smooth flow in the reservoir. Recirculation zones besides a nonuniform delivery of the metal to the belt were observed. Divergences in the solid fractions between the center and the edges of the strips were found to increase with increasing turbulence at the exit gap. The values of the morphology constant C and the overall heat transfer coefficient h were considered the most important inputs of the model. Furthermore, modelling turbulence through a kappa- 3 model proved to be critical for this particular configuration. The adoption of a flow modifier within the extended nozzle eliminated the recirculation zone in the reservoir and yielded a smoother flow to the belt. Such improvements in the flow distribution were decisive to ensure more uniform solidification along the width of the strip. In early solidification, the strip was found to displace inwardly, due to the cooling and contraction of the solid shell. Tensile stresses were calculated at the cooling surface, whereas compressive stresses were found {{in the middle of the}} strip. Interfacial heat fluxes and heat transfer coefficients measured on the strip <b>casting</b> <b>simulator</b> were highly dependent on the contact metal-substrate-coating. Values of q and h varied threefold for the various coatings and levels of roughness investigated. Correlations were derived to predict peak heat fluxes and the evolution of q after the peak, for the various coatings. A relationship was observed between the peak heat transfer coefficient and the total solidification time. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{multimodal}} camera {{networks have}} been deployed in various environment, image fusion is playing a critical role for better visual perception and process parameter measurement. The objective of the dissertation is to design robust vision-based thermal control systems to tolerate uncertainties for industrial automaton. To be specific, two new methods have been developed, one for robust shape fitting in visual images and another for packet loss recovery in thermal images. Firstly, an adaptive curve fitting technique is proposed based on prediction error sum of squares for the sampled data set containing outliers. The method converges very fast and superaccuracy can be obtained under certain conditions when compared with other methods. The method is applied to find an optimal curve of casting dies in the visual images. Secondly, the thermal image loss generated by network traffic from camera nodes to fusion center is modeled as a Markov chain. A graph cuts method is proposed to recover the loss based on thermal pattern classification. Simulation {{results show that the}}rmal information can be partially retrieved, which may greatly increase the robustness of a thermal management system. The proposed methods are tested with a laboratory die <b>casting</b> process <b>simulator</b> with two visual cameras and one thermal camera.

It has been found that changes in flow rates of cooling water inside the die affect die temperature; however, very limited research work has been done in this area. In this study, a die <b>casting</b> process <b>simulator</b> has been built in the laboratory. A PC-based data acquisition system (DAS) has been designed, established, and implemented, which is able to acquire, record, and plot temperature and flow rate signals during the die casting process. Experiments have been designed and conducted with the laboratory simulator to assess the heat transfer performance of the die using varying cooling water flow rates with a fixed waterline diameter. In addition to the analysis of experimental data, and process observations, the performance of an air-operated pump, which serves as a control actuator, has been evaluated with consideration of its ability to adjust water flow rates.

40|$|Most {{casting defects}} occur during initial pouring and {{therefore}} {{the design of the}} running system, which guides the metal from the ladle into the mold, is crucial. Traditionally, the running system and mold filling are designed by trial and error, which is tedious, time consuming, and expensive. The uncertainties that remain can be overcome by a computer simulation that demonstrates the actual process of mold filling and subsequent solidification. Computer simulation of various processes has become more and more common in recent years. The cost-effectiveness of making flawless castings has made the foundry worker more aware of the process of mold filling, identification of hot spots, etc. The macroscopic <b>Casting</b> Process <b>Simulator</b> (CaPS) software combines heat transfer and fluid flow aspects and can describe a variety of solidification aspects, including mold filling. CaPS is a two-dimensional time-dependent computer code involving a finite-volume formulation for the mass, momentum. and energy equations. CaPS has the following characteristics. CaPS uses the PATRAN geometric modeling package for constructing the geometry, generating a neutral file consisting of a list of named components, and post-processing of the simulation results; building the geometry independently of the mesh is a time-saving procedure.

Mixtures of CO 2 and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gases {{were used as}} protective atmosphere during melting and casting. The castability of the AZ 31 -B strips was investigated for a smooth, low carbon steel substrate, and six copper substrates with various textures and roughnesses.

The highest heat flux from the strip was recorded for casting on macrotextured copper substrates with 0. 15 [*]mm grooves. As the thickness of the strip decreased, the net heat flux decreased. As the heat flux increased, the grain sizes of the strips were reduced, and the SDAS decreased. The mechanical properties were improved when the heat flux increased.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} a selection of commonly used performance indicators (PIs) that have been reported to be sensitive to distraction and workload. More specifically, the PIs were tested for their ability to differentiate between task modalities (visual, cognitive and haptic) and task difficulty (easy, medium and hard). It was investigated whether possible differences were constant across two traffic situations (with/without lead vehicle) and two driving simulators. The experiment was conducted in the VTI Driving Simulator III, an advanced moving-base simulator, and in the Volvo Car Corporation driving simulator, an advanced fixed-base simulator. Both simulators were equipped with Smart Eye Pro eye tracking systems. A visual, a cognitive and a haptic secondary task were chosen to test the ability of the PIs to distinguish between the tasksâ€™ loading on different modalities. Some of the main results from the study were: There were only minor differences between the two simulators for driving behaviour as described by longitudinal PIs. There was no overall offset, and the main difference was that the visual task led to stronger speed reductions in the moving-base simulator, which influenced both the mean speed and the speeding index. Regarding lateral PIs, major differences between the two simulators were found, both as a general offset and for those factor combinations that include modality and task difficulty level. With the visual or the haptic task active, the drivers positioned themselves further to the left and the variation in lateral position was higher in the fixed-base simulator. The number of lane crossings did not differ considerably between the simulators, but the lane departure area was larger on average in the fixed-base simulator, again influenced by modality, with the largest lane departure areas for the visual task, and in the case of the fixed-base simulator for the haptic task as well. Most of the eye movement related PIs had a general offset between the simulators.

40|$|The thin solidifying shell in the {{meniscus}} {{region of}} a continuous caster deforms due to severe contraction in steels of near-peritectic composition, thereby exacerbating {{the risks of}} cracking and in the extreme, breakouts. The main {{purpose of the present}} study was to contribute to an improved understanding of the fundamentals underpinning the solidification behaviour of selected steels of industrial importance and to relate these fundamentals to industrial practice. A further aim was to explore the potential of countermeasures aimed at avoiding or at least minimizing surface defects that originate as a result of the occurrence of the peritectic phase transition. Several experimental techniques were employed to simulate various aspects of solidification events that occur in the meniscus region of an operating continuous caster. In-situ observations of solidification in addition to subsequent solid-state phase transformations were made by employing a concentric solidification technique in a high-temperature laser-scanning confocal microscope (HTLSCM) in real time and at temperature. It is possible by this technique to effectively simulate early solidification events occurring in an operating continuous caster and the solidification behaviour of a series of steel of near-peritectic composition and of industrial importance have been assessed and compared. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to determine the exact phase relationships in the selected steels as a function of temperature as an aid to the interpretation of the outcomes of the solidification studies. A potential countermeasure that can be taken in industrial practice to counteract uneven solidification is to texture the mould surface. In order to explore and evaluate the effect of different mould surface textures on reducing the unevenness of the solidifying, a simple dip-test was developed, followed by more sophisticated experiments and analyses in a continuous <b>casting</b> mould <b>simulator.</b> In parallel to the texture studies in the mould-simulator certain aspects of the interaction between mould, strand and mould-flux have also been assessed. The stresses encountered in and development of these stresses in the course of solidification, were assessed by the use of a submerged split-chill contraction (SSCC) technique. In an attempt to relate the fundamental studies to operational practice, an in-plant study of off-corner crack formation was conducted. The solidification studies conducted in a high-temperature laser-scanning microscope revealed that the velocity of the liquid/delta-ferrite interface decreases with the extent of segregation occurring in the early stages of solidification. An increase in alloy content of steels and/or an increase in cooling rate exacerbate segregation during solidification. It is understood that the migration of the interface requires the diffusion of large amounts of solute across the interface, implying that the delay in shell growth in the very early stage of solidification in mould might be attributed to this segregation. This is an important observation since it means that the initial rate of solidification in industrial practice is a strong function of steel composition, but that the influence of alloying elements on the rate of solidification can be quantified through experimental simulation studies. The rate of the solid-state delta-ferrite to austenite phase transformation in the presence of liquid phase is significantly higher in hypo-peritectic steels than in the other steels investigated, even at low cooling rates. The higher undercooling of these steels before nucleation of austenite initiates has been attributed to the pre-existence of a higher fraction of primary solidified deltaferrite in the steels of hypo-peritectic composition. However, it is not the fraction of pre-existing delta-ferrite as such that causes the deeper undercooling, but rather the higher solute concentration gradients that develop in the delta-ferrite phase in these steels that leads to an increased rate of the subsequent delta-ferrite to austenite phase transformation. In order to illustrate the ill-effects of uneven solidification in a thin-slab caster in industrial practice, the case of off-corner cracking of titanium bearing steels close to peritectic composition was selected for further study. This in-plant study revealed that off-corner cracks can occur as a result of excessive growth of austenite grains caused by the peritectic phase transition and/or by the precipitation of fine TiN precipitates at grain boundaries. Experiments conducted by the simple dip-test have shown that textured surfaces with 2 mm interval grooves provided the best mould surface to produce even solidification. These grooves also provided the most extensive shell growth through the improved contact between shell and textures mould surface. This observation is attributed to the effect of grooves on the dispersion of deformation sites in the thin shell. In mould simulator experiment, with the application of mild cooling mould flux the growth of shell in hypo-peritectic steel became much evener. Also with mild cooling much thicker shell grew through more intimate contact between shell and mould. The mould simulator experiments revealed that the use of a â€˜mild cooling mould fluxâ€™ provided conditions conducive to high shell growth rates and even shell formation in casting hypo-peritectic steel. This observation is also attributed to the intimate contact between shell and mould as a result of the reduced heat extraction rate achieved with the â€˜mild cooling mould fluxâ€™. In industrial practice it is difficult to predict the solidification behaviour of a specific steel design. The experiments conducted by DSC techniques provided convincing evidence that the susceptibility to the ill-effects of the peritectic phase transition of a given steel cannot be predicted by currently available thermodynamic software or by the calculation of the carbon equivalent alone. It is necessary to determine the absolute values of the phase boundaries as a function of temperature. It was shown that DSC technique is a tool for the identification of steels that will be subject to undergoing the peritectic transformation during continuous casting. It was found that in the case of at least one steel, DSC measurements proved it to be of hypo-peritectic composition whereas thermodynamic software predicted it to be of hyper-peritectic composition. It was possible to measure the stress developing in the course of solidification in each of the steels investigated by the use of the SSCC test. It was also found that the effect of a reduction in heat transfer by the use of a zirconium oxide coating in the SSCC test on decreasing the contraction forces is more pronounced in the case of hypo-peritectic steels. In summary: An attempt was made to explore practical measures (or the directions towards improvement) aimed at minimizing defects resulting from solidification events in high-speed continuous casting processes such as uneven shell formation, depressions, cracks and even breakouts. Specific attention was paid to the high stresses that result from the massive-type of phase transformation occurring in the meniscus region. The present study confirmed that it is necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors, fundamental and operational, that impact on solidification in order to predict the solidification behaviour of steels that fall within the peritectic composition range. Steel composition, casting speed and cooling rate play dominant roles. Two distinct occurrences close to the liquid/solid interface in a solidifying steel shell in a continuous casting mould were identified as of paramount importance: A massive type of deltaferrite to gamma-austenite transformation with planar liquid/solid interface morphology in the very initial stages of solidification in the meniscus region, which is caused by solute elements build-up in the liquid ahead of the growing solid/interface (partitioning) and a diffusionally driven deltaferrite to gamma-austenite transformation upon further solidification in the region of dendritic growth as a result of smoothed concentration gradients. Hot-spots need to be avoided at all cost and the development of a thin shell of even thickness in the region below the meniscus is a pre-requisite to preventing casting defects...|$|R
