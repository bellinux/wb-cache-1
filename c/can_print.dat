25|$|A visa most {{commonly}} {{takes the form}} of a sticker endorsed in the applicant's passport or other travel document. The visa, when required, was historically granted by an immigration official on a visitor's arrival at the frontiers of a country, but increasingly today a traveller wishing to enter another country must apply in advance for a visa, sometimes in person at a consular office, by mail or over the internet. The actual visa may still be a sticker or a stamp in the passport, or may take the form of a separate document or an electronic record of the authorization, which the applicant <b>can</b> <b>print</b> before leaving home and produce on entry to the host country. Some countries do not require visas for short visits.|$|E

Results have indicated that the techniques that are most applicable to <b>can</b> <b>printing</b> are the solvent ink and high solids overvarnish printing with thermal curing, or the UV based ink and overvarnish printing with UV curing.

2500|$|Many {{innovations}} {{and technical}} refinements {{have been made}} in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of presses with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that <b>can</b> <b>print</b> multi-color images in one pass {{on both sides of the}} sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (webs) of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren instead of the old method which is still used on older presses (conventional dampening), which are rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a [...] "delta effect or vario," [...] which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as [...] "hickies".|$|E
2500|$|During 1880-1890 {{the local}} {{communication}} channels were developed. The organizations were fully functional under Ankara, Amasya, Çorum, Diyarbakır, Yozgat, and Tokat.

[...] The main theme of these materials were people should {{take control of their}} own life against the oppressors. These ideological communicants did not have any effect on the Muslims. These activities ended with clashes between revolutionaries and Ottoman police. Generally resulted with the jail time. Every jail time ended with official exchanges between Ottoman Empire and Britain, as it was the protectorate of the Educated revolutionaries who <b>can</b> <b>print</b> papers. It was more than probable' that Armenian revolutionaries were responsible parties in this conflict, Britain concluded. Sultan panicked, and local authorities act against them as they were cutting telegraph wires, bombing the odd government buildings.

2500|$|The {{official}} game {{cover was}} revealed by Irrational Games in early December 2012; the art featured DeWitt against a burning flag {{with some other}} elements of the game. Several journalists were critical of the art, with the lack of any major elements from the game including Elizabeth, and lacking any of the uniqueness that BioShock Infinite had set itself to be prior to this point, such as through the Game Informer Saturday Evening Post-inspired covers. Erik Kain of Forbes considered the art [...] "generic", while Owen Good of Kotaku considered it both [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "cliché"; Gieson Cacho of the San Jose Mercury News noted that the cover was reminiscent of , down to the pose of DeWitt matching that of Nathan Drake. Levine responded to these complaints commenting that they had decided to make the cover art something to draw the attention of the more casual player, [...] "the uninformed, the person who doesn't read IGN" [...] that may never have heard of the game, knowing that those players that are already planning to purchase the game {{do not need to be}} swayed further. A public poll was opened by Irrational to allow players to decide what the reversible cover art should be, while alternate cover art will be provided as downloadable files that players <b>can</b> <b>print</b> and use. Levine further showed the back cover art, which includes Elizabeth, an element further designed to draw interest in casual players. Levine stated that for the cover and other parts of the game's promotion including live-action commercials, they had hired Anna [...] "Ormeli" [...] Moleva, a Russian cosplayer that had earlier attracted attention for her recreation of Elizabeth back in September 2011.|$|E
