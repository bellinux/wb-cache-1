In this paper, four talkers were chosen to record 69 American-English Consonant-Vowel syllables with audio, video, and facial movements captured. During the recording, 20 markers were put on the face and an optical Qualisys system was used to track three-dimensional facial movements. The videotapes (with markers on the face and without sound) were presented to normal hearing viewers with average or above average lipreading ability, and visual <b>confusion</b> <b>matrices</b> were obtained. Results showed that the facial measurements were correlated with visual perception data by about 0. 79 and account for about 63 % of the variance...|$|R

The similarity structure in perceptual and physical measures for visual consonants was examined across four talkers. Four talkers, spanning {{a wide range of}} rated visual intelligibility, were recorded producing 69 Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllables. Audio, video, and 3 -D face motion were recorded. Each talker's CV productions were presented for identification in a visual-only condition to six viewers with average or better lipreading ability. The obtained visual <b>confusion</b> <b>matrices</b> demonstrated that phonemic equivalence classes were related to visual intelligibility and were talker and vowel context dependent. Physical measures accounted for about 63 % of the variance of visual consonant perception, with C/u/ syllables yielding higher correlations than C/a/ and C/i/ syllables...|$|R

In this paper we first propose to estimate the Rd parameter by means of extending a state-of-the-art method based on the phase minimization cri-terion. The utilization of a recently proposed adaption of the standardRd parameter regression enables us to assess supplementary to the normal Rd range as well the upper Rd range. By evaluating the <b>confusion</b> <b>matrices</b> depicting the error surfaces of the involved different Rd parameter estimation methods and by objective measurement tests we verify the overall improvement of one new method compared to the state-of-the-art baseline approach.

40|$|Abstract: The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is twofold. First we investigate the use of the <b>confusion</b> <b>matrices</b> in order to get some insight to better define perceptual zoning for character recognition. The features considered in this work are based on concavities/convexities deficiencies, which are obtained by labelling the background pixels of the input image. Four different perceptual zoning (symmetrical and non-symmetrical) are discussed. Experiments show that this mechanism of zoning could be considered as a reasonable alternative to exhaustive search algorithms. The second contribution is a methodology to define metaclasses for the problem of handwritten character recognition. The proposed approach is based on the disagreement among the characters and it uses Euclidean distance computed between the <b>confusion</b> <b>matrices.</b> Through comprehensive experiments we demonstrate that the use of metaclasses can improve the performance of the system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Confusion</b> <b>matrices</b> {{have been}} widely used to {{increase}} the ac-curacy of speech recognisers, but usually a mean confusion ma-trix, averaged over many speakers, is used. However, analysis shows that <b>confusion</b> <b>matrices</b> for individual speakers vary con-siderably, and so there is benefit in obtaining estimates of con-fusion matrices for individual speakers. Unfortunately, there is rarely enough data to make reliable estimates. We present a technique for estimating the elements of a speaker’s confu-sion matrix given only sparse data from the speaker. It utilizes non-negative matrix factorisation to find structure within confu-sion matrices, and this structure is exploited to make improved estimates. Results show that under certain conditions, this tech-nique can give estimates that are as good as those obtained with twice the number of utterances available from the speaker. 1...|$|R
