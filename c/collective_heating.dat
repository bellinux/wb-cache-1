Because of this, investing in efficient and renewable heat generation becomes less interesting. Therefore, to incorporate renewables or residual heat on a larger scale, district heating or <b>collective</b> <b>heating</b> systems grow in importance. Within this set-up, the substation {{is responsible for the}} interaction between local demand for comfort and overall energy performance of the <b>collective</b> <b>heating</b> system. Many different configurations of substations exist, which influence both local comfort and central system performance. Next to that, also hybrids exist with additional local energy input. To evaluate performance of such substations, a new experimental-based test procedure is developed in order to evaluate these different aspects, characterized by the two roles a substation has, namely as heat generator and as heat consumer. The advantage of this approach is that an objective comparison between individual and central systems regarding performance on delivering local comfort can be executed experimentally. The lab set-up consists out of three different subsystems, namely the central system, the domestic hot water consumption and the local space heating. The central system can work with different temperature regimes and control strategies, as these aspects have proven to have the largest influence on actual performance. The domestic hot water system is able to generate similar tap profiles according to eco-design regulation for domestic hot water generation.

40|$|The {{project is}} made in {{cooperation}} with Lolland municipality, which has set a series of ambitious goals in relation to reducing the CO 2 emissions in the municipality. One of the challenges faced by the municipality in this connection is to achieve a cleaner <b>heat</b> supply. The <b>collective</b> <b>heat</b> supply is almost 100 % CO 2 -neutral, as the district heating plants primarily use CO 2 -neutral fuel. However, {{there are a great}} number of households outside the <b>collective</b> <b>heat</b> supply, which are heated by means of an oil-fired boiler. It is precisely these households that are subject matter for this project. Overall, the project encompasses two levels, namely a technological level and an implementation level. At the technological level, seven different heating technologies that can function as a supplement or an alternative to an oil-fired boiler, which is presupposed to be from 1985, have been selected. Following heating technologies have been selected: Air-to-water heat pump, water-to-water heat pump, solid fuel boiler, wood pellet boiler, solar heating system, biofuel boiler and a new oil-fired boiler. The criteria for the selection have been that these technologies emit less greenhouse gases than an oil-fired boiler from 1985, they are compatible with the systems of heat emission of the houses and they are cost competitive to the current oil-fired boiler. Financial calculations have been carried out for all the heating technologies {{on the basis of the}} annuity principle, as well as calculations of the energy efficiency of the technologies, and calculations of the technologies’ annual emissions of greenhouse gases. These calculations show that the annual costs are lowest when using the air-to-water pump, followed by the solid fuel boiler, solar heat combined with the existing oil-fired boiler, water-to-water pump, wood pellet boiler, the current oil-fired boiler alone, solar heat combined with wood pellet boiler, a new oil-fired boiler and the current oil-fired boiler with a new biofuel boiler. The greenhouse gas emissions are lowest when using the biofuel plants, followed by the air-to-water pump, water-to-water pump, solar heat combined with the existing oil-fired boiler, a new oil-fired boiler and highest when using the current oil-fired boiler alone. On the level of implementation, it will be examined how Lolland municipality can, through strategic communication, optimise their chances in encouraging as many citizens as possible of the individual heat supply to adopt a heating technology that reduces greenhouse gases. Seven individual qualitative interviews have been carried out with citizens of Lolland municipality, which at present warm up their houses by means of an oil-fired boiler. The interviews seek to uncover at which level citizens have set up barriers in relation to an implementation of a cleaner way of heating, but also where there might be any possible incentives. The questions for the interview have been designed on the basis of the classical communication theory “diffusion of Innovations” and a theoretical campaign model, which springs from theory and empirical results from behaviourism and social psychology. The interviews enable a segmentation of the target group and a specification of the factors, which hinder the target group from choosing to implement a heating technology that reduces greenhouse gases. The analysis shows especially that there is a significant lack of knowledge of the existing alternative options to the oil-fired boiler. Furthermore, the citizens do not know where to obtain guidance concerning alternative heating options. The analysis also shows that the target groups place great emphasis on the fact that a heating technology must not be demanding and it must be cheap in relation to the current oil-fired pump. The identified barriers and incentives for the choice of alternative heating technologies of the target groups, as well as their weighting of which heating technologies seem to be attractive, are incorporated in the communication planning, so that the barriers are minimised and incentives maximised. It is recommended that the communication product focuses on implementation of the heating technologies that can contribute in meeting the environmental objectives of the municipality in the best way possible. At the same time, they have to be attractive for the citizens and there will be given instructions on how the municipality should address to the citizens efficiently with this information. In the project’s final recommendations to Lolland municipality, it will be considered how the further work with the communication planning should proceed in order to achieve the best results possible...|$|R

For the second, this paper shows the detailed analysis of water temperature within the storage and annual performances by varying the mass flow rate on the cold side of the heat exchanger and the number of collectors in series on the hot side. It is shown that the stratification within the storage is strongly influenced by mass flow rate and the connections between collectors.

40|$|In {{apartment}} buildings with a <b>collective</b> <b>heating</b> system usually a weather compensator {{is used for}} controlling the heat delivery to the various apartments. With this weather compensator the supply water temperature to the apartments is regulated depending on the outside air temperature. With decreasing outside air temperature, the supply water temperature is increased because {{of the increase in}} the heat demand. The relation between the supply water temperature and outside air temperature is called the heating curve. After implementation these heating curves are usually set according to the design of the heating system. Often there is no check whether this setting is indeed correct in practice. Due to safety marges in the design, in practice often a some what lower heating curve is possible. Furthermore in practice adjustments on the heating curves are often used as an easy way to prevent complaints. Heating curves are for instance increased in case of complaints about too low inside air temperatures. The actual cause for the complaints is often not further investigated and the heating curve is often not set back and kept at an unnecessary high level in the future. The result of the above mentioned is that in a lot of situations the setting of the heating curve will not be the optimum for the specific building. This can, amongst other things, lead to thermal discomfort and unnecessary energy consumption. A method for determining the optimum setting of the heating curve in practice is developed by CSTB (France). With this method an easy and rational optimalisation can be obtained.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for permanently connecting two components (4, 6) by soldering using a glass or metal solders as solder material (5), comprises introducing a layer system (7) mediating an adhesion {{on one of the}} components and then guiding to a permanent solder joint between the components after cooling. One of the components consists of an electrically non-conductive material. The solder material is applied on the layer system, is directly or indirectly contacted with the other component, and is heated at a soldering temperature for the solder material characteristic. The layer system has an adhesion mediator layer (1) and a solderable layer (2) indirectly bringable on the component. The adhesion mediator layer is oxidic-, carbidic- and nitric compounds or alloys. A metal compound is used as the adhesion mediator layer, and distinguishes itself by the chemical composition of Me(CaNbOcSdXe), where Me represents a metal or a metal compound, one of the counting indices of a, b, c, d and e is not equal to zero, C is carbon, N is nitrogen, O is oxygen, S is sulfur and X represents fluorine, chlorine and bromine. The adhesion mediator layer has heteroatoms from the halides. The adhesion mediator layer contains one of the metallic elements from the following main- or sub group of the periodic system consisting of lanthanides and groups of III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, XIII and XIV. The adhesion mediator layer has a layer thickness, along which the material composition of the adhesion mediator layer is varied, in which one of the counting indices of a, b, c, d, e is varied. The solderable layer is directly applied on the adhesion mediator layer. The layer system provides a layer, which is applied on the solderable layer. The layer system is formed with a thickness of 20 nm. The layer system is produced {{in the way of a}} chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, sputtering process or metal epitaxy process and a wet-chemical process or in the way of a galvanic separation process. The heating of the solder material takes place by local heating of the solder material or by <b>collective</b> <b>heating</b> of the layer system including the components to be connected with one another. One of the components consists of a glass material, with which a second component is connected. A layer material is selected as solderable layer. USE - Method for permanently connecting two components, which are useful in the field of optics and metrology. ADVANTAGE - The method ensures rapid and effective connection of the two components with inexpensive material without external environment influences such as electro magnetic radiation, moisture and temperature in improved manner...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{overview}} {{is given}} on some measurable quantities that carry {{information on the}} evolution of the fissioning system from the quasi-bound configuration to the final fission fragments in their respective ground states. New insights into the nature of the fission process, but also new puzzles, emerging from recent experimental findings, are presented. They cover the following topics: Dynamics: Early freeze-out due to dynamical effects; importance of quantum-mechanical effects for fluctuations and angular-momentum pumping. Systematics of fission channels: Separability principle, a powerful application of the macroscopic-microscopic approach to fission; the puzzle of the apparent role of proton shells. Energetics: Transformation of the potential-energy gain into kinetic energy, single-particle excitations, and <b>collective</b> excitations; <b>heat</b> transfer between the nascent fragments; consequences for prompt-neutron emission and the even–odd effect in fragment yields; ambiguities and model dependences. New experimental knowledge on the nuclear level density is included in the discussion...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{predictive}} Kinetic Collective Model using {{first principles}} phonon spectra and relaxation times is presented. Thermal conductivity values obtained for Si, Ge, C (diamond) and GaAs {{in a wide}} range of sizes and temperatures have good agreement with experimental data without the use of any fitting parameter. This validation of the model open the door to discuss how the precise combination of kinetic and <b>collective</b> contributions to <b>heat</b> transport could provide a useful framework to interpret recent complex experiments displaying non-Fourier behavior.

50|$|Arrentières was {{the first}} commune to have {{installed}} coloured candelabras (red) in the streets and, in 1995, {{one of the first}} small communes to be equipped with a sewerage treatment plant. An innovative <b>collective</b> project to <b>heat</b> all homes with wood has been designed but not implemented due to lack of funding. After the rehabilitation of roads, public lighting, water system and the church (Retable over the nave refurbished) over 3 years to 2010, the commune started the renovation of the hall as well as the walls of two lavoirs (public laundries).|$|R
