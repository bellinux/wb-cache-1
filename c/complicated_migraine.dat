50|$|The {{cause of}} AHC is unknown. It was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} a form of <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine</b> because of strong family histories of migraine reported in AHC cases. AHC has also been considered to be a movement disorder or a form of epilepsy. Suggested causes have included channelopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cerebrovascular dysfunction. The disorder most closely related to AHC is familial hemiplegic migraine, and this was recently discovered to be caused by a mutation in a gene for calcium channel receptors. It is suspected that AHC may be caused by a similar channelopathy, and this is a current area of investigation into the cause of AHC. An association with ATP1A2 mutation has been found in some patients, but other studies have found no mutations and thus a lack of evidence that mutations which cause AHC are in the same genes as mutations which cause familial hemiplegic migraine.|$|E
40|$|The Classic {{presenting}} {{features of}} both migraine {{with and without}} aura have been clearly defined. Occasionally however migrainous headaches are accompanied by abrupt appearance of focal and ominous neurological signs. Such attacks can be labelled as migraine variants and the diagnosis in reality is one made by exclusion of other CNS diseases. Some but not all such conditions are mentioned in the International Headache Society (IHS) classification under the general heading of migraine with aura. Rarely, the focal neurological deficit may outlast the migraine attack by days and occasionally with appearance of structural brain lesions on neuroimaging.

40|$|Background: Migraine is {{a chronic}} {{neurological}} disease characterized by recurrent {{moderate to severe}} headaches commonly in association with neuro-inflammation. Interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, {{plays an important role}} in modulating pain threshold and has an essential role in stimulation of pain receptors in the trigeminal nerve fibers. Aim of the study: The current study aimed to investigate the possible associations between IL- 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and susceptibility to migraine in Iranian patients. Patients and methods: In a prospective case–control study, we studied blood samples of 190 patients with migraine (migraineurs) and 200 healthy controls (HCs) for analysis of gene variants. Genotyping for the IL- 4 SNPs: C- 589 T (rs 2243250), T+ 2979 G (rs 2227284), and C- 33 T (rs 2070874) were performed using PCR-RFLP. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 21. 0 (SPSS, Chicago) and SNPStats version 1. 14. 0. Results and conclusion: Among IL- 4 SNPs, rs 2243250 (TC genotype, OR =  0. 25, 95 % CI =  0. 13 – 0. 50, P =  0. 001) and rs 2227284 (TG and TT genotypes, OR =  0. 44, 95 % CI =  0. 23 – 0. 92, P =  0. 029 and OR =  0. 38, 95 % CI =  0. 18 – 0. 79, P =  0. 009 respectively) were significantly associated with migraine. No significant associations between IL- 4 SNP rs 2070874 (TC, TT and CC genotypes) and migraine were found. The most frequent genotypes in the migraineurs were CC in both SNPs rs 2243250 (79 %), and rs 2070874 (71. 5 %), as well as GG for SNP rs 2227284 (64 %). There was no statistically significant relationship between these SNPs and different subclasses (common, classic and <b>complicated)</b> of <b>migraine.</b> Our findings revealed that in IL- 4 rs 2243250 and rs 2227284 genotypes and allele frequencies have a role in susceptibility to migraine in our population. Therefore, it is suggested that in addition to other factors, IL- 4 genetic variations also play a pivotal role in the progress of migraine...|$|R
40|$|Medication-overuse {{headache}} (MOH) {{represents a}} severely disabling condition, {{with a low}} response to prophylactic treatments. Recently, consistent evidences have emerged in favor of botulinum toxin type-A (onabotulinum toxin A) as prophylactic treatment in chronic migraine. In a 12 -week double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study, we tested the efficacy and safety of onabotulinum toxin A as prophylactic treatment for MOH. A total of 68 patients were randomized (1 : 1) to onabotulinum toxin A (n = 33) or placebo (n = 35) treatment and received 16 intramuscular injections. The primary efficacy end point was mean change from baseline {{in the frequency of}} headache days for the 28 -day period ending with week 12. No significant differences between onabotulinum toxin A and placebo treatment were detected in the primary (headache days) end point (12. 0 vs. 15. 9; p = 0. 81). A significant reduction was recorded in the secondary end point, mean acute pain drug consumption at 12 weeks in onabotulinum toxin A-treated patients when compared with those with placebo (12. 1 vs. 18. 0; p = 0. 03). When we considered the subgroup of patients with pericranial muscle tenderness, we recorded a significant improvement in those treated with onabotulinum toxin A compared to placebo treated in both primary (headache days) and secondary end points (acute pain drug consumption, days with drug consumption), as well as in pain intensity and disability measures (HIT- 6 and MIDAS) at 12 weeks. Onabotulinum toxin A was safe and well tolerated, with few treatment-related adverse events. Few subjects discontinued due to adverse events. Our data identified the presence of pericranial muscle tenderness as predictor of response to onabotulinum toxin A in patients with <b>complicated</b> form of <b>migraine</b> such as MOH, the presence of pericranial muscle tenderness and support it as prophylactic treatment in these patients...|$|R

40|$|Migraine: Evaluation by MR Twenty-four {{patients}} clinically {{diagnosed as}} having migraine (17 of the classic or common type and seven of the complicated type) were evaluated on a O.

Eleven (46 %) of the patients (seven with classic or common and four with <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine)</b> showed well-defined lesions with prolonged T 2 signal intenSity. The lesions associated with classic migraine were focal and predominantly distributed in the periventricular white maHer, bilateral in four and unilateral in three. In the group with <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine,</b> larger cortical abnormalities similar to infarcts were seen in three patients and multiple bilateral focal white maHer lesions were seen in one. Almost all the lesions were evident only on T 2 -weighted studies; a few exhibited hypointense signal intensity on T 1 -weighted studies.

40|$|Objective. -To {{determine}} whether patients with {{migraine without aura}} with maternal "inheritance" are affected by a monosymptomatic form of the MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) or carry the most common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation associated with MELAS, namely the A 3243 G transition in the transfer RNA (tRNA) (Leu(UUR)), gene. Background. -The association between migraine and abnormal mitochondrial function has been suggested on clinical, biochemical, and neuroradiological grounds. Migraine attacks with vomiting and cerebral infarctions, most often in the posterior cerebral regions, which are reminiscent of <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine,</b> are typical features of MELAS. The observation that migrainous patients have affected mothers more often than affected fathers suggests a possible role for maternally transmitted genetic factors. Methods. -We studied 25 patients with migraine with aura whose mothers were also affected. A sensitive polymerase chain reaction {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis was used to detect mutated genomes. Conclusions. -We failed to detect the MELAS mutation, but migraine may still be associated with point mutations of mtDNA other than A 3243 G or with as-yet-unidentified nuclear DNA factors related to mitochondrial function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Several neurophysiological {{techniques}} {{are available for}} examin-ing children with headache. The choice among them is made accord-ing to clinical features. Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly performed in headache; abnormalities observed are heteroge-neous, and specific patterns have been described in different forms of <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine.</b> Quantitative EEG, brain mapping and spectral analysis are at present useful mainly for research purposes and in migraine diagnosis. Polysomnography studies are just at the beginning {{but they have been}} providing interesting findings. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) have demonstrated conflicting results: increased amplitudes observed in migraine children need to be repli-cated and methodological flaws need to be corrected. Event-related poten-tials (ERPs) have been used to shed light on cognitive processes related to migraine during development of the nervous system. Electromyography studies have doc-umented increased spontaneous mus-cle activity in tension-type headache, but further studies are awaited. Overall, clinical neurophysiology is of primary interest in studying func-tional mechanisms of headache and migraine symptoms. In clinical prac-tice, these procedures are not essen-tial for diagnosis but are relevant for clarifying specific problems. Key words Childhood headache...|$|E
40|$|Migraine is an episodic {{headache}} disorder affecting {{as many as}} 10 % {{of people}} worldwide. Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is an autosomal dominant subtype of severe migraine accompanied by visual disturbances known as aura. Migrainous aura is caused by cortical spreading depression (CSD) — a slowly advancing wave of tissue depolarization in the cortex. More than half of FHM cases are caused by mutations in the CACNA 1 A gene, which encodes a neuronal Cav 2. 1 Ca 2 + channel, resulting in increased Ca 2 + flow into dendrites and excessive release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. In {{this issue of the}} JCI, Eikermann-Haerter et al. show that transgenic mice with FHM-associated mutations in Cacna 1 a have increased susceptibility to CSD compared with wild-type animals, likely due to augmentation of excitatory neurotransmission (see the related article beginning on page 99). Additional as-yet-undefined channel mutations may similarly render the migraine brain more susceptible to the initiation of CSD, with implications not only for the genesis of migraine but also for the hypoxic injury that accompanies its worst manifestation, <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Stroke in a {{migraine}} with aura {{has been documented}} in several cases, even deserving the merit of a classification as <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine.</b> Herein, we present a rare case of migrainous infarct without aura. The diagnosis was challenging {{due to lack of}} risk factors. The patient was unique in not having any other comorbidities. Case Presentation: The case is of a 21 -year-old female presenting with right-sided hemiplegia and facial drooping. She had had an index presentation of throbbing headaches for the past 2 years, typical of {{a migraine}} but not preceded by any aura symptoms. However, in the current episode, the pain became excessively severe and accompanied by right-sided hemiplegia and facial drooping. A full investigation workup using MRI revealed evidence of infarct in the left temporoparietal and basal ganglion region. Conclusion: Our case highlights the need to evaluate silent ischemic stroke in case of prolonged headache with a history of migraine as well as the need for precaution to avoid the use of triptans or opioids in such a case. It also highlights the conditions that need to be excluded before labeling it as a migrainous infarct...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging of the {{self-diffusion}} {{of water}} {{has become increasingly}} popular for the early detection of cerebral infarction in adults. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate MR line scan diffusion imaging (LSDI) of the brain in children. METHODS: LSDI was performed in four volunteers and 12 patients by using an effective TR/TE of 2736 / 89. 4 and a maximum b value of 450 to 600 s/mm 2 applied in the x, y, and z directions. In the volunteers, single-shot echo planar imaging of diffusion (EPID) was also performed. The patients (10 boys and two girls) ranged in age from 2 days to 16 years (average age, 6. 6 years). Diagnoses included acute cerebral infarction, seizure disorder, posttraumatic confusion syndrome, <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine,</b> residual astrocytoma, encephalitis, hypoxia without cerebral infarction, cerebral contusion, and conversion disorder. In all patients, routine spin-echo images were also acquired. Trace images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were produced for each location scanned with LSDI. RESULTS: In the volunteers, LSDI showed less chemical-shift and magnetic-susceptibility artifact and less geometric distortion than did EPID. LSDI was of diagnostic quality in all studies.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Efforts to {{increase}} the availability and shorten the time delivery of intravenous thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke carry the potential for tissue plasminogen activator administration in patients with diseases other than stroke, that is, stroke mimics (SMs). We aimed to determine safety and to describe outcomes of intravenous thrombolysis in SM. Methods—We retrospectively analyzed stroke registry data of consecutive acute ischemic stroke admissions treated with intravenous thrombolysis over a 6 -year-period. The admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, vascular risk factors, ischemic lesions on brain MRI (routinely performed as part of diagnostic work-up), and discharge modified Rankin Scale scores were documented. Initial stroke diagnosis in the emergency department was compared with final discharge diagnosis. SM diagnosis {{was based on the}} absence of ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging sequences in addition to an alternate discharge diagnosis. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as brain imaging evidence of intracranial hemorrhage with clinical worsening by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score increase of 4 points. Results—Intravenous thrombolysis was administered in 539 patients with acute ischemic stroke (55 % men; mean age, 6615 years). Misdiagnosis of acute ischemic stroke was documented in 56 cases (10. 4 %; 95 % CI, 7. 9 % to 13. 3 %).

Dominant symptoms of CH include severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal pain, lasting from 15 to 180 minutes if untreated, associated with at least one of various autonomic symptoms during the headache, such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, facial sweating, miosis, ptosis, and eyelid edema. Headache is not frequently a symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). The most commonly reported primary headaches are migraine without aura and a tension-type headache. Several described cases involved <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine,</b> ophthalmoplegic migraine-like headache, and finally cluster-like headache. We present a case of a 45 -year-old male patient who had typical CH attacks as the initial and only clinical manifestation of MS, which was diagnosed after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isoelectric focusing and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation. He presented as a typical cluster-like headache patient since in the background of the CH symptoms and signs, were MS demyelinating lesions. In a patient with CH symptoms one should always think about the possibility of cluster-like-headache, which presents the CH patient with different underlying diseases, so we proposed a protocol to evaluate such patients and exclude diseases that could be in the background of CH symptoms.

40|$|Alternating {{hemiplegia}} {{of childhood}} (AHC, MIM 104290) {{is a rare}} syndrome, characterized by early onset of episodic hemi-or quadriplegia lasting minutes to days. This disorder, first reported by Verret and Steel in 1971, has historically been thought to represent a migraine equivalent or an unusually form of epilepsy or a movement disorder, as it typically presents with complex and variable clinical features. In most patients, the earliest manifestations clearly related to AHC are tonic- dystonic attacks and paroxysmal nystagmus associated with autonomic changes and paroxysmal dyspnoea and usually appear between 3 and 6 months of age. The hemiplegic episodes develop before 18 months of age lasting anywhere from minutes to {{days at a time}} and involving either side of the body or shifting {{from one side to the}} other during the same episode with a period of bilateral weakness when the second side becomes involved. Some attacks are characterized by a bilateral involvement, which is apparent from the beginning, and do not follow an hemiplegic episode, which determines extreme hypotonia of the whole body inability to move and a level of consciousness markedly depressed. A characteristic feature of AHC is the disappearance of all abnormalities when the child falls asleep. At increasing age, hemiplegic episodes follow a general pattern of initially increasing frequency and duration, followed by a plateau, and finally by a decrease in the number and duration of attacks. Analogously, the paroxysmal manifestations associated with hemiplegia tend to decrease in frequency and intensity with time and usually disappear after 5 - 7 years. Development before the onset of hemiplegic episodes may be normal or delayed. Epileptic seizures are reported in a variable percentage of sporadic patients. An association with migraine has also been noticed since the earliest description. Indeed, for some time, the international classification of headaches (IHC) has included AHC as a childhood periodic syndrome that may be associated with <b>complicated</b> <b>migraine</b> (familial hemiplegic migraine, FHM), mostly due to the clinical similarity of the attacks and the paroxysmal nature of both disorders. Some of the aspects of AHC, however, are clearly distinct from FHM, including choroathetosis, dystonic posturing, and a progressive course associated with mental deterioration. Concerning the possible genetic origin of the disease, only a few familial cases have been described so far, providing evidence to support an autosomal dominant genetic mechanism of transmission. In the first AHC family described, a balanced reciprocal translocation was detected: 46, XY, t(3; 9) (p 26;q 34), thus indicating the first two genomic regions possibly associated with the disease. Subsequently, mitochondrial abnormalities identified in a few sporadic AHC patients suggested the hypothesis, which was however never clearly confirmed, of a mitochondrial dysfunction underlying the pathogenesis of the disease.
