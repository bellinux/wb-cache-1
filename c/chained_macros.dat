40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} paradigm shifts of modern business management is that individual businesses no longer compete as solely autonomous entities, but rather as supply chains. Firms worldwide have embraced the concept of supply chain management as important and sometimes critical to their business. The idea of a collaborative supply chain is to gain a competitive advantage by improving overall performance through measuring a holistic perspective of the supply chain. However, contemporary performance measurement theory is somewhat fragmented and fails to support this idea. Therefore, this research develops and applies an integrated supply chain performance measurement framework that provides a more holistic approach to the study of supply chain performance measurement by combining both supply <b>chain</b> <b>macro</b> processes and decision making levels. Therefore, the proposed framework can provide a balanced horizontal (cross-process) and vertical (hierarchical decision) view and measure the performance of the entire supply chain system. Firstly, literature on performance measurement frameworks and performance measurement factors of supply chain management will help to develop a conceptual framework. Next the proposed framework will be presented. The framework will be validated through in-depth interviews with three Thai manufacturing companies. The fieldwork combined varied sources {{in order to understand the}} views of manufacturers on supply chain performance in the three case study companies. The collected data were analyzed, interpreted, and reported using thematic analysis and analysis hierarchy process (AHP), which was influenced by the study’s conceptual framework. This research contributes a new theory of supply chain performance measurement and knowledge on supply chain characteristics of a developing country, Thailand. The research also affects organisations by preparing decision makers to make strategic, tactical and operational level decisions with respect to supply <b>chain</b> <b>macro</b> processes. The results from the case studies also indicate the similarities and differences in their supply chain performance. Furthermore, the implications of the study are offered for both academic and practical use. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Survival of fittest & fastest is {{the mantra}} of today’s {{business}} game. To compete successfully {{in this business}} era, the retailer must focus on the customer’s buying experience. To manage a customer’s experience, retailers should understand what “customer experience” actually means. Customer Experience Management is a strategy that focuses the operations and processes of a business around {{the needs of the}} individual customer. It represents a strategy that results in a win–win value exchange between the retailer and its customers. The goal of customer experience management is to move customers from satisfied to loyal and then from loyal to advocate. This paper focuses on the role of macro factors in the retail environment and how they can shape customer experiences and behaviors. Several ways (e. g., Brand, Price, Promotion, Supply Chain Management, Location, Advertising, Packaging & labeling, Service Mix, and Atmosphere) to deliver a superior customer experience are identified which should result in higher customer satisfaction, more frequent shopping visits, larger wallet shares, and higher profits.

40|$|In {{a series}} of joint papers, Teppo Felin and Nicolai J. Foss {{recently}} launched a microfoundations project {{in the field of}} strategic management. Felin and Foss observe that extant explanations in strategic management are predominantly collectivist or macro. Routines and organizational capabilities, which are supposed to be properties of firms, loom large in the field of strategic management. Routines figure as explanantia in explanations of firm behavior and firm performance, for example. Felin and Foss plead for a replacement of such macro-explanations by micro-explanations (viz. explanations in terms of individual action and interaction). Such a replacement is needed, Felin and Foss argue, because macro-explanations are necessarily incomplete: they miss out on crucial links in the causal <b>chain</b> that connect <b>macro</b> phenomena with each other. I argue that this argument is flawed. It is based on a doubtful if not outright incorrect understanding and use of Coleman’s diagram. In a sense to be explained below, only if Coleman’s diagram is squared it can accurately account for the relations between individual action and interaction, routines and firm behavior and firm performance. Once Coleman’s diagram is squared, one can see why and how macro-explanations need not miss out on any link in the causal <b>chains</b> that connect <b>macro</b> phenomena. Micro-analyses are still needed, not to highlight and specify causal links that macro-explanations miss out on, but to check whether the many properties that are ascribed to routines in macro-explanations of firm behavior are warranted...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to determine whether Business Process Reengineering (BPR) can be utilized to standardize and integrate business and management processes of three subsidiary companies at the branch level within a large multinational holding company. Although the functions of procurement, selling, order processing, credit management, warehousing and distribution, and collection are {{the same in the}} three subsidiary companies, there were differences as to how the processes were carried out. The objective of the holding company is to portray to the customers that it is one entity. The problem situation resulted amongst other matters, confusion among the customers. Top management in line with the principles of BPR decided to redesign the process to create standard and integrated processes. Action Research with a dual-cycle was the research paradigm. The Action component was to resolve the problem situation and the Research component was to acquire new knowledge. The researcher is not involved in the day-to-day running of the three subsidiary companies where the problem situation existed. The methodology used is the seven-stage Soft Systems Methodology. The research issues investigated are whether BPR can be used to resolve the problem situation, can a process-based organization be set-up with process owners and key performance indicators and whether dramatic improvements can be observed. The problem situation was expressed in As-Is context diagrams, activity-flow diagrams, organization charts, resulting in ""Rich Pictures"" drawing out the differences amongst the three subsidiary companies. Analysis of the As-Is data was carried out using the intervention analysis by means of the process-issues-classification method developed in this research as well as social and power analysis. Root definitions were developed for five macro processes. Conceptual To-Be' models were created for the business model, a process value <b>chain,</b> <b>macro</b> and micro processes, a process- based organization chart with process owners and key performance indicators. After the first cycle of Action Research, a strategic decision was taken to proceed along business specific units rather than group functions for order processing and credit management which were later merged. The To-Be models were compared to the As-Is models using the ordered questioning, general comparison and model outlay comparison methods. Outcome analysis is carried out where the important ideals are traced back through the analysis process to the point it is evaluable either quantitatively or qualitatively. Contribution to literature involved eight contributions from the BPR concept of standardization and integration, six in research methodology and three involving the BPR definition of dramatic improvements including the proposed guideline linking the level of process orientation in a company to the quantum change expected.

The RAFT agents used in these polymerizations were dibenzyl trithiocarbonate (DBTTC), s- 1 -dodecyl-s'-(α,α'-dimethyl-α-acetic acid) trithiocarbonate (MTTCD), s,s'-bis (2 -hydroxyethyl- 2 '-dimethylacrylate) trithiocarbonate (BDATC) and s-(2 -cyanoprop- 2 -yl) -s-dodecyltrithiocarbonate (CPTCD). The results indicated that the structure of the end-group of RAFT agents had significant effects on the ability to control polymerization.

The {{focus is on the}} stationary dynamics of the model and in particular on the effect of inhomogeneities in the interaction topology on the stationary behavior.

Markov chain aggregation is then used to derive a <b>macro</b> <b>chain</b> for the complete graph as well as a meso-level description for the two-community graph composed of two (weakly) coupled sub-communities. In both cases, a detailed understanding of the model behavior is possible using Markov chain tools.

We show that memory effects are introduced at the macro level when we aggregate over agent attributes without sensitivity to the microscopic details and quantify these effects using concepts from information theory. In this way, the method facilitates the analysis of the relation between microscopic processes and a their aggregation to a macroscopic level of description and informs about the complexity of a system introduced by heterogeneous interaction relations...|$|R

The resulting latex particles could then be transformed into a variety of nanostructures by cooling below the lower critical solution temperature of the thermoresponsive block {{in the presence of a}} plasticizer for polystyrene. The dominant structure was cylindrical worms with the observation of other structures including jelly fish and the rare disc.

Conventional {{supply chain}} {{integration}} concepts {{focus primarily on}} {{the internal and external}} integration of individual supply chains (can be viewed as intra-supply chain integration). Due to the highly integrated nature of petrochemical value chains, related supply chains should also be integrated by taking account of enterprise/industry-wide synergies and interdependencies (can be viewed as inter-supply chain integration). Inter-supply chain integration can typically develop along three dimensions: - Upstream feed clusters (upstream in the chemical value chain) - Downstream product clusters (downstream in the chemical value <b>chain)</b> - <b>Macro</b> logistics network clusters (within and across related logistics networks for liquid bulk, dry bulk, packaged goods and gases) This dissertation presents a generic framework of applicable intra- and inter-supply chain planning processes that supports related long- (strategic), medium- (tactical) and short-term (operational) supply chain decisions for large-scale petrochemical companies. This type of companies has to manage relative complex supply chains. Highly complex supply chains (due to an extensive product portfolio, supplier base, customer base, manufacturing processes, transportation, and management processes and systems) require far more advanced planning processes than simple supply chains. Advanced supply chain planning processes cover an extended supply chain scope, deal with longer time horizons, and utilize more sophisticated analytical techniques and decision support systems. An extensive literature study, supplemented by empirical research in the South African petrochemical industry, provided the foundation for the advanced supply chain planning framework concluded in this dissertation. Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire presented to an informed audience constitute the empirical research conducted. The related best practices, concepts, approaches followed, and level of advancement in three supply chain planning dimensions were derived. To guide petrochemical companies along the planning advancement journey, the roadmap developed can be utilized for the application and implementation of the advanced supply chain planning framework. This roadmap articulates the advancement stages, dimensions, characteristics, and triggers to advance. Typical characteristics associated with the advancement stages and dimensions provide the means for a company to assess their level of progression.

Both the common alpha and hormone-specific beta {{subunits}} contain Asn-linked N-glycan <b>chains.</b> Recently, <b>macro</b> heterogeneous FSH glycoforms consisting of beta-subunits that differ in N-glycan number were identified in pituitaries of several species and subsequently the recombinant human FSH glycoforms biochemically characterized. Although chemical modification and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis studies defined the roles of N-glycans on gonadotropin subunits, in vivo functional analyses in a whole-animal setting are lacking. Here, we have generated transgenic mice with gonadotrope-specific expression of either an HFSHBWT transgene that encodes human FSH beta WT subunit or an HFSHBdgc transgene that encodes a human FSH beta(Asn 7 Delta) (24 Delta) double N-glycosylation site mutant subunit, and separately introduced these transgenes onto Fshb null background using a genetic rescue strategy. We demonstrate that the human FSH beta Mn 7 Delta (24 Delta) double N-glycosylation site mutant subunit, unlike human FSH beta WT subunit, inefficiently combines with the mouse alpha-subunit in pituitaries of Fshb null mice. FSH dimer containing this mutant FSH beta subunit is inefficiently secreted with very low levels detectable in serum. Fshb null male mice expressing HFSHBdgc transgene are fertile and exhibit testis tubule size and sperm number {{similar to those of}} Fshb null mice. Fshb null female mice expressing the mutant, but not WT human FSH beta subunit containing FSH dimer are infertile, demonstrate no evidence of estrus cycles, and many of the FSH-responsive genes remain suppressed in their ovaries. Thus, HFSHBdgc unlike HFSHBWT transgene does not rescue Fshb null mice. Our genetic approach provides direct in vivo evidence that N-linked glycans on FSH beta subunit are essential for its efficient assembly with the a-subunit to form FSH heterodimer in pituitary. Our studies also reveal that N-glycans on FSH beta subunit are essential for FSH secretion and FSH in vivo bioactivity to regulate gonadal growth and physiology.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{synthesize}} complex macromolecular architectures such as dendrimers and dendronized polymers, and evaluate the effect from the dendrons on the optical and material properties. The work presented in this doctoral thesis, Dendrimers and Dendronized Polymers - Synthesis and Characterization, is divided into one minor and one major part. The first part deals with the synthesis and characterization of two sets of dendritic porphyrins based on 2, 2 -bis(methylol) propionic acid (bis-MPA). The second part deals with the synthesis and characterization of dendronized poly(hydroxyl ethyl methacylate), dendronized poly(norbornene), and dendronized triblock copolymers, were the pendant dendrons are based on bis-MPA. Both free-base and zinc containing dendritic porphyrins was synthesized up to the fifth generation by employing iterative ester coupling utilizing the acetonide protected anhydride of bis-MPA as generic building block. First and second generation dendron bearing methacrylates based on 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate were also synthesized by utilizing the acetonide protected anhydride of bis-MPA, and subsequently polymerized by atom transfer radical polymerization. By adopting a divergent “graft-to” approach starting from the first generation dendronized poly(hydroxyl ethyl methacrylate), well-defined dendronized polymers with acetonide, hydroxyl, acetate and hexadecyl surface functionality were obtained. By utilizing the same divergent iterative esterfication, first to fourth generation dendron functionalized norbornenes were synthesized. These monomers were polymerized by ring-opening metathesis polymerization, utilizing either Grubbs´ first or second generation catalyst. Acrylate functional first to fourth generation monomers were synthesized by the copper(I) catalyzed “click” coupling of azido functional dendrons and propargyl acrylate. The monomers were polymerized to dendronized triblock copolymers by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, utilizing a difunctional poly(methyl methacrylate) as <b>macro</b> <b>chain</b> transfer agent. The bulk properties of the dendronized poly(hydroxyl ethyl methacrylate) and poly(norbornene) were investigated by dynamic rheological measurements and differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that all the acetonide functional bis-MPA based dendronized polymers had glass transitions temperatures in a similar range. The rheological behaviour showed that for the dendronized polymers having the same backbone length the complex viscosity {{as a function of}} functionality was independent of the surface functionality of the polymer. The generation number of the polymer had a profound influence on the complex viscosity, changing form a Newtonian behaviour to a shear thinning behaviour when the generation of the dendrons was increased from two to four. The dendronized poly(norbornene) had increasingly shorter backbone lengths for each generational increase, and for the materials set with comparably lower degree of polymerization, the G’ part of the complex modulus was mostly affected by attaching larger dendrons. In the case of the sample set of higher degree of polymerization, the second, third, and fourth generation samples had similar slopes of the G’ and G” curves, indicating a similar relaxation behaviour.
