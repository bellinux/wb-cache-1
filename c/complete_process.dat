25|$|The Salon de la Section d'Or, held October 1912—the {{largest and}} most {{important}} public showing of Cubist works prior to World War I—exposed Cubism to a wider audience still. After the war, with support given by the dealer Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism returned to {{the front line of}} Parisian artistic activity. Various elements of the Groupe de Puteaux would mount two more large-scale Section d'Or exhibitions, in 1920 and in 1925, with the goal of revealing the <b>complete</b> <b>process</b> of transformation and renewal that had transpired since the onset of Cubism.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, it {{was decided}} by the Dowager Consorts (the four widows of the {{emperors}} before Puyi) {{that it was time}} for the 15-year-old Puyi to be married, although court politics dragged the <b>complete</b> <b>process</b> (from selecting the bride, up through the wedding ceremony) out for almost two years. Puyi saw marriage as his coming of age benchmark, when others would no longer control him. He was given four photographs to choose from. Puyi stated they all looked alike to him, with the exception of different clothing. He chose Wenxiu. Political factions within the palace made the actual choice as to whom Puyi would marry. The selection process alone took an entire year.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, {{with the}} support given by the dealer Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism {{returned}} as a central issue for artists. With the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, Gleizes attempted to resuscitate {{the spirit of the}} Section d'Or in 1920 but was met with great difficulty, despite support by Fernand Léger, Alexander Archipenko, Georges Braque, Constantin Brâncuși, Henri Laurens, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Louis Marcoussis and Léopold Survage. Gleizes' organizational efforts were directed towards the establishment of a European-wide movement of Cubist and abstract art {{in the form of a}} large traveling exhibition; the Exposition de la Section d’Or. The idea was to bring together a collection of works that revealed the <b>complete</b> <b>process</b> of transformation and renewal that had taken place. It was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was seen as passé for emerging artists and other established artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Picabia, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.|$|E

2500|$|Apples {{historically}} were {{an important}} crop. Bourdélots are apple dumplings, {{but the most}} typical speciality is black butter (lé nièr beurre), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices (especially liquorice). Although called butter, it does not contain any milk. It is traditional to hold black butter nights (séthées d'nièr beurre) in autumn. These are still an important traditional social occasion in country areas; the stirring must be maintained around the clock. [...] The <b>complete</b> <b>process</b> of making black butter, including the peeling of the apples, the stirring of the mixture in a large cauldron throughout the night, the camaraderie and the jarring up was recently recorded by the filmmaker D. Rusowsky for a 48-minute documentary to {{capture the essence of}} this ancient recipe and reveal the spirit of one on Jersey’s best kept secrets: its people. Reviving the tradition benefits not only people and communities but creates a fertile social environment supporting the conservation of traditional orchards, which are highly endangered.|$|E
2500|$|A {{quiescent}} {{solar wind}} flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts {{with it and}} can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', {{as opposed to being}} 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the bow shock. It can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere. Such replacement of [...] "hot" [...] electrons by [...] "cold" [...] ones is in complete accord with the 2nd law of thermodynamics. The <b>complete</b> <b>process,</b> which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.|$|E

60|$|The {{scale on}} which the service is carried on, is very large. It was begun in 1883, {{and by the end}} of 1887 no less than 60,000 sets of {{measures}} were in hand, but thus far only about one half of the persons arrested in Paris were measured, owing to the insufficiency of the staff. Arrangements were then made for its further extension. There are from 100 to 150 prisoners sentenced each day by the Courts of Law in Paris to more than a few days' imprisonment, and every one of these is sent to the Dépôt for twenty-four hours. While there, they are now submitted to Bertillonage, a newly coined word that has already come into use. This is done in the forenoon, by three operators and three clerks; six officials in all. About half of the prisoners are old offenders, of whom a considerable proportion give their names correctly, as is rapidly verified by an alphabetically arranged catalogue of cards, each of which contains front and profile photographs, and measurements. The remainder are examined strictly; their bodily marks are recorded according to a terse system of a few letters, and they are variously measured. Each person occupies seven or eight minutes. They are then photographed. From sixty to seventy-five prisoners go through this <b>complete</b> <b>process</b> every forenoon. In the afternoon the officials are engaged in making numerous copies of each set of records, one of which is sent to Lyon, and another to Marseille, where there are similar establishments. They also classify the copies of records that are received from those towns and elsewhere in France, of which from seventy to one hundred arrive daily. Lastly, they search the Registers for duplicate sets of measures of those, whether in Paris or in the provinces, who were suspected of having given false names. The entire staff consists of ten persons. It is difficult to rightly interpret the figures given in the pamphlet (4) at pp. 22-24, as they appear to disagree, but as I understand them, 562 prisoners who gave false names in the year 1890 were recognised by Bertillonage, and only four other persons were otherwise discovered to have been convicted previously, who had escaped recognition by its means.|$|E
