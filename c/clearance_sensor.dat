40|$|NASA {{programs}} {{that focus on}} the use of fiber optics for aircraft engine/inlet control are reviewed. Fiber optics for aircraft control is attractive because of its inherent immunity to EMI and RFI noise. Optical signals can be safely transmitted through areas that contain flammable or explosive materials. The use of optics also makes remote sensing feasible by eliminating the need for electrical wires to be connected between sensors and computers. Using low-level optical signals to control actuators is also feasible when power is generated at the actuator. Each application of fiber optics for aircraft control has different requirements for both the optical cables and the optical connectors. Sensors that measure position and speed by using slotted plates can use lossy cables and bundle connectors if data transfer is in the parallel mode. If position and speed signals are multiplexed, cable and connector requirements change. Other sensors that depend on changes in transmission through materials require dependable characteristics of both the optical cables and the optical connectors. A variety of sensor types are reviewed, including rotary position encoders, tachometers, temperature sensors, and blade tip <b>clearance</b> <b>sensors</b> for compressors and turbines. Research on a gallium arsenide photoswitch for optically switched actuators that operate at 250 C is also described...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of new active tip clearance control and structural health monitoring schemes in turbine engines {{and other types of}} rotating machinery requires sensors that are highly accurate and can operate in a high temperature environment. The use of a microwave sensor to acquire blade tip clearance and tip timing measurements is being explored at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The microwave blade tip <b>clearance</b> <b>sensor</b> works on principles that are very similar to a short range radar system. The sensor sends a continuous microwave signal towards a target and measures the reflected signal. The phase difference of the reflected signal is directly proportional to the distance between the sensor and the target being measured. This type of sensor is beneficial in that it has the ability to operate at extremely high temperatures and is unaffected by contaminants that may be present in turbine engines. The use of microwave sensors for this application is a new concept. Techniques on calibrating the sensors along with installation effects are not well quantified as they are for other sensor technologies. Developing calibration techniques and evaluating installation effects are essential in using these sensors to make tip clearance and tip timing measurements. As a means of better understanding these issues, the microwave sensors were used on a bench top calibration rig, a large axial vane fan, and a turbofan. Background on the microwave tip <b>clearance</b> <b>sensor,</b> an overview of their calibration, and the results from their use on the axial vane fan and the turbofan will be presented in this paper.

40|$|The {{development}} of techniques for the in-situ measurement and structural health {{monitoring of the}} rotating components in gas turbine engines is of major interest to NASA. As part of this on-going effort, several experiments have been undertaken to develop methods for detecting cracks and measuring strain on rotating turbine engine like disks. Previous methods investigated have included the use of blade tip <b>clearance</b> <b>sensors</b> to detect the presence of cracks by monitoring the change in measured blade tip clearance and analyzing the combined disk-rotor system's vibration response. More recently, an experiment utilizing a novel optical Moir based concept has been conducted on a subscale turbine engine disk to demonstrate a potential strain measurement and crack detection technique. Moir patterns result from the overlap of two repetitive patterns with slightly different spacing. When this technique is applied to a rotating disk, {{it has the potential}} to allow for the detection of very small changes in spacing and radial growth in a rotating disk due to a flaw such as a crack. This investigation was a continuation of previous efforts undertaken in 2011 - 2012 to validate this optical concept. The initial demonstration attempted on a subscale turbine engine disk was inconclusive due to the minimal radial growth experienced by the disk during operation. For the present experiment a new subscale Aluminum disk was fabricated and improvements were made to the experimental setup to better demonstrate the technique. A circular reference pattern was laser etched onto a subscale engine disk and the disk was operated at speeds up to 12 000 rpm as a means of optically monitoring the Moir created by the shift in patterns created by the radial growth due the presence of the simulated crack. Testing was first accomplished on a clean defect free disk as a means of acquiring baseline reference data. A notch was then machined in to the disk to simulate a crack and testing was repeated for the purposes of demonstrating the concept. Displacement data was acquired using external blade tip clearance and shaft displacement sensors as a means of confirming the optical data and for validating other sensor based crack detection techniques...|$|R

40|$|Tripping and {{slipping}} {{are serious}} health {{concerns for the}} elderly because they result in life threatening injuries i. e., fractures and high medical costs. Our recent work in detection of tripping gait patterns has demonstrated that minimum toe clearance (MTC) is a sensitive falls risk predictor. MTC measurement has previously been done in gait laboratories and on treadmills which potentially imposes controlled walking conditions. In this paper, we describe a prototype design of a wireless device for monitoring vertical toe <b>clearance.</b> The <b>sensors</b> consists of a tri-axis accelerometer and dual-axis gyroscope connected to Crossbow sensor motes for wireless data transmission. Sensor data are transmitted to a laptop and displayed on a Matlab graphic user interface (GUI). We have performed zero base and treadmill experiments to investigate sensor performance to environmental variations and compared the calculated toe clearance against measurements made by an Optotrak motion system. It was found that device outputs were approximately independent of small ambient temperature variations, had a reliable range of 20 m indoors and 50 m outdoors and a maximum transmission rate of 20 packets/s. Toe clearance measurements were found to follow the Optotrak measurement trend but could be improved further by dealing with double integration errors and improving data transmission rates...|$|R
40|$|Part 10 : Internet of ThingsInternational audienceWireless {{sensor network}} {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} components of the Internet of Things. With the growing use of wireless sensor networks in commercial and military, data security is a critical problem in these applications. Considerable security works have been studied. However, the majority of these works based on the scenarios that the sensitivities of data in the networks are in the same. In this paper, we present a cluster-based multilevel security model that enforces information flow from low security level to high security level. The design of the model is motivated by the observation that sensor nodes in numerous applications have different security clearances. In these scenarios, it is not enough for just protecting the data at a single level. The multilevel security mechanism is needed to prevent the information flow from high level nodes to low level nodes. We give the formal description of the model and present a scheme to achieve it. In our model, sensor nodes are grouped into different clusters. In each cluster, the security <b>clearance</b> of <b>sensor</b> nodes must not be higher than the security clearance of the cluster head.

The novel approach requires fewer calculations, i. e. less computational time. Obstacle detection algorithms were investigated, in order to perform safe motion control, in an environment with unknown overhanging obstacles. We describe a two dimensional (2 D) laser sensor application, and optimal sensor configurations for mounting a monocular camera to monitor path ahead <b>clearance.</b> Two different <b>sensors</b> are used, a vision sensor and a scanning laser, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). While LIDAR measures the precise distance to the object, it cannot detect low objects and overhanging obstacles due to its predefined, constant, scanning height and angle. In contrast, vision sensor provides 2 D scenery information with relatively poor distance information. To compensate for the drawbacks of these two sensors, the sensor fusion method for obstacle detection of AGV is proposed. Size expansion cue algorithm is deployed to achieve that goal. Proposed method is validated experimentally...|$|R

In this paper, we present a cluster-based multilevel security model that enforces information flow from low-security level nodes to high-security level nodes to prevent information leakage. We give the formal description of the model and present a scheme to achieve it. In our model, sensor nodes are grouped into different clusters. In each cluster, the security <b>clearance</b> of <b>sensor</b> nodes must not be higher than the security clearance of the cluster head, and if a sensor node has a relay node, the <b>sensor</b> node <b>clearance</b> must be lower than the relay node clearance. We use cryptography techniques to enforce the information flow policy of this model. The higher-level nodes can derive the keys of lower-level nodes and get the information using the derived keys. Keywords-wireless sensor network; multi-level security; access control; In this paper, we propose a cluster-based multilevel security model to address the problem, in which all sensor nodes and cluster heads have different security clearances. The WSN is modeled as a tree, in which the base station is the root, and each cluster is the subtree. In each cluster, the security clearances of all nodes are lower than the clearance of the cluster head, and the clearances of nodes are decreased from the root to leaf. In our model, each information has a classification, only the nodes whose clearance is higher than the classification can read and relay the information. We give the formal description of the model and achieve the prototype of it. To achieve this model, we present a cluster head election algorithm and a cluster routing algorithm to build the multilevel security topology of WSN, and give a hierarchical key computation scheme to enforce the information flow control.
