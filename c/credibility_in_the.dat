5|$|As a senator, McGovern was an {{exemplar of}} modern American liberalism. He became most {{known for his}} outspoken {{opposition}} to the growing U.S.involvement in the Vietnam War. He staged a brief nomination run in the 1968 presidential election as a stand-in for the assassinated Robert F. Kennedy. The subsequent McGovern–Fraser Commission fundamentally altered the presidential nominating process, by greatly {{increasing the number of}} caucuses and primaries and reducing the influence of party insiders. The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment sought to end the Vietnam War by legislative means but was defeated in 1970 and 1971. McGovern's long-shot, grassroots-based 1972 presidential campaign found triumph in gaining the Democratic nomination but left the party badly split ideologically, and the failed vice-presidential pick of Thomas Eagleton undermined McGovern's <b>credibility.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> general election McGovern lost to incumbent Richard Nixon in one of the biggest landslides in American electoral history. Re-elected Senator in 1968 and 1974, McGovern was defeated in a bid for a fourth term in 1980.|$|E

It {{may also be a}} matter of U.S. <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MENA region, where America was sharply criticized for seemingly applying a double-standard in the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections – encouraging free and fair elections, only to withdraw aid and diplomatically boycott the new government when Hamas emerged the victor.|$|E

Accordingly, Jones preached that the Temple must move to Redwood Valley, California. Jones led approximately 140 members, half of whom were Black, to Redwood Valley in July 1965 and officially opened his church in Redwood Valley, California. The addition of deputy district attorney Timothy Stoen greatly increased the Temple's <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, quickly increasing membership.|$|E

25|$|In Colombia, however, a wave {{of attacks}} by the FARC in June seemed to undo the {{progress}} made in Havana. Sabotage to energy infrastructure left Buenaventura and Tumaco without electricity, 13,000 barrels of oil were spilled in Putumayo, a power pylon in Caquetá was bombed and a police colonel was assassinated in Ipiales. These attacks left over one million people without electricity, and the attacks against oil infrastructure created an environmental catastrophe. With these actions, the FARC had sought to regain the military initiative after the hits they suffered from the military in May and put political pressure on the government, but analysts judged that the guerrilla had miscalculated as it had further reduced their <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of the public.|$|E

25|$|Germany's {{policy was}} {{to support a}} swift war to destroy Serbia that would present a fait accompli to the world. Unlike the three earlier cases dating from 1912 when Austria had asked for German {{diplomatic}} support for a war against Serbia, {{this time it was}} felt that political conditions for such a war now existed. At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia as the best way of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an Austro-Serbian war would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved not waiting to complete judicial inquiries to strike back immediately and not to strain its <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination. Likewise, Germany wished to give the impression of its ignorance of Austrian intentions.|$|E
25|$|However, due to {{his poor}} {{performance}} in economy and diplomacy, Roh was not a popular president, having the worst approval rating on average ever recorded in South Korean political history. His economic policy was often criticized for persisting with certain obsolete economic views and failing certain livelihood issues. There had been a considerable diplomatic dissonance between South Korea and its traditional allies during Roh's presidency as well. Former Bush administration officials such as Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates, in their memoirs published, claimed that Roh was anti-American and disclosed {{that there had been}} numerous conflicts between the U.S. and South Korea because of Roh's unpredictability. There has been criticism that Roh's anti-Americanism, nationalism, and pro-North Korean views contributed to a contradiction in diplomacy and impaired <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international community. It also led to a decline in some of his popular support, especially among the older generation.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{began to}} {{question}} Hogan's trustworthiness and <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{weeks leading up to}} Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel {{for the first time in}} WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.|$|E

500|$|The {{disclosure}} of the deception in 1995, following investigations into the Ames case, led to a media stir and heavy congressional criticism. The Agency's Inspector General, Frederick Hitz, identified 12 CIA personnel he deemed responsible for the lapse, including three former directors; CIA Director John M. Deutch criticized seven of these employees, calling the affair [...] "a major intelligence failure". A damage assessment determined that the disinformation altered intelligence analyses of the Soviet (and later Russian) military {{towards the end of}} the Cold War, creating a false impression of Soviet strength; however, initial charges that the faulty reports led to billions of dollars' worth of Pentagon spending proved to be exaggerated. Regardless, the revelation further undermined the CIA's <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the Ames case.|$|E
500|$|He became {{president}} of the Australian Academy of Science in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir Mark Oliphant, but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961–63. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet's personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he [...] "made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia".|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, {{like many}} other U.S. media sources, the Times had {{suffered}} from a decline in public perceptions of <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. from 2004 to 2012. A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations.

Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's On the Media, writing for The New York Times, says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that [...] "Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation." ...|$|E

500|$|Amnesty International in 2006 {{said it was}} “continuing {{to analyze}} sources of information” about the allegations. David Ownby, a {{professor}} of history at of the University of Montreal and expert on Falun Gong, wrote in Falun Gong and the Future of China that Falun Gong practitioners were probable candidates for organ harvesting in Chinese prisons. However, he felt that Falun Gong spokespersons [...] "overplayed their hand" [...] with the concentration camp allegations, potentially losing <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of neutral observers, despite the real persecution they were suffering. A Congressional Research Service report by Thomas Lum said that the report relies on logical inferences and telephone call transcripts which, he suggested, may not be credible. Glen McGregor of the Ottawa Citizen was skeptical about the logistical plausibility of the allegations after visiting Sujiatun at the invitation of the Chinese Medical Association. He said that, depending on who you believe, [...] "the Kilgour–Matas report is either compelling evidence that proves the claims about Falun Gong ... or a collection of conjecture and inductive reasoning that fails to support its own conclusions".|$|E

After asserting {{prior to its}} release that it was [...] "bound {{to be one of}} the most dissected pop collections in years", Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the album [...] "rivals the force and the power of It Takes a Nation" [...] while [...] "maintaining commercial and artistic <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fast-changing rap world" [...] with original music. USA Todays Edna Gundersen called it [...] "a masterpiece of innovation [...] challenging music" [...] that makes the group's pro-black lyrics more interesting and plausible. Rolling Stone magazine's Alan Light praised Public Enemy's self-assured and realistic lyrics, and viewed the album as a deeper, more focused version of [...] "the careening rage of Nation of Millions". Greg Sandow of Entertainment Weekly found it powerfully relevant to contemporary American culture and unparalleled by anything in popular music: [...] "It sounds like a partly African, partly postmodern collage, stitched together on tumultuous urban streets." [...] Tom Moon of The Philadelphia Inquirer observed [...] "some of the genre's most sophisticated sound designs and unconventionally agile rapping" [...] on the album and called it [...] "a major piece of work, the first hard evidence of rap's maturity and a measure of its continuing relevance".|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 Cooney took {{a leave of absence}} from WNDT and, funded by Carnegie Corporation, {{traveled}} the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. [...] She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled [...] "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education". [...] The report, which Gikow called [...] "a schematic for the show Sesame Street would become", described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). [...] Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show's funding sources. [...] Davis credited Cooney's motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, as she put it, [...] "make a difference". [...] She later told an interviewer, [...] "I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor people that would be watched by a handful of the convinced, but I was never really going to have an influence on my times". [...] She later told Davis, [...] "Preschoolers were not necessarily my thing. [...] It was using television in a constructive way that turned me on".|$|E

[...] Scott Shelter from PopCrush wrote that, [...] "Despite the track's lack of originality, the beat is irresistible, and its lyrics about staying out all night are likely to resonate with summer partiers," [...] and concluded by writing that it is [...] "a song that succeeds in spite of its shortcomings." [...] A writer for Beatweek magazine praised Derulo for sampling [...] "Day-O" [...] into the song's chorus, writing that [...] "'Don't Wanna Go Home' is yet the latest evidence that Derulo can create a song in any genre, using any kind of samples, and turn it into a hit." [...] Robbie Daw from Idolator wrote that, [...] "Compared to his last few mediocre offerings, this single actually seems to have some fire" [...] courtesy of the samples in the song. However, Daw concluded by writing that [...] "if Derulo wants to achieve any kind of <b>credibility</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pop world, he'd better establish his own sound fast." [...] Meena Rupani from DesiHits felt that Derulo [...] "should think twice before he takes his lyrics from others." [...] Shahryar Rizvi from Dallas Observer called Derulo a [...] "lousy sampler", writing that [...] "all this song boasts is Derulo throwing airballs".
