500|$|Between {{the late}} 16th and the 18th centuries, [...] was a common, coarse synonym for prostitute; William Shakespeare used it with that meaning in The Merry Wives of Windsor (1602) and Measure for Measure (1603-4, {{published}} 1623 in First Folio). The term eventually came to describe [...] "a young male hustler, a gangster, a hoodlum, or a ruffian". As Legs McNeil explains, [...] "On TV, if you watched cop shows, Kojak, Baretta, when the cops finally catch the mass murderer, they'd say, 'you dirty Punk.'

[...] Hanna indicated {{that he was willing}} to come to terms with Roosevelt on two conditions: [...] that Roosevelt carry out McKinley's political agenda, and that the President cease from his habit of calling Hanna [...] "old man", something which greatly annoyed the senator.

500|$|In August 1967, {{just prior}} to {{recording}} sessions for the WCPAEB's third Reprise album, Shaun Harris took a hiatus from the band. His departure was partly due to his disillusionment with the group, primarily with the WCPAEB's lack of success, and it served as a waiting period while his brother, Danny, was being treated for depression. He formed the California Spectrum with Danny, Lloyd, and Jimmy Greenspoon. The group toured the Midwest with Markley's state-of-the-art light show, and released two singles in its brief recording career, [...] "Sassafras" [...] (the same version featured on Volume One) and a cover of the Left Banke's [...] "She May <b>Call</b> <b>You</b> Up Tonight", none of which were met with much attention. When Harris returned to the WCPAEB in 1968, he touted a completely different line-up, and promoted the California Spectrum with his column in the teen zine Tiger Beat until the group disbanded sometime in early 1969.|$|E
500|$|Contrary to the lukewarm {{response}} to the pilot, [...] "Diversity Day" [...] earned positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode positive reviews, stating that: [...] "Think of the toss-off racism of the original, plopped into a PC-gone-wrong showcase that might be entitled The Accidental Bigot. As when the African-American diversity trainer introduces himself as Mr. Brown, and Scott assures him, 'I will not <b>call</b> <b>you</b> that.'" [...] Ricky Gervais, who was {{the lead in the}} British series, stated that, in comparison to the British version, [...] "It is as good. I love the fact that, apart from the first one, the scripts are all original. You've gone back to the blueprint of what the characters are and you've started from there, as opposed to copying anything." [...] Rolling Stone magazine named the scene wherein Michael shows the office his diversity video the third greatest Moment from The Office. The article particularly praised Michael's line: [...] "Abraham Lincoln once said, 'If you are a racist, I will attack you with the North.|$|E
500|$|Finally, a Bedouin story {{states that}} Allah created the Arabian horse {{from the south}} wind and exclaimed, [...] "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I {{establish}} thee {{as one of the}} Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings." [...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature out of you. Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I <b>call</b> <b>you</b> Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the early}} {{release of the}} lyrics, it had {{garnered}} criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona, claiming that the usage of the terms [...] "chola" [...] and [...] "orient" [...] was offensive and derogatory. In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned {{the use of the}} term [...] "chola", asking, [...] "Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must <b>call,</b> <b>you</b> must not stop, you must protest peaceably." ...|$|E
500|$|After the show, {{the band}} posted a public {{statement}} about the incident, thanking their fans for coming despite of the risks involved, and blessing the radicals: [...] "We are proud to <b>call</b> <b>you</b> {{our brothers and sisters}} in Christ.

Extra special hails to our fans who had the balls to come although they knew it could be dangerous. Antestor salutes you and be blessed." [...] In a newspaper interview with the Norwegian Christian newspaper Dagen two days following the band's safe return to Norway, bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen said that he had prepared himself for the worst-case scenario that the tour could end in death, and he reiterates the band's gratitude to the aggressive Brazilian Satanists stating: [...] "We're now twice as big in Brazil as we were before we went there." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2009–10 campaign, manager Mark Stimson {{admitted}} he was undecided {{as to whether}} Julian or Simon Royce would start in the club's opening fixture of the season. Julian ultimately started in the club's 5–0 home win against Swindon Town {{on the first day}} of the season. After three straight defeats in the space of a week with Gillingham conceding seven goals, Julian was replaced by Royce ahead of the club's League Cup game against Blackburn Rovers. After the game, Julian only featured twice in the space of four months, both appearances coming in Football League Trophy fixtures. Julian handed in a transfer request in November 2009 as a result of a lack of first-team appearances. However, Gillingham received no offers for the player, with manager Mark Stimson saying [...] "I haven't had a phone call. He's been on the loan circuit for four to six weeks and I haven't had a <b>call.</b> <b>You</b> don't just say I'm on the transfer list and six teams come in for you". He remained at Gillingham, and after appearing in Gillingham's 2–1 away loss at Huddersfield Town in December 2009, Julian remained as a first choice goalkeeper until the end of the season. The club went the whole season without an away victory, and were relegated back to League Two on the final day of the season following a 3–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. Julian made 33 appearances during the 2009–10 season, keeping eight clean sheets.|$|E
