40|$|The {{emergence}} of ability {{testing in the}} United States during the early 20 th century sparked interest in identifying students for placement in advanced academic programs (for a review see Kaufman et al., in press). Early on, administrators used IQ scores almost exclusively as the criterion for placing students in advanced academic programs. However, not long after Lewis Terman first used intelligence tests to identify “gifted ” school-children, psychologists and educators in the United States appealed for broader conceptions of learning that specifically included creativity (e. g., Guilford, 1950; Marland, 1972). These calls for broadened conceptions of learning were fortified by researchers (e. g., Torrance, 1959 a, 1959 b, 1959 c; Yamamoto, 1964) who demonstrated empirical links between creativity and academic achievement. Unfortunately, the prototypical K– 12 curriculum often fails to include creative thinking as an explicit <b>curricular</b> <b>goal.</b> The situation is somewhat better in the curriculum and instruction of advanced academic programs where creativity typically is identi-fied as an important ability to be cultivated.

40|$|The role of {{the puppet}} in {{creating}} <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> in kindergarten The master's thesis, entitled The {{role of the}} puppet in creating <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> in kindergarten, focuses on using the puppet (in the broadest sense) for achieving <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> in kindergarten activities. The main purpose of the research was to set out the reasons for introducing puppets in all curricular activities in individual areas {{on the basis of}} theoretical grounds, viewpoints and experience of kindergarten teachers. Playing with puppets enhances social relations in class, unburdens, relaxes and establishes interpersonal relations, and enables nonverbal communication between the participants. The thesis outlines the views and research of certain authors who established that communication and socialisation are more successful if a child learns to manipulate puppets in the preschool period, thus reducing stress while communicating with unknown adults. In addition, teachers can identify the child's psychological processes while he is playing with the puppet: his emotional development, general cognitive development and imagination. In this way, the use of simple puppetry techniques while achieving <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> helps the child to learn comprehensively. The empirical part of the master's thesis examines the opinions of kindergarten teachers about using puppets for achieving <b>curricular</b> <b>goals.</b> The results suggest that teachers have a positive attitude towards using puppets for achieving <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> from various perspectives: symbolic play, communication, socialisation, and creativity. However, they choose this option rather rarely. We established that the method of working with a puppet as well as using and mastering the <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> with the puppet should be expanded. In addition, the puppet should be integrated into the kindergarten curriculum, because the majority of the teachers who daily use both the kindergarten curriculum and puppets support the idea. The teachers also confirmed that a puppet is an ideal means of conveying curricular content in the areas of art, drama, dance and music, but the teachers require more profound knowledge of other puppetry methods. They also feel that a puppet can establish a link between the child and an adult and between the child and the kindergarten. The descriptive and causal non-experimental methods of pedagogical research were used in the thesis. The opinions of the teachers about using a puppet for mastering <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> were obtained through a questionnaire, which involved a five-level Likert scale with open-ended and closed-ended questions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to redefine and {{validate}} science education <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> for grades K- 12 in the 1980 s. Goals were obtained through a survey of recent educational literature. The goals were then compiled into an instrument, Science Education <b>Curricular</b> <b>Goals</b> for Validation, which was mailed to 100 science educators for validation by ranking each of the goals on a 1 - 7 scale (with 1 being the least important and 7 being the most important). The science educators were randomly selected from the membership of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching, an organization dedicated to research in science education with a United States membership of 582 as of October 1980. The sample of 100 science educators represented 17 % of the total United States membership. Medians and ranks for each of the 17 goals were calculated and the additional goals suggested by respondents, organized with minimal editing, were reported. The results of the study indicated that, although there was some agreement on the initial 17 goals in the instrument, there was also considerable disagreement as evidenced by the suggestions from respondents of 41 additional goals. The highest goal was one dealing with the processes, concepts, principles, and generalizations of sciences. The lowest ranked goal was one dealing with the integration of the humanities and the sciences. In the additional 41 goals suggested by respondents, there were several that were in direct opposition to those in the original 17 or to those additionally suggested by respondents.

These alternatives are understood as competing social imaginaries with different premises and logics. This chapter offers an empirical exploration of how the IBD’s <b>curricular</b> <b>goal</b> of ‘international-mindedness’ is interpreted firstly in current official documents, then reinterpreted by teachers and students in three case study schools in Australia.

40|$|Information Literacy (IL) is {{the ability}} to {{effectively}} locate, evaluate, and synthesize information to enhance one’s knowledge. The development of IL skills is a <b>curricular</b> <b>goal</b> for undergraduate biology programs at large public universities. Studies show that there is a discrepancy between students’ perception of their ability to locate credible scientific sources, and their actual ability to do so. The first step in developing these skills is the knowledge of the type, quality, and source of information. Efforts have been made to facilitate the development of these skills in advanced biology courses, but to a lesser extent in introductory courses. In this study, we assessed the impact of a semester-long project, designed to address this need, on the ability of students to categorize sources of scientific information. Student responses to questions about published scientific literature were collected pre- and post- semester. Using qualitative coding, we identified emerging themes centered around students’ descriptions of various scientific resources.

40|$|History teachers, teacher–researchers, {{government}} agencies and history education academics in England often report that students are frequently incapable of producing complex, polythetic or developmental narratives over long time scales. This lack of an overview tends to result in deficiencies in their application of the key concepts of the discipline. Consequently Shemilt has recommended the use of synoptic, millennia-wide ‘frameworks’ of knowledge in order to counteract these issues.

I conducted an exploratory case study investigating in what ways a pre-taught framework, in which I had responded to some practitioners’ criticisms, appeared to be manifested in my students’ subsequent thinking regarding historical significance. My goal was to contribute to professional curricular theorising about what constitutes a framework and how it might be expressed as a <b>curricular</b> <b>goal.</b> Themes were derived from pupils’ writing, lesson evaluations, group interviews and observations.

Participants were 290 Greek junior high school PE teachers. Two years after the introduction of the new curriculum, participants responded to de-identified questionnaires with acceptable psychometric properties. Mastery-oriented and high self-efficacious teachers had positive attitudes towards the new curriculum, implemented the biggest number of teaching plans and they intended to do the same in the future. Performance approach goal orientation had low positive relationship with the implementation of teaching plans and no relationship with intention to do the same in the future, while performance avoidance goal was not related to any determinant of curriculum implementation and intention. The effects of mastery goal orientation on intention and behaviour were mediated by self-efficacy to achieve an educational aim which is an end in itself, that is, the promotion of students' self-regulation in exercise settings.

The challenge is to negotiate how this orientation might sit alongside the more traditional mission of mass school curriculum in building collective ballast for a national identity through a common morality and shared narratives, or may conflict with efforts to protect and promote indigenous and minority identities. As a case study of how these agendas interact, this chapter will consider curricular responses to global imperatives in the variegated conditions across the Australasian region (defined as Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea). The chapter will outline recent developments in the social, economic and political contexts surrounding curricular reforms in these settings, and demonstrate how these developments have changed the conditions of possibility and strength of purpose behind efforts to internationalise school curricula. Three types of systemic responses are then described: firstly, an appetite for globally branded curricula such as the International Baccalaureate, Montessori, and Cambridge University Certificates to distinguish some in a stratified market; secondly, convergence in curriculum to improve national performance on international standardised tests; and thirdly, the infusion of cosmopolitan sensibilities, regional identities and intercultural competencies as a core <b>curricular</b> <b>goal</b> for all.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 2000 s, educators, administrators, politicians, and {{researchers}} have given increased {{attention to the}} potential affordances of video games for educating K- 12 and university learners. This {{has led to the}} instantiation of numerous game-based learning (GBL) journals, investigations of efficacy, achievement, and motivation using multimillion dollar tools, and a federally-funded competition for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics game development. Yet, {{little is known about the}} way particular game mechanics, narrative structures, and community-driven tools (e. g., forums, cheat guides, mods) influence the skills needed to be a successful 21 st century learner. Few studies have catalogued the particular actions and thoughts of particular players playing particular games, and even fewer have addressed the possible affordances of narrative, co-constructed storytelling, and student agency in educational game environments. In response, this dissertation discusses how increased emphasis on intentionality, game design, and narrative may expand on not just what is known about games and gameplay but also how educators can leverage game mechanics, embedded social collaboration, and stories toward the fulfillment of complex objectives like transfer and <b>curricular</b> <b>goal</b> adoption. Qualitative data collected from a text-based, dual alternate reality-roleplaying game was used to conduct grounded theory analysis of emergent player-game-context relationships across a five-month period. Findings suggest that GBL may be optimally studied as dynamic, in-the-moment agent-environment interactions rather than single-purpose independent variables.

40|$|Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) {{has been}} a force in {{education}} for more than 25 years. Yet WAC in chemistry might seem still something of a mystery, especially for the chemist new to teaching or to the language studies teacher unfamiliar with conventions of thinking and writing in chemistry. Fortunately, teachers in higher education who wish to explore the uses of writing in chemistry have a wealth of material to draw from in the literature. Our review of that material is intended {{to address the needs}} of those teachers who want to get started using writing in their chemistry classrooms. Thus, the focus will be primarily on practical matters. We begin by pointing to studies that suggest why WAC can be useful, then turn to reports of successful approaches to using writing at all levels of the chemistry curriculum. Additional resources are listed at the end of this article. Why Writing Is Useful in the Classroom Writing Across the Curriculum, as a pedagogical strategy, has at-tracted teachers because it offers a way of teaching subject-area knowl-edge at the same time it facilitates the development of thinking and writing skills (Britton, et al. 1975). Writing in subject areas also encourages stu-dents to learn communication and other social interaction skills, which educators and industry professionals believe are critical to succeeding in the workplace (Stark, et al. 1986). However, to take full advantage of WAC theory and practices, faculty and administrators must look to writing as more than an end product, a <b>curricular</b> <b>goal</b> in itself. Instead, they must also see writing as the means to the end, as a way students can learn by exploring ideas and making connections between them (Madigan, Writing 1987). Some faculty, intent on incorporating writing into their classroom, focus so heavily on the end products of writing that their effort might b...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how learner {{independence}} was implemented as a <b>curricular</b> <b>goal</b> at a tertiary level Preparatory Programme (PP) in the United Arab Emirates. This exploratory-interpretive case study shows how {{students and teachers}} at the English programme responded to an Independent Learning Log (ILL) and how they interpreted learner autonomy {{with respect to the}} ILL. The study analyzes how various interpretations of autonomy affected the students’ and teachers’ attitudes towards the ILL. The interviews and the surveys used in this study were conducted between 20122014. The data was examined using Critical Discourse Analysis and was coded with NVivo software. As a result of the data analysis, the researcher identified themes related to student and teacher roles in the promotion of autonomy, learner representations in TESOL, and issues of control and agency, in the language classroom and out-of-class. The findings suggest that, in the teachers’ discourse, students are assigned passive roles and are often represented as lacking, deficient, and in need of control. Furthermore, the teachers are represented as the agents and controllers of education. These findings are supported by other studies from different cultural settings. This suggests that the US and THEM divide is not unique to the context of this study, but, rather, that it reflects a broader issue that is characteristic of TESOL discourse. In the discussion section, the researcher demonstrates how the themes identified in this study draw on a Social Order perspective in education. It is argued that this conceptual model remains ingrained in teachers’ and students’ group consciousness as the default model for learning. We conclude that learner independence as an educational goal is incompatible with this way in which students and teachers conceptualise education. In order for autonomy to become a feasible educational goal, we need to re-think how we organise language learning and what roles teachers and students assign each other. Overall, this case study reveals the problems that educators may face when promoting autonomy in a language programme. An understanding of these issues may help future language programmes develop better strategies towards fostering learner autonomy at an institutional level...|$|E

Introduction [...] The learner as discursive {{practitioner}} [...] The curriculum [...] The learners [...] Researching {{the curriculum}} [...] Interaction {{in the curriculum}} [...] Conclusion. The study is {{an account of the}} conceptualisation, design, implementation and evaluation of an innovative curriculum in an EFL (English as a Foreign Language) proficiency program in Japan. The study takes the form of an interpretative case study and monitors classroom interaction of learners who are 'false beginners' (British tradition) or 'interactive novices' (US tradition) in a process syllabus, where learners must 'co-construcf, or negotiate together, the planning, management, presentation and evaluation of substantial elements of the curriculum, in peer groups. A central element is the theorising of discourse in terms of a system of social relations and symbolic power; as a mode of social practice, and focuses on contrasting subject positions of learners and their investment in classroom discourse in different EFL settings. In this way, the crucial issue is the translation of power and control into principles of communication, which become their carriers or relays (Bernstein 1996 : 93). [...] The context of the study is the transition of young Japanese learners from the foreign language pedagogic practices of high school to university. It therefore includes a critical review of the sociocultural context of foreign language pedagogy in Japanese high schools, and the way that the pedagogic subject tends to be constructed: restricted to responsive roles, often in the learners' first language. The innovative curriculum described here (hereafter the Kanda Curriculum) is a response to this situation and aims to transform learners' institutional experience of foreign language pedagogy by shifting the locus of discursive control ('framing') away from the teacher to the learners, involving a very different 'speech exchange system' (Sacks et al. 1974) and hence more active/signifying and less responsive roles by learners. A pivotal assumption is the Foucaultian idea (1969) that a change in the order of discourse is not a trivial change, it amounts to a transformation in social practice and hence consciousness of the individual. [...] The <b>curricular</b> <b>goal</b> is to provide opportunities for learners to engage in sustained collaborative problem-solving in the target language, which stands in contrast with the more usual implicit goal of learners' 'acquiring' a second or foreign language. The curriculum is aimed at a prospective identity for learners; one which is built around the idea of the acquisition of 'communication': actively signifying in the target language across a range of situations and activities. [...] The research component of the study empirically explores how different activities in the curriculum differentially afford opportunities for participation by learners; in other words, how the 'contexts' of talk and activity mutually (re) configure each other, and empirical links between activity and discourse types are demonstrated and discussed. In this way, the thesis explores the potential for communicative practices in foreign language education, and is especially relevant to relatively monolingual societies where the target language is seldom used in the wider community.

40|$|This {{small-scale}} {{action research}} project explores the possibilities and challenges involved in facilitating Social Studies Teachers {{in understanding the}} notion and practices of the curricular enrichment process in their classroom contexts. The effort {{is based on the}} rationale that the curriculum needs to be enriched in order to maximize the attainment of set <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> and objectives. However, the assumption is that in most cases the <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> and objectives are not satisfactorily met due to the teachers: a) limited access to and understanding of <b>curricular</b> <b>goals</b> and objectives, and b) limited knowledge and expertise in effective implementation of the curriculum. In this background, the project sees, curriculum enrichment, as one of the important ways in assuring the attainment of goals and objectives of the curriculum. To realize this aim, the action researcher worked with two secondary level Social Studies teachers in a private school of Karachi, Pakistan. In this regard, the project studies the existing perceptions and practices of curriculum enrichment of the teachers. Subsequently, a strategic action plan was prepared and implemented to facilitate the teachers 2 ̆ 7 understanding and practice of curriculum enrichment. Subsequent planning and action remained responsive to any need for change arising out of the experiences of implementing the previous one. The data for the action process was collected through semi-structured interviews, lesson observations notes, researcher 2 ̆ 7 s and teachers 2 ̆ 7 reflective journals and tape recordings of input sessions. The gathered data was analyzed soon after each action step for reflection and further action. The study reports some possible strategies to facilitate teachers in gaining understanding about the notion of curriculum and curriculum enrichment. These are: 1) Using input/training sessions about definition and theory of curriculum and curriculum enrichment. 2) Sharing strategies for content, pedagogical and organizational enrichment. For example, adding supplementary reading materials from sources other than the prescribed textbooks, use of newspapers, audio-visual aids, inquiry and project work, organizing field trips and inviting guest speakers. In the same vein, the study also reports the challenges faced Dissertation Abstracts MEd V Class of 2002 33 in the process; such as: striking a balance between facilitating in joint and;individual input sessions, time availability for action and its research and overemphasis on theoretical input.

In the empirical part I present some of my experiences with the use of puppets in a classroom which confirm the power of a puppet itself.
