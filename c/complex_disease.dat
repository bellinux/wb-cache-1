25|$|Alcohol {{addiction}} is a <b>complex</b> <b>disease</b> {{that results from}} a variety of genetic, social, and environmental influences. Alcoholism affected approximately 4.65 percent of the U.S. population in 2001-2002, producing severe economic, social, and medical ramifications (Grant 2004). Researchers estimate that between 50 and 60 percent of alcoholism risk is determined by genetics (Goldman and Bergen 1998; McGue 1999).This strong genetic component has sparked numerous linkage and association studies investigating the roles of chromosomal regions and genetic variants in determining alcoholism susceptibility.|$|E

Furthermore, we presented the role of natural selection on genetic diversity and <b>complex</b> <b>diseases.</b> Then we reviewed the disadvantageous consequences of historical selection events in modern time and their relation to the development of <b>complex</b> <b>diseases.</b> In addition, we discussed the effect of consanguinity on the incidence of <b>complex</b> <b>diseases</b> in human populations.

Monogenic Mendelian inheritance in such conditions is infrequent but its elucidation may help to detect pathogenic mechanisms in the more common variety of <b>complex</b> <b>diseases.</b> Involvement by multiple genes in <b>complex</b> <b>diseases</b> usually occurs but the isolation and identification of specific genes so far has been exceptional.

40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, most of which have not yet been identiWed. The vast majority of diseases, including several congenital defects and a number of adult-onset <b>diseases,</b> fall into <b>complex</b> <b>diseases.</b> <b>Complex</b> <b>diseases</b> do not obey the standard Mendelian patterns of inheritance [1]. In the past few decades, many studies have been performed to relate genetic polymorphisms to com-plex diseases. In these studies, researchers examined the association between the allele, genotype and complex dis-eases. They usually select a dominant genetic eVect and a recessive genetic eVect of the minor allele. However, the two genetic inheritance patterns may not be comprehensive for <b>complex</b> <b>diseases,</b> and there may be another genetic eVect of the minor allele...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{genome-wide}} association studies (GWAS) {{have successfully}} identified {{tens of thousands}} of genetic variants among a variety of traits/diseases, shedding a light on the genetic architecture of <b>complex</b> <b>diseases.</b> Polygenicity of <b>complex</b> <b>diseases,</b> which refers to the phenomenon that a vast number of risk variants collectively contribute to the heritability of <b>complex</b> <b>diseases</b> with modest individual effects, have been widely accepted. This imposes a major challenge towards fully characterizing the genetic bases of <b>complex</b> <b>diseases.</b> An immediate implication of polygenicity is that a much larger sample size is required to detect risk variants with weak/moderate effects. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence suggests that different <b>complex</b> <b>diseases</b> can share genetic risk variants, a phenomenon known as pleiotropy. In this study, we propose a statistical framework for Leveraging Pleiotropic effects in large-scale GWAS data (LPG). LPG utilizes a variational Bayesian expectation-maximization (VBEM) algorithm, making it computationally efficient and scalable for genome-wide scale analysis. To demon- strate the advantage of LPG over existing methods that do not leverage pleiotropy, we conducted extensive simulation studies and also applied LPG to analyze three au- toimmune disorders (Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and Type 1 diabetes). The results indicate that LPG can improve the power of prioritization of risk variants and accuracy of risk prediction by leveraging pleiotropy.

40|$|Many <b>complex</b> <b>diseases</b> (chronic disease onset, {{development}} and differentiation, self-assembly, etc.) {{are reminiscent of}} phase transitions in a dynamical system: quantitative changes accumulate largely unnoticed until a critical threshold is reached, which causes abrupt qualitative changes of the system. Understanding such nonlinear behaviors is critical to dissect the multiple genetic/environmental factors that together shape the genetic and physiological landscape underlying basic biological functions and to identify the key driving molecules. Based on stochastic differential equation (SDE) model, we theoretically derive three statistical indicators, that is, coefficient of variation (CV), transformed Pearson’s correlation coefficient (TPC), and transformed probability distribution (TPD), to identify critical transitions and detect the early-warning signals of the phase transition in <b>complex</b> <b>diseases.</b> To verify {{the effectiveness of these}} early-warning indexes, we use high-throughput data for three <b>complex</b> <b>diseases,</b> including influenza caused by either H 3 N 2 or H 1 N 1 and acute lung injury, to extract the dynamical network biomarkers (DNBs) responsible for catastrophic transition into the disease state from predisease state.
