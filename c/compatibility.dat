5|$|Early {{models of}} the Wii are fully {{backwards}} compatible with GameCube software {{and most of its}} accessories; the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support. Early versions of the PlayStation 3 and all {{models of the}} Xbox 360 only offer partial support and use software emulation for backwards <b>compatibility.</b> Current versions of the PS3 do not offer PlayStation 2 <b>compatibility,</b> though PS1 <b>compatibility</b> is retained. Some models of the first generation of the PS3 offered full backwards <b>compatibility</b> for PS2 games. The Xbox 360's <b>compatibility</b> is increased through game-specific patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website and the PS3's <b>compatibility</b> is expanded with firmware updates.|$|E
5|$|System {{calls are}} being split into userland and kernel {{versions}} and being encapsulated into messages. This will {{help reduce the}} size {{and complexity of the}} kernel by moving variants of standard system calls into a userland <b>compatibility</b> layer, and help maintain forwards and backwards <b>compatibility</b> between DragonFly versions. Linux and other Unix-like OS <b>compatibility</b> code is being migrated out similarly.|$|E
5|$|After {{intercontinental}} <b>compatibility</b> tests, Petersen and Bermudes {{suggested that}} bioluminescence and <b>compatibility</b> were independent since bioluminescence {{seemed to be}} geographically restricted. This suggested that the ability or potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of P.stypticus into geographically isolated areas.|$|E
40|$|The work {{presents}} a methodology contributing to boundary extraction in images of approximate polyhedral objects. We make {{extensive use of}} basic principles underlying the process of image formation and thus reduce the role of object-specific knowledge. Simple configurations of line segments are extracted subject to geometric-photometric <b>compatibilities.</b> The perceptual organization into polygonal arrangements is based on geometric regularity <b>compatibilities</b> under projective transformation. The combination of several <b>compatibilities</b> yields a saliency function for extracting a list of most salient structures. Based on systematic measurements during an experimentation phase the adequacy and degrees of <b>compatibilities</b> are determined. The methodology is demonstrated for technical objects of electrical scrap located in cluttered scenes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{improves}} {{on a novel}} methodology {{advanced in}} order to assess deterministically (i. e.; precisely) compromises and <b>compatibilities</b> between manufacturing capabilities in individual firms. We extend the original proposal to include more recent theoretical developments arguing that both trade-offs and <b>compatibilities</b> (e. g.; cumulative capabilities) can be observed in a relationship between two or more competitive criteria. This means that as opposed to widely-accepted views, trade-offs and <b>compatibilities</b> can be complementary, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, when explaining relationships between various competitive criteria. As such, our improved methodology and rationale can assess the existence of both trade-offs and <b>compatibilities</b> between multiple capabilities utilising a single framework. Opportunities for novel research that uses our methodology are also offered...|$|R
40|$|Pairwise {{grouping}} and clustering {{approaches have}} tra-ditionally worked {{under the assumption}} that the similari-ties or <b>compatibilities</b> between the elements to be grouped are symmetric. However, asymmetric <b>compatibilities</b> arise naturally in many areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a new generic ap-proach to clustering and grouping that can deal with asym-metries in the <b>compatibilities.</b> In this paper, we present a generic framework for grouping and clustering derived from a game-theoretic formalization of the competition be-tween the hypotheses of group membership, and apply it to perceptual grouping. In the proposed approach groups correspond to evolutionary stable strategies, a classic no-tion in evolutionary game theory. We also provide a com-binatorial characterization of the stable strategies, and, hence, of the elements that belong to a group. Experiments show that our approach outperforms both state-of-the-art clustering-based perceptual grouping approacheswith sym-metric <b>compatibilities,</b> and other approaches explicitly de-signed to make use of asymmetric <b>compatibilities.</b> 1...|$|R
5|$|Most {{software}} {{that runs on}} Linux can run on FreeBSD using an optional built-in <b>compatibility</b> layer. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This <b>compatibility</b> layer is not an emulation; Linux's system call interface is implemented in the FreeBSD's kernel and hence, Linux executable images and shared libraries are treated the same as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides <b>compatibility</b> layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to Linux, such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common for users to compile those programs directly on FreeBSD.|$|E
