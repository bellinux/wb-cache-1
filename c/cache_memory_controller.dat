Many students are keenly interested in learning how a modern computer works, but are unable to because of their limited background. We have developed a series of activities that mimic the operation of a digital computer to teach computer architecture concepts without the need for expensive equipment that are beyond the resources of most schools. Students role-play parts of a digital computer to accomplish a given task, and follow a given set of rules (their program). Student roles include: a processor, a <b>cache</b> <b>memory</b> <b>controller,</b> main memory, mass storage devices, system busses, and input/output devices. Student activities include displaying a multimedia movie, exploring cache memory, and processing an image.

40|$|The POWER 5 + {{processor}} has {{a faster}} memory bus {{than that of}} the previous generation POWER 5 processor (533 MHz vs. 400 MHz), but the measured per-core memory bandwidth of the latter is better {{than that of the}} former (5. 7 GB/s vs. 4. 3 GB/s). The {{reason for this is that}} in the POWER 5 +, the two cores on the chip share the L 2 cache, L 3 cache and memory bus. The memory controller is also on the chip and is shared by the two cores. This serializes the path to memory. For consistently good performance on a wide range of applications, the performance of the processor, the memory subsystem, and the interconnects (both latency and bandwidth) should be balanced. Recognizing this, IBM has designed the Power 6 processor so as to avoid the bottlenecks due to the L 2 <b>cache,</b> <b>memory</b> <b>controller</b> and buffer chips of the POWER 5 +. Unlike the POWER 5 +, each core in the POWER 6 has its own L 2 cache (4 MB - double that of the Power 5 +), memory controller and buffer chips. Each core in the POWER 6 runs at 4. 7 GHz instead of 1. 9 GHz in POWER 5 +. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a dual-core Power 6 based IBM p 6 - 570 system, and we compare its performance with that of a dual-core Power 5 + based IBM p 575 + system. In this evaluation, we have used the High- Performance Computing Challenge (HPCC) benchmarks, NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), and four real-world applications [...] three from computational fluid dynamics and one from climate modeling...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in multi-core systems is the contention of shared resources such as <b>cache,</b> <b>memory</b> <b>controller,</b> pre-fetcher etc. among the cores. Due to the contention among shared resources, the processing unit's performance is degraded. Scheduling of applications {{in such a way}} that it reduces the contention among shared resources is one of the promising solutions. Scheduling is considered as an efficient and best technique as it doesn't require any extra hardware or any changes to be made to the OS or its underlying kernel. Scheduling can be implemented at user level by using system calls. In the prior works it was considered that the cache contention was the main cause of performance degradation and many hardware and software techniques were found to avoid or minimize it. But further experiments proved that the contention caused by pre-fetcher and memory controller is also having significant effect on performance degradation. Many scheduling policies and classification schemes have been designed to find out an efficient scheduling algorithm. Miss rate is considered to be simple yet efficient classification scheme to classify the threads as it not only considers contention due to cache but also the memory controller and pre-fetcher. Distributed Intensity is the first scheduling algorithm discussed which uses miss rate to classify threads and assign them to all cores in an efficient way so that miss rate is shared almost equally among the cores. Then Distributed Intensity is combined with Swap algorithm to further improve the performance by using dynamic optimization. Then by further studies it is found out that miss rate cant be efficient classification technique for memory intensive workloads. So the concepts of Contentiousness and Sensitivity are introduced to improve the efficiency of scheduling algorithm and to minimize the performance degradation due to contention...|$|E

40|$|Graph {{partitioning}} and repartitioning {{have been}} studied for several decades. Yet, they are receiving more attention due to the increasing popularity of large graphs from various domains, such as social networks, web networks, telecommunication networks, and scientific simulations. Traditional well-studied graph (re) partitioners often scale poorly against these continuously growing graphs. Recent works on streaming graph partitioning and lightweight graph repartitioning usually assume a homogeneous computing environment. However, modern parallel architectures may exhibit highly non-uniform network communication costs. Several solutions have been proposed to address this, but they all consider the network as the primary bottleneck of the system, even though transferring data across modern high-speed networks is now {{as fast as the}} local memory access. As such, minimization of the network data communication may not be a good choice. We found that putting too much data communication into partitions assigned to cores of the same machines may result in serious contention for the shared hardware resources (e. g., last level <b>cache,</b> <b>memory</b> <b>controller,</b> and front-side bus) on the memory subsystems in modern multicore clusters. The performance impact of the contention can even become the dominant factor in limiting the scalability of the workload, especially for multicore machines connected via high-speed networks. Another issue of existing graph (re) partitioners is that they are usually not aware of the runtime characteristics of the target workload. To enable efficient distributed graph computation, this thesis aims to (1) understand the performance impact of non-uniform network communication costs, the impact of contention on the memory subsystems, as well as the impact of workload runtime characteristics on distributed graph computation; and (2) design and implement new scalable graph (re) partitioners that take these factors into account...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{meet the}} growing needs of {{computing}} power, communication speed and performance requirements demanded by today’s applications, processor clock speed {{has to be}} increased. However, increasing clock speed is not viable due to heat dissipation and power consumption constraints. Hence Instead of trying to increase the clock speed, multi-core processor architectures with the lower frequency can be used. A multi-core processor is a single integrated circuit in which two or more processors have been attached for enhanced performance, reduced power consumption and more efficient simultaneous processing of multiple tasks. Multi-core processors, which have multiple processing units on a single chip, are widely viewed {{as a way to}} achieve higher processor performance. Well scheduling of running threads on these processors will result in achieving higher performance. Modern multi-core systems are designed to allow clusters of cores to share various hardware structures, such as last-level <b>caches,</b> <b>memory</b> <b>controllers,</b> and interconnections without considering these shared resources, scheduling the threads will cause serious degradation in overall performance of the system. In this paper we are showing one basic problem in multicore processor.

An ever-increasing complexity and the number of components present new challenges to software developers interested in finding operating points that strike an optimal bal-ance between performance and energy consumed. In this paper we analyze the impact of thread scaling and frequency scaling on performance and energy in modern multicores. By exploiting recent additions to microprocessors that support energy estimation and power management, we measure execution times and energy consumed on an Intel Xeon 1240 v 2 microprocessor when run-ning the PARSEC benchmark suite. We conduct a number of experiments by varying the number of threads, 1 ≤ N ≤ 16, and processor clock frequency, 1. 6 ≤ F ≤ 3. 4 GHz. We find that the maximum performance is achieved when the number of threads matches or slightly exceeds the number of logical processors (8 ≤ N ≤ 12) and the clock frequency is at maximum (F = 3. 4 GHz). The minimum energy is consumed when the pro-cessor clock frequency is in range 2. 0 ≤ F ≤ 2. 4 GHz. Finally, we find that the best performance at minimal energy is achieved whe...|$|R
40|$|On {{multicore}} systems, contention for {{shared resources}} occurs when memory-intensive threads are co-scheduled on cores that share {{parts of the}} memory hierarchy, such as last-level <b>caches</b> and <b>memory</b> <b>controllers.</b> Previous work investigated how contention could be addressed via scheduling. A contention-aware scheduler separates competing threads onto separate memory hierarchy domains to eliminate resource sharing and, as a consequence, to mitigate contention. However, all previous work on contention-aware scheduling assumed that the underlying system is UMA (uniform memory access latencies, single <b>memory</b> <b>controller).</b> Modern multicore systems, however, are NUMA, {{which means that they}} feature non-uniform memory access latencies and multiple <b>memory</b> <b>controllers.</b> We discovered that state-of-the-art contention management algorithms fail to be effective on NUMA systems and may even hurt performance relative to a default OS scheduler. In this paper we investigate the causes for this behavior and design the first contention-aware algorithm for NUMA systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{theory of}} {{scheduling}} has expanded rapidly {{during the past}} years. As multi-core architectures begin to emerge, operating system issues are {{to be considered for}} best use of multi-core processes. Due to the architectural differences in the state of art multi-core processors such as shared <b>caches,</b> <b>memory</b> <b>controllers</b> etc., it becomes the responsibility of the operating system to make use of intelligent scheduling mechanisms instead of simply scheduling tasks. In this paper, we try to explore the rapidly expanding area of scheduling by classifying the multi-core scheduling into traditional shortest job scheduling for multi-core, tree based threaded scheduling and block level scheduling. We have conducted simulation of the traditional shortest job first for multi-core processors the details of which are discussed below. Tree based scheduling is achieved by constructing a binary search tree (BST) data structure; similarly we have demonstrated block scheduling which form a part of software scheduling for reducing the processes execution time. Research by, [13] shows that applications do not make use of the entire processing power of multi-core processors. There has been considerable progress in the design of thread schedulers. We demonstrate a mechanism of handling various cores as compared to the traditional mechanism of handling a single processor core. Results show improved values of execution time as compared to traditional scheduler...|$|R
