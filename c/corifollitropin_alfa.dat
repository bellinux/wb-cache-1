In this large, double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority trial the ongoing pregnancy rates were assessed after one injection of 150 mu g <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> {{during the first week}} of stimulation and compared with daily injections of 200 IU rFSH using a standard GnRH antagonist protocol. The study population comprised 1506 treated patients with mean age of 31. 5 years and body weight of 68. 6 kg. Ongoing pregnancy rates of 38. 9 % for the <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> group and 38. 1 % for rFSH were achieved, with an estimated non-significant difference of 0. 9 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 3. 9; 5. 7] in favor of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa.</b> Stratified analyses of pregnancy rates confirmed robustness of this primary outcome by showing similar results regardless of IVF or ICSI, or number of embryos transferred.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{primarily}} {{investigated the}} dose-response relationship of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> to initiate multifollicular {{development for the}} first 7 days of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). METHODS: Women aged 20 - 39 years undergoing COS for in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection were randomized to a single dose of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> 60, 120 or 180 μg, or daily injections of 150 IU recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH). Patients treated with <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> started fixed daily treatment with 150 IU rFSH on stimulation Day 8. Patients received a GnRH antagonist (ganirelix 0. 25 mg/day) from stimulation Day 5 until the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetics of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> were dose-proportional. The main reason for not having embryo transfer was insufficient ovarian response in 30. 8, 2. 6, 3. 8 and 7. 4 % of patients in the <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> 60, 120, 180 μg and rFSH groups, respectively. On Day 8, the mean (standard deviation) number of follicles ≥ 11 mm was 6. 8 (4. 4), 10. 1 (6. 1) and 12. 8 (7. 5), respectively. The number of cumulus-oocyte complexes retrieved showed a clear dose-response relationship (P < 0. 0001), being 5. 2 (5. 5), 10. 3 (6. 3) and 12. 5 (8. 0) in the three dose groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A single injection of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> induces dose-related increase in multifollicular development and {{in the number of}} retrieved oocytes. The optimal dose for a 1 -week interval is higher than 60 μg and lower than 180 μg and will be selected based on modelling and simulation taking into account insufficient stimulation as well as overstimulation.

40|$|Innovative drug {{development}} {{is essential to}} improve therapy over time by offering better efficacy, safety and/or treatment convenience. This thesis summarizes the sequential clinical development of three innovative fertility drugs namely follitropin-b (recombinant FSH), ganirelix (GnRH antagonist) and <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (recombinant long-acting FSH agonist). Follitropin-b replaced urinary FSH, ganirelix introduced a new and short treatment protocol, and <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> replaced the first 7 daily (r) FSH injections during ovarian stimulation in a GnRH antagonist protocol. The development of these drugs has dramatically changed hormonal treatment of women participating in an ART program from being lengthy and complicated to short and simple. Comparative preclinical pharmacology is essential to determine the mechanism of action, specificity, and bioactivity to predict the potency in humans. The first-in-human phase I studies of follitropin-b and <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> included subjects with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) as the immunogenicity is hard to predict in preclinical models. Apart from safety and pharmacokinetics, it was examined whether follitropin-b could stimulate multiple follicular growth in the complete absence of LH activity. The first-in-human study of the fusion molecule <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> in HH men was focusing on its potential immunogenicity. Only thereafter, a phase I study in pituitary-suppressed female volunteers was performed with increasing doses of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa.</b> Phase II research of follitropin-b {{was limited to the}} question whether patients down-regulated with different GnRH agonist protocols could be treated with pure recombinant FSH lacking LH activity. In contrast, the GnRH antagonist ganirelix was tested in a double-blind, dose-finding study including 6 dose groups of which the lowest and highest dose group were discontinued and finally one dose was selected for further development. <b>Corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> was initially tested in a feasibility study and thereafter in a phase II controlled dose-finding study that demonstrated that the optimal dose was between the lowest and highest test dose. Subsequent dose selection was based on modeling and simulation taking into account the inverse relationship between exposure to <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> and body weight and that FSH activity has to retain for 7 days above the threshold to support multiple follicular development. In comparative phase III studies of follitropin-b, ganirelix and <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa,</b> the number of oocytes or the pregnancy rate was the primary endpoint. In time, follitropin-b was compared to urinary FSH and developed in a long GnRH agonist protocol. Subsequently, the GnRH antagonist ganirelix was compared to a long GnRH agonist protocol and finally a single dose of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> was compared to daily follitropin-b using a ganirelix protocol. Main safety endpoints during phase III trials focused on the incidence of adverse events including Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), hypersensitivity, immunogenicity, and the health outcome of offspring. Registration of new drugs requires a positive benefit/risk ratio based on the evaluation of all efficacy and safety parameters. Following drug approval, retrospective analyses may support further development of treatment regimens or for specific subgroups of patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND One {{injection}} of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> replaces {{the first seven}} daily FSH injections in controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycles. Repeated treatment with therapeutic proteins may cause immune responses or hypersensitivity reactions. We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> treatment in up to three COS cycles. METHODS In this multicentre, phase III uncontrolled trial, patients (> 60 kg) started treatment with one {{injection of}} 150 µg <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> on cycle Day 2 or 3 of menses and 0. 25 mg ganielix on stimulation Day 5 or 6. Primary outcome measures were antibody formation against <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (using highly sensitive radioimmunoprecipitation assay), hypersensitivity reactions, local tolerance and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS First, second and third COS cycles were started by 682, 375 and 198 patients, respectively. No clinically relevant immunogenicity or drug-related hypersensitivity was observed. For 192 patients undergoing their third cycle a post-treatment blood sample was negative in the anti-corifollitropin antibody assay, resulting in an upper limit of the one-sided 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 1. 5 %. Most frequent AEs were procedural pain (17. 7 %, 95 % CI: 14. 9 – 20. 8 %), headache (9. 1 %, 95 % CI: 7. 0 – 11. 5 %) and pelvic pain (7. 6 %, 95 % CI: 5. 7 – 9. 9 %).

Methods: A total of 85 poor responder patients with a mean age 40. 2 ± 3. 9 years entered our assisted fertilization program. The patients were prospectively randomized into two groups based on the ovarian stimulation regimen used: group A (study group) (n= 42) received clomiphene citrate and <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> for the first 7 days of stimulation followed by recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) in a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol, and group B (control group) (n= 43) received clomiphene citrate and a daily injection of rFSH in a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol. We analyzed the stimulation outcome, the number of retrieved oocytes, cleaving embryos, and pregnancy and implantation rates as well. Results: Comparable results were observed between the two groups in terms of demographic data, stimulation outcome, and the number of canceled cycles. There were no differences evident between groups A and B with respect to the number of retrieved oocytes (3. 0 ± 0. 8 and 2. 7 ± 0. 7, respectively) and the number of cleaving embryos (1. 8 ± 0. 6 and 1. 7 ± 0. 7, respectively). Higher, though not statistically significant, differences were observed in favor of group A compared to group B in terms of pregnancy rate per cycle (19 % and 16. 3 %, respectively), pregnancy rate per transfer (21. 6 % and 17. 9 %, respectively), and implantation rate (14. 7 % and 13. 4 %, respectively).

40|$|The {{release of}} <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> {{simplifies}} daily injections of short-acting recombinant follicular stimulating hormone (rFSH), and its widely-used protocol involves short-acting gonadotropins supplements and a fixed GnRH antagonist regimen, {{largely based on}} follicle size. In this study, the feasibility of <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> without routine pituitary suppression was evaluated. A total of 288 patients were stimulated by <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> on cycle day 3 following with routine serum hormone monitoring and follicle scanning every other day after 5 days of initial stimulation, and a GnRH antagonist (0. 25 mg) was only used prophylactically when the luteinizing hormone (LH) was ≧ 6 IU/L (over half of the definitive LH surge). The incidence of premature LH surge (≧ 10 IU/L) was 2. 4 % (7 / 288) before the timely injection of a single GnRH antagonist, and the elevated LH level was dropped down from 11. 9 IU/L to 2. 2 IU/L after the suppression. Two hundred fifty-one patients did not need any antagonist (87. 2 % [251 / 288]) throughout the whole stimulation. No adverse effects were observed regarding oocyte competency (fertilization rate: 78 %; blastocyst formation rate: 64 %). The live birth rate per OPU cycle after the first cryotransfer was 56. 3 % (161 / 286), and the cumulative live birth rate per OPU cycle after cyrotransfers was 69. 6 % (199 / 286). Of patients who did and did not receive GnRH antagonist during stimulation, no significant difference existed in the cumulative live birth rates (78. 4 % vs. 68. 3 %, p = 0. 25).

40|$|What is the {{threshold}} for {{the prediction of}} moderate to severe or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) {{based on the number}} of growing follicles ≥ 11 mm and/or estradiol (E 2) levels?The optimal threshold of follicles ≥ 11 mm on the day of hCG to identify those at risk was 19 for both moderate to severe OHSS and for severe OHSS. Estradiol (E 2) levels were less prognostic of OHSS than the number of follicles ≥ 11 mm. In comparison to long gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocols, the risk of severe OHSS is reduced by approximately 50 % in a GnRH antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF), while the two protocols provide equal chances of pregnancy per initiated cycle. Nevertheless, moderate to severe OHSS may still occur in GnRH antagonist protocols if human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is administered to trigger final oocyte maturation, especially in high responder patients. Severe OHSS following hCG trigger may occur with an incidence of 1 - 2 % in a relatively young (aged 18 to 36 years) IVF population treated in a GnRH-antagonist protocol. From the Engage, Ensure and Trust trials, in total, 2, 433 women who received hCG for oocyte maturation and for whom the number of follicles ≥ 11 mm and the level of E 2 on the day of hCG administration were known were included in the analyses. The threshold for OHSS prediction of moderate and severe OHSS was assessed in women treated with <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> or daily recombinant follicle stimulation hormone (rFSH) in a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) -antagonist protocol. Receiver operating characteristics curve analyses for moderate to severe OHSS and severe OHSS were performed on the combined dataset and the sensitivity and specificity for the optimal threshold of number of follicles ≥ 11 mm, E 2 levels on the day of (hCG), and a combination of both, were determined. The optimal threshold of follicles ≥ 11 mm on the day of hCG to identify those at risk of moderate to severe OHSS was 19 (sensitivity and specificity 62. 3 % and 75. 6 %, respectively) and for severe OHSS was also 19 (sensitivity and specificity 74. 3 % and 75. 3 %, respectively). The positive and negative predictive values were 6. 9 % and 98. 6 %, respectively, for moderate to severe OHSS, and 4. 2 % and 99. 5 % for severe OHSS. This was a retrospective analysis of combined data from three trials following ovarian stimulation with two different gonadotropins. For patients with 19 follicles or more ≥ 11 mm on the day of hCG, measures to prevent the development of OHSS should be considered. Secondary preventive measures include cycle cancellation or coasting, use of a GnRH agonist to trigger final oocyte maturation in place of hCG and a freeze all strategy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assisted {{reproduction}} techniques (ART) such as {{in vitro}} fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can help subfertile couples to create a family. It is necessary to induce multiple follicles; this is achieved by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) injections. Current treatment regimens prescribe daily injections of FSH (urinary FSH with or without luteinizing hormone (LH) injections or recombinant FSH (rFSH)). Recombinant DNA technologies have produced a new recombinant molecule which is a long-acting FSH, named <b>corifollitropin</b> <b>alfa</b> (Elonva) or FSH-CTP. A single dose of long-acting FSH is {{able to keep the}} circulating FSH level above the threshold necessary to support multi-follicular growth for an entire week. The optimal dose of long-acting FSH is still being determined. A single injection of long-acting FSH can replace seven daily FSH injections {{during the first week of}} controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and can make assisted reproduction more patient friendly. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of long-acting FSH versus daily FSH in terms of pregnancy and safety outcomes in women undergoing IVF or ICSI treatment cycles. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases, trial registers and websites: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, electronic trial registers for ongoing and registered trials, citation indexes, conference abstracts in the ISI Web of Knowledge, LILACS, Clinical Study Results (for clinical trial results of marketed pharmaceuticals), PubMed and OpenSIGLE (10 October 2011). We also carried out handsearches. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing long-acting FSH versus daily FSH in women who were part of a couple with subfertility and undertaking IVF or ICSI treatment cycles with a GnRH antagonist or agonist protocol were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias was independently done by two review authors. Original trial authors were contacted in the case of missing data. We calculated Peto odds ratios for each outcome; our primary outcomes were live birth rate and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rate. MAIN RESULTS: We included four RCTs with a total of 2335 participants. A comparison of long-acting FSH versus daily FSH did not show evidence of difference in effect on overall live birth rate (Peto OR 0. 92; 95 % CI 0. 76 to 1. 10, 4 RCTs, 2335 women) or OHSS (Peto OR 1. 12; 95 % CI 0. 79 to 1. 60, 4 RCTs, 2335 women). We compared subgroups by dose of long-acting FSH. There was evidence of reduced live birth rate in women who received lower doses (60 to 120 mug) of long-acting FSH compared to daily FSH (Peto OR 0. 60; 95 % CI 0. 40 to 0. 91, 3 RCTs, 645 women). There was no evidence of effect on live births in the medium dose subgroup (Peto OR 1. 03; 95 % CI 0. 84 to 1. 27) and no evidence of effect on clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate or ectopic pregnancy rate. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The use of a medium dose of long-acting FSH is a safe treatment option and equally effective compared to daily FSH. Further research is needed to determine if long-acting FSH is safe and effective for use in hyper- or poor responders and in women with all causes of subfertility...|$|E
