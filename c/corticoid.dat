The molecular structure and pharmacological effects are somewhat similar to endogenous progesterone, although in smaller amounts it is found to be orally active.

25|$|In the CORTICUS study, {{hydrocortisone}} hastened {{the reversal}} of septic shock, but did not influence mortality, with an increased occurrence of septic shock relapse and hypernatremia. The latter findings tempered enthusiasm for the broad use of hydrocortisone in septic shock. Prior to this study, several other smaller studies showed beneficial effects of long courses of low doses of <b>corticoid.</b> Several factors (such as lack of statistical power due to slow recruitment) could have led a false-negative finding on mortality in the CORTICUS study; thus, more research is needed.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to measure the changes in plasma <b>corticoids</b> and progesterone, at two different levels of energy intake during the postpartum period in beef heifers and to assess their relationship to breeding efficiency. Blood samples were taken using a tail bleeding method from 26 first calf crossbred heifers within 24 hours postpartum. Sampling was continued twice weekly until each animal was diagnosed pregnant. Plasma samples were analyzed for progesterone and <b>corticoids</b> using competitive binding techniques. Progesterone levels increased from. 5 ng/ml postpartum to 3. 7 ng/ml following first ovulation. These levels remained high if conception occurred (5. 0 + ng/ml) or returned to minimum levels for repeat estrous cycle. Due to the necessary manipulation of the animals, postpartum plasma levels of <b>corticoids</b> fluctuated widely (10 ng/ml to 70 ng/ml) for each animal. <b>Corticoids</b> means were lower during the postpartum anestrum than during subsequent estrous cycles. No significant correlations were found between plasma <b>corticoids</b> and progesterone concentrations. Providing more than NRC recommended energy intake had no influence on breeding efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{interference}} with the circulation in a circumscribed tissue area, too slight to produce any manifest disturbance in itself, can strikingly alter topical reactivity to irritants and to the antiphlogistic effect of hydrocortisone. Thus, certain vascular territories can be "selectively condi-tioned " to the anti-inflammatory actions of blood-borne <b>corticoids.</b> Conversely, when tissue dam-age is severe, such "selective conditioning " may induce a seemingly paradoxic reversal of the hydrocortisone effect, so that the hormone enhances inflammation. Here, impairment of circulation and hydrocortisone facilitate the production by irritants of necrosis, more than of inflammation. The resulting wide-spread necrosis induces an even greater inflammatory response, despite hydro-cortisone, than would have been observed without hormone treatment. IT has been amply substantiated, both byexperimental and by clinical observations,that the so-called "gluco-corticoids " or "antiphlogistic <b>corticoids,</b> " such as hydrocor-tisone, can inhibit inflammatory responses to {{a great variety of}} irritants.
