25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{criteria}} that the Committee can consider in order to determine whether the <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> admissible or not. The Committee can consider one or all of these criteria, it is entirely discretionary.|$|E
25|$|Whether the <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> {{an abuse}} of the process. If the claim is {{inappropriate}} or {{considered to be a}} waste of the Committee's time (such as frivolous claims or claims that have already been rejected by the Committee or another international mechanism) then it will be considered inadmissible.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequent}} <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> {{with regard}} to its transportation. Whereas other parts of Hong Kong are generally well served by frequent transport options from competing operators, DB is served solely by DBTSL and DBTPL, both subsidiaries of HKR. These services, while reliable, may take longer than the advertised times depending on weather and traffic conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Complaints</b> <b>are</b> filed free {{of charge}} by WebMoney members. All <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> {{analyzed}} by the arbitration administration. If the administration finds the facts stated in the complaint valid, it can consider various disciplinary actions, such as blocking access to WMID, deleted websites, etc. <b>Complaints</b> <b>are</b> analyzed and considered within 7 days from registration.|$|R
50|$|What happened: On July 22, 2010, an {{impeachment}} <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed against Gutierrez. On August 10 that same year, another impeachment <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed against her.|$|R
50|$|In July 2007, a <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> {{made against}} Free Dominion before the Canadian Human Rights Commission for posting {{material}} {{perceived to be}} discriminatory against Muslims. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> subsequently withdrawn.|$|R
25|$|Appellants {{invoke the}} right to vote and to have their votes counted. But they are {{permitted}} to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state councils. Their <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerful.|$|E
25|$|The Ombudsman is {{the final}} appeal {{authority}} in resolving postal service complaints. If a <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> not resolved to the customer’s satisfaction by Canada Post, the customer can appeal to the Ombudsman. Although the Ombudsman has no legislative power over the Corporation, the recommendations that the office makes to Canada Post can help improve company processes, amend policies and reinforce compliance with procedures.|$|E
25|$|An {{argument}} {{in favour of}} secession {{is based on the}} assumption a Federal government in Canberra will favour the business and popular interests of the larger population centres. A common <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> that Western Australia is a forgotten or Cinderella State, which contributes more to federal funds than it gets back, and is discriminated against by the more populous states.|$|E
50|$|A further <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> laid in 1999 citing {{four of his}} columns, {{including}} the column raised in the previous <b>complaint.</b> This one <b>was</b> upheld, and Collins and his publisher were ordered to pay $2,000 in damages. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> upheld upon appeal.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, the Office {{received}} 932 <b>complaints</b> that <b>were</b> {{opened for}} investigation. Investigations into 1,015 <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> concluded.|$|R
25|$|The House of Representatives' Committee on Justice {{voted on}} September 1, 2010 {{that the two}} <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> {{sufficient}} in form. With the result, further hearings would be held {{to determine if the}} two <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> sufficient in substance.|$|R
25|$|Unlike in the Americas of the 19th century, {{slaves in}} the Middle East were allowed to own land, and their {{children}} were generally not born into slavery. Also conversion to Islam precluded further servitude and gave freedom. Skin color played a distinctive role even amongst slaves. Many activists amongst Afro-Iraqis complain that {{they are unable to}} find opportunities to improve their social condition. However, the same <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> often also made by Iraqis of Arab Semitic descent as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the events - if the event or events {{occurred}} before the State concerned became {{a party to the}} First Optional Protocol then the <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> inadmissible ratione temporis. The Committee has a list of exceptions to this general rule in regards to the ICCPR if the effects of the event continue when the State does accede to the First Optional Protocol. These include when the person is still serving a prison sentence following an unfair trial, for example.|$|E
25|$|Food allergy is a non-seasonal {{disease with}} skin and/or {{gastrointestinal}} disorders. The main <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> excessive scratching (pruritus) {{which is usually}} resistant to treatment by steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (atopy/flea-allergic dermatitis). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with dietary elimination-challenge trials. Allergy testing {{is necessary for the}} identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).|$|E
50|$|The {{unit was}} highly criticized, {{when it had}} used the vehicle {{registration}} number of a revenue department officer without obtaining proper permissions. A <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed with the police against director Cheran, however no official <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> later lodged.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Archbishop Julian Porteous was {{notified}} that a <b>complaint</b> had <b>been</b> {{filed with the}} office of Tasmania's Anti-discrimination Commissioner in relation to the distribution in all Tasmanian Catholic schools of a booklet, Don't Mess with Marriage, stating marriage should be a [...] "heterosexual union {{between a man and a}} woman" [...] and changing the law would endanger a child's upbringing. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed by a transgender activist and Federal Greens candidate Martine Delaney. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> called [...] "'an attempt to silence' the Church over same-sex marriage" [...] by Archbishop Porteous. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> treated as a possible breach of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tas), and sparked fierce debate on the issues of freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and tolerance. The frivolous <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> ultimately withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|A <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> sent in June 2013 against France to the {{investigators}} of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Another <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> {{sent to the}} French Supreme Court against Minister Valls for not signing the administrative paper necessary for Abdallah's release.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} patient {{deferoxamine}} <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> {{that they are}} painful and inconvenient. The oral chelator deferasirox was approved for use in 2005 in some countries, it offers some hope with compliance at a higher cost. Bone marrow transplantation is the only cure and is indicated for patients with severe thalassemia major. Transplantation can eliminate a patient's dependence on transfusions. Absent a matching donor, a savior sibling can be conceived by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) {{to be free of}} the disease as well as to match the recipient's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} the {{potential}} for a substantial harm to occur that is permanent in nature, such as the execution of a death penalty or the deportation of a person who could face torture, then the author of the complaint can request that it be greeted with Urgency. Cases such as these are covered by Rule 86 of the Committee's Rules of Procedure. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur on New Communications can issue 'interim measures' in order to prevent the harm occurring while the <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> being considered. The Committee views any failure by the State to adhere by these interim measures a breach of their obligations under the First Optional Protocol.|$|E
25|$|Like many developments, DB {{has its own}} {{share of}} issues. An oft-made <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> that DB is {{expensive}} compared {{to the rest of}} Hong Kong; from its member-only recreation and entertainment clubs to its limited shopping options and expensive restaurants. Furthermore, various groups such as teenagers and the elderly complain that there are few activities catered to them. Plans have been made to open a skating area for the former, also {{to be used as a}} Tai-Chi area for the latter. However, although an area has been paved for this purpose, the opening is stalled as discussions with nearby residents are still being held.|$|E
50|$|However, the <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> ignored.|$|R
50|$|On 17 July 2000, {{a second}} {{criminal}} <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> brought against Slyusarchuk in Lviv. According to complainants Oleg and Bogdana Gamalii, they paid him $1,500 {{to treat their}} two young children; the children worsened following his treatment. After five years, the <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> dropped.|$|R
50|$|Wheeler told {{constituents}} that {{he would}} vote to reinstitute slavery if his constituents wanted him to. An ethics <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed against Wheeler, stating {{that he does not}} live in the 39th district. Another <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed against Wheeler for failing to disclose a lien.|$|R
25|$|In sum, the Committee {{finds that}} the <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> not {{sufficient}} in form and substance to warrant its further consideration. It is not sufficient in form because the verification made by the affiants that the allegations in the resolution “are true and correct of our own knowledge” is transparently false. It taxes the ken of men {{to believe that the}} affiants individually could swear to the truth of allegations, relative to the transactions that allegedly transpired in foreign countries given the barrier of geography and the restrictions of their laws. More important, the resolution cannot be sufficient in substance because its careful assay shows that it is a mere charade of conclusions.|$|E
25|$|Food allergy is a non-seasonal {{disease with}} skin and/or {{gastrointestinal}} disorders. The main <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> pruritus. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. There is no breed, sex or age predilection, although some breeds are commonly affected. Before {{the onset of}} clinical signs, the animals have been fed the offending food components {{for at least two}} years, although some animals are less than a year old. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (atopy / flea-allergic dermatitis). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with an elimination diet. Challenge–dechallenge–rechallenge is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).|$|E
25|$|Whether the <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> {{within the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the ICCPR - there are other treaty bodies that can receive individual communications concerning other human rights treaties as well as special provisions that allow claims from outside these groups to be heard, however, no body can receive a claim that does not relate specifically to the treaty or convention that they are charged with, if this is the case, the complaint will be inadmissible ratione materiae. The right alleged to have been violated must be contained within the ICCPR in order for it to be heard. The Committee does allow for other bodies to bring complaints that the other body has received to the Committee if the ICCPR offers greater protection to that cause.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Complaints by {{patients}} and their relatives are {{an important source of}} information for service improvement. In order to take remedial measures, the present study evaluated the complaints of {{patients and their}} relatives about our emergency department (ED). Methods: Records of all patient complaints, from June 2008 to June 2012, were retrieved from the Quality Improvement Unit (QIU) archives. All complainants were contacted by phone. The socio-demographic profiles of complainants, their reasons for complaints, and the outcomes were analyzed using the SPSS statistical package. Results: The results revealed that 54 <b>complaints</b> have <b>been</b> made against our ED over four years relating to medical care, staff attitudes, waiting time, and financial reasons. Of the complainants, 75. 9 % were male (n= 41), and 24. 1 % (n= 13) were female. The majority (29. 7 %, 20. 4 %) of the <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> due to medical care and attitude problems. Most <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> made for green code patients (55. 6 %). The majority of <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> about emergency physicians (38. 9 %). <b>Complaint</b> frequency <b>was</b> 0. 18 per 1. 000 visits. Conclusions: <b>Complaints</b> <b>are</b> potentially useful quality assurance tools, and can identify remediable system flaws. The main causes of <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> medical care, staff attitude, and waiting time, and many of these causes are remediable...|$|R

25|$|As of August 24, 2006, {{the last}} lawsuit {{connected}} with the odor issue has been dismissed {{and the problem is}} acknowledged as fixed. In late November, however, another <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> filed over bad smells. This <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> closed on January 11 of 2007 with no fines assessed.|$|R
25|$|Originally a {{sub-category}} {{of direct}} discrimination, harassment {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E
500|$|The {{power of}} the Court to require that this be done is {{specifically}} mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore, which states: [...] "Where a <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> made to the High Court or any Judge thereof {{that a person is}} being unlawfully detained, the Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the Court and release him." ...|$|E
500|$|Some modern composers {{have been}} critical. Pierre Boulez {{dismissed}} Shostakovich's music as [...] "the second, or even third [...] of Mahler". The Romanian composer and Webern disciple Philip Gershkovich called Shostakovich [...] "ahack in a trance". [...] A related <b>complaint</b> <b>is</b> that Shostakovich's style is vulgar and strident: Stravinsky wrote of Lady Macbeth: [...] "brutally hammering... and monotonous". English composer and musicologist Robin Holloway described his music as [...] "battleship-grey in melody and harmony, factory-functional in structure; in content all rhetoric and coercion." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2000, a press council <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> {{made against}} {{a letter to}} the editor in The Press, which argued that Hager had lied in the book. The <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> not upheld, because the Press Council ruled that it was {{responsible}} for vetting robust debate in the letter pages.|$|R
2500|$|Consumers may [...] against {{businesses}} and individuals with the Attorney General. More than 90,000 consumer complaints and inquiries {{each year are}} submitted to the Attorney General. Many of those <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> resolved through mediation by the AG. In cases where a company's actions have been determined to be in violation of Missouri's consumer protection law, complaints lead to legal action. Some <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> frivolous. Missouri residents may file complaints against any business entity and non-Missouri residents may file complaints against Missouri businesses. <b>Complaints</b> <b>are</b> available for [...] by the public.|$|R
30|$|We {{identified}} 13 cases. The main <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> missed diagnosis (6 cases)—fractures of the tibial eminence {{were the}} main culprit, with damage to the popliteal artery caused by a medial condyle fracture being the most serious. All cases were missed by junior doctors. Secondary <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> problems with casting, dissatisfaction with correct treatment, and insufficient surgery or complications relating to surgery. Eight of the <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> acknowledged, with six receiving financial compensation ranging from EUR 9, 600 to EUR 70, 000. Five out of the six cases of missed diagnosis were acknowledged.|$|R
