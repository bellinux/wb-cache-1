5|$|Reviewers {{also gave}} credit to Elizabeth Sanders, Phipps' granddaughter and {{literary}} executor, for her skillful {{handling of the}} last two volumes. The purpose of the work becomes even more apparent and direct under her management and editing of the material. The role of the future marshals becomes more <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaigns of 1797, and especially in the Italian campaign; her handling of the material kept it fully focused on the future marshals Massena, Augereau, Berthier, and Brune.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense {{was published}} in January 1776, just as it became <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no new ideas and probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing her}} father's story, the narrator becomes {{interested}} in the mystery and begins researching Dracula as {{she and her father}} travel across Europe during the 1970s. Although he eventually sends her home, she does not remain there. After finding letters addressed to her that reveal he has left on a quest to find her mother (previously believed to be dead), she sets out to find him. As is slowly made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel, Helen is the narrator's mother. The letters continue the story her father has been telling her. The narrator decides to travel to a monastery where she believes her father might be.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s that the library had outgrown its {{existing}} building, the school initially hired an architect who proposed a traditional {{design for the}} new building. Deciding instead to construct a library with a contemporary design, the school gave the commission to Louis Kahn in 1965. The library was opened in 1971. In 1997 the library received the Twenty-five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects, an award that recognizes architecture of enduring significance that is given {{to no more than}} one building per year.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad had a {{distinctive}} Syrian iconography, which is <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seals of the kings that gave prominence to the Syrian gods. Egyptian influence was minimal and {{limited to the}} ankh, which cannot be interpreted as an emulation of Egyptian rituals but rather as merely {{a substitute for the}} cup held by the deity elsewhere. Yamhad had a special pattern of trim called the Yamhad style, which was favored in Mari during the reign of king Zimri-Lim, whose queen Shibtu was the daughter of Yarim-Lim I.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name is uncertain. In old maps and books Tadley can be found spelled as Taddanleage, Tederlei, Titherley, Tudurley, Tadel and Taddeley. As with many other rural British communities, {{it is assumed that}} the village began as a <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dense forest which at one time covered the greater part of England. In Old English, Tadde means 'Toad' or 'Frog' and ley being 'a <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods', so it {{possibly}} means [...] "a <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods with frogs". Most sources, however, say that the name means [...] "woodland clearing of a man called Tada".|$|R

5|$|Code: Veronicas story, setting, {{and artistic}} design strayed {{away from the}} series standard. While {{previous}} games are set in the United States and have a corresponding American feel to them, Code: Veronica {{is set in the}} Southern Ocean and Antarctica and carries a European gothic horror inspired design. This is made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environments which features gothic architecture and art in addition to central European carvings and German-style weaponry. In addition, the gothic feel is emphasized through the story. The horror in Code: Veronica is driven by this story which follows a crazed man and the fate of his noble bloodline. The story is told partly through a lullaby, and this method of story telling is intended to bring out European operatic undertones. This contrasts to previous games in the series which were driven by the panic elements from American horror films, such as monsters and zombies. With regards to managing the art staff, Mikami split them up depending on their interests. Those interested in guns worked solely on gun designs while those interested in environments were sent to photograph houses and castles for research.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E
5|$|Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} embedded into English political life during Henry III's minority. As the King grew older, his government {{slowly began to}} recover from the civil war, regaining control of the counties and beginning to raise revenue once again, taking care not to overstep the terms of the charters. Henry remained a minor and his government's legal ability to make permanently binding decisions on his behalf was limited. In 1223, the tensions over the status of the charters became <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal court, when Henry's government attempted to reassert its rights over its properties and revenues in the counties, facing resistance from many communities that argued—if sometimes incorrectly—that the charters protected the new arrangements. This resistance resulted in an argument between Archbishop Langton and William Brewer over whether the King had any duty to fulfil the terms of the charters, given that he had been forced to agree to them. On this occasion, Henry gave oral assurances that he considered himself bound by the charters, enabling a royal inquiry into the situation in the counties to progress.|$|E
50|$|The -ley suffix {{is shared}} by many villages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, and means a <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods. This means that Keresley was <b>clearing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forest of Arden. And the Keres- prefix is thought to either be a {{corruption}} of the Saxon word for cress or someone's name, meaning together either: The cress clearing, or 'Mr' Cress's Clearing.|$|R

5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been <b>clear.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened {{all the way back to}} the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Once {{news of the}} Ottoman {{approach}} arrived, Venice sent reinforcements to its cities along Albania; Durazzo (Durrës) {{had already}} garrisoned 3,000 men. The Scutari Fortress was also reinforced after Skanderbeg's counsel and the walls were rebuilt. On 19 April 1466, news spread that the sultan was going to march into Avlonya (Vlorë) with an army of 100,000 men although the Ragusans reported that the number was 30,000. Ottoman forces were ready to enter the Kingdom of Naples and pressured Ferdinand to form an alliance with Mehmed. The situation was not <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, however, as {{it was thought that}} the Ottomans could march against Bosnia, Serbia, Dalmatia, Negroponte, or Albania. By the beginning of May, however, {{it was clear that the}} Ottomans would attack Albania because of the approach of Mehmed's troops towards Albania after the end of his campaigns in Wallachia, Karaman, and the Morea. None of the promised reinforcements from Naples and Venice arrived and Skanderbeg was thus left to fight Ottoman forces only with the league's troops.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{decision}} of the inquiry went against NESCo and those in support of the station, and the company dropped their plans. NESCo received an ex gratia payment of £6,650 from the Ministry of Town and Country Planning for the expenditure incurred to that point. The site itself was inherited by the nationalised British Electricity Authority in 1948 and they eventually sold it. On 9 October 1945, Minister of Town and Country Planning Lewis Silkin made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons that NESCo had begun extending their existing power stations by installing additional generating plant at sites other than Kepier, sufficing the demand for electricity, and meaning no station was needed at Kepier.|$|E

5|$|Whether or not {{the summit}} is {{considered}} important for its content, the meeting held some symbolic importance. First of all, {{it was the first}} NATO summit between the leaders of the North-American and Western European states, and Eastern European states, states that were finally, after decades of Cold War tensions, together in the same alliance. The media attention that these new members received during the summit, opened public debates about whether there was still a consensus about the purpose, the perceived threats and the future borders of NATO among its 26 members. That this was not the case, became <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> run-up to the 2006 Riga Summit. Secondly, the holding of the summit in Istanbul made it the most eastern summit in NATO's history. It marked the increasingly key role played by Turkey as a major strategic hub due to its location close to the hotbeds of tension and conflict in the South Caucasus and the Middle East. The location of the summit made clear that NATO’s security concerns had shifted towards the southeastern part of the European continent. By shifting eastwards, the Alliance’s centre of gravity ventured into very different areas from those on which the Cold War military NATO had focused.|$|E
