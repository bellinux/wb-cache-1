The thesis is divided into three main chapters. First chapter is focused on the theory of the balance of payments and its individual accounts. Second chapter deals specifically with the U. <b>S.</b> <b>balance</b> of payments. First the attention is paid to the overall development followed by a mention of the relationship between public debt and current account deficit. This chapter also includes the issue of the U. S. dollar in the position of the main reserve currency. Ending of this chapter is connected with the theme of global imbalances and the paradox of the U. S. net international investment position. The chapter three is made up of individual events, included are also their causes and consequences. The most space is devoted to the subprime mortgage crisis and financial crisis. The main purpose of the final chapter is to provide perspective on these events through the U. <b>S.</b> <b>balance</b> of payments...|$|R

40|$|According to Godley, the {{significance}} of the deficit in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>balance</b> of payments has been underestimated in both public policy and academic discussions despite the fact that U. S. markets are increasingly dominated by foreign manufacturers and the main cause of the 20 -year deterioration in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>balance</b> of trade is that domination. Godley analyzes the problem posed by the U. <b>S.</b> <b>balance</b> of payments deficit. Breaking down the current account into its component parts, he traces the cause of the deficit. He refutes the arguments of other economists that the balance of payments deficit is self-correcting, unimportant, or the result of other domestic forces (namely, too low a level of national saving) and outlines policy approaches to solving the problem. Godley notes that although the strategic problems posed are specific to this country and the United States may have to take unilateral action to solve them, the problems have arisen because there is no significant international regulation of the system as a whole. Inherent flaws have developed in the system of international production, trade, and payments as that system has expanded and become increasingly deregulated. "All the difficulties that exist, or that are foreshadowed in this brief, would be best resolved by energetic international cooperation, of which there is at present little sign. "...|$|R

40|$|Sulphate {{leaching}} losses {{may reduce}} the long-term possibility of maintaining the S supply of crops in low input farming systems. Sulphate leaching and <b>S</b> <b>balances</b> were investigated in an organic dairy/crop rotation (barley [Hordeum vulgare]  grass-clover [Lolium perenne/Trifolium repens]  grass-clover  barley/pea [Pisum arvénse]  winter wheat [Tritucum aestivum]  fodder beet [Beta vulgaris]) from 1994 until 1998. The importance of climatic conditions and use of different organic manure types at different application rates for sulphate leaching were investigated and related to the concurrent nitrate leaching. As an average of years, sulphate leaching from the crop rotation was 20 kg S ha- 1, which was equivalent to 60 % of the total input to the rotation. Sulphate leaching was very variable over the years (4 - 45 kg S ha- 1 for the same crop) and {{closely related to the}} annual drainage volume (r 2 = 0. 99; P< 0. 01). The same relationship between drainage and nitrate leaching was not significant. No differences were observed in sulphate leaching between the organic manure types or the application rates, but significant differences were found in sulphate leaching between the different crops in the rotation. In the year with the largest drainage volume, there was a significant correlation between the S input in irrigation and sulphate leaching (r 2 = 0. 69; P< 0. 05). The <b>S</b> <b>balance</b> was slightly positive when averaged over the four years, as more S was imported than removed. Thus, immediate S deficiency may not occur, but in the longer term a negative <b>S</b> <b>balance</b> must be expected in this crop rotation. However, even with a positive overall <b>S</b> <b>balance,</b> the <b>S</b> input is not necessarily synchronised with plant needs. In order to maintain a sufficient S supply in the future when further reductions in the atmospheric deposition are expected, it is important to reduce leaching losses of sulphate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{open economy}} portfolio balance model with endogenous asset supply. Domestic producers choose an optimal capital structure and finance capital goods through credit, bonds and equity assets. Private households hold {{a portfolio of}} domestic and foreign assets, shift balances depending on risk-return considerations, and maximise real consumption {{in accordance with the}} law of one price. Within this general equilibrium model, it will be shown that central bank interventions may promote an inefficient international allocation of real capital. The application of expansive monetary interventions throughout the course of economic crises maintains the domestic stock of real capital at the cost of inflation, currency devaluation, distortions of interest rates and asset prices, and risk clusters on the central bank <b>s</b> <b>balance</b> sheet. Exchange rate stabilising interventions have the result that the central bank can also stabilise the domestic stock of real capital.

40|$|This paper assesses {{prospects}} for sustained {{improvement in the}} U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> drawing on both model-based macro analysis and examination of disaggregated data. Most model projections of the future path of U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> show the recent improvement petering out by the end 1989 or so. Key structural factors leading to the expected future worsening of U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> are two asymmetries [...] the "income asymmetry" and the "pass-through asymmetry". That is, asymmetries in the pricing behavior of U. S. exporters and foreign suppliers and asymmetries in the elasticities of U. S. demand for imports and foreign demand for U. S. exports with respect to economic activity.; However, could projections based on historical relationships be misleading? Have these models ignored important changes in the international environment? Changes in trading partners and composition of trade, in income responsiveness, exchange rate movements and price competitiveness, the net debt position, trade protection, long-term supply response, and model uncertainty are considered.; Plausible (or sometimes implausible) changes in the historical relationships do not materially change the medium-term outlook for a future deterioration in U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance.</b> However, model uncertainty suggests that confidence intervals around the point estimates of key parameters are sufficiently large that periods of improvement in U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> are {{within the realm of}} statistical probability; nevertheless, the outlook for sustained improvement remains problematical.; This suggests that outcomes for growth and the exchange rate different from those assumed in the projections, and which would probably stem from a different configuration of fiscal and monetary policies here and abroad, are likely necessary to put U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> on a sustainable path.
