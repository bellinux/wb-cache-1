5|$|A fire {{destroyed}} part of {{the monastery}} during the War of the Spanish Succession. During the Peninsular War, French troops looted the buildings and used them as barracks. The monks were forced to leave in 1820 because of <b>confiscations</b> by a new liberal government, but they returned in 1823 after King Ferdinand VII restored conservative institutions. However, the nearby villagers denied support to the monastery despite its protection by the king. The monastery ceased to operate in 1835: the Ecclesiastical <b>Confiscations</b> of Mendizábal enforced a law declaring that minor religious holdings housing fewer than 12 residents were to be forfeit to the state; the monastery had only four monks and one lay brother, who were cast out.|$|E
5|$|During Becket's exile Foliot {{collected}} {{and sent to}} Rome Peter's Pence, the annual payment from England to the papacy. Foliot observed during the conflict {{that it was not}} a theological or moral dispute, merely one over church government. During Becket's exile, the king confiscated the archbishop's estates, and also confiscated the benefices of the clerks who had followed Becket into exile. Foliot was made custodian of those benefices in the diocese of Canterbury. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the <b>confiscations,</b> but evidence appears to show that the <b>confiscations</b> were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious custodian who made sure that little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went to religious purposes.|$|E
5|$|This period {{coincided with}} further <b>confiscations</b> of private {{property}} belonging to Armenians. Special commissions were created to separate the evictions of non-Muslims from others.

40|$|AbstractSince the {{creation}} of the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) in 2001, which is now known as the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 200 l (the 2001 Act), money laundering and terrorism financing have been criminalized. Other legal measures to disrupt the flows and incidence of such crimes were also introduced involving freezing, seizure and <b>confiscation</b> or forfeiture of the proceeds of such crimes by the authorities. Prior to the 2001 Act, <b>confiscation</b> cases were almost exclusively centred on drug trafficking cases under the Dangerous Drug legislation. The 2001 Act entailed two current types of <b>confiscation</b> of criminal property, namely, the criminal <b>confiscation</b> that is based upon the prosecution of the accused person and the civil <b>confiscation</b> when there is no such prosecution. This paper seeks to examine these <b>confiscation</b> systems in Malaysia to understand their origin, nature {{and the extent to which}} such <b>confiscation</b> systems could be governed at the international and local levels. Of significance, is the legal implications of the non-conviction based <b>confiscation</b> that indicates that such <b>confiscation</b> law represents one of the most serious encroachments on private property rights. It is worse when the rule of such <b>confiscation</b> is making the property and not the property owner, guilty until proven innocent...|$|R
50|$|Some States have, {{as far as}} the <b>confiscation</b> of {{proceeds}} is concerned, the {{two systems}} (both property and value <b>confiscation)</b> available under their domestic law. In order to properly take into account these basic differences in national legislation, it was agreed to put the two systems (value and property <b>confiscation)</b> of <b>confiscation</b> on an equal footing and to make the text unambiguous on this point.|$|R
5|$|Despite some {{immediate}} <b>confiscations</b> {{after the}} siege, {{by the time}} of the Restoration of Charles II, the Somerset family had managed to recover most of their possessions, including Raglan Castle. Henry Somerset, the 3rd Marquess, decided to prioritise the rebuilding of his other houses at Troy and Badminton, rather than Raglan, reusing some of the property sent away for safety before the war, or salvaged after the slighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{downward}} spiral {{of the economy}} has been attributed mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land <b>confiscations</b> of 2000. The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|Between his {{coronation}} and 1071, William consolidated {{his hold}} over England, defeating {{a number of}} rebellions that arose particularly {{in the north and}} west of the country. Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh <b>confiscations</b> of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility had been replaced by Norman and other continental nobles.|$|E

50|$|The PC-R-SC {{identified}} considerable {{differences with}} regard to the basic systems of <b>confiscation</b> at national level in the member States of the Council of Europe. All States have a system of so-called property <b>confiscation,</b> that is, the <b>confiscation</b> of specific property, with respect to the instrumentalities used in the commission of offences, including items or substances whose uncontrolled possession is in itself illegal. Some States also know property <b>confiscation</b> for the proceeds, directly or indirectly derived from offences, or their substitutes. As a result of property <b>confiscation,</b> the ownership rights in the specific property concerned are transferred to the State.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, the {{government}} pressed ahead with its Fast Track Land Reform programme, a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing {{land from the}} minority white population to the majority black population. <b>Confiscations</b> of white farmland, continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other supports led to {{a sharp decline in}} agricultural exports, which were traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector. Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|Outwardly, the {{destruction}} and removals for sale {{had changed the}} church forever. Many churches had concealed their vestments and their silver, and had buried their stone altars. There were many disputes {{between the government and}} parishes over church property. Thus, when Edward died in July 1553 and the Duke of Northumberland attempted to have the Protestant Lady Jane Grey made Queen, the unpopularity of the <b>confiscations</b> gave Mary the opportunity to have herself proclaimed Queen, first in Suffolk, and then in London to the acclamation of the crowds.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Soviet {{and native}} Stalinists was {{widespread}} among {{not only the}} general population but also the PZPR ranks, which limited the oppressive system's damage in Poland to well below that of other European communist-ruled countries. Political violence after 1947 was not widespread. The Church, subjected to partial property <b>confiscations,</b> remained largely intact, the marginalized to a considerable degree intelligentsia retained its potential to affect future reforms, the peasantry avoided wholesale collectivization and remnants of private enterprise survived. Gradual liberalizing changes took place between Stalin's death in 1953 and the Polish October of 1956.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} fight more {{effectively}} against {{the financing of}} criminal organisations, Italian legislation on <b>confiscation</b> was significantly modified during the eighties. Since 1982, {{in addition to the}} traditional <b>confiscation</b> regulated by article 240 of the criminal code, new criminal <b>confiscation</b> measures have been introduced to specifically combat organised crime. Furthermore, in that same year, the <b>confiscation</b> of ill-gotten gains can be pursued not only in criminal proceedings, but also in the so called ‘procedimento di prevenzione’. However, several obstacles hamper the implementation of these measures during the entire <b>confiscation</b> procedure, from the investigative phase, to the judicial phase and, finally, to the disposal phase. This essay presents an overview of the development of seizure and <b>confiscation</b> laws in Italy (section 1), and statistics on their application (section 2). It goes on to identify the main obstacles to the implementation of these measures (section 3), and proposes Irish civil <b>confiscation</b> as a ‘reasonable’ and ‘advisable’ model as a basis for the reform of Italian legislation (section 4) ...|$|R

5|$|The rising {{forced a}} change of policy by the regime, which instead of {{attempting}} to replace the landholding classes now looked for a reconciliation with former Royalists and Engagers. This resulted in the Act of Grace and Pardon, proclaimed in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654. Instead of a blanket forfeiture among those implicated in resistance, it named 24 persons (mainly from the nobility) whose lands would be seized, and 73 other landholders who could retain their estates after paying a fine. Even then most of those names were treated with leniency and fines were remitted for <b>confiscations,</b> or were reduced, and some were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued {{to bring in}} additional luxuries, including pet dogs or cats to control the local vermin. The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, {{and a collection of}} 133 books. Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention of the family of Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively normally. The prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various <b>confiscations</b> by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.|$|E
5|$|Angus Maddison {{estimates}} that the country's gross domestic product was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 United States dollars—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did not significantly change {{until the beginning of}} the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, <b>confiscations,</b> and price regulation schemes.|$|E
40|$|Extended <b>confiscation</b> is {{a safety}} measure {{introduced}} in Romanian criminal law in 2012.

5|$|In Japan alone, 39confiscations {{including}} 363live {{animals were}} made between 1998 and 2006, with 2006 being the peak year. During {{the same time}} period, Thai, Indonesian, and Singaporean officials discovered 358lorises destined for Japan. Details of several <b>confiscations</b> from smuggling attempts between Thailand and Japan have been reported by the IPPL, including one event on 2May 2007, where 40slow lorises were confiscated at Narita Airport only {{a month before the}} CITES conference that elevated the slow loris status to Appendix I. Twelve of those animals died. The deaths are not unusual, with a mortality rate of 76% for all species of confiscated slow lorises, many dying before they are transferred to zoos. The JWCS suspects that the high mortality rate among smuggled slow lorises causes traders to smuggle more slow lorises than are needed to supply the market.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund, {{supported}} by Zamoyski {{and the former}} king's wife, Anna Jagiellon, was elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on 19 August 1587 and recognized as such by the interrex, the Primate Karnkowski. The election was disputed, however, by Maximilian and opponents of Sigismund chose not to respect the election outcome, decreeing that Maximilian was the rightful monarch three days later on 22 August. The Zborowski family called for the rokosz (legitimate right to rebel) and the election ended in chaos, with several killed and many wounded. For both Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, losing was not an option, as they knew the losing side would likely pay a severe price, from <b>confiscations</b> {{and a loss of}} prestige to a possible death sentence for treason.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of San Martín repeated {{some of the}} ideas outlined in the Operations plan, drafted by Mariano Moreno {{at the beginning of the}} war. A combination of incentives, <b>confiscations</b> and planned economy allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, saltpeter, sulfur and borax, which had several usages and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers. Father José Luis Beltrán headed a military factory of 700 men, which produced rifles and horseshoes. San Martín stayed on good terms with both the {{government of}} Buenos Aires and the provincial caudillos, without fully allying with either one. He was able to receive provisions from both. He considered that the war of independence took priority over the civil wars.|$|E
50|$|<b>Confiscation,</b> {{depending}} on the law stating that all property gained during governmental service belongs to public, was enspoused by Ottomans when Fatih Sultan Mehmet was on the throne. The objective of <b>confiscation</b> was to prevent high-degree servants of accumulating huge amounts of assets and to make them carry out their governmental service properly. But, later on, governors of rural area implemented the <b>confiscation</b> process upon local affluent people in order to offer presents to Sultan and Grand vizier. Mahmud the Second reinforced a new law, stating that <b>confiscation</b> would be only through permission of court.|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{expertise}} of thirty leading experts on <b>confiscation</b> in the EU, {{this is the first}} book to analyse the practice of proceeds from crime <b>confiscation</b> in the original fifteen EU Member States. It examines the implementation of <b>confiscation</b> provisions in all three (investigative, judicial and disposal) phases of <b>confiscation</b> proceedings. It quantifies the enforcement of <b>confiscation</b> provisions in the EU, using an innovative and unique methodology and thereby furnishes understanding of obstacles and best practices. The conclusion of the book is that the ‘tough on criminal wealth’ philosophy is largely alien to the everyday practice of law enforcement agencies. Putting criminals behind bars is still the main aim of the system, and most of the scarce resources available are devoted to achieving this...|$|R

5|$|Earl Thomas, {{with other}} barons, {{captured}} King Edward's favourite, Piers Gaveston, {{and killed him}} in 1312. Nevertheless, the King stayed at Melbourne in 1314. For a time, after Edward's defeat at Bannockburn, the earl, {{a friend of the}} Scots, controlled most of England, but by 1321 Edward had raised an army and driven Thomas from the Midlands. The Lancastrian castles at Melbourne and Tutbury were left deserted and looted by the local populace. Earl Thomas was finally defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. He was swiftly executed, and Robert de Holland was beheaded in 1328. The King sent a garrison to Melbourne and appointed a steward, Ralph Basset, to replace the incumbent, John de Hardedeshull. In March, those who had stolen from the castle were arrested, and by April Edward had withdrawn his troops. He appointed Robert Tocher and Roger de Beler in 1323 to help administer his possessions in Melbourne using money obtained from <b>confiscations</b> of rebel property in Staffordshire. Edward stayed at Melbourne again in 1325, and while there he issued a right to collect tolls to the men of nearby Swarkestone to repair the bridge over the Trent.|$|E
5|$|Under Rau's {{leadership}} the DWK, {{still under}} {{supervision of the}} Soviet Military Administration in Germany (German: Sowjetische Militäradministration in Deutschland or SMAD), quickly developed more and more into a partner of the SMAD with its own conceptions and intentions. This policy was also endorsed by the Soviet chief diplomat in Germany, Vladimir Semyonov, the future Chief Commissar of the USSR in Germany, who already in January 1948 correspondingly stated, that SMAD orders, (which accompanied DWK orders,) should have merely the purpose to back {{the authority of the}} German orders. One of Rau's aims during the meetings with the SMAD was, to come to agreements, which also obliged the Soviet side, including subordinate Soviet authorities, who still engaged in wild <b>confiscations</b> for reparation purposes. An important success in this direction was a half-year plan for the economic development {{in the second half of}} 1948, which was accepted by the SMAD in May 1948. It was followed by a likewise accepted two-year plan for 1949 and 1950.|$|E
5|$|In February 1223, Maulay {{forfeited}} Upavon to the king. This {{was part}} of a string of <b>confiscations</b> that struck at supporters of des Roches, including William de Cantilupe, Breauté, and Robert de Vieuxpont, by taking back grants that had been made earlier and which were held at the king's will. The seizures were made to teach the nobles a lesson and curb their dissension from the royal government, which was in the hands of Roches' rival de Burgh. Most of the manors, including Upavon, were returned to their previous holders in April after a settlement between de Burgh and those who resented his government. Around this time Maulay began work on Mulgrave Castle, in Yorkshire, which {{was part of}} his wife's inheritance. In June and July 1224, Maulay was present at on the royal side at the siege of Bedford Castle, which was held by de Breauté against the government. In 1225 Maulay claimed that he had sworn to King John that he would not give up custody of the royal castles until after John's son came of age. Maulay lost Upavon to the king again in 1229, with the king regranting Upavon to Gilbert Basset. This grant to Basset was by charter, with the lands to be held in fee. Maulay claimed that he only gave up his tenure because of threats by de Burgh.|$|E
50|$|Within a {{few weeks}} of the {{introduction}} of Trumbull's bill, different ideological coalitions emerged. Trumbull took the lead of a group of radicals sponsoring a vigorous <b>confiscation</b> bill, joined by Charles Sumner of Massachusetts and Benjamin Wade of Ohio in the Senate and George Julian of Indiana in the House. To their amazement these <b>confiscation</b> radicals soon faced bitter opposition both from outside and from within their own Republican Party. A group of conservatives soon began to condemn the radical bill as a violation of the Fifth Amendment and the Constitution's prohibition of bills of attainder. Republican senator Orville Browning of Illinois, a powerful friend of President Lincoln, led these conservatives in condemning the radical <b>confiscation</b> plan. As winter turned to spring and spring to summer, Congress argued endlessly over <b>confiscation.</b> Was property <b>confiscation</b> a legitimate power of the national legislature? Was <b>confiscation</b> in violation of the Constitution? Were slaves a type of property subject to <b>confiscation?</b> These basic questions drew intense scrutiny and the congressional debates were remarkable for their sustained consideration, in the midst of war, of the power of government and the rights of property.|$|R
