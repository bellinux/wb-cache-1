Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in resuscitation, {{the ability to}} predict survival at cardiac arrests remains unsophisticated. We identified the factors determining outcome of all <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitations</b> performed at our institution over a 4 -year period, and used a Cox multivariate regression model to design prognostic indices to assess the probability of successful resuscitation and hospital discharge. Cardiac arrests (710) were studied, and 193 (28 %) were successfully resuscitated. The most influential variables judged by the size and significance of their logistic regression coefficients, were rhythm, resuscitation delay, and age (for successful resuscitation), and rhythm, performance of intubation and defibrillation, defibrillation delay, and age (for survival until discharge). The combination of these in a prognostic index reliably predicted both outcome (area under the receiver operating curve of 0. 78), and survival until discharge (area under the curve of 0. 80) ...|$|R
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> <b>Resuscitation</b> have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Emergency {{department}} {{performance index}} (EPI) greatly influences {{the function of}} other hospital’s units and also patient satisfaction. Recently, the Iranian Ministry of Health has defined specific national EPI containing five indexes. In the present study, the performance indexes of emergency department (ED) in one educational hospital has been assessed before and after establishment of emergency medicine. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study the ED of Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital, Tehran, Iran has been assessed during one-year period from March 2012 to February 2013. The study was divided into two six-month periods, before and after establishment of emergency medicine. Five performance indexes including: the percentage of patients were disposed during 6 -hour, leaved the ED in a 12 -hour, had unsuccessful <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitations</b> (CPR), discharged against medical advice, and the mean time of triage were calculated using data of department of medical records on daily patients’ files. Then, Mann-Whitney U {{test was used to}} make comparisons at P< 0. 05. Results: The average triage time decreased from 6. 04 minutes {{in the first six months}} to 1. 5 minutes in the second six months (P= 0. 06). The percentage of patients leaving the ED in a 12 -hour decreased from 97. 3 % to 90. 4 % (P= 0. 004). However, the percentage of disposed patients during 6 -hour (P= 0. 2), unsuccessful CPR (P= 0. 34) and discharged against medical advice (P= 0. 42) did not differ between the two periods. Conclusion: It seems that establishment of emergency medicine could be able to improve ED performance indexes such as time to triage and leave in a 12 -hour period.  </p...|$|R
25|$|The modern {{elements}} of resuscitation for sudden cardiac arrest are <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR in turn consists of mouth-to-mouth ventilation and chest compression), defibrillation and {{emergency medical services}} (the means to bring these techniques to the patient quickly).|$|E

25|$|Defibrillation is the {{definitive}} treatment of ventricular fibrillation, whereby an electrical current {{is applied to}} the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles, with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for co-ordinated contractions to occur again. The use of this is often dictated around the world by Advanced Cardiac Life Support or Advanced Life Support algorithms, which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors, nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs, predominantly epinephrine, after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation, as well as <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR) in between defibrillation attempts. Though ALS/ACLS algorithms encourage the use of drugs, they state first and foremost that defibrillation should not be delayed for any other intervention and that adequate <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> be delivered with minimal interruption.|$|E
40|$|Background Precise and {{complete}} documentation of in-hospital <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitations</b> is important but data quality can be poor. In the present study, we investigated {{the effect of}} a tablet-based application for real-time resuscitation documentation used by the emergency team leader on documentation quality and clinical performance of the emergency team. Methods Senior anaesthesiologists either used the tablet-based application during the simulated resuscitation for documentation and also used the application for the final documentation or conducted the full documentation {{at the end of the}} scenario using the local hospital information system. The latter procedure represents the current local documentation method. All scenarios were video recorded. To assess the documentation, we compared the precision of intervention delivery times, documentation completeness, and final documentation time. To assess clinical performance, we compared adherence to guidelines for defibrillation and adrenaline administration, the no-flow fraction, and the time to first defibrillation. Results The results showed significant benefits for the tablet-based application compared to the hospital information system for precision of the intervention delivery times, the final documentation time, and the no-flow fraction. We observed no differences between the groups for documentation completeness, adherence to guidelines for defibrillation and adrenaline administration, and the time to first defibrillation. Discussion In the presented study, we observed that a tablet-based application can improve documentation data quality. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a well-designed application can be used in real-time by a member of the emergency team with possible beneficial effects on clinical performance. Conclusion The present evaluation confirms the advantage of tablet-based documentation tools and also shows that the application can be used by an active member of an emergency team without compromising clinical performance...|$|R

40|$|Limits {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} closed-chest compression as a <b>cardiopulmonary</b> cerebral <b>resuscitation</b> technique have been pointed out, {{and the use of}} cardiopulmonary bypass apparatus has been gaining attention as an alternative to this technique. However, the clinical application of these machines in first-aid was not realized until the advancement of certain medical technologies, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenator, centrifugal pumps, and percutaneous-insertion-enabled cannula of the current percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system. There have been many recent reports of the clinical application of PCPS in cardiac arrest patients. The reports showed very good results. For example, in 1983, Phillips and joint researchers reported that from among five cardiac arrest patients they had saved the lives of three using PCPS. From 1989, Safer and joint researchers began clinical studies of PCPS. In 1992, they reported that, from among 187 cardiac arrest patients they had saved the lives of 40 (21 %). In our hospital, PCPS as a resuscitation technique has been applied in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients since 1988. We applied PCPS in 156 cases up to March 2005 and, as a result, saved 34 lives (21. 2 %) and acquired 16 intact survival cases (10. 2 %). In 1999, we began to attach importance to the idea of comprehensive lifesaving medical services, including PCPS for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. That is, we tried to improve pre-hospital medical procedures, established a radical treatment system for cardiogenic diseases, and introduced post-resuscitation brain hypothermia therapy. As a result, the PCPS introduction time was remarkably shortened and the lifesaving rate was increased. PCPS as a <b>cardiopulmonary</b> cerebral <b>resuscitation</b> technique has several problems: there is no established standard for PCPS and no definitive evaluation of the technique. However, it cannot be negligible that, since 1999, among the cardiac arrest cases in which ordinary advanced life support was not available, at leas 10 % were acquired as intact survival cases. As a crucial next step, we will establish a standard for PCPS and examine its prospective usage by examining past cases. It is said that PCPS is a high-cost treatment; however, as a counterbalance, we should consider that other lifesaving costs are included in the cost of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treatmen...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to summarise current research {{in the use of}} three different vasopressors for cardiopulmonary arrest. Both experimental and clinical studies from human and veterinary literature are employed to assess the efficacy of these vasopressors and to recognise potential for current use of the drugs in veterinary emergency medicine. Adrenaline is the most effective vasopressor available, however, high doses of adrenaline are detrimental to the post-resuscitative period. The use of methoxamine avoids some of the adverse effects of adrenaline but its efficacy as an adequate vasopressor for <b>cardiopulmonary</b> and cerebral <b>resuscitation</b> is questionable.

40|$|Cardiac arrest induces whole-body ischemia, {{which causes}} damage to {{multiple}} organs. Understanding how each organ responds to ischemia/reperfusion {{is important to}} develop better resuscitation strategies. Because direct measurement of organ function is not practicable in most animal models, we attempt to use mitochondrial respiration to test efficacy of resuscitation on the brain, heart, kidney, and liver following prolonged cardiac arrest. Male Sprague-Dawley rats are subjected to asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest for 30 [*]min or 45 [*]min, or 30 [*]min cardiac arrest followed by 60 [*]min <b>cardiopulmonary</b> bypass <b>resuscitation.</b> Mitochondria are isolated from brain, heart, kidney, and liver tissues and examined for respiration activity. Following cardiac arrest, a time-dependent decrease in state- 3 respiration is observed in mitochondria from all four tissues. Following 60 [*]min resuscitation, the respiration activity of brain mitochondria varies greatly in different animals. The activity after resuscitation remains the same in heart mitochondria and significantly increases in kidney and liver mitochondria. The result shows that inhibition of state- 3 respiration is a good marker to evaluate the efficacy of resuscitation for each organ. The resulting state- 3 respiration of brain and heart mitochondria following resuscitation reenforces the need for developing better strategies to resuscitate these critical organs following prolonged cardiac arrest...|$|R

In 40, 7 % the CPR has been initial successful. 37 {{patients}} have been discharged from the hospital. That means only 4, 9 % of all registered adults (n = 755) have been discharged, {{it also means that}} 12, 1 % of the initial successful treated patients or 17, 1 % of all transported patients left the hospital. The CPR has been more successful if the medical history has been known, an association which also has been found as significant in the multivariate analysis. The most frequent accompanying diseases have been cardiac diseases (42 %), diabetes mellitus (8, 6 %), alcoholism, drug abuse and cirrhosis (7, 6 %). In cases of hypertension or diabetes in the anamnesis the CPR has been more successful. The primary success of CPR has also been more successful in cases of disorders of the cardiac rhythm (61, 2 %) and myocardial infarction (48, 8 %). In the ECG written at the place of shock the most frequent diagnosis has been asystolia (61, 2 %), ventricular fibrillation (VF) has been found in 32, 2 % of all cases, an electromechanically dissociation (EMD) in 6, 1 %. The success of CPR in VF-patients has been better than in asystolic ones (61, 8 % vs. 27, 9 %). VF has been detected as a factor for a better primary success of CPR in the multivariate analysis. 67, 6 % of the CPR where performed in the patients flat, 26, 3 % at public places. The CPR has been started most often by the ambulance staff (78, 2 %), in 9, 2 % an emergency doctor started the treatment, in 6, 2 % medical laymen and in 5, 7 % paramedical staff. The CPR has been most successful when laymen did start (71, 2 %), the multivariate analysis appeared that the CPR was less successful when the ambulance staff initiated it. The time (AT) the ambulance staff arrived varied from < 1 minute - 39 minutes (8, 6 ± 4, 4 minutes). Until an AT of 15 minutes the primary success of CPR has been about 35 %, it decreased over 29, 2 % (up to 20 minutes) to 18, 1 % (more than 20 minutes).

40|$|The {{survival}} of patients after prolonged cardiac arrest is still inadequate. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) represents an alternative therapeutic method {{for patients who}} {{do not respond to}} conventional <b>cardiopulmonary</b> cerebral <b>resuscitation.</b> This technology is used to support the circulation of a patient with severe cardiac failure. Between June 1997 and January 2003, 40 ECLS procedures were performed in patients who presented with refractory cardiac arrest. During external cardiac massage, the patient was connected to an extracorporeal circuit by the insertion of an arterial and venous cannula through the femoral vessels. The extracorporeal circuit included a centrifugal pump and an oxygenator. Mean age was 42 ± 15 years; the average time of external cardiac massage was 105 ± 44 minutes. Once the circulation was restored, 22 patients were disconnected from the extracorporeal circulation because of brain death or multiorgan failure; after 24 hours, among the 18 survivors, 6 were weaned off the pump, 9 were bridged to a ventricular assist device, and 2 patients were directly bridged to cardiac transplantation. Eight patients are alive and without any sequelae at 18 month's follow-up. In prolonged cardiac arrest with failing conventional measures, rescue by extracorporeal support provides an ultimate therapeutic option with a good outcome in survivors. Our results encourage the wider application of ECLS for refractory cardiocirculatory arrest in selected patients.
