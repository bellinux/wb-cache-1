50|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} currently used to manage M. phaseolina fungal infections. Often, fungicides {{are used to}} inhibit mycelial growth. These include thiram, iprodione, <b>carbendazim,</b> pyraclostrobin, fluquinconazol, tolyfluanid, and metalaxyl and penflufen + trifloxystrobin.

In this same study, the M. phaseolina isolate showed insensitivity to the active ingredients fluquinconazole, metalaxyl, thiram and tolyfluanid. Thus, fungicides are not necessarily an effective way to manage this fungal pathogen.|$|E

50|$|Most {{diseases}} {{come from}} the uncharacteristic growing conditions of vanilla. Therefore, conditions such as excess water, insufficient drainage, heavy mulch, overpollination, and too much shade favor disease development. Vanilla is susceptible to many fungal and viral diseases. Fusarium, Sclerotium, Phytophthora, and Colletrotrichum species cause rots of root, stem, leaf, bean, and shoot apex. These diseases can be controlled by spraying Bordeaux mixture (1%), <b>carbendazim</b> (0.2%) and copper oxychloride (0.2%).|$|E
5000|$|Botryosphaeria corticola [...] can {{be managed}} in high value trees, {{but there is no}} current {{management}} for forest trees. <b>Carbendazim</b> and thiophanate-methyl have shown to prevent infection in cork oak in Europe, where it is applied after cork has been harvested. Sanitation is the most common management technique for this disease. [...] Branches with diseased tissue are pruned off, and heavily infected trees are removed. This prevents future infections by limiting the amount of spores in the area.|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} when a {{pathogen}} evolves resistance to one fungicide, it automatically obtains resistance to others - a {{phenomenon known as}} cross resistance. These additional fungicides are normally of the same chemical family or have the same mode of action, or can be detoxified by the same mechanism. Sometimes negative cross resistance occurs, where resistance to one chemical class of fungicides leads {{to an increase in}} sensitivity to a different chemical class of fungicides. This has been seen with <b>carbendazim</b> and diethofencarb.|$|E
5000|$|Lignasan BLP (<b>carbendazim</b> phosphate), {{introduced}} in the 1970s, was the first fungicide used to control Dutch elm disease. This had to be injected into {{the base of the}} tree using specialized equipment, and was never especially effective. It is still sold under the name [...] "Elm Fungicide". Arbotect (thiabendazole hypophosphite) became available some years later, and it has been proven effective. Arbotect must be injected every two to three years to provide ongoing control; the disease generally cannot be eradicated once a tree is infected.|$|E
50|$|Exposure to {{a variety}} of {{chemical}} compounds in the environment have caused reproductive impairment to Florida panthers. Tests show that the differences between males and females in estradiol levels are insignificant, which suggests that males have been feminized due to chemical exposure. Feminized males are much less likely to reproduce, which represents a significant threat to a subspecies that already has a low population count and a lot of inbreeding. Chemical compounds that have created abnormalties in Florida panther reproduction include herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides such as benomyl, <b>carbendazim,</b> chlordecone, methoxychlor, methylmercury, fenarimol, and TCDD.|$|E
50|$|As {{fungicides}} {{are largely}} ineffective, {{there are few}} options for managing Panama disease. Chemical sterilisation of the soil with methyl bromide significantly reduced incidence of the disease but {{was found to be}} effective for only three years after which the pathogen had recolonised the fumigated areas. Injecting the host plants with <b>carbendazim</b> and potassium phosphonate appears to provide some control but results have been inconclusive. Heat treatment of soil has also been tried in the Philippines but the pathogen is likely to reinvade the treated area. The greatest hope for managing this disease in infested soils is the development of genetic modifications that will provide resistant cultivars.Modified bananas developed in collaboration by Ugandan and Belgian scientists were reported in 2008 to be being grown experimentally in Uganda.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control Fungicides {{that may}} be used to {{effectively}} control N. galligena are limited. Infection by N. galligena often occurs through wounds in the autumn and spring-summer period, therefore, it is recommended that fungicides be applied at these times. The application of fungicides will prevent or decrease the sporulation of existing cankers, which in turn decreases the inoculum available to spread the pathogen. Fungicides may also protect trees from N. galligena through a fungitoxic deposit over favorable infection sites. A mixture of <b>carbendazim</b> and a scab fungicide, such as dithianon, is the suggested treatment in areas with a severe canker problem. In areas with a reduced risk of canker, it is recommended that a scab fungicide be applied in the spring-summer and copper oxychloride applied at leaf-fall to avoid infection. Although scab fungicides are commonly used for managing apple scab, cankers are also controlled when applied at the correct time. Thiophanate-methyl is another fungicide that is highly effective because it protects trees against the pathogen and suppresses sporulation of already infected plants. However, the application of thiophanate-methyl is limited due to its harm on organisms such as mites.|$|E

Lumbricus terrestris were maintained in soil columns to which <b>carbendazim</b> and then deionized water (a rainfall substitute) were applied. <b>Carbendazim</b> was applied at 4 [*]kg/ha, the rate recommended in pesticide field trials. Three rainfall regimes were investigated: initial and delayed heavy rainfall 24 [*]h and 6 d after <b>carbendazim</b> application, and frequent rainfall every 48 [*]h. Earthworm mortality and movement of <b>carbendazim</b> through the soil was assessed 14 d after <b>carbendazim</b> application. No detectable movement of <b>carbendazim</b> occurred through the soil in any of the treatments or controls. Mortality in the initial heavy and frequent rainfall was significantly higher (approximately 55 %) than in the delayed rainfall treatment (approximately 25 %). This was due to reduced bioavailability of <b>carbendazim</b> in the latter treatment due to a prolonged period of sorption of <b>carbendazim</b> to soil particles before rainfall events. The impact of <b>carbendazim</b> application on earthworm surface activity was assessed using video cameras. <b>Carbendazim</b> applications significantly reduced surface activity due to avoidance behavior of the earthworms.

Pregnant female rats were treated with 6. 25, 12. 5 or 25 mg/kg <b>carbendazim,</b> 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg benomyl, and 0. 6, 2. 5 or 10 mg/kg flutamide by gavage once daily from gestational day 0 to 20. Alternatively, another group of female rats was cotreated with 25 mg/kg <b>carbendazim</b> or 100 mg/kg benomyl and 0. 6, 2. 5, and 10 mg/kg flutamide. The various treatments decreased the survival rates of pups on postnatal day (PND) I and 21. In male offspring, 12. 5 and 25 mg/kg <b>carbendazim</b> increased anogenital distance (AGD), an androgen-dependent marker, on PND 2. Treatment with benomyl also increased AGD. Cotreatment with 25 mg/kg carbendazirn with 0. 6, 2. 5, and 10 mg/kg flutamide blocked the androgenic effect on AGD induced by <b>carbendazim.</b> The androgenic effects of <b>carbendazim</b> and benomyl on AGD were reversible on PND 22 and later. <b>Carbendazim</b> had no effects on other androgen-dependent markers including testis and epididymis malformations, hypospadias, nipple retention, and organ weights of seminal vesicle and levator ani bulbocavernosus muscle on PND 56. Surprisingly, <b>carbendazim</b> antagonized the antiandrogenic effects on these markers induced by flutamide cotreatment. In female offspring, carbendazirn produced synergistic effects on the flutamide cotreatment-mediated increases of organs weights in liver and kidney on PND 56. Carbenazim had no marked effects on female reproductive organs. These findings show that <b>carbendazim</b> exposure in utero displays a transient and weak androgenic effect and reduces flutamide antiandrogenicity in male rats. The fungicide enhances flutamide-mediated liver and kidney weight increases in female rats.

C/MC films with <b>carbendazim</b> had lower solubility values than control films. The moisture sorption isotherms of C/MC films incorporated with <b>carbendazim</b> were examined for water activities in the range of 0. 11 - 0. 86 at 25 ± 0. 5 o C. These isotherms showed that <b>carbendazim</b> content affected the equilibrium moisture content (%EMC) of the films and the %EMC of all films dramatically increased above a w = 0. 66. The C/MC films incorporated with <b>carbendazim</b> exhibited lower %EMC than that of the control films under all relative humidity conditions. The changes of the moisture sorption isotherms of the C/MC films at different <b>carbendazim</b> contents can be related to changes in cross-section morphology of these films. By understanding the behavior of the sorption isotherms, it is possible to predict the moisture sorption properties of C/MC films via moisture sorption empirical models.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the systemic fungicides in the sixties, the phenomenon of resistance to these compounds has become a serious problem in the control of fungal plant diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} contribute to the knowledge about the consequences of fungicide applications in cereals with respect to the emergence of fungicide resistant strains of Septorianodorum, the causal agent of glume blotch of wheat, and of Cercosporellaherpotrichoides, the causal agent of eyespot of wheat, barley and rye. CHAPTER 3. An accurate and reproducible inoculation method was used to inoculate wheat seedlings with spore suspensions of S. nodorum. The effect of postinfectional applications of the systemic fungicides <b>carbendazim</b> and edifenphos with respect to the development of symptoms and the length of the latent period was studied. Both fungicides suppressed the development of symptoms and elongated the duration of the latent period, the extent to which depending on the concentration of each fungicide used. CHAPTER 4. It is suggested that alternate or combined use of two systemic fungicides with a different mode of action can reduce the enrichment of specific resistant forms in a fungal population. To verify these statements, model experiments were carried out under controlled conditions. During 9 passages on living wheat plants, inoculated with spore suspensions of S. nodorum, the fungicides <b>carbendazim</b> and edifenphos were applied either alone or as a mixture in each passage, or applied alternately from passage to passage. After 9 passages, disease control by either fungicide alone was reduced. This tendency was not so pronounced in that variant where the fungicides were applied alternately and nearly absent in that variant where a mixture was applied. Comparable results were obtained in experiments on agar media. A stable edifenphos resistant strain was selected in that variant, where S. nodorum in each passage was cultured on plates with edifenphos. With C. herpotrichoides, experiments were carried out on agar media only, using <b>carbendazim</b> and nuarimol. Here, a strong effect of the alternate exposure of the fungus to these two compounds was present. since the fungus was hardly able to grow on plates with a moderate dosis of <b>carbendazim,</b> after first being cultured on plates with nuarimol. CHAPTER 5. The effect of field applications of thiophanate methyl and edifenphos on the frequency of resistant spores in field isolates of S. nodorum was examined, during five vegetation periods between 1973 and 1977. Two types of <b>carbendazim</b> resistant strains were present in S. nodorum. Weakly <b>carbendazim</b> resistant strains were inhibited at 5 μg/ml <b>carbendazim</b> in vitro and occured at a frequency of about 1 : 7 x 10 6 in populations from unsprayed plots. Highly <b>carbendazim</b> resistant strains occurred at a frequency of about 100 times that low and were hardly inhibited at 1000 μg/ml <b>carbendazim</b> in vitro. In each year, there was a significant increase in the frequency of weakly <b>carbendazim</b> resistant spores after thiophanate methyl applications in the field. but the absolute figures remained rather low. In no case, an isolate with more than 1 : 10 4 weakly resistant spores was found. There was no clear yearly increase in the frequency of highly <b>carbendazim</b> resistant spores after thiophanate methyl application. Edifenphos resistant spores were present in field isolates of S. nodorum. Their frequency- about 1 : 10 7 in isolates from unsprayed plots-, increased significantly after edifenphos application in the field, but the absolute figures remained rather low. During three years, field trials were carried out with C. herpotrichoides to examine the effect of <b>carbendazim</b> application in the field on the frequency of <b>carbendazim</b> resistant spores in field isolates. Their frequency in isolates from unsprayed plots was about 1 : 7 x 10 8 . This frequency increased after <b>carbendazim</b> applications, but mostly on an insignificant scale only. CHAPTER 6. Fungicide sensitive and resistant strains of S. nodorum were compared with respect to their mycelial growth rate, their sporulation capacity and their pathogenicity on agar medium and/or living wheat plants. Weakly <b>carbendazim</b> resistant strains showed a significantly faster mycelial growth on agar media with <b>carbendazim,</b> than sensitive ones, but were almost completely inhibited at 5 μg/ml <b>carbendazim.</b> This growth reduction was accompaniedby an increase in the number of spores, produced per mm 2 mycelium. Highly <b>carbendazim</b> resistant strains were able to grow and produce spores at 1000 μg/ml <b>carbendazim</b> in vitro. Resistant strians were present with a mycelial growth and spore production equal to that of sensitive ones. Pathogenicity tests with sensitive and highly <b>carbendazim</b> resistant strains on living wheat plants showed the same tendency, as far as the development of symptoms and sporeproduction is concerned. Edifenphos resistant strains of S. nodorum were compared with sensitive ones in tests on agar media and on wheat plants. Resistant strains were strongly inhibited at 200 μg/ml edifenphos in vitro. Edifenphos resistant strains were present with an equal fitness as sensitive ones, when grown in the absence of edifenphos, on agar media and on living wheat plants. The tests with C. herpotrichoides were performed with sensitive mother strains and the corresponding <b>carbendazim.</b> resistant daughter strains. These resistant strains were able to grow and produce spores even at 1000 μg/ml <b>carbendazim</b> in vitro. They produced more spores per mm 2 mycelium when cultured in the presence of <b>carbendazim</b> than in its absence. The properties of <b>carbendazim</b> resistant strains in vitro and in vivo did not differ very much from those of sensitive strains, in the absence of the fungicide. CHAPTER 7. The competitive ability of resistant strains was studied by inoculating wheat plants with different mixtures of resistant and sensitive spores. <b>Carbendazim</b> resistant strains of S. nodorum and C. herpotrichoides could maintain themselves in the mixed population for three passages on wheat plants, even in the absence of any fungicide selection pressure. In case of a postinfectional fungicide application, only <b>carbendazim</b> resistant strains could be reisolated. Edifenphos resistant strains disappeared from the respective populations in the absence of the fungicide, due to a smaller relative reproduction ratio...|$|E

'Mikado' pea seeds were treated with the following fungicides: <b>Carbendazim,</b> <b>Carbendazim</b> + Thiram, Captan, Iprodione, Iprodione + Thiram, Metalaxyl-M + Fludioxonil, Pencycuron, Procymidone and Tolyfluanid. Control seeds were treated with deionized water. Physiological seed quality was evaluated with the following tests: germination, first count, accelerated aging and electrical conductivity. Seeds were sown in soil inoculated and no inoculated with R. solani. The experimental design was completely random with four replications. Seedling emergence was reduced in inoculated soil and the best treatments for R. solani control were <b>Carbendazim,</b> Pencycuron, Iprodione and <b>Carbendazim</b> + Thiram. Captan reduced seed physiological quality in both the laboratory and field...|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} a graphene-based electrochemical sensor for sensitively measuring <b>carbendazim,</b> {{which is one}} of the effective benzimidazole fungicides popularly used in agricul- ture. The β-cyclodextrin-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (β-CD–RGO) nanocomposites were synthesized using hydrazine as the reducing agent at room temperature. The assynthesized nanocomposites were characterized using different analytical methods including UV–visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The nanocomposites with a combination of physicochemical properties of RGO and high molecular recognition capability of β-CD were used to modify the surface of a glassy carbon electrode for the electrochemical determination of the drug <b>carbendazim</b> using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. The current responses of <b>carbendazim</b> on the β-CD–RGO-modified electrode were greatly enhanced compared to that on the bare electrode due to the electrocatalytic effect of β-CD–RGO. It was found that the peak currents increased linearly with the <b>carbendazim</b> concentration in the range between 0. 1 and 40 μ M. The obtained results suggest that β-CD–RGO composite could be a potential candidate for the preparation of effective electrochemical sensors for <b>carbendazim</b> or similar drugs in the future...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the ability of}} capillary electrochromatography (CEC) for the determination of imidaclo-prid and <b>carbendazim</b> in tomato samples. A novel liquid crystal crown ether modified hybrid silica monolithic column was synthesized, characterized and developed as separation column for the first time. Baseline separation of imidacloprid and <b>carbendazim</b> could be achieved using a mobile phase containing 90 % (v/v) 20 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0) and 10 % (v/v) acetonitrile. The matrix matched calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficient r 2 > 0. 9998 {{in the range of}} 0. 20 - 10. 00 mg/L. The limits of detection for imidacloprid and <b>carbendazim</b> were 0. 061 and 0. 15 mg/kg, respectively, which were below the maximum residue limits established by the European Union as well as Codex Alimentarius. Average recoveries for imidacloprid and <b>carbendazim</b> varied from 101. 6 - 108. 0 % with relative standard deviations lower than 6. 3 %. This method was applied to the analysis of tomatoes collected from local markets.

40|$|Field experiments, and {{laboratory}} {{tests were conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy of four commercial formulations of fungicides, against root-rot and leaf spot diseases of wheat, the formulations contained <b>carbendazim,</b> and {{three of them were}} ready-mix combinations of <b>carbendazim</b> and triazol fungicides. The formulations included cyproconazol / <b>carbendazim</b> (Alto-Ambel, 46 % SC); Flutriafol / <b>carbendazim</b> (Shafy, 24. 4 % SC); Propiconazol / cabendazim (Tilt CB, 18. 75 % SC) and <b>Carbendazim</b> (50 % WP). Test fungi were Alternaria tritici, Fusarium graminearum and Helminthosporium sativum. Results of laboratory tests indicated that, Alto-Ambel formulation showed the strongest inhibitory effect of H. sativum hyphal growth, followed by Shafy and Tilt CB formulations. <b>Carbendazim</b> exhibited the strongest effect against F. graminearum, but without appreciable effect on either A. tritici or H. sativum hyphal growth. Field experiment showed that, application of any of the formulations on wheat, 4 – 5 weeks after seeding produced good control of root-rot and leaf spot diseases of wheat, and Alto-Ambel (46 % SC) was the strongest in decreasing disease severity of leaf spot caused by Alternaria and Helminthosporium, whereas Tilt CB (18. 75 % SC) was the strongest against root-rot caused by Fusarium and Helminthosporium. Combination formulations (Alto-Ambel, Shafy and Tilt CB) showed an effective reduction in the percentages of the presence of Helminthosporium and Alternaria in leaf spot disease and of Fusarium in root-rot disease of wheat plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} eyespot of <b>carbendazim,</b> {{prochloraz}} or {{a mixture of}} <b>carbendazim</b> and prochloraz, applied twice yearly and to the same plots in each year, were studied in five successive crops of winter wheat. Some plots were uninoculated (with a background population of the eyespot fungus, Pseudocerosporella herpotrichoides, which was initially mainly MBC-sensitive W-type), whereas others were inoculated artificially in the first autumn of the experiment (1984) with mainly MBC-sensitive W-type, MBC-resistant W-type, MBC-sensitive R-type or MBC-resistant R-type fungus. Samples were taken in April (1985 - 1987) and July (1985 - 1989). When all inoculation treatments are considered together, <b>carbendazim</b> was ineffective at all sampling times after April 1985 because of its rapid selection for MBC-resistance, and increased eyespot incidence and severity in some samples. Prochloraz applied alone decreased eyespot incidence and severity at all sample times except July 1988. Where applied with <b>carbendazim,</b> prochloraz always decreased eyespot incidence and severity, sometimes more so than when applied alone. The control of eyespot by the fungicides {{was influenced by the}} initial populations in the first two seasons only. <b>Carbendazim</b> decreased eyespot incidence in 1985 only where no artificial inoculum was added (both samples) and where mainly MBC-sensitive R-type inoculum was added (April 1985). Prochloraz applied alone was ineffective in July 1985 where mainly MBC-sensitive R-type fungus was added, and, applied with <b>carbendazim,</b> was ineffective in July 1986 where mainly MBC-resistant fungus was added. Subsequently, the populations were unrelated to the initial populations and were mainly a result of selection by fungicides where these were applied. Although selecting for the R-type fungus and, where no <b>carbendazim</b> was applied, for MBC-sensitivity, prochloraz remained generally effective after repeated applications over five seasons...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Amongst three {{isolates}} of Trichoderma harzianum from rhizosphere (TH- 1) and non-rhizosphere (TH- 2 and TH- 3) soils of chickpea field, TH- 1 exhibited highest antagonistic activity against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri, causing wilt of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Four systemic fungicides viz. <b>carbendazim,</b> propiconazole, thiophanate-methyl and tebuconazole {{were evaluated}} and <b>carbendazim</b> caused maximum growth inhibition of the pathogen and supported maximum multiplication of Rhizobium ciceri in vitro.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to synthesize and characterize the hydrochloride salt of <b>carbendazim</b> with the aim of improving the intrinsic solubility of the parent compound. <b>Carbendazim</b> hydrochloride dihydrate was synthesized for the purpose of increasing the aqueous solubility of the parent drug, <b>carbendazim.</b> This was done with the commonly used saturation and cooling method. The structure was determined by single crystal radiograph crystallography, and the hydrochloride salt was found to be a dihydrate. The salt crystallized in a P 21 21 21 (# 19) space group, which is typical for nonplanar, achiral, and noncentrosymmetric molecules. The asymmetric unit is comprised of 1 molecule each of <b>carbendazim</b> and chloride and 2 water molecules. The <b>carbendazim</b> molecules arrange themselves in a helical structure, with the waters and the chloride molecules in the channel linking the helix. The crystal lattice is held together by numerous hydrogen bonds, as well as van der Waals interactions. The melting point of the salt is 125. 6 °C. The solubility of the salt is 6. 08 mg/mL, which is a thousand-fold increase from the intrinsic solubility (6. 11 μg/mL) of the free base...|$|E
40|$|Carbendazim-amended {{soil was}} placed {{above or below}} unamended soil. Control tests {{comprised}} two layers of unamended soil. Allolobophora chlorotica earthworms were added to either the upper or the unamended soil. After 72 h vertical distributions of earthworms were compared between control and carbendazim-amended experiments. Earthworm distributions in the carbendazim-amended test containers differed significantly from the ‘normal’ distribution observed in the control tests. In {{the majority of the}} experiments, earthworms significantly altered their burrowing behaviour to avoid <b>carbendazim.</b> However, when earthworms were added to an upper layer of carbendazim-amended soil they remained in this layer. This non-avoidance is attributed to (1) the earthworms’ inability to sense the lower layer of unamended soil and (2) the toxic effect of <b>carbendazim</b> inhibiting burrowing. Earthworms modified their burrowing behaviour in response to <b>carbendazim</b> in the soil. This may explain anomalous results observed in pesticide field trials when <b>carbendazim</b> is used as a control substance. ...|$|E
