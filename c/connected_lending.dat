40|$|A central {{feature of}} the Asian {{currency}} crisis was the vast prior capital inflow into the region, and the later rapid reversal of that movement. In seeking to explain why this outflow of capital took place and was so devastating for the countries concerned, various writers have laid blame upon a combination of <b>connected</b> <b>lending,</b> poor bank supervision, moral hazard and Â“crony capitalismÂ”. Our emphasis is different. Much of the capital inflow financed a vast over-expansion of commercial real estate development.

In most countries, however, the market for corporate control is significantly restricted by anti-takeover laws and business practices used to entrench management, such as poison pills, heavy debt, pyramid schemes, and cross-holdings of equity. The key to overcoming these obstacles is to restructure incentives—by requiring business groups to disclose intercorporate ownership and banks to limit <b>connected</b> <b>lending,</b> by ensuring that bankruptcy law allows effective transfer of control, and by removing regulatory barriers to takeovers.

We commence with the introduction of some stylized facts as well as decisive determinants of credit euroization, including the exchange rate regime. Subsequently, the economic performance and soaring volume of non-performing loans during the crisis are found to be adversely related to previous FX credit growth. Furthermore, we discuss some challenges, which are faced by the monetary authority of a credit euroized economy. Next, we construct a distinctive index on currency mismatch adjusted for unhedged borrowers, which appears to be significantly associated with country risk premia. The final chapter is devoted to the recent materialization of vulnerabilities <b>connected</b> to FX <b>lending</b> in Hungary. The sensitivity of this economy to exchange rate movements is illustrated by strong correlation between CDS spread and relevant exchange rates.

40|$|Systemic banking crises often {{result from}} {{widespread}} imprudent lending, driven by strong incentives for risk taking and <b>connected</b> <b>lending.</b> This paper identifies a counterbalancing incentive for in-dividual banks to act prudently {{in the face}} of widespread risk taking among its competitors. In general, the value of a banking charter is enhanced by reduced competition. Hence a deliberate policy of pro-moting takeovers of weaker institutions by solvent banks has the effect of increasing the charter value of solvent banks, and grants the managers of better banks an incentive to pursue less profitable but safer lending strategies, thus breaking down the strategic externality of risk-taking strategies. A temporary phase of concentration in banking can thus reinforce stability and pre-emptive closures may in fact reduce the risk of a systemic banking crisis. We also address the case where banking authorities face pressure for an ex post bailout in a context where many banks are in trouble at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Essay one. For banks, good governances {{can reduce}} both the {{abilities}} and incentives of insiders to expropriate bank resources and promote bank efficiency, and {{are supposed to}} have real economic effect on their customers and firms in that country. This study examines how banking sector's ownership structure is related to the firm-level investment efficiency on a sample of 88, 764 firm-year observations across 36 developed and developing countries between 1995 and 2006. I find that, ceteris paribus, a country's banking sector with more cash flow rights by controlling owners improves firms' investment efficiency; whereas, a country's banking sector with larger divergence between cash flow rights and control rights by controlling owners reduces firms' investment efficiency. In addition, I find that the relation between a country's banking sector ownership structure and firms' investment efficiency is stronger for low growth firms, suggesting banks' stronger debt monitoring role on firms with free cash flow problem. Besides, banks have more influence on investment efficiency of firms, which rely on more external financing. Finally, the relation between banking sector's ownership structure and firms' investment efficiency is more pronounced in countries with stronger private monitoring for banks and better information environment of banks. On the whole, the results suggest that banking sector's ownership structure is an important instrument to govern banks' operation with regard to efficient lending and sound governances on firms' investment decision. Essay two. In this study, we examine whether and how incentives in bank lending, in emerging market like China, influence firms' investment behaviors, the key determinant of firms' productivity. First, being connected with bureaucrats provides firms with a comparative non-economic advantage of access to debt in China. Our empirical results show that loans granting to political connected firms is less sensitive to those firms' profitability, which is consistent with "rent-seeking" hypothesis. Second, political connection is a violated factor in debt markets and politically <b>connected</b> <b>lending</b> is accompanied by less monitoring posted by banks. Consequently, we find that firms with political tie invest less efficiently than firms without political tie when they can access to abnormal debt through political tie. Moreover, the negative relation between politically <b>connected</b> <b>lending</b> and firms' investment efficiency is stronger for SOE firms and low growth firms. Finally, we find that region development with regard to financial development and government quality improvement reduces politically connected lending's negative impact on firms' investment efficiency. In sum, soft lending, like politically <b>connected</b> <b>lending,</b> destroy economic growth because of misallocation of scary resources among firms and also because of less incentive to monitor firms' project selection. essay 1.

40|$|The {{proposal}} {{is to create}} a Foreclosure Prevention Program in Lowell, Massachusetts. The challenge facing many home owners with adjustable rate and sub prime mortgages is compounded by the current real estate market. Many home owners with these types of mortgages owe more than the property is currently worth. Lowell enjoys great ethnic diversity. This diversity introduces increased vulnerability for many people who are not familiar with or <b>connected</b> with traditional <b>lending</b> services. The homeowners at risk fall into three categories: 1. Those who have not yet purchased a home but are likely targets. 2. Those who have a mortgage in good standing but face increased riskas the interest rates adjust. 3. Those who have mortgages in default This program goal is to achieve the following outcomes: Those who have not yet purchase will be encouraged to attend an approved, pre-purchase home buyer training program. Refinancing options will be promoted to those with risky loans that are still in good standing.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four essays discussing network structures and institutions in financial markets. The first essay explores the determinants of the egocentric lending networks of stock listed companies in China. Egocentric lending networks are constructed using the public loan announcements of firms listed on China’s two stock exchanges combined with cross-ownership shares <b>connecting</b> the <b>lending</b> institutions. The study demonstrates that large, high-growth firms and firms with low leverage {{are more likely to}} have less-constrained lending networks. In contrast, highly indebted firms with poor performance tend to have more-constrained lending networks. The lending networks of firms with higher shares of state ownership, however, are not significantly related to the standard firm characteristics, suggesting that partly state-owned corporations in China still enjoy privileged access to bank financing, despite substantial reforms and growing competition in China’s banking sector. The second essay studies the relation between firm specific networks of creditors and corporate access to bank loans in China. The results show that firms with highly constrained lending networks have better access to credit than firms with less constrained networks. This effect is most pronounced in regions where formal financial institutions are weak. These findings suggest that highly constrained lending networks play a significant role in mitigating the problem of information asymmetry and adverse selection in China’s credit market. The third essay investigates the relationship between social beliefs and microfinance financial performance. We find that microfinance institutions in countries with higher levels of trust and more collectivist culture have lower operating and default costs and charge lower interest rates. These results provide the first large cross-country evidence that social beliefs are important determinants of microfinance performance. The fourth essay uses a novel data set covering the period 1997 to 2008 and employ Granger causality tests to estimate the finance-growth nexus of each of China's four distinct organizational bank forms. Our results show that state-owned commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives do not Granger-cause GDP growth and that state-owned commercial banks even have a negative effect on manufacturing growth. By contrast, policy banks and joint stock commercial banks promote economic growth...|$|R

As the summary It can be asserted that the most serious ethical problems which led to financial crises in TRNC were, <b>connected</b> <b>lending,</b> credits without adequate collaterals, favorism by the management, inadequate use of funds, dealing in non-financial activities, political interference, lack of accountability, illegal use of funds, lack of transparency, and risky investments with low returns...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the lessons}} {{financial}} history offers: Macroeconomic stability - low inflation and sound public finance - {{is important for}} creating the right incentives for banks and for facilitating the development of securities markets. High inflation and large fiscal deficits distort economic behavior in favor of short-term speculative projects conducive to sustainable economic development. Central bank independence may contribute to economic stability. One way to increase it is by lengthening the term of central bank governors. There must be incentives for bank owners to behave prudently - a requirement that they have capital commensurate with the risks they assume, for example. Unlimited liability and double liability limits may be less feasible now than in the past, but banks in developing countries that face higher risks should maintain higher capital ratios than banks in the more advanced OECD countries. Effective supervision is also essential. Banks run into solvency problems because they fail to diversify - often because of regulatory (especially geographic) restrictions, {{but also because of}} excessive <b>connected</b> <b>lending</b> or genuine mistakes. Regulators must ensure that banks diversify their risks, which means ending geographic or sectoral restrictions (including prohibitions against holding foreign assets) and restricting <b>connected</b> <b>lending.</b> Developing effective supervision (to ensure meaningful and effective compliance with prudential rules) is difficult and time-consuming but essential. The difficulty of supervising universal banks and financial conglomerates is an argument used against them in developing countries. But universal banks may generate efficiency gains as they overcome the problems of inadequate reliable public information on industrial and commercial companies. Holding small equity stakes and being involved in corporate governance may be productive. The risk of overlending to related firms is likely to be small when banks hold small stakes in industrial firms; it is high when firms control banks. Pension funds and other institutional investors have grown in importance in many countries over the past thirty years or so, because of longer life spans and longer retirement. These funds started as labor market institutions and personnel management tools, but have become important financial intermediaries. Pension funds offer developing countries an alternative both for restructuring their public finances and for promoting their capital markets. Pension funds can play the role that thrift deposit institutions - such as savings banks, credit cooperatives, and building societies - played in developed countries in the nineteenth century. But thrift institutions can still contribute to financial and economic development by promoting thrift and facilitating credit rural areas and among low-income groups. They will contribute more if they involve a three tier structure that combines the benefits of local involvement and monitoring with centralized auditing and supervision.

40|$|Compared {{with the}} case of central bank {{independence}}, independence for financial sector supervisors remains more controversial. This paper analyzes changes in independence and accountability arrangements {{in a set of}} 32 countries that overhauled their legal and/or institutional frameworks for supervision in recent years. Despite improvements, there is strong evidence that the endorsement of independence remains half-hearted, which shows itself through either overcompensation on the accountability side, or resort to political control mechanisms. The latter could potentially undermine the agency''s credibility. The results indicate that policymakers still need to be persuaded of the long-term benefits of independence for financial sector soundness, and of the potential for a virtuous interaction between independence and accountability, if the arrangements are well-designed.

40|$|This paper assesses how {{various types}} of {{financial}} risk such as credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk affect banking stability in the ten countries that joined the European Union most recently, and eight neighboring countries. It also examines how the quality of supervisory standards may have mitigated the vulnerabilities arising from these risk factors. Using panel data, the study finds substantial variation in the impacts of financial risks, the macroeconomic environment, and supervisory standards on banks'' risk profile across different country clusters. Credit quality is of general concern especially in circumstances where credit growth is accelerating.

40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{financial soundness}} indicators (FSIs) and stress-testing methodologies {{to provide a}} broad assessment of the soundness of Venezuela''s banking sector, based on a diagnosis of its structural and transient shortcomings. While the Venezuelan banking sector appears sound under current favorable economic conditions, it remains significantly vulnerable to cyclical downturns-which have been severe in the past. Banks are particularly exposed to interest rate and credit risks. This suggests that the strong FSIs may be partly {{the result of a}} conjunctural credit boom in the context of capital controls and very low real interest rates.
