40|$|The {{availability}} of climatological chlorophyll-a concentration data {{products from the}} SeaWiFS mission spanning the eight-year mission period allowed {{the creation of a}} <b>climatological</b> <b>anomaly</b> analysis function in Giovanni, the GES DISC Interactive Online Visualization and ANalysis Infrastructure. This study utilizes the Giovanni anomaly analysis function to examine mesoscale anomalies in the North Atlantic Ocean during the springtime North Atlantic Bloom. This examination indicates that areas exhibiting positive anomalies and areas exhibiting negative anomalies are coherent over significant spatial scales, with relatively abrupt boundaries between areas with positive and negative anomalies. Year-to-year variability in anomaly "intensity" can be caused by either variability in the temporal occurrence of the bloom peak or by variability in the peak chlorophyll concentration in a particular area. The study will also discuss the feasibility of combining chlorophyll anomaly analysis with other data types...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{integrated}} ocean response to tropical cyclones (TCs) in the South Pacific convergence zone through a complete ocean heat budget. The TC impact analysis {{is based on}} the comparison between two long-term (1979 - 2003) oceanic simulations forced by a mesoscale atmospheric model solution in which extreme winds associated with cyclones are either maintained or filtered. The simulations provide a statistically robust experiment that fills a gap in the current modeling literature between coarse-resolution and short-term studies. The authors results show a significant thermal response of the ocean to at least 500 -m depth, driven by competing mixing and upwelling mechanisms. As suggested in previous studies, vertical mixing largely explains surface cooling induced by TCs. However, TC-induced upwelling of deeper waters plays an unexpected role as it partly balances the warming of subsurface waters induced by vertical mixing. Below 100 m, vertical advection results in cooling that persists long after the storm passes and has a signature in the ocean climatology. The heat lost through TC-induced vertical advection is exported outside the cyclogenesis area with strong interannual variability. In addition, 60 % of the heat input below the surface during the cyclone season is released back to the oceanic mixed layer through winter entrainment and then to the atmosphere. Therefore, seasonal modulation reduces the mean surface heat flux due to TCs to about 3 X 10 (- 3) PW in this region exposed to 10 %- 15 % of the world's cyclones. The resulting <b>climatological</b> <b>anomaly</b> is a warming of about 0. 1 degrees C in the subsurface layer and cooling below the thermoclinc (less than 0. 1 degrees C) ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{low-level}} jet of the southern Great Plains (the GPLLJ) of the U. S. is primarily a nocturnal phenomenon that virtually vanishes during the daylight hours, {{it is one of the}} most persistent and stable climatological features of the low-level continental flow during the warm-season months, May through August. We have used significant-level data to validate the skill of the GEOS- 1 Data Assimilation System (DAS) in realistically detecting this jet and inferring its structure and evolution. We have then carried out a 15 -year reanalysis with the GEOS- 1 DAS to determine its climatology and mean diurnal cycle and to study its interannual variability. Interannual anomalies of the meridional flow associated with the GPLLJ are much smaller than the mean diurnal fluctuations, than random intraseasonal anomalies, and than the mean wind itself. There are three maxima of low-level meridional flow variance over the Great Plains and the Gulf of Mexico: a 1. 2 m 2 s- 2 peak over the southeast Texas, to the east and south of the mean velocity peak, a 1. 0 m 2 s- 2 peak over the western Gulf of Mexico, and a. 8 m 2 s- 2 peak over the upper Great Plains (UGP), near the Nebraska/South Dakota border. Each of the three variance maxima corresponds to a spatially coherent, jet-like pattern of low-level flow interannual variability. There are also three dominant modes of interannual variability corresponding to the three variance maxima, but not in a simple one-to-one relationship. Cross-sectional profiles of mean southerly wind over Texas remain relatively stable and recognizable from year to year with only its eastward flank showing significant variability. This variability, however, exhibits a distinct, biennial oscillation during the first six to seven years of the reanalysis period and only then. This intermittent biennial oscillation (IBO, one of the three modes discussed in the previous paragraph) in the lowlevel flow is restricted to the region surrounding eastern Texas and is also evident in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set from about 1978 to 1985 or 1986 and again from 1995 to 2000. It is evident as well in surface pressure in both the GEOS- 1 and NCEP/NCAR sets. The interannual anomalies do not necessarily persist uniformly throughout an entire season, but can fluctuate from one part of the season to the next. To estimate the characteristic sub-seasonal time scales for coherence of these fluctuations, we have taken the weekly anomaly of low-level wind at each point of the domain from the climatological average for that given point and that given week of the season and computed the covariance of its fluctuations over all weeks and over all years with the weekly <b>climatological</b> <b>anomaly</b> of the meridional wind at each of the three reference points discussed above. The typical duration of a coherent interannual anomaly within a given warm season increases with decreasing latitude from 2 to 3 weeks over the UGP, to 6 to 7 weeks over eastern Texas. Coherence over the western Gulf of Mexico is intermediate between the two with a typical duration of 4 to 5 weeks. There appears to be evidence that the interannual anomalies over Texas the Gulf propagate to the UGP after a week and those over the Gulf propagate there after 2 to 3 weeks. There also appears to be some reverse propagation of interannual anomalies over the UGP to Texas and to the Gulf after a period of about one week. The interannual anomalies in southerly flow over eastern Texas seem to correlate well with interannual anomalies of surface temperature and (negative) ground wetness and over western Texas...|$|E

While the background environment supporting this event was generally consistent with that corresponding to a severe thunderstorm and tornado event in the midlatitudes, particular factors supporting this event in central Montana were seasonally anomalous. In support of future pattern recognition and forecasting of such an event—for which large potential impact could exist—the synoptic and mesoscale environment evolution, and the radar evolution associated with this event, are investigated.

40|$|The Amazon {{region is}} of {{particular}} interest because it represents a large source of heat in the tropics and has been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} extratropical circulation and it is Earth's largest and most intense land-based convective center. During the Southern Hemisphere summer when convection is best developed, the Amazon basin is one of the wettest regions on Earth. Amazonia is of course not isolated from the rest of the world, and a global perspective is needed to understand the nature and causes of <b>climatological</b> <b>anomalies</b> in Amazonia and how they feed back to influence the global climate system. The Amazon River system is the single, largest source of fresh- water on Earth. The flow regime of this river system is relatively uninpacted by humans (Vorósrnarty et al. 1997 a, b) and is subject to interannual variability in tropical precipitation that ultimately is translated into large variations in downstream hydrographs (Marengo et al. 1998 a, Vórósmarty et al. 1996, Richey et al. 1989 a, h). The recycling of local evaporation and precipitation by the forest accounts for a sizable portion of the regional water budget (Nobre et al. 1991, Eltahir 1996), and as large areas of the basin are subject to active deforestation there is grave conem about how such land surface disruptions mar affect the water cycle in the tropics (see reviews in lean et al. 1996).

40|$|Using {{the water}} isotope- and vapor source {{distribution}} (VSD) tracer-enabled Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE-R, we examine changing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) -like expressions in the hydrological cycle in {{a suite of}} model experiments. We apply strong surface temperature anomalies associated with composite observed El Nino and La Nina events as surface boundary conditions to preindustrial and mid-Holocene model experiments in order to investigate ENSO-like expressions in the hydrological cycle under varying boundary conditions. We find distinct simulated hydrological anomalies associated with El Nino-like ("ENSOWARM") and La Nina-like ("ENSOCOOL") conditions, and the region-specific VSD tracers show hydrological differences across the Pacific basin between El Nino-like and La Nina-like events. The application of ENSOCOOL forcings does not produce <b>climatological</b> <b>anomalies</b> that represent the equal but opposite impacts of the ENSOWARM experiment, as the isotopic anomalies associated with ENSOWARM conditions are generally stronger than with ENSOCOOL and the spatial patterns of change distinct. Also, when the same ENSO-like surface temperature anomalies are imposed on the mid-Holocene, the hydrological response is muted, relative to the preindustrial. Mid-Holocene changes in moisture sources to the analyzed regions across the Pacific reveal potentially complex relationships between ENSO-like conditions and boundary conditions. Given the complex impacts of ENSO-like conditions on {{various aspects of the}} hydrological cycle, we suggest that proxy record insights into paleo-ENSO variability {{are most likely to be}} robust when synthesized from a network of many spatially diverse archives, which can account for the potential nonstationarity of ENSO teleconnections under different boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|Protecting key {{hotspots}} {{of marine}} biodiversity {{is essential to}} maintain ecosystem services at large spatial scales. Protected areas serve not only as sources of propagules colonizing other habitats, but also as receptors, thus acting as protected nurseries. To quantify the geographical extent and the temporal persistence of ecological benefits resulting from protection, we investigate larval connectivity within a remote archipelago, characterized by a strong spatial gradient of human impact from pristine to heavily exploited: the Northern Line Islands (NLIs), including part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (PRI-MNM). Larvae are described as passive Lagrangian particles transported by oceanic currents obtained from a oceanographic reanalysis. We compare different simulation schemes and compute connectivity measures (larval exchange probabilities and minimum/average larval dispersal distances from target islands). To explore the role of PRI-MNM in protecting marine organisms with pelagic larval stages, we drive millions of individual-based simulations for various Pelagic Larval Durations (PLDs), in all release seasons, and over a two-decades time horizon (1991 - 2010). We find that connectivity in the NLIs is spatially asymmetric and displays significant intra- and inter-annual variations. The islands belonging to PRI-MNM act more as sinks than sources of larvae, and connectivity is higher during the winter-spring period. In multi-annual analyses, yearly averaged southward connectivity significantly and negatively correlates with <b>climatological</b> <b>anomalies</b> (El Niño). This points out a possible system fragility and susceptibility to global warming. Quantitative assessments of large-scale, long-term marine connectivity patterns help understand region-specific, ecologically relevant interactions between islands. This is fundamental for devising scientifically-based protection strategies, which must be space- and time-varying {{to cope with the}} challenges posed by the concurrent pressures of human exploitation and global climate change...|$|R
40|$|Two globally-complete, observation-only {{precipitation}} datasets {{have recently}} been developed for the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). Both depend heavily {{on a variety of}} satellite input, as well as gauge data over land. The first, Version 2 x 79, provides monthly estimates on a 2. 5 deg x 2. 5 deg lat/long grid for the period 1979 through late 1999 (by the time of the conference). The second, the One-Degree Daily (1 DD), provides daily estimates on a 1 deg x 1 deg grid for the period 1997 through late 1999 (by the time of the conference). Both are in beta test preparatory to release as official GPCP products. These datasets provide a unique perspective on the hydrological effects of the various atmospheric flow anomalies that have been identified by meteorologists. In this paper we discuss the regional precipitation effects that result from persistent extratropical flow anomalies. We will focus on the Pacific-North America (PNA) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) patterns. Each characteristically becomes established on synoptic time scales, but then persists for periods that can exceed a month. The onset phase of each appears to have systematic mobile features, while the mature phase tend to be more stationary. Accordingly, composites of monthly data for outstanding positive and negative events (separately) contained in the 20 -year record reveal the climatological structure of the precipitation during the mature phase. The <b>climatological</b> <b>anomalies</b> of the positive, negative, and (positive-negative) composites show the expected storm-track-related shifts in precipitation, and provide the advantage of putting the known precipitation effects over land {{in the context of the}} total pattern over land and ocean. As well, this global perspective points out some unexpected areas of correlation. Day-by-day composites of daily data anchored to the onset date demonstrate the systematic features during the onset. Although the 1 DD has a fairly short record, some preliminary results are shown and compared to previous work with numerical weather prediction models...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} exists for wetter-than-modern continental conditions in North America during the pre-Quaternary warm climate intervals. This is in apparent {{conflict with the}} robust global prediction for future climate change of a northward expansion of the subtropical dry zones that should drive aridification of many semiarid regions. Indeed, areas of expected future aridification include much of western North America, where extensive paleoenvironmental records are documented to have been much wetter {{before the onset of}} Quaternary ice ages. It has also been proposed that climates previous to the Quaternary may have been characterized as being in a state with warmer-than-modern eastern equatorial sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Because equatorial Pacific SSTs exert strong controls on midlatitude atmospheric circulation and the global hydrologic cycle, the teleconnected response from this permanent El Niño-like mean state has been proposed as a useful analogue model, or "blueprint", for understanding global <b>climatological</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the past. The present study quantitatively explores the implications of this blueprint for past climates with a specific focus on the Miocene and Pliocene, using a global climate model (CAM 3. 0) and a nested high-resolution climate model (RegCM 3) to study the hydrologic impacts on global and North American climate of a change in mean SSTs resembling that which occurs during modern El Niño events. We find that the global circulation response to a permanent El Niño resembles a large, long El Niño event. This state also exhibits equatorial super-rotation, which would represent a fundamental change to the tropical circulations. We also find a southward shift in winter storm tracks in the Pacific and Atlantic, which affects precipitation and temperature over the mid-latitudes. In addition, summertime precipitation increases over the majority of the continental United States. These increases in precipitation are controlled by shifts in the subtropical jet and secondary atmospheric feedbacks. Based on these results and the data proxy comparison, we conclude that a permanent El Niño like state is one potential explanation of wetter-than-modern conditions observed in paleoclimate-proxy records, particularly over the western United States...|$|R

Here we focus on identifying, from data, the geographical regions which have similar atmospheric properties. We study surface air temperature (SAT) time series with monthly resolution, recorded at a regular grid covering the Earth surface. We consider two datasets: NCEP CDAS 1 and ERA Interim reanalysis. We show that two surprisingly simple measures are able to extract meaningful information: i) {{the distance between the}} lagged SAT and the incoming solar radiation and ii) the Shannon entropy of SAT and SAT anomalies. The distance uncovers well-defined spatial patterns formed by regions with similar SAT response to solar forcing while the entropy uncovers regions with similar degree of SAT unpredictability. The entropy analysis also allows identifying regions in which SAT has extreme values. Importantly, we uncover differences between the two datasets which are due to the presence of extreme values in one dataset but not in the other. Our results indicate that the distance and entropy measures can be valuable tools for the study of other <b>climatological</b> variables, for <b>anomaly</b> detection and for performing model inter-comparisons.

After the collection of all pluviometric stations from the Southern Region, 600 stations which had historic series over 30 years were selected. Afterwards the data consistency analyses which comprehend the verification of doubtful data and the filling of the gaps, fundamental to adjust and complete the missing values.

We begin with a general overview, discussing wind-stress forcing fields and their <b>anomalies,</b> <b>climatological</b> distributions of stratification, mixed-layer depths, altimetric sea-level distributions, and seasonal circulation patterns (Section 2). The three main monsoon circulation sections deal with the equatorial regime (Section 3), the Somali Current and western Arabian Sea (Section 4), and the Bay of Bengal, seasonally reversing monsoon currents south of India and Sri Lanka, and the eastern and central Arabian Sea (Section 5). For the equatorial regime, we discuss equatorial jets and undercurrents, their interactions with the eastern and western boundaries, and intraseasonal and vertically propagating signals. In the Somali Current section, we describe the ocean’s responses to the summer and winter monsoon winds, and outline the modelling efforts that {{have been carried out}} to understand them.

The thermospheric total mass density, as derived from CHAMP satellite data, shows a distinct enhancement {{in the vicinity of the}} cusp, the so-called density <b>anomaly.</b> In a <b>climatological</b> analysis this <b>anomaly</b> is identified as a continuous phenomenon of both hemispheres which depends mainly on background density, coupling efficiency between Earth Magnetic Field and Interplanetary Magnetic Field, and solar activity. Air-upwelling from deeper atmospheric layers (neutral fountain effect), as excited by Joule heating, is considered to be the cause of the density anomaly. Its activating mechanisms have been investigated by considering a combined CHAMP-EISCAT campaign, a model study on soft particle precipitation, and an analysis of periodic density anomaly variations and their controlling parameters. According to the results of this study the following mechanism is suggested to cause a cusp-related density anomaly: The energy input by the solar wind provides the power for Joule heating of preferably neutral molecules. Soft particle precipitation in the cusp simultaneously enhances the altitude of maximal Pedersen conductivity, thus lifting up the heated layer in the cusp. Differential expansion of heavier particles changes the local air composition, thus contributing to the density anomaly. The mechanism is more pronounced during high solar activity phases, since a larger background density causes larger density anomaly amplitudes. The phenomenon can affect the global thermospheric density distribution...|$|R

In addition, we find that the reef ecosystems with the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations; Jarvis, Howland, Baker, Palmyra and Kingman are each uninhabited and are characterized by high hard coral cover and large numbers of predatory fishes. Finally, we find that scaling environmental data to the spatial footprint of individual islands and atolls is more likely to capture local environmental forcings, as chlorophyll-a concentrations decreased at relatively short distances (> 7 km) from 85 % of our study locations. These metrics will help identify reef ecosystems most exposed to environmental stress as well as systems that may be more resistant or resilient to future climate change...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying climatological {{precipitation}} {{and soil}} moisture {{as well as}} interannual variability and trends requires extensive observation. This work focuses on the analysis of available precipitation and soil moisture data {{and the development of}} new ways to estimate these quantities. Precipitation and soil moisture characteristics are highly dependent on the spatial and temporal scales. We begin at the point scale, examining hourly precipitation and soil moisture at individual gauges. First, we focus on the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW), a 150 km² area in southern Arizona. The watershed has been measuring rainfall since 1956 with a very high density network of approximately 0. 6 gauges per km². Additionally, there are 19 soil moisture probes at 5 cm depth with data starting in 2002. In order to extend the measurement period, we have developed a water balance model which estimates monsoon season (Jul-Sep) soil moisture using only precipitation for input, and calibrated so that the modeled soil moisture fits best with the soil moisture measured by each of the 19 probes from 2002 - 2012. This observationally constrained soil moisture is highly correlated with the collocated probes (R= 0. 88), and extends the measurement period from 10 to 56 years and the number of gauges from 19 to 88. Then, we focus on the spatiotemporal variability within the watershed and the ability to estimate area averaged quantities. Spatially averaged precipitation and observationally constrained soil moisture from the 88 gauges is then used to evaluate various gridded datasets. We find that gauge-based precipitation products perform best followed by reanalyses and then satellite-based products. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) models perform the worst and overestimate cold season precipitation while offsetting the monsoon peak precipitation forward or backward by a month. Satellite-based soil moisture is the best followed by land data assimilation systems and reanalyses. We show that while WGEW is small compared to the grid size of many of the evaluated products, unlike scaling from point to area, the effect of scaling from smaller to larger area is small. Finally, we focus on global precipitation. Global monthly gauge based precipitation data has become widely available in recent years and is necessary for analyzing the <b>climatological</b> and <b>anomaly</b> precipitation fields as well as for calibrating and evaluating other gridded products such as satellite-based and modeled precipitation. However, frequency and intensity of precipitation are also important in the partitioning of water and energy fluxes. Therefore, because daily and sub-daily observed precipitation is limited to recent years, the number of raining days per month (N) is needed. We show that the only currently available long-term N product, developed by the Climate Research Unit (CRU), is deficient in certain areas, particularly where CRU gauge data is sparse. We then develop a new global 110 -year N product, which shows significant improvement over CRU using three regional daily precipitation products with far more gauges than are used in CRU...|$|R
