For my part, I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor.

5|$|In 1981, {{around the}} time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were {{questioning}} the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less <b>concerned,</b> <b>and</b> so was more of an outsider.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a classification of crosscutting concerns in sorts based on the analysis of various refactoring efforts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to determine early childhood pre-service teachers' <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions. One hundred early childhood pre-service teachers who were enrolled at Pamukkale University, Turkey, answered two open-ended questions by e-mail. In addition, six of these participants were interviewed for developing {{a deeper understanding of}} their <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions. Five main areas of <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions were identified as: (1) children, (2) parents, (3) school principals and colleagues, (4) environmental conditions, (5) self-orientation. This paper draws attention to the underlying reasons given by pre-service teachers about their <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> elicits their ways of overcoming these concerns, in order to identify pre-service teachers' needs, in becoming effective teachers, and to integrate possible areas of <b>concern</b> in management <b>and</b> development of teacher education...|$|R

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all <b>concerned,</b> <b>and</b> ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E

During the case, in talking with the latest victim's wife, Olivia realizes that she is truly in love with Peter. After {{the conclusion of the}} case, she admits to Nina that she will let the memory alterations continue, even if this means she will forget the times she spent with Nina during her childhood.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Little {{is known}} about how {{environmental}} concern in young adulthood may shape childbearing attitudes and intentions. Here, we {{examine the relationship between}} individual environmental <b>concern,</b> fertility intentions, <b>and</b> attitudes toward reproduction in a sample of Canadian university students, N = 139. General envi-ronmental <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> pollution-related health <b>concerns</b> both predicted a less positive attitude toward having children. Further, attitude toward having children mediated the negative relationship between pollution-related health <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> personal fertility intentions.

5|$|After {{removing}} her corpse {{from the}} canvas sack and beginning the post mortem examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson {{he was certain}} that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night <b>concerned,</b> <b>and</b> was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E
5|$|De Gray was postulated, or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which {{presented}} Innocent {{with two}} {{candidates for the}} office. In an effort to reach a compromise, the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206; Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy. The monks then elected Stephen Langton, with Innocent's approval. John did not accept Langton's candidacy however, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over {{the rights of the}} king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop. John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks. Innocent placed an interdict on England in 1207, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. Innocent went on to excommunicate John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England; by 1209 de Gray and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, were the only English bishops not in exile or dead. But it was not until 1213, when Innocent began to support John's deposition, that the king became <b>concerned</b> <b>and</b> reached a settlement with the papacy.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, modules whose {{implementation}} is {{tangled with}} crosscutting concerns {{are hard to}} reuse in different contexts. Crosscutting impedes reuse of components. The lack of interfaces between crosscutting <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> other modules {{makes it hard to}} represent and reason about the overall architecture of a system. As the concern is not modularized, the interactions between the <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> the top-level components of the system are hard to represent explicitly. Hence, these concerns become hard to reason about because the dependencies between crosscutting <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> components are not specified.|$|R

5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual <b>concerned</b> <b>and</b> humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{first home}} in exile was Wartegg Castle in Rorschach, Switzerland, a {{property}} {{owned by the}} Bourbon-Parmas. However, the Swiss authorities, worried about the implication of the Habsburgs living near the Austrian border, compelled them {{to move to the}} western part of the country. The next month, therefore, found them moving to Villa Prangins, near Lake Geneva, where they resumed a quiet family life. This abruptly ended in March 1920 when, after a period of instability in Hungary, Miklós Horthy was elected regent. Charles was still technically King (as Charles IV) but Horthy sent an emissary to Prangins advising him not to go to Hungary until the situation had calmed. After the Trianon Treaty Horthy's ambition soon grew. Charles became <b>concerned</b> <b>and</b> requested the help of Colonel Strutt to get him into Hungary. Charles twice attempted to regain control, once in March 1921 and again in October 1921. Both attempts failed, despite Zita's staunch support (she insisted on travelling with him on the final dramatic train journey to Budapest).|$|E
