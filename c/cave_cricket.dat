25|$|A 2008 {{study of}} white-nose syndrome, a fungal {{infection}} causing high mortality rates in bats, {{determined that the}} fungus found on the muzzles, wings, and ears of infected bats {{is a member of}} the Geomyces genus. Later, the conidial morphology of this isolate was shown to be morphologically distinct from the conidia of other characterized members of the genus, despite the phylogenetic similarity. Finally, in spring 2009 the source of the infection was identified as a new species, Geomyces destructans. It is not yet certain if the fungus is a causative agent in the bat deaths, or merely an opportunistic pathogen. It is known however that Geomyces species are found in caves and bat hibernacula, and have been isolated from the <b>cave</b> <b>cricket</b> Troglophilus neglectus.|$|E

Observational and experimental data demonstrate that a primary food source of this beetle is the eggs of <b>cave</b> <b>crickets</b> (Ceuthophilus spp.). The beetles locate eggs by selective digging into substrata where <b>cave</b> <b>crickets</b> have oviposited.

40|$|In {{this note}} we report {{a new series}} of data on Dolichopodainae and Troglophilinae <b>cave</b> <b>crickets</b> of Turkey, after an {{extensive}} survey conducted between the years 2006 and 2010 in the main Anatolian cave systems. These new data, including the identifications of some undescribed taxa, are discussed in the framework of climate regions, vegetation and karst distribution of Turkey, contributing to the study of diversity and geographical distribution of Rhaphidophoridae <b>cave</b> <b>crickets</b> from Turkey...|$|R

50|$|The cave {{contains}} a large bat roost and numerous Jamaican <b>cave</b> <b>crickets</b> (Uvaroviella cavicola). Also present are the invasive Periplaneta americana (cockroach) in small numbers, Gaucelmus cavernicola (spider), and Neoditomyia farri (fly).|$|R
50|$|Their {{distinctive}} {{limbs and}} antennae serve a double purpose. Typically {{living in a}} lightless environment, or active at night, they rely heavily on their sense of touch, which is limited by reach. While they {{have been known to}} take up residence in the basements of buildings, many <b>cave</b> <b>crickets</b> live out their entire lives deep inside actual caves. In those habitats, they sometimes face long spans of time with insufficient access to nutrients. Given their limited vision, <b>cave</b> <b>crickets</b> will often jump towards any perceived threat in an attempt to frighten it away. Although they look intimidating, they are completely harmless.|$|R
50|$|Troglophiles {{can live}} part {{or all of}} their lives in caves, but can also {{complete}} a life cycle in appropriate environments on the surface. Examples include <b>cave</b> <b>crickets,</b> bats, millipedes, pseudoscorpions and spiders.|$|R

40|$|Preliminary field {{observations}} {{suggested a}} different pattern in locomotor activity between natural and artificial populations of Dolichopoda <b>cave</b> <b>crickets.</b> To test and to quantify these differences {{we used a}} chronobiological approach and an automatic electronic device has been built for the continuous monitoring of the general locomotor activity of individual <b>cave</b> <b>crickets.</b> We modified a commercial microwave-based radar device and connected it to the computer. Crickets samples from two artificial caves and two natural caves, were individually monitored throughout 15 days in constant darkness and temperature. Time series were analysed by a Discrete Fourier Transform and chi-square periodogram. Data showed a variability of the circadian period significantly different in {{the two types of}} populations. Moreover, the spectral analysis and periodogram revealed the presence of ultradian rhythmicity...|$|R
