The design of a propeller is broad, flattened blade and squared-off tips because the aerodynamic favors a high drag that is useful for slowing an airboat. A simple method of predicting the performance of a propeller is the use of Blade Element Theory. In this method the propeller is divided into a number of independent sections along the length. At each section a force balance is applied involving 2 D section lift and drag with the thrust and torque produced by the section. At the same time a balance of axial and angular momentum is applied. This produces a set of nonlinear equations that can be solved by iteration for each blade section. The resulting values of section thrust and torque can be summed to predict the overall performance of the propeller...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> {{are gaining}} {{recognition}} in civil engineering applications {{as a viable}} alternative to traditional materials. Their migration from customary automotive, marine, aerospace and military industries into civil engineering has continued to gain momentum over the last three decades as new civil engineering applications develop. The use of <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> in civil engineering has now evolved from non-structural applications, such as handrails and cladding, into primary structural applications such as building frames, bridge decks and concrete reinforcement. However, there are issues which are slowing the use of <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> into civil engineering. Issues include high costs, difficulties in realising potential benefits, general lack of civil engineers' familiarity with the material and relatively little standardisation in the composites industry. For composites to truly offer {{a viable alternative to}} traditional construction materials in the civil engineering marketplace, it is essential that these issues be addressed. It is proposed that this situation could be improved by demonstrating that potential benefits offered by composites can be achieved with familiar civil engineering forms. These forms must be well suited to <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> and be able to produce safe and predictable civil engineering structures with existing structural engineering methods. Of the numerous structural forms currently being investigated for civil engineering applications, the truss form appears particularly well suited to <b>fibre</b> <b>composites.</b> The truss is a familiar structural engineering form which possesses certain characteristics that make it well suited to <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials.</b> In this research a novel monocoque <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> truss concept was developed into a working structure and investigated using analytical and experimental methods. To the best of the author's knowledge the research presented in this thesis represents the first doctoral research into a structure of this type. This thesis therefore presents the details of the development of the monocoque <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> (MFC) truss concept into a working structure. The developed MFC truss was used as the basis for a detailed investigation of the structural behaviour of the MFC truss elements and the truss as a whole. The static structural behaviour of the principal MFC truss elements (tension members, compression members and joints) was investigated experimentally and analytically. Physical testing required the design and fabrication of a number of novel test rigs. Well established engineering principles were used along with complex finite element models to predict the behaviour of the tested truss elements and trusses. Results of the theoretical analysis were compared with experimental results to determine how accurately their static structural behaviour could be predicted. It was found that the static structural behaviour of all three principal truss elements could be accurately predicted with existing engineering methods and finite element analysis. The knowledge gained from the investigation of the principal truss elements was then used in an investigation of the structural behaviour of the MFC truss. Three full-scale MFC trusses were fabricated in the form of conventional Pratt, Howe and Warren trusses and tested to destruction. The investigation included detailed finite element modelling of the full-scale trusses and the results were compared to the full-scale test results. Results of the investigation demonstrated that the familiar Pratt, Howe and Warren truss forms could be successfully manufactured with locally available <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> and existing manufacturing technology. The static structural behaviour of these <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> truss forms was accurately predicted with well established engineering principles and finite element analysis. A successful marriage between <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> and a civil engineering structure has been achieved. Monocoque <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> trusses have been developed in the familiar Pratt, Howe and Warren truss forms. These structures possess characteristics that make them well suited to applications as primary load bearing structures...|$|R
40|$|The highly {{competitive}} {{nature of the}} transportation industry has produced significant demand for increased equipment efficiency. This has been manifested in attempts to increase carrying capacity whilst lowering running costs. While these factors remain {{at the forefront of}} trailer design, the dependence on steel as the primary material has limited {{the extent to which these}} goals are realised. The advantages associated with the use of <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> in automotive applications have been well documented, demonstrating that the substitution of steel with <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> greatly increases the scope for tare mass reduction. However, to fully utilise the advantages produced through the use of <b>fibre</b> <b>composites,</b> it is necessary to formulate a design philosophy that incorporates the selection of materials and the definition of acceptable performance of both the material and the trailer. This dissertation addresses this broad subject. Within this greater context, this study addresses the incorporation of <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> into semi-trailers, with the significant issues being divided into two areas: - The development of a design philosophy, intended specifically to address the application of <b>fibre</b> <b>composites</b> to semi-trailers. - The design, analysis and experimental validation of a new type of <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> trailer chassis, utilising the aforementioned design philosophy. This PhD project is a foundational study on the suitability of <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> in the heavy transportation industry, primarily focusing on a practical assessment of the potential for tare mass reduction. The work presented in this dissertation is seen to provide a basis for <b>fibre</b> <b>composite</b> trailer design, in addition to a foundation upon which further investigation into this field can be made. The major outcomes of this project include, amongst others: - The definition of significant load cases and trailer classifications · The development of a design philosophy suited specifically to FRP semi-trailers - The establishment of selection criteria which identifies appropriate FRP materials for use in this application - The development of a new type of FRP chassis for a flatbed semi-trailer - Validation of the design philosophy through experimental testing - Affirmation of the potential of FRPs in application to flatbed semi-trailer...|$|R

40|$|In {{light weight}} {{structures}} buildt from <b>composite</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>materials,</b> unwanted vibrations due to low structural damping yield a common source of limitations for different applications. For acoustic applications e. g. in aircrafts, noise limits {{have to be}} fulfilled. To shorten cycle times in assembly tasks of highly accelerated light weight robot structures, a reduction of these vibrations can also be essential. This {{can be achieved by}} increasing the structural damping significantly due to suitable control algorithms, which use piezoceramic patches as structural actuators and sensors. The rigid subcomponents of a structure under consideration can be augmented with flat actuator devices. To model such a plant as input for establishing control algorithms, a fully coupled system can be sol-ved in suitable finite element (FE) software systems, but there are severe drawbacks if the optimi-zation of the actuator locations for enhanced control performance is neccessary. This paper discusses a so-called modal correction method to rapidly fasten the model creation if actuator locations are changed. The underlying method needs a modal decomposition of the passive structure and corrects modal stiffness and mass contributions in combination with the electromechanical coupling of the devices. This is done outside the original FE environment in a matrix orientated software package by using a new electromechanical triangle element, which is applied at the current locations of the piezoceramic devices on exported parts of the structural element mesh. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands on}} industrial robots regarding speed and precision {{lead to the}} investigation of parallel mechanisms, because they are stiffer than serial robotic structures and the obtainable accelerations are higher, {{due to the fact}} that the weighty drives are fixed to the reference frame. To further enhance the precision or to shorten the cycle time, unwanted vibrations of the end effector can be reduced by adaptronic devices. These concepts will be most useful in directions orthogonal to the actuation authority of the electric drives. The kinematical and dynamical equations of typical parallel mechanisms are highly non-linear. The position-dependent coefficients of the underlying state space models for the structural vibrations lead to some difficulty in the design of appropriate control strategies. In this paper a five revolute joint parallel test platform with two integrated stack actuators will be presented. After a short summary of the physical realization, an overview of the modeling approach will also be given. The system identification reveals two position dependent eigenfrequencies of approximately 10 and 230 hertz. Finally the promising results of a simulation study, which is based on an interpolating state space control law, will be compared with an implemented control strategy, realized on a dSPACE platform. Both approaches show, that the structural damping of parallel systems with <b>composite</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>materials</b> can be significantly increase...|$|R

As a result, it was found that by drying the kenaf fibres before laminating, the mechanical properties of laminate were improved, and by compressing the laminate after the vacuum infusion process, the excess absorbed resin from the laminate was removed and the mechanical properties of laminate were improved.
