50|$|LIMS and LIS {{are very}} similar in {{operation}} and design. The primary difference between them is that LIMS are normally sold to the chemical and environmental analysis market while LIS are sold to the clinical and healthcare market, so the terminology will vary, {{but a number of}} vendors sell to both markets. CDS both control and collect data from <b>chromatographs,</b> which include not only gas and liquid <b>chromatographs,</b> but also ion <b>chromatographs</b> and gel permeation <b>chromatographs.</b> SDMS are more general systems that allow the tracking of all information associated with a sample, not just the raw data, but all reports and their revisions.|$|R

25|$|Borax as {{a source}} of borate has been used to take {{advantage}} of the co-complexing ability of borate with other agents in water to form complex ions with various substances. Borate and a suitable polymer bed are used to <b>chromatograph</b> non-glycosylated hemoglobin differentially from glycosylated hemoglobin (chiefly HbA1c), which is an indicator of long term hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|A common {{combination}} is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a gas <b>chromatograph</b> {{is used to}} separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the ion source, a metallic filament to which voltage is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.|$|E

25|$|Biofuels are {{different}} from fossil fuels in regard to greenhouse gases but are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to air pollution. Burning produces airborne carbon particulates, carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides. The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution. Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas <b>chromatograph</b> studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.|$|E
25|$|In a {{hydrogen}} breath test, {{the most accurate}} lactose intolerance test, after an overnight fast, 25 grams of lactose (in a solution with water) are swallowed. If the lactose cannot be digested, enteric bacteria metabolize it and produce hydrogen, which, along with methane, if produced, can be detected on the patient's breath by a clinical gas <b>chromatograph</b> or compact solid-state detector. The test takes about 2.5 hours to complete. If the hydrogen levels in the patient's breath are high, they may have lactose intolerance. This test is not usually done on babies and very young children, because it can cause severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Antique or badly {{preserved}} perfumes undergoing {{this analysis}} {{can also be}} difficult due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown of the odorous compounds. Ingredients and compounds can usually be ruled out or identified using gas <b>chromatograph</b> (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both through their physical properties and their scent. Reverse engineering of best-selling perfumes in the market is a very common practice in the fragrance industry due to the relative simplicity of operating GC equipment, the pressure to produce marketable fragrances, and the highly lucrative nature of the perfume market.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} various {{molecules}} in an oil sample {{can be determined}} by laboratory analysis. The molecules are typically extracted in a solvent, then separated in a gas <b>chromatograph,</b> and finally determined with a suitable detector, such as a flame ionization detector or a mass spectrometer. Due to {{the large number of}} co-eluted hydrocarbons within oil, many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography and typically appear as a hump in the chromatogram. This unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of oil will mix with water: the water associated fraction of the oil.|$|E
25|$|British {{military}} helicopters {{flew over}} the crash site, pointing out large pieces of wreckage to the search parties. Private helicopters, equipped with thermographic cameras, were drafted in to survey the heavily wooded areas surrounding Lockerbie. Within hours of the crash, photographs of the area taken by a French satellite were delivered to the investigators. High-resolution photographs from spy satellites were also provided by the United States Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Every item picked up was tagged, placed in a clear plastic bag, labelled and taken to the gymnasium of a local school, where everything was X-rayed and checked for explosive residue with a gas <b>chromatograph,</b> after which the information was entered into the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{molecule}} has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, it is frequently bound to other lipids including fatty acids; most analytical methods, therefore, utilise a strong alkali (KOH or NaOH) to saponify the ester linkages. Typical extraction solvents include 6% KOH in methanol. The free sterols and stanols (saturated sterols) are then {{separated from the}} polar lipids by partitioning into a less polar solvent (e.g. hexane). Prior to analysis, the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with BSTFA (bis-trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide) to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable trimethylsilyl (TMS) group. Instrumental analysis is frequently conducted on gas <b>chromatograph</b> (GC) with either a flame ionisation detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS). The mass spectrum for 5β-coprostanol - TMS ether {{can be seen in}} the figure.|$|E

25|$|This {{instrument}} is a versatile gas chemical analyzer {{that was designed}} to identify and measure chemicals in Titan's atmosphere. It was equipped with samplers that were filled at high altitude for analysis. The mass spectrometer, a high-voltage quadrupole, collected data to build a model of the molecular masses of each gas, and a more powerful separation of molecular and isotopic species was accomplished by the gas <b>chromatograph.</b> During descent, the GC/MS also analyzed pyrolysis products (i.e., samples altered by heating) passed to it from the Aerosol Collector Pyrolyser. Finally, the GC/MS measured the composition of Titan's surface. This investigation was made possible by heating the GC/MS instrument just prior to impact in order to vaporize the surface material upon contact. The GC/MS was developed by the Goddard Space Flight Center and University of Michigan's Space Physics Research Lab.|$|E
25|$|According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) (2007), benzene {{is both an}} anthropogenically {{produced}} and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include: volcanic eruptions, wild fires, synthesis of chemicals such as phenol, production of synthetic fibers, and fabrication of rubbers, lubricants, pesticides, medications, and dyes. The major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions; however, ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water. Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine. Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes, which are then analyzed with a gas <b>chromatograph.</b> The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine, blood, and breath tests; however, all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body.|$|E
25|$|These two components, used together, allow a much finer {{degree of}} {{substance}} identification than either unit used separately. It {{is not possible}} to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame ionization detector) cannot differentiate between multiple molecules that happen to take {{the same amount of time}} to travel through the column (i.e. have the same retention time), which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas <b>chromatograph</b> and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.|$|E

30|$|According to the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceutical for Human Use (ICH) {{guidelines}} (ICH 2000 a, b), {{the developed}} method was validated {{to assure the}} reliability of the results of analysis for the different parameters, viz. linearity, range, accuracy, precision, robustness, limit of quantization (LOQ), limit of detection (LOD) and specificity. Linearity was determined by serial dilutions (1 to 20 μg/mL) of the OLO in 50 % aqueous methanol in triplicate. The range of OLO was validated between 5 and 15 μg/mL with triplicates of dilutions. The recovery method was used to determine the accuracy of the developed method by spiking the standard solution to the pre-analysed samples (5, 10 and 15 μg/mL), which was repeated six times. Repeatability and intermediate precision were studied to assure the precision of the method. Six replicates of the standard dilution (5 μg/mL) were <b>chromatographed</b> subsequently to assure repeatability, which were further <b>chromatographed</b> after 5 h to assure the stability of the drug in the solvent system. The standard dilutions were analysed by different analysts in subsequent days to study intermediate precision in the linearity range. A change in temperature (20 °C, 25 °C and 30 °C) and acidic content of the aqueous part of the mobile phase (5 % change in 0.1 % aqueous formic acid) was observed. Different serial dilutions of OLO (0.1 to 1, 000 ng/mL) were <b>chromatographed</b> to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio to determine LOD and LOQ. Alkaline-degraded OLO samples were <b>chromatographed</b> to ascertain the specificity of the developed method for OLO.|$|R
500|$|Advancements in {{the field}} of {{chromatography}} arrived in 1953 with the invention of the gas <b>chromatograph</b> by Anthony T. James and Archer John Porter Martin, allowing for the separation of volatile liquid mixtures with components which have similar boiling points. [...] Nonvolatile liquid mixtures could be separated with liquid chromatography, but substances with similar retention times could not be resolved until the invention of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Csaba Horváth in 1970. [...] Modern HPLC instruments are capable of detecting and resolving substances whose concentrations are as low as parts per trillion.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advancements in forensic chemistry came in 1955 with the invention of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) by Fred McLafferty and Roland Gohlke. [...] The coupling of a gas <b>chromatograph</b> with a mass spectrometer allowed for the identification {{of a wide range of}} substances. [...] GC-MS analysis is widely considered the [...] "gold standard" [...] for forensic analysis due to its sensitivity and versatility along with its ability to quantify the amount of substance present. The increase in the sensitivity of instrumentation has advanced to the point that minute impurities within compounds can be detected potentially allowing investigators to trace chemicals to a specific batch and lot from a manufacturer.|$|E
500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the technetium-99m used in medical work is produced by irradiating dedicated highly enriched uranium targets in a reactor, extracting molybdenum-99 from the targets in reprocessing facilities, and recovering at the diagnostic center the technetium-99m produced upon decay of molybdenum-99. Molybdenum-99 in the form of molybdate [...] is adsorbed onto acid alumina (...) in a shielded column <b>chromatograph</b> inside a technetium-99m generator ("technetium cow", also occasionally called a [...] "molybdenum cow"). Molybdenum-99 has a half-life of 67hours, so short-lived technetium-99m (half-life: 6hours), which results from its decay, is being constantly produced. The soluble pertechnetate [...] can then be chemically extracted by elution using a saline solution. A drawback of this process is that it requires targets containing uranium-235, which are subject to the security precautions of fissile materials.|$|E
