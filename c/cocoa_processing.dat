40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{work is to}} discuss the various forces/ factors that affect the business environment of Ghana which impacts investing in marketing and <b>processing</b> of <b>cocoa</b> beans in Ghana. In order to determine or classify Ghana as an attractive destination or otherwise to invest in <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing</b> there {{is the need to}} discuss the prevailing macro business environmental forces which little is known about to investors, managers and policy makers in cocoa trade. These mentioned parties have been under increasing pressures to assess the various forces prevailing in Ghana before considering investing in <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing</b> in Ghana. The work therefore looks as the various macro environmental factors Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Physical Environment and Legal (PESTEL) forces in Ghana’s business environment which impacts <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing</b> which makes Ghana an attractive base or otherwise to invest in <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing.</b>   Research Questions: The specific questions that the research aims at solving are as follows: what are the external and environmental forces that will influence investing in <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing</b> in Ghana? Is Ghana a safe and attractive base to invest in <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing?</b>   Research method: In carrying this research I made use of both secondary and primary data. Primary data was gathered through face interviews and administrating questionnaires to illicit response from stakeholders in Ghana’s cocoa. The paper also presents a review of literature on PESTEL which has influence or features in Ghana’s business environment which are important in <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing.</b>   Research Findings: Empirical findings and review of PESTEL model reported in the work suggests that the PESTEL will impact on the strategy of organizations and policy makers who are into <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing.</b> Also gives suggestions on how the various environmental forces (PESTEL) will be applied to further improve upon the business environment which makes marketing and <b>processing</b> of <b>cocoa</b> in Ghana attractive.   Research Implications and Limitations: The discussions and analyses of the macro environmental forces prevailing in Ghana’s business environment which impacts cocoa marketing produces a frame work to analyze current threats and opportunities in Ghana’s business environment which impacts <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing</b> for people contemplating on investing in marketing and <b>processing</b> of <b>cocoa</b> in Ghana as well as other practical lessons for policy makers in cocoa. The work overlooks the micro environmental forces in Ghana that impacts <b>cocoa</b> marketing and <b>processing.</b> Further research into such area will help give an understanding of the micro factors that impact the business environment of Ghana. Also the work has a limited empirical data base as most information gathered were inconsistent and unreliable which raises concerns about investment information. These have been minimized thro 3 ugh cross checks with primary data...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of turning and environmental contamination on six spontaneous cocoa bean heap fermentations performed in Ghana was studied through a multiphasic approach, encompassing both microbiological (culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques) and metabolite target analyses. A sensory analysis of chocolate {{made from the}} fermented, dried beans was performed as well. Only four clusters were found among the isolates of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) identified: Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter ghanensis, Acetobacter senegalensis, and a potential new Acetobacter lovaniensis-like species. Two main clusters were identified among the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated, namely, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum. No differences in biodiversity of LAB and AAB were seen for fermentations carried out at the farm and factory sites, indicating the cocoa pod surfaces and not the general environment as the main inoculum for spontaneous cocoa bean heap fermentation. Turning of the heaps enhanced aeration and increased the relative population size of AAB {{and the production of}} acetic acid. This in turn gave a more sour taste to chocolate made from these beans. Bitterness was reduced through losses of polyphenols and alkaloids upon fermentation and <b>cocoa</b> bean <b>processing...</b>|$|R
