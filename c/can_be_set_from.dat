40|$|Abstract: A {{very low}} cost PC-compatible {{instrument}} is presented. It {{is attached to}} paralell port and it can generate any arbitrary or standard (sine, square, triangular, etc.) waveform, allowing to set all of its parameters: frequency, amplitude and duty cycle. Amplitude or frequency modulation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> optionally used when sine wave is selected. It is based on DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) technique and implemented on a CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device). By means of a text file of 32 K values, one waveform cycle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> programmed. Output frequency <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>setted</b> <b>from</b> 0. 6 Hz to 1 MHz, with maximum measured errors lower than 0. 12 %. Amplitude resolution is 2. 44 mV. PC is only used to set waveform parameters, hence the device operates in an autonomous way. PC <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used by other applications, being one of them the acquisition of the real-time system response. There are several commercial ICs that carry out DDS technique but they only generate sine, square and triangular waveform, whereas the system propposed can also generate any arbitrary waverform in a very easy way...|$|R
