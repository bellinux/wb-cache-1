40|$|Wear in rock crushers causes great {{costs in}} the mining and {{aggregates}} industry. Change of the geometry of the crusher liners is {{a major reason for}} these costs. Being able to predict the geometry of a worn crusher will help designing the crusher liners for improved performance. A model for prediction of sliding wear was suggested by Archard in 1953. Tests have been conducted to determine the wear coefficient in Archard's model. Using a small jaw crusher, the wear of the crusher liners has been studied for different settings of the crusher. The experiments have been carried out using quartzite, known for being very abrasive. Crushing forces have been measured, and the motion of the crusher has been tracked along with the wear on the crusher liners. The test results show that the wear mechanisms are different for the fixed and moving liner. If there were no relative sliding distance between rock and liner, Archard's model would yield no wear. This is not true for rock crushing applications where wear is observed even though there is no macroscopic sliding between the rock material and the liners. For this reason, Archard's model has been modified to account for the wear induced by the local sliding of particles being crushed. The predicted worn geometry is similar to the real <b>crusher.</b> A <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> is a machine commonly used in the mining and aggregates industry.

Attrition milling equipment includes the wet scrubber (also called the planetary mill or wet attrition mill), which has paddles in water creating vortexes in which the material collides and break up.

40|$|Cone crushers {{are used}} in the {{aggregates}} and mining industries to crush rock material. The pressure on <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> liners is the key factor that influences the hydraulic pressure, power draw and liner wear. In order to dynamically analyze and calculate <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> performance along with liner wear, a series of experiments are performed to obtain the crushed rock material samples from a crushing plant at different time intervals. In this study, piston die tests are carried out and a model relating compression coefficient, compression ratio and particle size distribution to a corresponding pressure is presented. On this basis, a new wear prediction model is proposed combining the empirical model for predicting liner wear with time parameter. A simple and practical model, based on the wear model and interparticle breakage, is presented for calculating compression ratio of each crushing zone along with liner wear. Furthermore, the size distribution of the product is calculated based on existing size reduction process model. A method of analysis of product size distribution and shape in the crushing process considering liner wear is proposed. Finally, the validity of the wear model is verified via testing.

40|$|Cone crushers {{are used}} by both the {{aggregate}} producing and the mining industry. Both industries are interested in increasing the product quality {{while at the same}} time lowering the production costs. Prediction of crusher performance has been focused on, since crushing is a vital process for both industries. In the thesis a method for prediction of <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> performance is presented. The model is based on the laws of mechanics and constitutive relations concerning rock breakage characteristics. There are some crucial assumptions which are of central interest for the model. The validity of these assumptions has been verified by full-scale tests. The overall size reduction process is a result of several subsequent crushing events. Therefore, the process occurring in a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> must also be modelled in the same repetitive way. Each crushing event is modelled with a selection and a breakage function. Selection corresponds to the probability of a particle being broken when an aggregate of particles is compressed. Breakage represents the way a single particle is broken into smaller fragments. The appearance of the selection and breakage functions is rock material specific and can be obtained by laboratory tests. The characterization of the fragmentation behaviour for rock materials is done by form conditioned compression crushing tests. Two modes of breakage are possible to achieve in a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher.</b> The location of the choke level is the criterion which determines the breakage mode. Interparticle breakage is achieved above the choke level while only single particle breakage is achieved below this level. The crusher model takes the fragmentation behaviour of the rock and feed size distribution into consideration. Moreover, chamber and machine geometry, together with machine parameters such as closed side setting, stroke and eccentric speed, is accounted for. On all occasions continuity of mass is preserved. Three main factors are identified to promote the size reduction process occurring in a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher.</b> These factors are: breakage modes, number of crushing zones, and compression ratio. The main factors are affected by both design and operating parameters. For a given crusher, the factors depend on eccentric speed, closed side setting, rock material breakage characteristics and feed size distribution. The main factors provide a fundamental and detailed understanding of how a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> operates. Any design consideration should be evaluated against these main factors. The model can be used as a simulation tool to assist in the design process of crushers. Any arbitrary design can then be studied. If a set of simulations is performed for a given crusher, a Crusher Performance Map is achieved, which in turn can be used when optimizing a given crushing task or a crushing plant...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to simulate the effects of segregation of the feed material entering the hopper on top of a typical <b>cone</b> <b>crusher.</b> A commercially available Discrete Element Method (DEM) software has been used to simulate and demonstrate some important aspects and phenomena and problems that are common in cone crushers. The first phenomenon of interest is segregation and uneven distribution of the feed entering a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher.</b> This is a common problem in many applications and leads to decreased comminution performance, poor product quality, uneven wear of the crusher manganese liners, high stress amplitudes and premature fatigue failures. This problem has been observed in many different applications and can sometimes severely affect the crusher performance in a negative way.

40|$|A <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> is a {{crushing}} machine which {{is widely used}} in the mining, construction and recycling industries. Previous research studies have proposed empirical mathematical models to simulate the operational performance of a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher.</b> These models attempt to match the size distributions of the feed and product streams. The flow of the rock and its breakage within the <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> chamber are not explicitly modelled by these methods. Moreover, the ability to investigate the changes in crusher performance affected by changes to the crusher design geometry and/or operating variables (including cavity profile, closed size setting and eccentric speed) are not easily achieved. Improvements to system design and performance are normally achieved by the combination of iterative modifications made to the design and manufacture {{of a series of}} prototype machines, and from a subsequent analysis of the results obtained from expensive and time consuming rock testing programs. The discrete element method (DEM) has in recent years proved to be a powerful tool in the execution of fundamental research to investigate the behaviour of granular material flow and rock breakage. Consequently, DEM models may provide the computational means to simulate the flow and breakage of rock as it passes through a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> chamber. Thus, the development of field validated models may provide a cost effective tool to predict the changes in crusher performance that may be produced by incremental changes made to the dimensions or power delivered to the crusher chamber. To obtain an improved understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that take place within a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> chamber, the two processes of rock flow and rock breakage may be decoupled. Consequently, this study firstly characterised the flow behaviour of broken rock through a static crusher chamber by conducting a series of experiments to investigate the flow of regular river pebbles down an inclined chute. A parallel computational study constructed and solved a series of DEM models to replicate the results of these experimental studies. An analysis of the results of these studies concluded that an accurate model replication of the shape of the pebbles and the method used to load the pebbles into the inclined chute were important to ensure that the DEM models successfully reproduced the observed particle flow behaviour. These studies also established relationships between the chute geometry and the time taken for the loaded pebble streams to clear the chute. To investigate the rock breakage behaviour observed within a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> chamber, thirty quasi-spherical particles of Glensanda ballast aggregate were diametrically crushed in the laboratory using a Zwick crushing machine. The crushed rock particles used were of three sieve size fractions: 14 - 28 mm, 30 - 37. 5 mm and 40 - 60 mm. The effects that either a variation in the particle size or strength has on and the number and size distribution of the progeny rock fragments produced on breakage were studied. Subsequently, a series of DEM simulation models were constructed and solved to replicate the experimental results obtained from these crushing tests. The aggregate particles were represented by agglomerates consisting of a number of smaller diameter bonded micro-spheres. A new method was proposed to generate a dense, isotropic agglomerate with negligible initial overlap between the micro-spheres by inserting particles to fill the voids in the agglomerate. In addition, the effects that a variation in the particle packing configurations had on the simulated strength and breakage patterns experienced by the model agglomerate rock particles were investigated. The results from these DEM model studies were validated against the experimental data obtained from the ballast rock breakage tests. A comparative analysis of the experimental and modelling studies concluded that once the bond strengths between the constituent micro-spheres matched the values determined from the rock breakage tests, then the numerical models were able to replicate the measured variations in the aggregate particle strengths. Finally, the individual validated DEM aggregate particle flow and breakage modes were combined to construct a preliminary coupled prototype DErvl model to simulate the flow and breakage of an aggregate feed through a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> chamber. The author employed two modelling approaches: the population balance model (PBM) and bonded particle model (BPM) to simulate the observed particle breakage characteristics. The application of the PBM model was successfully validated against historical experimental data available in the literature. However, the potential wider use of the BPM model was deemed impractical due to the high computation time. From a comparative analysis of the particle size distributions of the feed and computed product streams by the two modelling approaches, it is concluded that the simpler PBM produces more practical computationally efficient numerical solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} to simulate and predict <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> performance {{is of great}} interest {{for the development of}} crushers {{as well as for the}} design and optimization of crushing plants. To calculate the output from a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher,</b> models for size reduction and flow are needed. The interaction between these two models is quite complex as the overall size reduction in a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> is a result of a repeated consecutive comminution process. The flow model is important since it describes how the rock material moves through the crusher chamber. Thereby the flow model provides input to the size reduction model. In turn, the size reduction model predicts the size distribution after compressing the rock material. Previously presented flow models have only in a simplified way described the material flow. In the present paper the way an aggregate of particles moves down a crusher is described based on the equations of motion. A constitutive relation between size distribution and the uncompressed bulk density of the material is presented. Along with compatibility conditions from the crusher geometry, mass continuity is preserved. This is a very important aspect of flow modelling. Three different mechanisms are assumed to describe the material flow: sliding, free fall and squeezing. For a single particle only one of these three can be active at a time. Sliding occurs when a rock particle is in contact with the mantle and slides downwards. If the mantle accelerates away rapidly enough, the corresponding particle will fall freely. When a particle comes into contact with both mantle and concave or when the density of a material volume exceeds a critical value, squeezing will occur. During squeezing, particles will be compressed and thereby crushed. The flow model provides detailed information about how different machine parameters affect the flow of the rock material through the crusher chamber. From the model it can be explained why crushers with smaller inclination of the mantle require a larger stroke compared to the ones with steep inclination. Â© 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Cone crushers {{are often}} used as an {{intermediate}} comminution step in the mining industry. Real-time feedback data on the product streams {{can be obtained by}} applying mass-flow sensors to the process. Systems used for controlling the Closed Side Setting (CSS) on cone crushers are widely used to compensate for wear of the manganese crushing liners and to protect the machines from overloads. With a frequency converter also the eccentric speed in a <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> can be adjusted in real-time in addition to the CSS. The eccentric speed affects the dynamic interaction between the rock material and the crusher liners. The adjustment of these two online parameters in real time can result in an increased potential for production yield; however, a nontrivial optimization problem with a large solution space also arises. As the feed material also varies, and the wear is highly evident, the optimal setting for the parameters varies in time. In this paper we report on the preparation of a secondary <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> for real-time optimization. The <b>cone</b> <b>crusher,</b> a Sandvik CH 680, has got a frequency converter installed and the temperature in the crusher is measured {{in order to ensure that}} the crusher as a mechanical machine is working under good operating conditions.

The ore is then moved by conveyor belts, trucks or occasionally trains to the shaft to be hoisted to the surface in buckets or skips and emptied into bins beneath the surface headframe for transport to the mill.|$|R
40|$|Compressive {{crushing}} {{has been}} proven {{to be one of}} the most energy efficient principles for breaking rock particles (SchÃ¶nert, 1979). In this paper the <b>cone</b> <b>crusher,</b> which utilizes this mechanism, is investigated using the discrete element method (DEM) and industrial scale experiments. The purpose of the work is to develop a virtual simulation environment that can be used to gain fundamental understanding regarding internal processes and operational responses. A virtual crushing platform can not only be used for understanding but also for development of new crushers and for optimisation purposes. Rock particles are modelled using the bonded particle model (BPM) and laboratory single particle breakage tests have been used for calibration. The industrial scale experiments have been conducted on a Svedala H 6000 <b>cone</b> <b>crusher</b> operated as a secondary crushing stage. Two different close side settings have been included in the analysis and a high speed data acquisition system has been developed and used to sample control signals such as pressure and power draw in order to enable detailed comparison with simulation results. The crusher has been simulated as a quarter section with a batch of breakable feed particles large enough to achieve a short moment of steady state operation. Novel methods have been developed to estimate the product particle size distribution using cluster size image analysis. The results show a relatively good correspondence between simulated and experimental data, however further work would be need to identify and target the sources of observed variation and discrepancy between the experiments and simulations...|$|R
