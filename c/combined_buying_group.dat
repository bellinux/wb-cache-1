40|$|In diverse industries, from grocery {{retailing}} {{to health}} care, retailers join <b>buying</b> <b>groups</b> to achieve better terms with suppliers. The authors track the <b>buying</b> <b>group</b> membership of Europe's largest grocery retailers over a 15 -year period and evaluate why some <b>buying</b> <b>groups</b> {{are better than}} others in increasing retailer performance and why different members belonging to the same group do not always benefit equally from their membership. They find that, on average, <b>buying</b> <b>groups</b> indeed generate scale advantages for their members: group scale increases group members' productivity and sales and decreases their cost of goods sold. Still, bigger is not always better. Retailers benefit less from <b>buying</b> <b>group</b> scale when the group is more heterogeneous in terms of member size and when it extends its scope across too many markets. Moreover, the smaller a member is within the group and the more it overlaps with fellow members, the less it benefits...|$|R

40|$|Does <b>buying</b> <b>group</b> {{membership}} affect small firm community involvement, {{and if it}} does, {{is there}} a further effect, in particular as it concerns small firm performance? This article addresses this intersection of issues.

The article then describes a {{study of more than}} 300 small retail hardware stores. The findings show <b>buying</b> <b>group</b> membership being positively related to both scale and scope of community involvement. The authors also report a complex set of findings concerning the interac-tion of community involvement and <b>buying</b> <b>group</b> membership with small firm perfor-mance. The article concludes by reflecting on what these findings suggest for further work in small firm philanthropy...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the empirical relationship between product market competition and {{prices in the}} retail grocery sector in the euro area.

The analysis confirms the inverse relation between downstream market competition among retailers and price levels for most of the reference products. Though less conclusive in terms of statistical significance, the proposed estimates also point to a welfare enhancing role of <b>buying</b> <b>groups.</b> Our results indicate that <b>buying</b> <b>groups</b> provide a balancing mechanism between retailers' and producers' bargaining power, in support of the countervailing power hypothesis...|$|R

5000|$|The Co-operative Retail Trading Group (CRTG) was {{established}} in 1993 by the Co-operative Wholesale Society to centralise buying power for retail co-operatives in the UK.

[...] The CRTG lost its complete control over the food co-op sector in 2014 however after the Clydebank Co-operative Society left the <b>buying</b> <b>group.</b> After the financial crisis in The Co-operative Group it was decided that The Group should no longer be responsible for the central <b>buying</b> <b>group</b> (the CRTG) as, if it had have collapsed, it could have led to the collapse of the independent co-operative societies as they would have had major difficulties in sourcing produce. The new <b>buying</b> <b>group,</b> Federal Retail and Trading Services, {{was established}} in 2015 and differs from its predecessor most notably in that each member co-operative has equal control over the business, whereas previously control was proportional to total amount purchased (giving The Co-operative Group dominant control).

The results also show that buyers most prefer representatives who can solve problems, followed by representatives with technical knowledge, and then representatives who are efficient and follow through. These are the three most important attributes from the buyers’ perspective, and they are followed in decreasing order of importance by representatives who are easy to contact, representatives who readily provide information and samples, and representatives with industry experience. The research concludes with the finding that sales representatives who adopt the attributes which have been highlighted in this study will be more successful...|$|R

5000|$|Recently, <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> {{has been}} taken online in {{numerous}} forms, although <b>group</b> <b>buys</b> prior to 2009 usually referred to the grouping of industrial products for the wholesale market (especially in China). Modern day online <b>group</b> <b>buys</b> are {{a variation of the}} tuángòu buying that occurs in China. Under tuángòu, an item must be bought in a minimum quantity or dollar amount, otherwise the seller will not allow the purchase. Since individuals typically do not need multiples of one item or do not have the resources to <b>buy</b> in bulk, <b>group</b> <b>buys</b> allow people to invite others to purchase in bulk jointly. These <b>group</b> <b>buys,</b> often result in better prices for individual buyers or ensure that a scarce or obscure item is available for sale. <b>Group</b> <b>buys</b> were, in the past, often organized by like-minded online shoppers through Internet forums. Now these shoppers have also started to leverage the <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> model for purposes of buying other consumer durables. <b>Group</b> <b>buying</b> sites are back in demand as small businesses look for ways to promote their products to budget-conscious consumers in a weak global economy. <b>Group</b> <b>buying</b> is also used for purchasing real estate properties.
