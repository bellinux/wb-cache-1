5|$|In Pest Control, the player's {{vision is}} limited to a small area of the screen around the Accu-Sight <b>crosshairs</b> while looking for {{cockroaches}} that attempt to eat an on-screen pizza. Two different power-ups briefly illuminate the screen and clear all bugs onscreen. Later levels feature larger insects that contain bombs and small, fast bugs.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format and set in the fictional town of Black Rock. The player takes {{on the role of}} Sheriff Quickdraw, and the main objective of the game is to track down and kill a gang of outlaws who are hiding in the town. The game begins with a first-person perspective targeting minigame in which vertically scrolling bags of money can be shot at using <b>crosshairs.</b> Shooting the bags give the player initial sums of money which can be used to purchase ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The main {{design feature}} of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb aimer more {{time to work on}} the problem of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected <b>crosshairs</b> into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus their eyes on the target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>crosshair</b> is {{the most}} basic reticle for the AN/PVS-4 and is {{available}} as either a simple <b>crosshair,</b> A mildot <b>crosshair</b> or as an aimpoint <b>crosshair.</b>|$|R
50|$|Players {{control a}} Strategic Defense Initiative {{satellite}} orbiting the Earth and must destroy enemy missiles and satellites with its weapons, when activated the satellite's weapon systems {{fire at the}} <b>crosshair</b> present onscreen during play. The arcade version features a joystick to control the satellite and a trackball to control the <b>crosshair.</b> Home computer versions use different control schemes, such as depressing the fire button to control the <b>crosshair,</b> alternating between controlling the satellite and its weapons. It is also possible to use a joystick and mouse in combination to control the satellite and <b>crosshair</b> at the same time, emulating the arcade game's controls.|$|R
50|$|The {{joystick}} {{moves the}} soldier and the <b>crosshair</b> {{left and right}} of the area. The A Button is used for shooting the gun where the <b>crosshair</b> is positioned. If the firing button is held down, the player can move the <b>crosshair</b> while keeping the soldier in the same spot. The B Button is used for throwing grenades where the <b>crosshair</b> is positioned. The C Button held down and the joystick pulled left or right enables the soldier to run. If the player pulls the joystick Diagonal-Left or Diagonal-Right during a run, the soldier will do an evasive roll that will prevent him getting killed.|$|R
5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized <b>crosshairs</b> on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on <b>crosshairs</b> for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E
5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the sight head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The sight head replaced the older wire <b>crosshairs</b> with a modern reflector sight that {{was easy to see}} at night. The sight could be rotated manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E

5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of the <b>crosshairs</b> for night use and was stabilized so the bomb aimer could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS {{on the front of}} a gyro unit taken from a Sperry Gyroscope artificial horizon, to provide stabilization in the horizontal plane, useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. It was no easy task to manually calculate the range angle on the Course and Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E
5|$|Wise asked Harold Michelson {{to be the}} film's {{production}} designer, and Michelson was put to work on {{finishing the}} incomplete Phase II sets. The designer began with the bridge, which had nearly been completed. Michelson first removed Chekov's new weapons station, a semicircular plastic bubble grafted onto {{one side of the}} bridge wall. The idea for Phase II was that Chekov would have looked out toward space while <b>crosshairs</b> in the bubble tracked targets. Wise instead wanted Chekov's station to face the Enterprises main viewer, a difficult request as the set was primarily circular. Production illustrator Michael Minor created a new look for the station using a flat edge {{in the corner of the}} set.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the <b>crosshairs</b> on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E

25|$|Conventional bombsights {{are set up}} {{pointing}} at a fixed angle, the range angle, which accounts for the various effects on the trajectory of the bomb. To the operator looking through the sights, the <b>crosshairs</b> indicate the location on the ground the bombs would impact if released at that instant. As the aircraft moves forward, the target approaches the <b>crosshairs</b> from the front, moving rearward, and the bombardier releases the bombs as the target passes through {{the line of the}} sights. One example of a highly automated system of this type was the RAF's Mark XIV bomb sight.|$|E

40|$|Gain {{calibration}} for X-ray imaging {{systems with}} a movable flat panel detector and an intrinsic <b>crosshair</b> {{is a challenge}} due to the geometry-dependent heel effect and <b>crosshair</b> artifact. This study aims to develop a gain correction method for such system by implementing the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction technique. Flood field images containing <b>crosshair</b> and heel effect were acquired in 4 different flat panel detector positions at fixed exposure parameters. The <b>crosshair</b> region was automatically detected using common image processing algorithms and removed by a simple interpolation procedure, resulting in a crosshair-removed image. A large kernel-based correction was then used to remove the heel effect. Mask filters corresponding to each <b>crosshair</b> region were applied to the resultant heel effect-removed images to invalidate the pixels of the original <b>crosshair</b> region. Finally, a seamless gain map was composed with corresponding valid pixels from the processed images either by the sequential replacement or by the selective averaging techniques developed in this study. Quantitative evaluation was performed based on normalized noise power spectrum and detective quantum efficiency improvement factor for the flood field images corrected by the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction-based gain maps. For comparison purpose, a single crosshair-removed gain map was also tested. As a result, it was demonstrated that the Multi-Acquisition Gain Image Correction technique achieved better image quality than the crosshair-removed technique, showing lower normalized noise power spectrum values over most of spatial frequencies. The improvement was more obvious at the priori-crosshair region of the gain map. The mean detective quantum efficienc...|$|R
