5|$|At that time, the {{university}} {{did not offer}} a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program so Massey undertook a Master of Science (MSc) <b>course,</b> <b>with</b> both experimental and theoretical components. The former, in cooperation with Courtney Mohr, dealt with soft X-ray deflection from metal surfaces; the latter with wave mechanics. This involved translating numerous articles from German journals such as Zeitschrift für Physik, Annalen der Physik and Physikalische Zeitschrift. His external examiner was Ralph Fowler from the University of Cambridge, who was Paul Dirac's PhD supervisor.|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{was based}} in Gloucestershire.

In mid-November, he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle-upon-Tyne where he trained in the used of radar. During his stay there, Miller sustained a back injury during a wrestling match: the injury was to cause him recurring and enduring problems, particularly diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E

5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when on a collision <b>course</b> <b>with</b> each other.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially {{to gain control}} of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania on a collision <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.|$|E

5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments {{to cope with}} the demands of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed {{to cope with the}} demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the <b>course</b> <b>with</b> spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E
5|$|Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld in {{his younger}} years was very {{enthusiastic}} about the mountains and wildlife. From his fourteenth year he participated in hunting.

5|$|Ultimately, the Solar System {{is stable}} in {{that none of}} the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within fivebillion years or so Mars's {{eccentricity}} may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it on a collision <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.|$|E

During the next 150 years, England would fight with Spain, the Netherlands, and France {{for control of the}} continent, while religious division in Ireland between Protestant and Catholic has lasted for 400 years. By actively pursuing more than just a personal union of his realms, he helped lay the foundations for a unitary British state.|$|E
5|$|Warning from Space {{influenced}} Toho's Gorath, a 1963 film which {{depicts a}} rogue planet {{on a collision}} <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth. The planet Paira in Warning from Space {{may have been an}} influence in the later Daiei film Gamera vs. Guiron, which features the planet Terra, another planet on the opposite of Earth's orbit. Critics have also noted plot similarities to the later Toho film Invasion of Astro-Monster, in that a friendly planet warns Japan of the atom bomb and subsequently assists in celestial defense. The Pairans' asteroidean appearance {{is similar to that of}} a later pentagrammic creation, Starro, a villain from DC Comics' Justice League.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet on a collision <b>course</b> <b>with</b> the Earth.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it on a collision <b>course</b> <b>with</b> Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not wearing his uniform cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary <b>course</b> <b>with</b> hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was thrown on his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E
