5000|$|QTCs were {{discovered}} in 1996 by technician David Lussey while he was searching {{for a way to}} develop an electrically <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Lussey founded Peratech Ltd, a company devoted to research work and usage of QTCs. Peratech Ltd. and other companies are working on developing quantum tunneling composite to improve touch technology. Currently, there is restricted use of QTC due to its high cost, but eventually this technology is expected to become available to the general user. Quantum tunneling composites are combinations of polymer composites with elastic, rubber-like properties elastomer, and metal particles (nickel)l. Due to a no-air gap in the sensor, contamination or interference between the contact points is impossible. There is also little to no chance of arcing, electrical sparks between contact points. In the QTC's inactive state, the conductive elements are too far from one another to pass electron charges. Thus, current does not flow when there is no pressure on the quantum-tunneling composite. A characterization of a QTC is its spiky silicon covered surface. The spikes do not actually touch, but when a force is applied to the QTC, the spikes move closer to each other and a quantum effect occurs as a high concentration of electrons flow from one spike tip to the next. The electric current stops when the force is taken away.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} solvent evaporation and shrink in <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive.</b> The adhesion mechanism of <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> strongly depends on the curing of the polymer matrix.

The curing behaviors and solvent evaporation of <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> were investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). As curing time increases, the silver particles in the polymer are concentrated due to the incremental solvent evaporation rate and the shrink rate.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} electrically <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints exposed to elevated temperature and relative humidity conditions has been investigated, and failure mechanisms of <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints have been determined. Three model, silver-filled, epoxy-based adhesive {{systems have been}} studied in conjunction with printed circuit board (PCB) substrates with metallizations of Au/Ni/Cu and Cu. Double cantilever beam (DCB) tests have been adopted to investigate the effects of environmental aging on electrically <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints. This study reveals that conductive adhesives as well as substrate metallizations both play important roles in the durability of <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints. The rate of water attack on the interface of <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints with Cu plated PCB substrates is faster than for those with Au/Ni/Cu metallization. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is based on considerations of surface free energy and interfacial free energy. Following drying of the aged <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints, the fracture energy recovered to some extent. This recovery in the fracture energy {{could be attributed to}} the reversible effect of plasticization of the bulk adhesives, as well as the rebonding between the adhesive and the substrate during drying at 150 C. XPS analysis of DCB failure surfaces suggested that diffusion of Cu to the Au surface might have occurred on the Au/Ni/Cu plated PCB substrates during aging. Copper oxide on the substrate surface upon exposure of the <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesive</b> joints to the hot/wet environment has also been observed...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Multiple fillers {{are adopted}} {{to study the}} filler {{influences}} on electrical and mechanical properties of the <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesives.</b> The performances of the developed nano-enhanced interconnect materials in printing process are also evaluated. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Micron-sized silver flakes are used as the basic fillers, and submicro- and nano-sized silver spheres and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are adopted to obtain <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesives</b> with multiple fillers. Differential scanning calorimetry measurement is carried out to characterize the curing behavior of the samples with different fillers, four-probe method is used to obtain the bulk resistivity, shear test is conducted for adhesive strength, and environmental loading test is also involved. Furthermore, printing trials with different patterns have been carried out. Findings -The electrical resistivity of the adhesives with submicro-sized silver spheres does not monotonically change with the increasing sphere proportion, and there exists an optimized value for the ratio of silver flakes to spheres. Samples with relatively small amount of CNT additives show improved electrical properties, while their mechanical strengths tend to decrease. For the printing application, the adhesives with 18. 3 volume% filler content behave much better than those with lower filler content of 6 percent. The presence of the nano-particles makes a slight improvement in the printing results. Research limitations/implications - More detailed printing performance and reliability test of the samples need {{to be carried out}} in the future. Originality/value - The <b>conductive</b> <b>adhesives</b> as interconnect materials exhibit some improved properties with optimized bimodal or trimodal fillers.
