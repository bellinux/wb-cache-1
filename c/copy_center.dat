25|$|Costco Business Centers are {{warehouses}} {{similar to}} regular Costco warehouses, and {{are open to}} all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise, though, cater predominantly to enterprises, {{with a focus on}} small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry. They do not offer most of the consumer-oriented services found at regular Costco warehouses, but some locations do have a food court or a gas station or both. Also unlike regular warehouses, most Costco Business Centers have a Print & <b>Copy</b> <b>Center</b> which provides printing professional services. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities. Finally, opening hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.|$|E
