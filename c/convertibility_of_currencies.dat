50|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, {{economic}} depression struck Europe. Of all the non-neutral powers, only the GDP of the United Kingdom had not decreased because of the war, Germany's GDP was at its 1908 level and France's at its 1891 level. Trade was based on US dollar reserves (the only acceptable reserve currency), which Europe lacked. Therefore, the transfer of money (immediately after each transaction) increased the opportunity cost of trading. Some trade was reduced to barter. The situation led the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) to create the EPU, all members signing the agreement on 1 July 1950. The EPU accounted for trades but did not transfer money {{until the end of}} the month. It changed the landscape from bilateral trades of necessity (trading with partners because of outstanding debts) to multilateral trades. The EPU also forced liberalization by mandating that members eliminate discriminatory trade measures. The EPU was a general success with trade levels more than doubling during its duration. By its close in 1958, <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> was a possibility, no longer needing government permissions in European countries.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on three key dates in {{analyzing}} the monetary policy options arrived at by the States of Europe {{over the course of}} the last thirty years. By the creation of the European Payments Union in 1958, the European States made a regionalist policy option by establishing the intra-European convertibility of their currencies while maintaining exchange restrictions with respect to the dollar zone. In 1958 on the other hand resumption of general <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> demonstrated the "global-linkage" policy option of the decision-makers of the period by removing any specifically European substance from the European monetary agreement. From this perspective, the decision of December 1978 to institute a monetary System would clearly appear to be by far the most important initiative taken in some time to reestablish a framework for European monetary cooperation. With regard to international monetary relations, eight countries have therefore, within three decades, chosen two regionalist policy options and one global-linkage policy option. The purpose of this study is to identify the circumstances, reasons and impact of the policy options that have successively been implemented...|$|E

These crucial changes include abolition of foreign trade monopoly and its liberalisation, introduction <b>of</b> stepwise <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> national <b>currencies</b> (for transactions <b>of</b> balance of payments on the current account at first), changes in exchange rate policy, price liberalisation and territorial reorientation of foreign trade.

40|$|The {{architects of}} the post-World War II {{international}} economic order considered the free <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> for current account purposes {{one of the fundamental}} prerequisites of multilateral trade and thus of economic growth. While the Bretton Woods system started operating in 1946, the Western European countries only formally established currency convertibility in December 1958. So far, analytical studies of the return to convertibility are scarce. The few studies that exist generally treat convertibility as a technical, monetary issue, even a simple formality. The prevailing view is that, because of its trade-facilitating characteristic, convertibility was a widely accepted and uncontroversial economic policy objective shared by the Western European countries. This assumption follows from the belief that the Bretton Woods period was characterized by an international consensus on the benefits and desirability of international trade and long-term economic growth. The collective move to convertibility is regarded as proof of this consensus and of the willingness to cooperate to achieve common goals. Therefore, most accounts consist of historical narratives of Western Europe's path to convertibility rather than analyses of the development within the context of national policy aims. The comparison of Britain, France and the Federal Republic of Germany shows that convertibility was a far more complex, even controversial issue than has so far been argued in the literature. This thesis analyzes the national policy on convertibility in each country, respectively, by comparing the importance of convertibility for trade, macroeconomic policy, foreign policy and economic adjustment. Economic and political considerations {{played a crucial role in}} each country's policy on convertibility. The comparative analysis of the three leading countries' national economic policy on convertibility reveals a fundamental divergence in general long-term policy orientations in the three countries, challenging the widely accepted idea of a post-war consensus among Western European countries on the long-term policy objectives. The collective return to convertibility represented a very versatile tool, which the key countries employed to fulfill different, often incompatible, objectives. The national economic and political circumstances, which determined French, British and German policy on convertibility explain why the return to convertibility occurred in December 1958 and why the key countries coordinated their efforts. In particular, the establishment of convertibility was intricately linked to national policies on European integration. As a vehicle for national economic policy the return to convertibility provides important new insights into the formation of national exchange rate policy and international monetary cooperation in the 1950 s...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the issue <b>of</b> achieving full <b>convertibility</b> for the Chinese currency, Renminbi (RMB), {{and its impact}} on the economies of both mainland China and Hong Kong. It focuses on the sequencing <b>of</b> Renminbi¡¦s full <b>convertibility,</b> clarifying the different concepts <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>convertibility,</b> i. e. current account convertibility, capital/financial account convertibility, and full convertibility. It also discusses the differences between removing restrictions on international transactions and removing restrictions on the exchange <b>of</b> foreign <b>currencies.</b> There still exist various extremely strict restrictions on capital/financial account convertibility in China. There is still a long way to go before these restrictions can be removed completely. China¡¦s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will surely drive the course <b>of</b> Renminbi¡¦s full <b>convertibility.</b> However, the Renminbi may not become a fully convertible currency within the five years after China¡¦s accession to the WTO.

At the same time, based on the common practices and basic sequence taken by most countries in the world, drawing on the experience and lessons from other countries¡¦ practice and given the fact that China is a large developing country, we also conclude that a progressive and prudent sequential process is needed for the full <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> Renminbi. <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> Renminbi, WTO, China, Hong Kong...|$|R

50|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the Federal Reserve, the banking system had dealt with periodic crises (such as in the Panic of 1907) by suspending the <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> deposits into <b>currency.</b> In 1907, the system nearly collapsed and there was an extraordinary intervention by an ad-hoc coalition assembled by J. P. Morgan. In the years 1910-1913, the bankers demanded a central bank to address this structural weakness. Friedman suggested, however, that if a policy similar to the Panic had been followed during the banking panic at the end of 1930, it might have stopped the vicious circle of the forced liquidation of assets at depressed prices, just as suspension <b>of</b> <b>convertibility</b> in 1893 and 1907 had quickly ended the liquidity crises at the time.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the posibilties for modifying existing currency board in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Generally, the currency board, as a monetary policy and exchange rate regime, has significant advantages {{in that it}} enables macroeconomic stabilization, primarily stabilization of inflationary expectations by establishing macroeconomic discipline; <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>currency</b> through its pegging to reserve currency, that normally covers monetary liabilities of the central bank; and increase in credibility and confidence in the domestic currency.

In the paper, based on available theoretical developments and solutions in practice, possible alternatives and measures for strengthening the existing monetary policy framework in Bosnia and Herzegovina – the orthodox currency board – have been analyzed, {{with the aim of}} increasing flexibility and resilience of the country’s monetary system and protection of its financial sector in conditions of a large economic crisis. Primarily, the possibility of introducing a lender of last resort function in the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina for providing liquidity backup for the banking sector has been considered, in which way the model <b>of</b> orthodox <b>currency</b> board would become closer to the model <b>of</b> quasi <b>currency</b> board, implemented in practice in many other countries...|$|R

Then Mr. Martínez Fresneda said that, since the execution of the Government agreement was already under way, there was no place to discuss the possibility of contesting and impeding its realization, but if there was no place for discussion, there was place to express, in his most solemn fashion, his energetic opposition, because he considered the agreement to be illegal and ineffective by right. It was illegal, because being the gold exclusive property of the Bank, neither the State nor the Government could take hold of it. On another account, he said, the gold is the reserve that is backed by the law and that guarantees the <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> notes, and this being so, the gold could not be kept anywhere else but in the vault of the Bank, precisely when the new vault has been inaugurated, which responds to all the advancements in security against fires, bombs, etc., all that demonstrates the unfortunateness of the agreement.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this article deals with some basic {{questions}} concerning the transition from a planned to a market economy in the C. S. F. R., Hungary, and Poland. Forty years of a centrally planned system have shaped the attitudes of economic agents, and the capacity of enterprises as well as of administration officials to act in conformity with market rules has been greatly impaired. Thus, the experiences of Western Europe in the post-war period can be transferred to Eastern Europe only to a limited extent. If the external sector of the Eastern economies is to flourish, <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>currencies</b> must be implemented quickly; this in turn will require a massive devaluation, supported by supplementary commercial policy measures. Even though the foreign trade of the Eastern economies should be redirected toward the West, trade relations with other Eastern countries should not be neglected; in the transition phase these traditional trade relations need to be stimulated through counter trade, bilateral clearing (in trade with the U.

In 1881 the country prepared for a return to the gold standard and to gradually eliminate fiat currency. However, during the Chilean Civil War in 1891 the government of José Manuel Balmaceda issued more fiat money to finance this new war.

In 1892 the [...] "oreros" [...] succeeded in having the <b>convertibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> approved by law and in December 1895 non-convertible legal tender was pulled out of circulation. In 1898 the convertible regime collapsed once again in the face of severe economic instability (crop failure, war scare) and was abolished. Issuing of fiat money then continued until 1907 but from there on currency was issued with convertibility to gold or saltpetre mining related legal titles.The establishment of the Buenos Aires-Mendoza railroad in 1885 ended the lengthy and costly trade with carts that connected these two regions of Argentina and facilitated cattle exports from the pampas to Chile, albeit in the last portion of the route the cattle had to walk over the high mountain passes of the Andes. These imports resulted in a lowering of meat prices in Chile. Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura (National Agriculture Society), a landowners organization, pushed for a tariff on Argentine cattle and in 1897 the tariff was passed in a bill at the Chilean congress. The unpopular tariff resulted a massive protest in that degenerated into a destructive riot in Santiago on October 1905. Chilean wine exports to Argentina were hampered by the lack of effective land transport and a series of war scares. This situation changed after the Pactos de Mayo were signed in 1902 and the inauguration of the Transandine Railway in 1909, making war unlikely and trade across the Andes easy. Governments agreed to sign a free trade agreement. Argentine winegrowers association, Centro Vitivinícola Nacional, dominated by European immigrants protested vigorously against the free trade agreement since Chilean wines were considered a threat to the local industry. The complaints of Argentine wine growers in conjunction with that of Chilean cattle farmers represented in Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura ended up tearing down the plans for a free trade agreement.|$|R
