5|$|Clement's {{position}} as Bishop of Dunblane provided {{the opportunity to}} participate on the larger national and international stage. In 1241, the Cistercian general chapter began postulating the Pope about the saintliness of Edmund of Abingdon, formerly Archbishop of Canterbury. In the following year, various clerics wrote pieces and compiled evidence supporting this Edmund's claim to sainthood. <b>Clement</b> was one of these clerics. Edmund's saintliness was endorsed by Pope Innocent IV in 1246. <b>Clement</b> took part in a similar campaign in 1249. He was part of the movement to canonise Queen Margaret, one of the ancestors of the contemporary Scottish kings. <b>Clement</b> was appointed to investigate her saintliness, and in the following year Margaret too was canonised. Meanwhile, in 1247, Pope Innocent IV gave <b>Clement</b> the more onerous and demanding appointment of papal tax collector. <b>Clement</b> was charged with collecting one twentieth of all ecclesiastical revenues within the Kingdom of the Scots. The purpose was to finance a new crusade, and Clement's appointment was part of a money-raising initiative carried out throughout Western Christendom.|$|E
