50|$|There are {{different}} types of <b>form</b> <b>tools.</b> Insert <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> {{are the most common}} for short- to medium-range jobs (50 to 20,000 pcs). <b>Circular</b> <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> are usually for longer jobs, since the tool wear can be ground off the tool tip many times as the tool is rotated in its holder. There is also a skiving tool {{that can be used for}} light finishing cuts. <b>Form</b> <b>tools</b> can be made of cobalt steel, carbide, or high-speed steel. Carbide requires additional care because it is very brittle and will chip if chatter occurs.|$|R
40|$|Sheet-bulk {{metal forming}} {{is a new}} {{production}} process capable of performing deep-drawing and massive forming steps in a single operation. However, due to the high forming forces of the forming process, continuous process control is {{required in order to}} detect wear on the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> before production quality is impacted. To be able to measure the geometry of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> in the limited space of forming presses, a new inspection system is being developed within the SFB/TR 73 collaborative research center. In addition to the limited space, the process restricts the amount of time available for inspection. Existing areal optical measurement systems suffer from shadowing when measuring the tool's inner elements, as they cannot be placed in the limited space next to the tool, while tactile measurement systems cannot meet the time restrictions for measuring the areal geometries. The new inspection system uses the fringe projection optical measurement principle to capture areal geometry data from relevant parts of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> in short time. Highresolution image fibers are used to connect the system's compact sensor head to a base unit containing both camera and projector of the fringe projection system, which can be positioned outside of the moving parts of the press. To enable short measurement times, a high intensity laser source is used in the projector in combination with a digital micro-mirror device. Gradient index lenses are featured in the sensor head to allow for a very compact design {{that can be used in}} the narrow space above the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> inside the press. The sensor head is attached to an extended arm, which also guides the image fibers to the base unit. A rotation stage offers the possibility to capture measurements of different functional elements on the <b>circular</b> <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> by changing the orientation of the sensor head next to the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> During operation of the press, the arm can be travelled out of the moving parts of the forming press. To further reduce the measurement times of the fringe projection system, the inverse fringe projection principle has been adapted to the system to detect geometry deviations in a single camera image. Challenges arise from vibrations of both the forming machine and the positioning stages, which are transferred via the extended arm to the sensor head. Vibrations interfere with the analysis algorithms of both encoded and inverse fringe projection and thus impair measurement accuracy. To evaluate the impact of vibrations on the endoscopic system, results of measurements of simple geometries under the influence of vibrations are discussed. The effect of vibrations is imitated by displacing the measurement specimen during the measurement with a linear positioning stage. The concept of the new inspection system is presented within the scope of the TR 73 demonstrational sheet-bulk metal forming process. Finally, the capabilities of the endoscopic fringe projection system are shown by measurements of gearing structures on a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> compared to a CAD-reference. © 2015 SPIE...|$|R

40|$|The {{northern}} and north-eastern parts of Iraq are mountainous area with very rugged topography that includes high and steep cliffs, deep valleys; locally canyon shape, and rare wide and flat plains.

This article deals with the origin of a <b>circular</b> <b>form</b> developed {{in one of the}} main valleys called Lolan Valley in Khwakurk area, northern part of Iraq.

40|$|We have {{extended}} {{the analysis of}} plasmid transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae by finding that monomeric and dimeric open <b>circular</b> and linear <b>forms</b> of pMV 158 were active in transformation. Their efficiencies were at least 35 -fold {{lower than those of}} the corresponding closed <b>circular</b> <b>forms.</b> The evidence came largely from analysis of S 1 nuclease-digested plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid by combinations of dye-buoyancy, gel electrophoresis, and sedimentation velocity methods. As with closed <b>circular</b> <b>forms,</b> monomer open <b>circular</b> <b>forms</b> gave second-order kinetics and dimer forms gave first-order kinetics. Unique linear products of digestion by either of two restriction enzymes were inactive, but a mixture of the two digests was active, as was the mixture of linear monomer deoxyribonucleic acids produced by S 1 nuclease. Absolute efficiencies of transformation were low even for closed circular donors. All of the results, including the low efficiencies, were consistent with the interpretation that plasmid replicons were assembled in the recipient cell by pairing of fragments of single strands that had entered the cell separately from duplex donors that had been cut on the cell surface...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have cyclized the {{polypeptide}} {{backbone of}} β-lactamase {{with a short}} peptide loop {{as a novel method}} for protein stabilization, using intein-mediated protein ligation. Successful cyclization was proven by mass spectrometry and subsequent re-linearization by proteolytic cleavage, as well as by resistance against carboxypeptidase. Under the conditions of the experiment, no disulfide bond is present. The <b>circular</b> <b>form</b> of β-lactamase was found to be significantly more stable against irreversible aggregation upon heating than the linear <b>form.</b> The <b>circular</b> <b>form</b> could be purified from the linear one either by this heat treatment or by a his-tag which became exopeptidase-resistant by cyclization. The increased stability of the <b>circular</b> <b>form</b> is probably due to the decreased conformational entropy in the unfolded state and in the intermediate states. While the introduction of additional disulfide bonds for protein stabilization follows the same rationale, the cyclization strategy may disturb the structure less and thus constitute a general method for stabilizing those proteins with N- and C-termini in close proximity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceElements that excise and integrate, such as prophages, and {{transfer}} by conjugation, such as plasmids, {{have been found}} in various bacteria. These elements appear to have a diversified set of characteristics including cell-to-cell contact using pili or cell aggregation, transfer of single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, low or high specificity of integration and serine or tyrosine recombinases. This has led to a highly heterogeneous nomenclature, including conjugative transposons, integrative 'plasmids', genomic islands and numerous unclassified elements. However, all these elements excise by site-specific recombination, transfer the resulting <b>circular</b> <b>form</b> by conjugation and integrate by recombination between a specific site of this <b>circular</b> <b>form</b> and a site in the genome of their host. Whereas replication of the <b>circular</b> <b>form</b> probably occurs during conjugation, this replication is not involved in the maintenance of the element. In this review, we show that these elements share very similar characteristics and, therefore, we propose to classify them as integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). These elements evolve by acquisition or exchanges of modules with various transferable elements including at least ICEs and plasmids. The ICEs are probably widespread among the bacteria...|$|R
