5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE). Upon arrival, the inspector <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Customs and Border Protection electronic database {{and found a}} computer-generated alert, based upon Howard Cotterman's prior conviction for child sex crimes in 1992.

5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to}} the police log and at 4:30 am {{according to the}} Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E

More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by hackers occurred on 19 September.

5|$|The Belgian Army, the BEF and the French 1st Army, in a domino effect, was ordered/forced {{to retire}} on 16 May to avoid their {{southern}} flanks from being turned by the German armoured forces advancing through the French Ardennes and the German 6th Army advancing through Gembloux. The Belgian Army {{was holding the}} German Fourteenth Army on the KW-line, along with the French 7th and British armies.

The Germans also believed that some Partisans merely withdrew into the mountains, concealing their numbers by walking in each other's snowprints, in order to return to the valleys when the Axis forces left. The operation concluded on 4 February 1942.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E
5|$|After wasting their {{ammunition}} in {{this preliminary}} action, the Mahdist force began a flanking maneuver against the Belgians. The Mahdists' right flank, situated {{along the river}} parallel to the Nile, advanced rapidly trying to pin Chaltin {{with his back to}} the river. Chaltin, who by this time had advanced within two hundred meters of the Mahdists and begun a more effective barrage of his own, replied to the threat by ordering the sudden advance of his reserve companies. The move <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> advancing Mahdists, avoiding the unfavorable position and causing the rebels to falter. Sensing that victory was near, Chaltin ordered the Azande to charge the Mahdists to separate the advanced right wing from the rest of the line. The charge was successful, and the now considerably damaged Mahdist flanking force was completely cut off and surrounded by Free State soldiers. Chaltin's main companies then attacked, pressing the Mahdist defenses as they forced their way into the hills. Three of the companies attacked the well-defended path through the hills, while two others charged the hilltops. After a fierce contest for the heights, the demoralized and weakened Mahdist line broke and its remaining defenders fled to the north towards Rejaf, leaving ammunition and weapons. The action was finished by eight-thirty that morning.|$|E
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled with the crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or {{sat in the front}} seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars to the left and right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{joined the}} revolt of Edward's wife Isabella of France and her lover Mortimer in 1326, {{pursuing}} and capturing Edward at Neath in South Wales. Following Edward's deposition at the Parliament of Kenilworth in 1326 and reputed murder at Berkeley Castle, Thomas's conviction was posthumously reversed and Henry regained {{possession of the}} Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas's treason. His restored prestige led to him knighting the young King Edward III of England before his coronation. Mortimer lost support over the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton that formalised Scotland's independence, and his developing power in the Welsh Marches provoked jealousy from the barons. When Mortimer called a parliament to make his new powers and estates permanent with the title of Earl of March in 1328, Henry led the opposition and held a counter-meeting. In response, Mortimer ravaged the lands of Lancaster and <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> revolt. Edward III was able to assume control in 1330 but Henry's further influence was restricted by poor health and blindness for {{the last fifteen years}} of his life.|$|E
5|$|McCudden set {{out across}} the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance he <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> {{airfield}} he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map and McCudden returned to his machine. Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a plunged into the ground. 8 Squadron's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was lying {{next to one of}} the wings—he had not worn his safety belt. Burdett followed and recognised the pilot as soon as his headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness and died at 20:00.|$|E
5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard.

The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by harnesses and facing the ground through most of the ride.

5|$|The Anzacs {{were confronted}} by a treacherous, {{confusing}} tangle of ravines and spurs that descended from the heights of the Sarı Baır range to the sea. The landing was only lightly opposed by scattered Turkish units until Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division and perceiving {{the threat posed by}} the landings, rushed reinforcements to the area in what became a race for the high ground. The contest for the heights was decided on the second ridge line where the Anzacs and Turks fought over a knoll called Baby 700. The position changed hands a number of times on the first day before the Turks, having the advantage of the higher ground on Battleship Hill, took final possession of it. Once the Anzac advance was <b>checked,</b> <b>the</b> Turks counter-attacked, trying to force the invaders back to the shore, but failed to dislodge them from the foothold they had gained. A trench perimeter quickly developed and a bloody stalemate ensued until August.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{judiciary}} {{launched an}} investigation into the circumstances surrounding the explosion. The prosecution conducted a search and seizure at the offices of Litoral Gas to confirm the absence of customer complaints about the gas leak. Judge Juan Carlos Curto ordered the arrest of Carlos Osvaldo García, an employee of the department responsible for gas service to the area. He was captured during the night, and his assistant Pablo Miño surrendered to police the following day. According to witnesses, one employee fled in a van before the explosion, when he realized the severity of the gas leak, while another remained to try to evacuate people from the endangered area. The van belonged to García, who experienced an acute stress reaction during the trial. Curto <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> remnants of the gas employee's workshop to verify García's testimony.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones {{was elected}} an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and the {{following}} year he exhibited (for the only time) at the Academy, showing The Depths of the Sea, {{a painting of a}} mermaid carrying down with her a youth whom she has unconsciously drowned in the impetuosity of her love. This picture adds to the habitual haunting charm a tragic irony of conception and a felicity of execution which give it a place apart among Burne-Jones's works. He formally resigned his Associateship in 1893. One of the Perseus series was exhibited in 1887, two more in 1888, with The Brazen Tower, inspired by the same legend. In 1890 the second series of The Legend of Briar Rose were exhibited by themselves, and won the widest admiration. The huge watercolor, The Star of Bethlehem, painted for the corporation of Birmingham, was exhibited in 1891. A long illness for some time <b>checked</b> <b>the</b> painter's activity, which, when resumed, was much occupied with decorative schemes. An exhibition of his work was held at the New Gallery in the winter of 1892-1893. To this period belong several of his comparatively few portraits. In 1894 Burne-Jones was made a baronet. Ill-health again interrupted the progress of his works, chief among which was the vast Arthur in Avalon. In the winter following his death a second exhibition of his works was held at the New Gallery, and an exhibition of his drawings (including some of the charmingly humorous sketches made for children) at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.|$|E
