50|$|A {{report by}} UN {{investigator}} Paul Volcker released in October 2005 {{found that the}} Australian Wheat Board, later AWB Limited, was the biggest single source of kickbacks for the Iraqi government. In exchange for trouble-free disembarkation of wheat purchased under the Oil-for-Food Programme, the Australian Wheat Board paid 'trucking charges' totalling A$300 million to Alia. Alia is a real Jordanian trucking company, but one with {{no role in the}} distribution of Australian wheat in Iraq. Alia kept a small percentage of 'charges', and passed the remainder on to Saddam's government. The AWB was fully compensated for the charges by increases in the price paid; the payments were approved by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Australian Government <b>commissioned</b> <b>judge</b> Terence Cole to further investigate whether Australian companies had indeed paid kickbacks to the Saddam regime.
