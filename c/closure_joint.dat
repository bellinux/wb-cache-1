40|$|A {{boundary}} element {{model was}} developed for stress/stability analysis of underground excavations {{in the vicinity of}} faults. The boundary element formulation adopts the Fictitious Stress Method for the simulation of excavation boundaries and the Displacement Discontinuity Method for the representation of faults. With the assumption that deformations and stress changes can generally be attributed to the presence of faults rather than to elastoplasticity of the rock mass, the numerical model employed a linear elastic constitutive relation for the rock, and nonlinear behaviour for the fault. This assumption is particularly justified in hard rock environment. Following a comprehensive review of constitutive models for rock joints, both deformation and peak strength models were incorporated for modelling the mechanical behaviour of the fault. Deformation or stiffness models include Goodman's constant stiffness model and Barton-Bandis' nonlinear model. The latter, considers the effect {{of a wide range of}} parameters such as coupling between shear and normal stresses and displacement, joint <b>closure,</b> <b>joint</b> separation, hardening followed by postpeak or residual behaviour. Peak strength models include Mohr-Coulomb and Barton-Bandis which employs a mobilized nonlinear shear strength envelope. An incremental, in situ stress relaxation algorithm is developed and implemented for the nonlinear analysis of the faults. Model verification was done by a comparison of its predictions with previously published results found in the literature. The comparison showed excellent agreement. A model sensitivity analysis was then carried out to compare the response of different discontinuity models. A case study of an underground hard rock mine was conducted to examine the stability of a mining ore zone intersected by faults. A user friendly graphical interface was developed to help generate the data and interpret the output results more efficiently...|$|E
40|$|The final thesis {{will deal}} with an {{immersed}} tunnel design of 13. 37 km long based on the Flyland project, a project to expand Schiphol Airport on an artificial island (Flyland) in North Sea. Approximately 111 immersed tunnel elements {{will be needed to}} connect Flyland with an intermediate island between the Netherlands and Flyland itself, which each element consists of six segments of 20 m. In addition, the thesis will focus in the design for the deepest tunnel element (cross and longitudinal sections including the reinforcement and post-tensioning) of the project and later on remarks are given for other tunnel elements. Based on the technical criteria mentioned in the report such as the clearance gauge, number of the traffic lanes, width of the pedestrian/inspection lanes, area for the ballast concrete, area for the interior equipment (ventilations, lightings, and signs), area of the service galleries, area to put on the GINA gasket, and area to put on the pre-stressed cables, then we come up with three tubes of 7. 5 m and two service galleries of 1. 35 m. The cross sections of the tunnel it self eventually has height of 11. 2 m and width of 30. 8 m. The reinforcement in the tunnel element cross section will be designed in Indonesian code (SKSNI) by inserting several comparisons to NEN (Dutch Code) especially for the crack width control since there is no SKSNI crack width control parameter for the sea environment. The result shows that using the SKSNI (with steel yield stress of 400 MPa), the amount of reinforcement needed is 124 kg/m 3, which is in between the normal range of 110 - 130 kg/m 3 for the tunnel constructions in the Netherlands which normally use steel yield stress of 500 MPa. Meanwhile the density of reinforced concrete got is 24. 4 kg/m 3 (the density includes the post-tensioned cables) For the longitudinal direction, post-tensioned cables design is applied mainly to bond the segments together in one whole element during the phases from the fabrication until the end situation. Design of the maximum positive moment is achieved from the transport phase with 1. 5 meter cosinus wave (minimum design) and the maximum negative moment is taken from the transport phase without wave consideration (maximum design). Minimum compression stress of 0. 3 MPa is given as a parameter on the total cross section of the element. Hence, the cables needed are 29 tendons of strands 19 ol 5 7 (FeP 1860) which is distributed as follows: 11 cables in the roof and 18 cables in the floor. Eventually, total losses in the cables are calculated according to NEN 6720. Due to the importance of flexibility needed within the segments of 20 meters, the expansion joints are fixed-in between the tunnel segments. The main purpose to this joint is to withstand the tunnel movements and make a water tight layer. The principle, details, and the incoming problem for the expansion joint subjected to Flyland project have been brought out in this report. The element/unit joint are maintained firstly by the GINA gasket to get a temporary water seal. The GINA is then totally compressed by the horizontal water pressure after the room in between two elements is de-watered. Later on, omega seal as the main water seal will be put on. As the main water seal system, the service life time of the omega seal will be made twice of that for the tunnel itself. The details, the trial of the omega seal, and the incoming problems subjected to Flyland project are described in this report. In between the last immersed tunnel element and the "cut and cover" tunnel, there will be a final/closure joint. A new design of the final joint is ought to be in situ constructed, then a new developed final joint is brought up in the discussion. A collar around the cast in situ tunnel is developed to have dry circumstances during constructing the <b>closure</b> <b>joint</b> of the tunnel.

40|$|The {{persistent}} {{increase of}} container vessel dimensions requires ports to adapt their wet infrastructure {{in order to}} compete with their competitors. However, in some cases waterway tunnels are expected to restrict the maximum depth. The Beneluxtunnel in Rotterdam {{is an example of}} such a tunnel. To allow more depth, the possibility of lowering this tunnel is studied. The Beneluxtunnel consists of two immersed tunnels constructed in 1967 and 2002. They consist of prefabricated elements that are immersed and connected to land parts {{on either side of the}} waterway. To allow lowering, various design options have been proposed in this study: 9 ̆ 5 Regarding the land part, the options are proposed (1) to do nothing, (2) to make local adjustments utilizing the space provided by the dewatering cellar or (3) to apply general lowering which would affect the entire structure. 9 ̆ 5 Regarding the immersed part, the options are proposed (1) to adapt the river bottom, (2) to lower the elements while they remain immersed by utilizing the limited freedom of rotation in its joints or (3) to re-float the elements to be re-immersed on a lowered bed. 9 ̆ 5 Regarding traffic requirements, an option is to lower the maximum speed which would allow for steeper slopes. These options and their combinations have been analysed to determine their feasibility and value. To do so, first all aspects regarding the functional design are determined. The relations between traffic requirements and navigation channel dimensions have been determined, resulting in an overview of possible vertical profiles for all relevant design combinations. Apart from a first estimate of the effectivity of the design options, it also showed that the 1 st Beneluxtunnel is governing because of the shorter length of its immersed part. For the technical design, the design of the original tunnel is analysed and for some important aspects, the structural capacity has been determined. This information is used to determine the effects of lowering on the tunnel and to estimate the associated lowering capacity in terms of vertical displacement profiles. This analysis shows that for all realistic design options, the structural capacity is sufficient. Apart from the lowering, also the effects and limitations of joint rotations have been determined. Both for the segment joints and the immersion joints, the rubber water stops are critical in determining the maximum rotation. The applied rotations must however be less as additional settlement could increase them. The vertical profiles associated with these rotations show significant depth increase, ranging up to 4. 5 m. ? To determine the technical feasibility, the design must also be constructible. Hence, for four of the design options, the construction methods have been determined and proposed: 9 ̆ 5 To lower the immersed part while it remains immersed, the soil must be removed below the elements by special dredging equipment. Also the supporting tiles must be removed. The large longitudinal pressure is expected to allow this without supports. However, for the lowering process, applying pre-tensioning and temporary supports is required. Special components connected to the pre-tensioning should allow to control the lowering process. Finally, the soil can be returned and the tunnel can be finished. 9 ̆ 5 To re-float the elements, the <b>closure</b> <b>joint</b> must be re-opened. Next, the weight of the elements must be reduced by removing the ballast. Instead of re-floating it is chosen to lift the elements which allows better control of the process. The elements can now be transported to a location where they can be stored and adapted. When the bed is lowered and the land parts are finished, the elements can be re-immersed. 9 ̆ 5 To locally adjust the land part, access is required which requires for the connecting element to be removed and for a watertight screen to be placed. Next, the old transition point can be demolished and the new transition point can be constructed within the existing abutment, utilizing the space provided by the dewatering cellar. 9 ̆ 5 General lowering can be achieved by wet reconstruction. First, additional anchors have to be inserted in the walls. Next the land part can be flooded and the entire abutment and underwater concrete floor must be demolished. A new floor should be constructed at a few meters below, but first additional anchors must be inserted into the soil to provide vertical stability. Finally, water could be pumped out and everything could be reconstructed. Finally, the construction sequences are used to estimate the costs of the design options and their combinations. The results were combined with the maximum navigation depth increase to determine the most cost effective solution for different lowering ranges. Also the long and short term traffic costs (traffic jams) have been taken into account. The results are: Depth increase Land part Immersed part Costs (millions) 0. 0 - 0. 9 m Local adjustments on both sides Remain immersed 8 ̆ 0 295 0. 9 - 1. 9 m General lowering on one side Remain immersed 8 ̆ 0 415 1. 9 - 3. 2 m General lowering on both sides Remain immersed 8 ̆ 0 500 3. 2 - 3. 6 m General lowering on both sides Re-float 8 ̆ 0 665 > 3. 6 m New immersed tunnel 8 ̆ 0 730 This study has proven that lowering the Beneluxtunnel is technically feasible and a cost effective method to increase the navigation draught. ?Hydraulic structuresHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

These turnkey innovative designs are being introduced into a rapid renewal technique called Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC). ABC was developed under the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2), which targeted strategic solutions to improve several aspects of transportation including, safety, congestion, and renewal methods for roads and bridges. Prefabricated bridge elements and systems (PBES) is one technique often associated with ABC. It incorporates the use of prebuilt modules, which include part of the girder system and {{a portion of the}} bridge deck. One of the most critical components in a modular system are the closure pours required to connect each prefabricated module. High performance materials (HPM) such as Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) are often being used for the longitudinal connections today. The transverse <b>closure</b> <b>joints</b> are used over the piers and connect each adjacent module.

As the {{government is trying to}} cut its expenses and minimise wasteful activities and unnecessary spending within the NHS, every trust and every department or unit within the trust has now realised that it has to justify its existence and review its services to the public. More so, the on-going restructuring of the NHS has led to the closure of some hospitals and departments that are considered not fit for purpose. Meanwhile, the closure of certain hospitals or departments, especially the accident and emergency departments (A&E), have caused outrage among the general public who reside within the vicinities or catchment areas served by those departments. In some cases, this move is challenged in the courts of law forcing the government to rescind its decision and leave certain hospitals open after they have been marked for <b>closure.</b> The <b>joint</b> efforts of staff and patients of these hospitals and their determination to preserve these valuable institutions are paying off greatly. However, the same cannot be said about the mental health facilities within the NHS. This is probably because the services provided by mental health departments are not meant for every member of the public. The services are meant for those who have mental health issues. As a result of this, only those who are concerned with mental health issues advocate for their continuous existence and maintenance. The general public do not always speak out for them...|$|R
40|$|Background. Direct {{intra-articular}} {{injection of}} low doses of local anesthetic (IALA) after <b>closure</b> of the <b>joint</b> capsule remains controversial for pain control after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods. A retrospective study comparing patients receiving IALA with high doses (0. 5 % bupivacaine 60 [*]mL) of local anesthetics or FNB {{in addition to}} intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with opioids for pain management after TKA was conducted. The primary end point was to compare the analgesic efficacy and early ambulation between the two groups. Results. No {{significant differences between the}} two groups in pain intensity, cumulative opioid consumption, incidences of opioid-related side effects, the time interval from the end of operation to the first time the patient could walk assisted with a walker postoperatively, and postoperative hospital stay were identified. Three patients in the IALA group but none in the FNB group walked within 12 hours after the end of operation. Summary. IALA with high doses of local anesthetics provides comparable analgesic efficacy as single-shot FNB after TKA and might be associated with earlier ambulation than FNB postoperatively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} three decades in {{response}} to a rise in substance use in the region, many countries in East and Southeast Asia responded by establishing laws and policies that allowed for compulsory detention in the name of treatment for people who use drugs. These centers have recently come under international scrutiny with a call for their <b>closure</b> in a <b>Joint</b> Statement from United Nations entities in March 2012. The UN's response was a result of concern for human rights violations, including the lack of consent for treatment and due process protections for compulsory detention, the lack of general healthcare and evidence based drug dependency treatment and in some centers, of forced labor and physical and sexual abuse (United Nations, 2012). A few countries have responded to this call with evidence of an evolving response for community-based voluntary treatment; however progress is likely going to be hampered by existing laws and policies, the lack of skilled human resource and infrastructure to rapidly establish evidence based community treatment centers in place of these detention centers, pervasive stigmatization of people who use drugs and the ongoing tensions between the abstinence-based model of treatment as compared to harm reduction approaches in many of these affected countries...|$|R
40|$|Heterodont {{dentition}} sometimes including multicuspid crowns {{appeared in}} numerous fossil forms through all main lineages of the Crocodyliformes. Teeth in these complex dentitions frequently bear wear facets that are exclusive indicators of tooth-tooth occlusion. Besides, dental features, specialisations of the jaw apparatus, jaw adductors and mandibular movement can be recognised, all reflecting a high variability of jaw mechanism and of intraoral food processing. Comparative study {{of these features}} revealed four main types of jaw mechanism, some of which evolved independently in several lineages of Crocodyliformes. Isognathous orthal jaw <b>closure</b> (precise jaw <b>joint,</b> rough wear facets) is characteristic for heterodont protosuchians and all forms possessing crushing posterior teeth. Proal movement (protractive powerstroke) occurred independently in Malawisuchus and Chimaerasuchus {{is supported by the}} antagonistic, vertically oriented carinae. Developed external adductors are the main indicators of palinal movement (retractive powerstroke) that evolved at least two times in various South American taxa. The fourth type (in Iharkutosuchus) is characterised by lateromedial mandibular rotation supported by extensive horizontal wear facets. This evolutionary scenario resembles that of the masticatory system of mammals and suggests that the ecological roles of some mammalian groups in North America and Asia were occupied in Western Gondwana by highly specialised crocodyliforms...|$|R
