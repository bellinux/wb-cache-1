25|$|There are {{a variety}} of reasons that {{periphery}} countries remain the way they are. One important factor that keeps countries in the periphery is the lack of development of technology. Another way periphery countries come to be is either the lack of a central government or the periphery country is under the control of another country. Periphery countries are known for exporting raw goods to core countries. What tends to happen is the maximum gain a periphery nation could earn is less than needed to maintain an equilibrium between costs and revenues. One thing periphery nations <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to stop the increase of exports. At the beginning of the 19th century, Asia and Africa were considered periphery and their lack of development enabled the United States and Germany to remain successful core nations.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Daniel Handler {{said that}} [...] "a sequel {{does seem to}} be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few {{corporate}} shakeups, which has led to many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps." [...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an odd way, the best thing you <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now, I'm afraid I’m going to have to show you the real thing.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|A minor {{controversy}} arose over Silverman's {{performance in}} the documentary film The Aristocrats (2005). The film shows her doing the Aristocrats joke [...] a sample of transgressive art told by numerous comedians since the vaudeville era [...] like it was an autobiographical account of {{her life as a}} child sex performer. [...] As part of the routine, she mentions that Joe Franklin, a New York radio and TV personality whose nostalgic programs aired from the early 1950s until shortly before his death in 2015, would ask her to perform privately for him in his apartment. Silverman looks at the camera and, in a deadpan voice, accuses Franklin of raping her. The film was edited {{in such a way that}} it appears as if Franklin knows what Silverman said about him. Later, after her clip, Franklin is shown stating, [...] "Sarah Silverman is a young lady to watch." [...] After the film came out, Franklin took offense at Silverman's using his name in the routine and considered suing her. A month later, The New York Times noted he remained undecided but had said, [...] "The best thing I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> get Sarah better writers so she'd have funnier material." ...|$|E

Besides which, it's supposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up (as I was saying) that it would be better to let them be the way they are. In my view, this part of the thing is vastly exaggerate, and if I were you I would not wear two thoughts on it.

50|$|For an example, {{suppose that}} in the 2004 {{election}} the former Republican Pat Buchanan had again run for President under the Reform Party (as {{he did in the}} 2000 election). Suppose that supporters of the 2004 Republican candidate, George W. Bush, had set up vote pairing web sites so that Buchanan supporters from swing states in the United States (such as Ohio, where the Democrats and Republicans were in a close race) would get matched with Bush supporters in solidly Democrat states (such as Massachusetts). This was not actually done of course (since Buchanan did not run in 2004), but suppose that Republican supporters of George W. Bush had gotten concerned that Democratic supporters of John Kerry would try to sabotage these web sites or manipulate the election by posing as either Bush or Buchanan supporters. However, if such Democrats had done so, all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> pose as George W. Bush supporters in solidly Democratic states or as Buchanan supporters in swing states. In the former situation (Democrats posing as Bush supporters in solidly Democratic states such as Massachusetts), all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> trick Buchanan supporters in swing states to cast their vote for Bush—which would only hurt the Democratic candidate, John Kerry. Similarly, in the latter situation (Democrats posing as |Buchanan supporters in swing states), all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> trick Bush supporters in solidly Democrat states to vote for Buchanan—which wouldn't change the election since the Democrat candidate, John Kerry, would very likely carry those states anyway.|$|E
50|$|One {{can work}} through this same {{issue in the}} {{opposite}} political direction—where it actually was a concern of Democrats in the 2004 election. In the 2004 presidential election, votepair.org matched Democratic Party supporters of John Kerry in staunchly Republican states with third-party supporters in swing states (including Ralph Nader supporters, Libertarian Party supporters of Michael Badnarik, or Green Party supporters of David Cobb). A common question was whether Republican supporters of George W. Bush could manipulate the election by posing as John Kerry supporters or as third-party supporters. However, if such people had posed as third-party supporters in swing states, all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> trick John Kerry supporters in staunchly Republican states {{to vote for a}} third-party candidate—which wouldn't change the outcome of the election (since George W. Bush would win those states anyway). Similarly if such people had posed as John Kerry supporters in staunchly Republican states, all they <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> trick third-party supporters in swing states to vote for John Kerry—which would have politically hurt George W. Bush, not helped him.|$|E
