40|$|Until the {{eruption}} of the 2007 - 2008 international crisis, the decade was characterized by a high growth of credit - especially credit lines for consumption - and of GDP in {{a large part of}} the developed and developing worlds. By the end of the period, the process coincided with increasing inflationary pressures in several countries, which might suggest a potential relationship between <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> and inflation. To give an answer to this question, we have performed an econometric analysis using information on 30 countries, both developed and developing, for the period 1995 - 2007. Our findings reject this hypothesis unequivocally since they provide no evidence whatsoever of a relationship between these two variables.

40|$|In {{trying to}} explain the balance-of-payments and banking crises of 1994 - 95 that erupted in Mexico, {{observers}} have pointed to various effects of the substantial capital inflows {{that took place in}} the preceding half decade. It has been argued that these inflows contributed to rapid monetary growth, real appreciation of the peso, and the widening of Mexico's current account deficit. In addition, by making available <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> loans at a time when investment spending in Mexico was not yet ready to grow rapidly, these inflows may have contributed to the fall in Mexico's savings rate. This paper looks at the effect of capital flows on macroeconomic and financial variables in Mexico during the 1980 s and 1990 s and compares Mexico's experience with that of a cross-section of Pacific Basin countries. In particular, we attempt to gauge the effect of capital flows on money growth, interest rates, consumption and investment. We do find evidence of an independent effect of capital flow [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{contemporary}} research, it {{is common}} to measure growth-enhancing financial development by the volume of credit as a ratio {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP), an application of Schumpeter's theory of credit and development. Recently, researchers have been surprised to find a negative relation between this measure and economic growth. This paper has three aims. First, Schumpeter sharply distinguished between the volume of credit financing development and the (typically larger) volume of the 'secondary wave' of credit financing consumption, over-investment and speculation, which follows the 'primary wave' of credit financing innovations. Combined with circuit theory, this helps explain the growth and the effects of credit/GDP ratios in our time. Second, it is shown that an increase in the credit/GDP ratio is due to an increase in 'secondary wave' credit, not productive credit; and since credit is debt, growth in the credit/GDP ratio is negative, not positive for economic development. Third, five contemporary ways in which the use of <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption,</b> financial investment and speculation has been institutionalized are discussed. The message of this paper is that, as Schumpeter wrote, "distinction between debts according to purpose, however difficult to carry out, is always relevant to diagnosis and may be relevant to preventive policy"...|$|E

The research project focuses interest rates variations and the 1755 earthquake’s impacts, integrating these topics into a broader approach on the Portuguese economy in a time when colonial Brazil contributed to gold money inflows. This article presents the methodological procedures followed to build up a representative sample of short-term loans that form the database for this project and describes the first results of the study considering the uses of credit. First results assure the minor role played by investment, whereas the main use of loans was personal <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption.</b> An extremely large proportion of this category, however, referred to contracts for the acquisition of durable goods (including the building of urban properties). The importance of rollover and restructuring of debts is the unanticipated information these short-term loans provided, and the earthquake did not show up as affecting particularly this feature of the structure of credit. The destruction of capital nevertheless accounted for the need of building and improving residential capital, and for that reason organisational investment to rebuild urban stores and rural equipment reached some representativeness among the overall uses of credit between 1756 and 1780...|$|E

We also wish to thank When people cannot commit to pay back their loans and there is limited information about their characteristics, lending institutions must draw inferences about their likelihood of default. In this paper, we examine how this inference problem impacts consumption smoothing. In particular, we study an environment populated by two types of people who differ with respect to their rates of time preference and receive idiosyncratic earnings shocks. Impatient types are more likely to borrow and default than patient types. Lenders cannot directly observe a person’s type but make probabilistic assessments of it based on the person’s credit history.

The reform provides an exogenous increase in access to credit comparable to a year of disposable income or more for a considerable fraction of the households in the sample analyzed.

40|$|Is the U. S. {{trade deficit}} made in China? The {{short answer is}} no. In recent years U. S. {{bilateral}} trade deficits have been increasing not only with China but most other trading partners as well. The imbalance on bilateral trade with China, though large, still accounts for less than one-quarter of the total. However, official purchases of U. S. dollar assets by China and other U. S. trading partners have facilitated the continued high level of U. S. domestic spending, and some analysts believe that large foreign purchases of U. S. assets {{have been responsible for}} keeping U. S. long-term interest rates low. Like China-specific trade policies at the level of individual products, a stronger yuan may benefit other U. S. trading partners, especially ones that have recently lost market share due to depreciation of the U. S. dollar against their own currencies. But yuan appreciation also means lower Chinese official purchases of U. S. dollars, which would likely put upward pressure on U. S. interest rates and thus moderate domestic spending. So yuan appreciation could reduce the U. S. overall trade imbalance, although {{it is not necessary to}} address the fundamental cause of the deficit, which lies in current macroeconomic conditions at home. The United States government will have an urgent case of adopting prudent and traditional ways to obtain <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption,</b> else the threat of trade deficit will eventually go out of a hand and military blackmail and economic blackmail by China, deindustrialization and massive loss of jobs for American workers might be the end result.

40|$|The recent {{policy debate}} has {{emphasized}} micro-credit, but not micro-finance {{as one of}} the tools for poverty alleviation (see for example the Micro-Credit Summit in February 1997 in Washington, D. C). Improved access to credit is seen as a potent means for increasing the poor’s income. The role of <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> smoothing is rarely mentioned in meetings attended by staff from micro-enterprise or agricultural credit institutions, and savings services seem to be promoted simply for the sake of “mobilizing ” capital, disregarding their potential role for smoothing consumption. Except for few micro-finance institutions, the role of insurance for income and consumption smoothing is completely neglected. This paper seeks to assess the role of microfinance for income and consumption smoothing by the poor. In section 2, a conceptual framework is developed that distinguishes between credit, savings and insurance services, and identifies two principal pathways through which access to financial services can enhance income and smooth consumption. I further discuss how the demand for these services is expected to change with increasing level of poverty and risk exposure of the household or individual. In section 3, the types of risks faced by households are presented. I then highlight potential areas for product innovation by the micro-finance sector to address these risks. Section 4 discusses the potential and limits of micro-finance services in assisting households to cope with adverse shocks. This section also provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of innovations already implemented by selected microfinance institutions that seek to address the demand for financial services for smoothing income consumption. Section 5 concludes with policy recommendations for the design and implementation of micro-finance schemes that not only respond to the income and accumulation motive of households but also to their desire to safeguard their consumption of food and other basic needs via measures of income and consumption smoothing...|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} novel urban system {{equilibrium}} model for {{design of a}} tradable location tax credit scheme to balance traffic congestion and environmental externalities. In the proposed model, {{the interaction between the}} location tax credit scheme and households' residential location choices is explicitly considered. It is assumed that the authority initially allocates the credits to all households in a uniform way, and the households pay a certain amount of <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> housing <b>consumptions,</b> relying on the traffic congestion and environmental externalities that they cause. The credits are traded among households through a free market, and the tax revenue due to credit trading is considered as a part of household's income to be redistributed through household's income budget constraint. <b>For</b> a given <b>credit</b> scheme, households' residential location choices and housing market structure in terms of housing prices and space can be endogenously determined by the urban system equilibrium and the price per unit of credit is governed by the credit market equilibrium.

40|$|This article {{examines}} critically the dominant {{theory of the}} monetary transmission mechanisms. It shows that monetary policy has abandoned the money supply as the instrument for inflationary control {{in favor of the}} interest rate. Formed in the market of bank reserves, the basic interest rate represents the opportunity cost of capital, which makes it a variable that affects the value of real and financial assets, impacting the supply of money and credit and, through the "wealth effects" and the availability of <b>credit,</b> the demand <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> goods, housing and inventories fluctuations, which is the most important variable to explain economic downturns. It shows that the main effects of aggregate demand variations are felt through changes in real output and not in prices. Considering the success of cambial anchoring in curbing high inflation/hyperinflation and the failure of aggregate-demand-based stabilization programs, it concludes that perhaps the main channel through which changes in the interest rate affects the price level is the exchange rate, though the money supply still has a secondary role. ...|$|R

40|$|For many years, {{farmers in}} remote upland areas of {{northern}} Laos just produced rice for self consumption. The production surpluses were bartered against other consumption goods or {{sold in the}} market to get some cash. Beside, farmers traditionally planted secondary crops on sloping land such as cassava or maize to feed small livestock such as pig, duck, and chicken. At present, upland agriculture is in transition from subsistence to intensified commercialized production. The rapid expansion of hybrid maize crop illustrates this major shift, leading to increased farmers’ income and reduced poverty. However, current maize-based production systems may not be sustainable, neither ecologically nor economically. In 2009 and 2010, we studied the changes in landscapes and livelihood systems triggered by maize expansion in Xiengkhor district in Huaphan province and Kham and Nonghet districts in iengkhouang province. Since 2005, maize had spread in these districts pushed by government policies and investment in infrastructures and pulled by the growing Vietnamese market. The study showed that maize was adopted by all households, independently of their economic status. The landscapes mosaics have gradually homogenize as maize replaced upland rice shifting cultivation system {{at the bottom of}} the hill sides and then progressed upwards towards the hill tops. Economic analyzes showed that the rapid expansion of agricultural land devoted to maize was the main source of income increase. In Xiengkhor district, the absence of fallow or fertilization in permanent maize cropping system gradually leads to land degradation (fertility loss and soil erosion) and to yield decline. Farmers are conscious of this downwardtrend but did not find any alternative so far, as the cropping system is still profitable. In the two districts of Xieng Khouang province, the rapid mechanization of land preparation and use of herbicide prefigure the changes that may happen in Xiengkhor district in the coming years. Maize spread had a tremendous impact on the local communities, widening farmer’s differentiation and changing social networks in favor of powerful middlemen and traders. The widespread use of <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> or production and the high variations in commodity prices have changed their economic environment.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is in the}} domains of materialism, consumer vulnerability and consumption indebtedness, concepts frequently approached {{in the literature on}} consumer behavior, macro-marketing and economic psychology. The influence of materialism on consumer indebtedness is investigated within a context that is characterized by poverty and by factors that cause vulnerability, such as high interest rates, limited access to credit and to quality affordable goods. The objectives of this research are: to produce a materialism scale that is well adapted to its environment, characterizing materialism adequately for the population studied; to compare results obtained with results of other studies; and to measure the relationship between materialism, socio-demographic variables, attitude to debt and consumption indebtedness. The primary data used in the analyses were collected from field research carried out in August, 2005 that relied on a probabilistic household sample of 450 low income individuals who live in poor regions of the city of Sao Paulo. The materialism scale, adapted and translated into Portuguese from Richins (2004), proved to be very successful and encourages new work in the area. It was noted that younger adults tend to be more materialistic than older ones; that illiterate adults tend to be less materialistic than those who did literacy courses when they were already adults; and that gender, income and race are not associated with the materialism construct. Among the other results, a logistic regression model was developed in order to distinguish those individuals who have an installment plan payment booklet from those who do not, based on materialism, socio-demographic variables and purchasing and consumer habits. The proposed model confirms materialism as a behavioral variable useful for forecasting the probability of an individual getting into debt in order to consume, in some cases almost doubling the chance of occurrence of this event. Findings confirm the thesis that it is not only adverse economic factors that lead people to get into debt; and that the study of demand for <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> purposes must, of necessity, include variables of a psychological nature. It is suggested that the low income materialistic consumer experiences feelings of powerlessness and exclusion because of the gap that exists between their possessions and their desires. Lines of conduct to combat this marginalization from the consumer society are drawn targeting marketing professionals, public policy makers and vulnerability researchers. Finally, the possibility of new studies involving the materialism construct, which is central to literature on consumer behavior, albeit little used in empirical studies in Brazil, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The essay {{points out}} that {{over-indebtedness}} and its related issues regarding consumers protection cannot be tackled simply by public law regulations, nor by insolvency provisions alone, {{such as the ones}} contained in Law n. 3 / 2013 and in similar statutory instruments enacted in many European countries: contract law rules can help preventing over-indebtedness and also offer remedies once the debtor has become over-indebted. Nevertheless over-indebtedness challenges traditional contract law concepts and rules. Notably, with regard to prevention of over-indebtedness, the Italian legislator has failed to put in place specific remedies in case of non-performance of the “hybrid” duties, to assist the borrowers and to assess their creditworthiness, which have been set on lenders by the Directives on <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumption</b> purposes and mortgage credit; at the same time, the provisions on standard unfair contract terms, usury and late payment interest do not suffice to protect debtors from the risk of over-indebtedness: those rules address only certain types of harmful conducts by lenders and, in order to be applied to a wider range of cases, they need to be complemented by the principle that compels the creditor to exercise his rights and defenses in conformity with good faith and that forbids any abus du droit (Article 1175 Italian Civil Code). Moreover, traditional contract law remedies do not offer an effective protection in case of bounded rationality of the borrower or exploitation by the lender of the consumer’s information asymmetry or economic distress. Once the condition of over-indebtedness has occurred, the unforeseeable events causing the difficulty or inability to repay (financial hardship) do not excuse the debtor in case of breach of contract under the rules on general obligations. In order to cure the problem, {{in the context of the}} specific relationship between creditor and debtor, the adjustment of the contract’s terms can be regarded as the most effective remedy: the debtor is entitled to the modification of the contract terms under the principle of good faith. Conclusively, the Author argues that insolvency law remedies – discharge among them – should be seen as a last resort means of protection, a form of social insurance, applicable in case of failure of all other remedies. The insolvency perspective is indeed aimed at tackling a social problem, while, on the contrary, the implications of the relationship between the borrower and the lender should be addressed at an earlier stage, by the rules on credit contracts supplemented by the general principles of contract law...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{empowerment}} of women {{is crucial to the}} process of development of any community. Though women constitute almost half of our population and {{play a vital role in}} every sphere of life, their importance is not properly recognized by the society. They are generally suppressed and enjoy limited access to different fields of life, such as, education, society, culture, politics, business and so on. But a nation can not achieve all round development if women are not given equal opportunity of development with their male counterparts. A society moves when women move. Thus, the social status of women is a reliable indicator to assess the development of the society. It can be said that status of women is intimately connected with their economic position, which in turn depends on opportunities to participate in economic activities. SHGs provide women an avenue to participate in economic activities. It gives women an easy access to credit. The members of SHG meet regularly and save an amount of money in a joint account of the group which can be used as a revolving fund to provide <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the <b>consumption</b> and production purposes. Sometimes, Bank also gives loans with minimum interest to these groups and as a result the SHG members can take money from that Bank loan at very low interest rate which in turn helps women to establish microenterprises and meet the crisis situations.
