50|$|William Sterling {{went down}} to Melbourne to produce the play in September and October. It {{involved}} seven weeks of preparation, three weeks of rehearsals and two days of <b>camera</b> <b>rehearsals</b> before it was telecast, and filmed for Sydney TV. Judith Godden was in holiday in Melbourne when cast. Robert Peach was a compere of C.M.F. entertainment units in Melbourne.|$|R

5|$|Each {{episode was}} rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with <b>camera</b> <b>rehearsals</b> taking place {{all day on}} Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then {{transmitted}} live—with a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot {{before and during the}} rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It {{was one of the last}} major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.|$|R
50|$|On {{the day of}} the taping, Angell {{spent the}} morning at his hotel going through the sketch with Hancock, trying to reassure and relax him, then she left for the studio. Hancock arrived at the studio during rehearsals, but {{when it came time for}} his final <b>camera</b> <b>rehearsal,</b> he had {{disappeared}} and he remained missing for four days; in the event he had to be hastily replaced by actor Johnny Lockwood. Several months after his aborted Mavis appearance, Hancock took his own life in his Sydney apartment.|$|E

5000|$|... "Normally {{after the}} seventh and final day of rehearsal, the cast and {{production}} team would travel to Birmingham to check into their hotel and digs," [...] recalled assistant floor manager David Tilley. [...] "The production team would meet in the studio that evening to see what state the studio was in. We'd need to check that the set building had been completed and if the sets were dressed ready for camera rehearsals to start the next day. The good thing about using the Birmingham studio {{was that they were}} excellent in design and set building. I liked working there, and they had terrific pride in All Creatures. The first day — in this case the Sunday — the cameras, sound, lighting, designers, scenery changes and action properties, costume and makeup rehearsed all the scenes technically. On the second day, <b>camera</b> <b>rehearsal</b> continued in the morning. After lunch, all five cameras were synchronised and the recording commenced on scenes that had already been rehearsed. We also allowed for discontinuous recording with breaks between scenes. Earlier in the 1970s, programmes were recorded continuously with very few breaks, but by this time two-machine editing had been established using two-inch-wide tapes. All the 16mm film inserts had also been transferred to videotape. The sequences could be seen on monitors in the studio during breaks in recording, which allowed the cast, designers and production team to check for continuity from scenes filmed months before so that they could match the studio scenes." ...|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} {{predominantly}} live from Studio 1 of the BBC's Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday to Saturday, usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with <b>camera</b> <b>rehearsals</b> {{in the morning}} and afternoon of transmission. Not every scene was live; a significant amount of material was on 35 mm film and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set on location or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at Ealing Studios, acquired by the BBC in 1955, where Cartier worked with the cinematographer A. A. Englander. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological dig at Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed {{that would not have been}} possible in an all-live production.|$|R
5000|$|Tinker {{joined the}} cast of Friday Night Lights in September 2009 playing Dallas Tinker, a small town {{football}} player. He had initially gone to the shoot to support two of his friends who had landed work as extras on the show, taking the bus with them from Houston to Austin. He met the show's executive producer, Peter Berg, who was directing the episode being filmed, and unexpectedly found himself acting in a scene {{with two of the}} show's regulars. The series was filmed using three <b>cameras,</b> without <b>rehearsal</b> and without extensive blocking, and Tinker later recalled, [...] "It was cameras up, let's go. I did it, and he liked it." [...] Two days later, the plans for the show's fourth season were being adjusted to include a new character, Dallas. He was a recurring character for that season, and for the final, fifth one.|$|R
5000|$|The 3 hour-plus {{event was}} shot on 16mm film with {{multiple}} cameras. Director Jopson prepared {{by studying the}} music from various live recordings, and then, consulting with producer Tammara Wells plus director of photography Martin Pitts and camera operators Ernest Dickerson, Paul Goldsmith and Don Lenser, determined the <b>camera</b> positions. During <b>rehearsals</b> Pitts and long-time associate Lou Tobin designed the lighting for show. The lighting team was joined by the crew from Chorus Line which had just closed on Broadway. The film {{is known for its}} intimate close-ups of the musicians, showing their subtle signals to each other and acknowledgment of well-played riffs. The recording was engineered by Mike Moran and David Hewitt with Remote Recording Service's Silver Truck.A four-LP box set One Night with Blue Note Preserved featuring the entire concert was released simultaneously with the film and as separate volumes [...]|$|R
