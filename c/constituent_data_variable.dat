Using ontological and epistemological positions to develop three research paradigms, and applying these paradigms to various uptakes of grounded theory demonstrates differences in the definition of emergence. Discovery emergence is presented as a unidirectional relationship between the <b>constituent</b> parts (<b>data)</b> and the emergent property (theory) observed by an external postpositivist grounded theorist. Mechanistic emergence is presented as having a bidirectional relationship between the <b>constituent</b> part (<b>data)</b> and the emergent property (theory) observed by an external constructionist grounded theorist.

30|$|While Nagel et al. have {{advanced}} {{the project in}} terms of temporal and aural dimensions, the use of 3 D scatterplots provides the base for the overall data representation. Scatterplots map three <b>data</b> <b>variables</b> to X, Y and Z coordinates to produce 3 D terrain-like visualizations that are described as ‘macro DV’. These data terrains are contrasted with ‘micro DV’, the mapping of other variables to geometric shapes aligned with the scatterplot. These shapes also have movement and dynamic colour properties that add additional layers of <b>data</b> <b>variables.</b> In discussion of their trials Nagel et al. report up to 10 quantifiable <b>data</b> <b>variables,</b> with three assigned to the macro DV (x, y, z coordinates) and the seven other variables that are mix of different shapes, color, orientation and sound. In conclusion, they report that VDM in VR does “help in discovering remarkable nonlinear data relations and substructures” [22].|$|R

An algebraic relation between two variables defines a nonsingular projective curve. Our understanding starts with moduli of curves.

That <b>data</b> <b>variable</b> eventually drags us into deeper, less personal territory. Abel, Galois and Riemann knew that; though some versions of algebraic geometry from the late 1970 s lost it.
