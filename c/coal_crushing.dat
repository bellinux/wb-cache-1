40|$|Coal {{moisture}} control (CMC) in coking process, which reduces coal moisture before loading the coal into the coke oven, allows substantial reduction in coking energy consumption and increase in coke productivity. The technology {{is seeking to}} integrate the coal classification, thus calling it the coal classifying {{moisture control}} (CCMC), to separate the fine and coarse coal fractions in the CMC process so that the downstream <b>coal</b> <b>crushing</b> can only treat the coarse fraction. CCMC adopts a reactor that integrates a fluidized bottom section and a pneumatic conveying top section. The present work investigates the pneumatic classification behavior in a laboratory CCMC reactor with such a configuration by removing the coal fraction below a given size (e. g., 3. 0 mm) from a 0 to 20. 0 mm coal feed. The {{results show that the}} coal classification were dominated by the gas velocity in the top conveying section, and the required gas velocity for ensuring the maximal degree of removing a fine coal fraction could be roughly predicted by the Richardson and Zaki equation.

The handling of this fuel is a great job. To handle the fuel, i. e., coal, each power station is equipped with a coal handling plant. Maintenance of Critical Equipments for Coal Handling Plants (CHP) of Thermal Power Stations is typical job. The failures of these equipments have led to high maintenance and operation costs. The reason for inspection depends on the component and its effect on plant operation. But one of the main systems of thermal power plant is coal-handling system.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{variation}} of the pressure relief scope and the stress around hydraulic flushing borehole, the theory of coal-rock damage was utilized to distinguish the interaction area of water-jet and coal-rock into the coal-rock crushing area, the water-jet pressure stagnation area, the transition area and the original stress recovery area of coal-rock. Based on the actual occurrence conditions of the coal seam, the pressure variation and relief scope around the hydraulic flushing borehole were analyzed and simulated by RFPA 2 D-Flow software. The results showed that a relief area with the radius of 5. 0 ~ 6. 0 m around the borehole formed due to the hydraulic flushing with the pressure relief of 0. 038 ~ 6. 545 MPa, and the maximum principal stress is 15. 85 MPa with a distance of 6. 8 m from the inspected hole where stress concentration appeared.

40|$|Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) is a sagebrushobligate {{species that}} has {{experienced}} species-wide declines in population density and distribution. Sage-grouse habitats support human-related needs including domestic livestock grazing, urban development, and energy extraction. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service identified energy extraction as a range-wide sage-grouse conservation threat. Mining {{has been of}} specific concern because of observed sage-grouse population declines and impaired habitat within {{close proximity to the}} activity. Mining may be particularly problematic for small, isolated sage-grouse populations. In southwestern Utah, proactive habitat improvements and predator management have been implemented to mitigate the potential effects of surface mining on the southernmost population of sage-grouse in the United States. We evaluated sage-grouse lek attendance trends before (1991 – 2010) and during (2011 – 2016) mining on a lek located near the mine (Sink Valley lek) to assess population responses to coal mining and related mitigation activities. Changes in lek trends have been demonstrated as a valid metric to assess the effects of conservation actions on sage-grouse populations. We used a paired t-test to compare differences in male lek attendance before and during mining and analysis of variance to determine if sage-grouse densities and distance to mining changed during the mining period. We recorded bird coordinate location and the number of birds observed at each sighting location along 10 transects within the study site area. Differences in location from mining was tested using Analysis of Variance with α 3 ̆c 0. 5. There was no difference in the number of males attending the Sink Valley lek before and during mining. Population cycles were consistent over the time period sampled. With the exception of 2013, which had an unusually high number of sage-grouse found within the Sink Valley area, there were no differences in the number of birds observed at each sighting location in relation to the mine center (P = 0. 37), the <b>coal</b> <b>crushing</b> facility (P = 0. 34), and the mine boundary (P = 0. 24). Coupled with ongoing mitigation activities including habitat restoration, pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis, Juniperus osteosperma) removal, aggressive predator control, pre-mining acclimation to human influences, and removal of pinyon-juniper woodlands, surface coal mining had no negative effect on population cycles in the Alton/Sink Valley area...|$|E
40|$|Airborne dust {{generation}} {{is one of}} the byproducts of coal mining, processing, and handling. The amount of airborne total dust (ATD, respirable size and larger) and airborne respirable dust (ARD) generated is of primary interest for designing the level of engineering controls needed for adequate dust abatement. Laboratory crushing experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel with a roll crusher to identify relationships among crushing parameters, product size, coal rank properties, and airborne dust generation. Through the first series of experiments, the effect of primary and secondary breakage processes on both product size and airborne dust generation was examined. Through a second series of experiments, the effect of coal rank properties on product size and airborne dust generation was studied using a uniform crushing process with secondary breakage. Laboratory results indicate that secondary breakage of a particular coal notably increases the specific amount of ATD generated, while negligibly impacting the specific amount of ARD generated. A strong positive relationship was identified between the specific amounts of ATD and ARD generated during the primary breakage process (with minimal secondary breakage), but a negligible relationship was observed between the same two variables when secondary breakage was introduced into the crushing process. This indicates that most of the ATD and ARD is generated from the primary breakage, while secondary breakage has a more of an influence on generating additional amounts of larger sized ATD. Additional experiments involving the uniform crushing of eight different bituminous coals showed that the coal rank, expressed as the inherent moist fuel ratio (MFR = fixed carbon =(volatile x inherent moisture)), had diverse relationships between the product size created and the amount of airborne dust generated. As bituminous coal rank or MFR increased, the amount of coal product fines < 250 gm increased while the mass percentage of ATD and ARD liberated from these < 250 25 m product fines decreased. Air dry loss (ADL) moisture in the coal was found to be inversely related to the dust cloud electrostatic field, influencing dust liberation from the coal product fines. Since the MFR was directly related to the dust cloud electrostatic field, opposite the ADL-electrostatic field relationship, the diverse relationships between the product size created and the amount of dust liberated from the < 250 25 m product fines were explained. Finally, 12 to 14 times more ATD was generated as compared to the ARD generated during these experiments. These results should provide a fundamental basis for initial estimation of the airborne dust loading requirements of engineering control methods for <b>coal</b> <b>crushing...</b>|$|E

40|$|Gas {{release from}} the <b>crushed</b> <b>coal</b> {{formation}} during coal mining {{poses a threat to}} the normal storage and gas transport within coal seam. This sort of release is largely related with the evolution of gas seepage properties of <b>crushed</b> <b>coal,</b> namely, the evolution of gas seepage properties {{plays an important role in}} the gas extraction and the outburst prevention of coal seam. Meanwhile, the evolution is directly related to the volume and geometry of fractures within the <b>crushed</b> <b>coal</b> and strongly influenced by particle size and porosity (axial displacement). In order to investigate the effect, a gas flow apparatus connecting with the MTS 815. 02 system was designed. The gas seepage properties of <b>crushed</b> <b>coal</b> specimens with five particle sizes of a (2. 5 – 5 mm), b (5 – 10 mm), c (10 – 15 mm), d (15 – 20 mm) and e (mixed sizes) under the variable axial displacement of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 mm, respectively are measured by the revised MTS 815. 02 system. The results of test show that: The porosity decreases with the increase of axial displacement and the weight loss of larger particle size, respectively. Particle crushing during compaction is a main reason to increase small-size and emerge size 0 – 2. 5 mm. Gas flow seepage properties of <b>crushed</b> <b>coal</b> are found to be strongly influenced by particle size and axial displacement.

The seepage properties of <b>crushed</b> <b>coal</b> are not only related to particle size, loading levels (axial displacement), but also the compound mode.
