40|$|Abstract: Since Tysk et al’s {{pioneering}} {{analysis of}} the Swedish twin registry, twin and family studies continue to support a strong genetic basis of the inflammatory bowel diseases. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritability</b> for siblings of inflammatory bowel disease probands is 25 to 42 for Crohn’s disease and 4 to 15 for ulcerative colitis. Heritability estimates for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis from pooled twin studies are 0. 75 and 0. 67, respectively. However, this {{is at odds with}} the much lower heritability estimates from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). This “missing heritability ” is likely due to shortfalls in both family studies and GWAS. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritability</b> fails to account for familial shared environment. Heritability calculations from twin data are based on Falconer’s method, with premises that are increasingly understood to be flawed. GWAS based heritability estimates may underestimate heritability due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium, and because some single nucleotide polypeptides (SNPs) do not reach a level of significance to allow detection. SNPs missed by GWAS include common SNPs with low penetrance and rare SNPs with high penetrance. All methods of heritability estimation regard genetic and environmental variance as separate entities, although it is now understood that there is a complex multidirectional interplay between genetic are environmental factors mediated by the microbiota, the epigenome, and the innate and acquired immune systems. Due to the limitations of heritability estimates, it is unlikely that a true value for heritability will be reached. Further work aimed at quantifying the variance explained across GWAS, epigenome-wide, and microbiota-wide association studies will help to define factors leading to inflammatory bowel disease.

40|$|Purpose. To reveal {{breeding}} and genetic peculiarities of modern spring barley varieties for the “number of grains per main ear” trait and identify genetic sources of increased combining ability for involving in hybridization. Methods. Investigations {{were carried out}} at the V. M. Remeslo Myronivka Institute of Wheat of NAAS of Ukraine. Modern varieties of domestic (‘Virazh’, ‘Talisman Myronivskyi’, ‘Komandor’) and foreign (‘KWS Aliciana’, ‘KWS Bambina’, ‘Zhana’, ‘Explorer’) breeding were involved in crossing for a full (7 ´ 7) diallel scheme. Parents and F 1 were studied in field conditions during 2014 – 2016. Results. The analysis of variance of combining ability has shown a significant advantage in varying of general combining ability (GCA) effects. The mean square of specific combining ability (SCA) was significantly less than the GCA, but reliable throughout the years. The reciprocal effect was reliable only in 2014. Stably high effects of GCA during all years of investigations were noted in the varieties ‘KWS Aliciana’ (1. 18 – 1. 62) and ‘Virazh’ (1. 33 – 1. 48). The variety ‘KWS Bambina’ was characterized by lower but reliable positive effects of GCA (0. 43 – 0. 99) as compared to mentioned above. Non-allelic gene interaction was not found, that allowed to calculate the basic parameters of genetic variation. During all years of investigations, dominant effects of genes (H 1 and H 2) prevailed over the additive (D) ones in phenotypic expression of grain number per main ear. Mean degree of dominance in the experiment (H 1 /D) has shown overdominance. The same pattern was also distinctive for the index of mean degree of dominance in the loci. The dominance was reliably directed. Dominant effects of genes increased grain content, and recessive ones reduced it. At least 3 – 4 genes (groups of genes) have been revealed which determined the effects of dominance. At the same time, recessive genes (F< 0) or gene effects were prevailed quantitatively in the varieties investigated. A high <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritability</b> in broad sense (H 2 = 0. 98) has shown a significant determination of phenotypic variability with genetic factors. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritability</b> in narrow sense (h 2 = 0. 66 – 0. 68) confirmed that despite the advantage of dominant effects over the additive ones, {{the contribution of the}} latter was also significant. Conclusions. The prevalence of dominant effects of genes in the phenotypic expression of the number of grains per main ear causes the need for sufficient sample size of hybrid material and points to the expediency of conducting a more “rigid” selection for phenotype in later generations. At the same time, the considerable contribution of additive effects and high values of heritability indices give reason to predict the efficiency of selections aimed at increasing the trait in created hybrid material. The varieties ‘Virazh’, ‘KWS Aliciana’, ‘KWS Bambina’ should be used as effective genetic sources to increase grain content in combination breeding...|$|E

The {{objectives of the}} present work were directed towards the study of genetic: variablilty In seven maize populations with a broad genetic base, {{as a guide for}} population improvement. The field evaluation was conducted in completely randomized blocks, at one location (Anhembi, Sao Paulo state) with different groups, of S(1) families Obtained from seven populations (GO-D: dent type, GO-F: flint type, GO-L: long car, GO-G: thick Car; and composites G 3, G 4 and GO-S). Estimates were obtained for genetic variance (progeny mean basis), phenotypic variance of families means, and <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritability</b> (broad sense) for progeny means. Estimates of heritability were high for Car weight (0, 89 to 0. 94), car length (0. 77 to 0. 88) and car diameter (0. 77 to 0. 92); and lower for plant height (0. 58 to 0. 80) and Car height (0. 54 to 0. 84), thus showing the high Potential of the populations for recurrent selection based oil S, families. Ear yield in the base populations used as controls varied front 11, 200 kg ha(- 1) (GO-D) to 12, 800 kg ha(- 1) (G 3). The means of S(1) families varied from 6, 070 kg ha(- 1) (GO-F) to 7, 380 kg ha(- 1) (G 4); the Inbreeding depression in S(1) Families varied front 37. 5 % (G 4) to 48. 0 % (G 3) relative to the non-inbred population...|$|E

Two composite populations named RPM (Resistant to P. maydis) and RET (Resistant to E. turcicum) were synthesized after recombination of 46 and 34 accesses, respectively. After {{two generations of}} recombination, a sample of 300 open pollinated ears (half-sib families) was chosen from each population. Families {{were evaluated}} in Anhembi (SP) in the 1999 / 00 season in six experiments with 50 families representing each population. The hybrid Master (Novartis Seeds) was used as check. The additive genetic variance (2 A) and the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritability</b> (2 F h) were estimated for ear yield, plant height and ear height. Mean yield of the RPM composite was 5. 707 t ha- 1 (77 % of the hybrid check). Plant and ear height means were 19. 4 % and 36. 3 % higher than check. Parameters of variability were high with estimates of 2 A and 2 F h of 554. 73 (g/pl) 2 and 0. 58, respectively. Mean yield of the RET composite was 4. 393 t ha- 1 (56. 7 % of the hybrid check).

The terms "type of tumover" and "type of deposition" embody two extremes of food energy preferably for milk production or for body composition. Insulin plays an outstanding role based on its central position in energetic metabolism. The function of insulin may be recorded {{by means of the}} intravenous glucose tolerance test (GTT). The reaction of insulin and glucose was investigated after infusion of 1 g Glucose/kg 075 because of the probable genetic determination of the reactive ability. The <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>heritability</b> range from h 2 = 0. 16 + 0. 10 to h 2 = 0. 28 ± 0. 16.
