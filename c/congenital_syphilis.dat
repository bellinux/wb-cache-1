The mercury would accumulate in the goats' milk and was passed into the syphilitic babies when they suckled at the goats' teats. This method did have some effect of improving the infants' mortality rates, though the goats tended to die prematurely of mercury poisoning.|$|E

500|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} {{caused by}} environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia {{is a condition}} in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate. This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency {{than the rest of the}} tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, <b>congenital</b> <b>syphilis),</b> undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. [...] Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad. Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.|$|E

Early prediction of syphilis is therefore of great importance for heath planning and management. In this paper, we analyzed surveillance time series data for primary, secondary, tertiary, <b>congenital</b> and latent <b>syphilis</b> in mainland China from 2005 to 2012. Seasonality and long-term trend were explored with decomposition methods. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) was used to fit a univariate time series model of syphilis incidence. A separate multi-variable time series for each syphilis type was also tested using an autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables (ARIMAX). The syphilis incidence rates have increased three-fold from 2005 to 2012. All syphilis time series showed strong seasonality and increasing long-term trend. Both ARIMA and ARIMAX models fitted and estimated syphilis incidence well. All univariate time series showed highest goodness-of-fit results with the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) ×(0, 1, 1) model. Time series analysis was an effective tool for modelling the historical and future incidence of syphilis in China. The ARIMAX model showed superior performance than the ARIMA model for the modelling of syphilis incidence.

Methods: This is a retrospective study reviewing the medical records of patients diagnosed with ocular inflammation between January 2012 and June 2014 at a tertiary referral center in Turkey. Ocular syphilis was diagnosed {{on the basis of}} non-treponemal and treponemal antibody tests, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. All the patients diagnosed with ocular syphilis were tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes. Results: A total of 1, 115 patients were evaluated between January 2012 and June 2014, and 12  patients (1. 07 %) were diagnosed with ocular syphilis based on the inclusion criteria. None of the patients were seropositive for HIV. Two patients were seropositive for T. gondii-specific IgG. Clinical presentations include non-necrotizing anterior scleritis, non-necrotizing sclerokeratitis, anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, panuveitis, and optic neuritis. All of the patients showed clinical improvement in the level of ocular inflammation with intravenous penicillin 24 million U/day for 10 days. Three patients received additional oral methotrexate as an adjunctive therapy. Two cases received low-dose trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. Conclusion: Ocular syphilis is an uncommon cause of ocular inflammation in HIV-negative patients. Central retinochoroiditis is the most common ocular manifestation, and it is {{the most common cause of}} visual impairment. Ocular syphilis might present associated with co-infections such as T. gondii in developing countries.

Serum samples from 180 people, 109 with various stages of untreated syphilis, 45 with treated syphilis, and 26 non-infected, were investigated. In all diagnostic groups of syphilis the reactivity of the IgM capture ELISA {{was similar to that}} of the 19 S(IgM) FTA-ABS test except in untreated neurosyphilis, for which the IgM capture ELISA was significantly less sensitive. The IgM capture ELISA was very sensitive in congenital (100 %, 5 / 5) and primary (82 %, 18 / 22) syphilis, but less sensitive in secondary (60 %, 12 / 20), latent (53 %, 16 / 30), neurosyphilis (34 %, 11 / 32), and treated (11 %, 5 / 45) syphilis. False positive IgM capture ELISA results were not found in five people who gave false positive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) reactions or in 21 neonates born to mothers adequately treated for syphilis before or during pregnancy. This indicated that the IgM capture ELISA was very specific. The course of antitreponemal IgM reactivity after treatment of early infectious syphilis was followed up in six patients. The quantity of IgM antibody declined in nearly all patients after treatment, but still remained detectable in five patients up to six months after treatment. In contrast, non-treponemal antibodies measured by the VDRL test disappeared in four out of six patients within five months from starting treatment. In conclusion, the IgM capture ELISA may be useful for easy and sensitive detection of IgM antibodies to treponemes in patients with <b>congenital</b> and primary <b>syphilis.</b> A positive test result in these cases indicates that patients should receive treatment if they have not been treated recently.

40|$|RETRO-CORNEAL hyaline bands {{may occur}} as {{congenital}} abnormalities or as a resuilt of compression {{of the globe}} following birth trauma, {{and they are not}} uncommon in longstanding cases of iridocyclitis due chiefly to syphilis or tuberculosis. Lehmann (1927) in a comprehensive review of 103 cases of interstitial keratitis, stated that 17 - 5 per cent. cases showed these bands; in 88 there was definitely <b>congenital</b> or acquired <b>syphilis,</b> and the remaining ten had tuberculosis. The bands were demonstrable only in the first eye to be affected. They were caused by a rupture of Descemet's membrane because of deep infiltration of the cornea, by the formation of folds after the recession of the corneal swelling, or by a deposition of fibrin {{on the back of the}} cornea as a result of exudation from the iris. Case Report A married woman aged 27 has been under observation since the age of 12 years. She first attended in 1937 with an inflamed left eye and subsequent inflammation of the right eye. A diagnosis of interstitial keratitis was made and she was admitted for a course of anti-specific treatment. The serological reaction in 1937 was Wassermann reaction++, Kahn test positive. These tests were negative in 1952. The inflammation in the right eye recurred in 1945 and 1952. Past History. -In 1942, she was an in-patient for 12 months in a sanatorium for tubercu-losis of the left lung. She had a phrenic crush and artificial pneumothorax.

Foram selecionados 125 neonatos no Centro de Atenção Integral à Saúde da Mulher da UNICAMP, obedecendo aos critérios de inclusão: neonatos cujos pais ou responsáveis legais que assinaram o Termo de Consentimento Informado; que não necessitaram de cuidados especiais; com idade gestacional entre 37 e 41 semanas; com avaliação no 1 º, 2 º, 3 º e 6 º, 9 º e 12 º meses. Foram excluídos neonatos com infecção congênita, malformações diagnosticadas no período {{neonatal}} e aqueles resultantes de gestação múltipla. A casuística, composta por 95 lactentes que compareceram para pelo menos uma avaliação programada no 1 º ano de vida, foi dividida em dois grupos de acordo com a adequação peso/idade gestacional: grupo PIG, constituído por 33 lactentes com peso ao nascimento abaixo do percentil 10 e grupo AIG por 62 lactentes com peso entre o percentil 10 e 90 da curva de crescimento fetal de Battaglia e Lubchenco (1967). Foram utilizadas as Escalas Bayley de Desenvolvimento Infantil II (1993), aplicadas no 1 º, 2 º, 3 º, 6 º, 9 º e 12 º meses de vida, no Laboratório de Estudos do Desenvolvimento Infantil I. Para a análise de resultados, a casuística do grupo PIG foi reagrupada de acordo com a proporcionalidade corporal ao nascimento em: PIG com crescimento intra-uterino simétrico (PIG-S) e PIG com crescimento intra-uterino assimétrico (PIG-A). Os grupos não apresentaram diferenças na performance nas escalas mental e motora quando classificados em inadequados (Index Score < 85) (IS) e adequados (IS = 85). O grupo PIG apresentou pontuações menores de IS na escala mental nas avaliações do primeiro semestre, sendo que esses resultados foram influenciados pelo grupo PIG-S. No entanto, não houve diferenças estatisticamente significativas em nenhum dos meses analisados. Na escala motora, o grupo PIG apresentou médias menores no 2 º e no 12 º meses (p = 0, 008 e 0, 046 Teste Mann-Whitney, respectivamente); e o grupo PIG-S no 2 º mês (p = 0, 016 Teste Kruskal Wallis). Considerando-se a Escala de Classificação do Comportamento (ECC), observou-se risco de associação à performance inadequada 5, 19 vezes maior no grupo PIG (IC 95 %: 1, 03 - 29, 12) no 2 º mês de vida. Quando classificados pela proporcionalidade corporal ao nascimento, observou-se risco de associação à performance inadequada 8, 39 vezes maior no grupo PIG-S (IC 95 %: 1, 53 - 57, 40) no 2 º mês e risco 22, 0 vezes maior no grupo PIG-A no 3 º mês na ECC. Considerando o perímetro craniano ao nascimento, o lactente nascido com microcefalia apresentou maior proporção com performance inadequada no 1 º mês de vida (p = 0, 011 Teste Exato de Fisher). Não foram observadas associações na análise univariada considerando-se a associação entre as variáveis biológicas e as relacionadas às condições sócio-demográficas com as performances mental e motora nos meses analisados. No estudo evolutivo comparando-se os resultados obtidos no primeiro semestre e no 9 º mês com os resultados do 12 º mês observou-se que, em grande proporção, os lactentes que apresentaram performance inadequada nas primeiras três avaliações apresentaram recuperação no 12 º mês; os lactentes com performance inadequada no 6 º e no 9 º mês mantiveram-se inadequados no 12 º mês. Intrauterine malnutrition {{has been}} associated to long-term neurological morbidity and the small for gestational age infant is considered {{as a model for}} study this propose. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the neurodevelopmental indicators according to Bayley Scales of Infant Development of full-term small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants compared with those born appropriate for gestational age (AGA), in the first year of life. The research design was a prospective study of two cohorts, one of full-term SGA group and other of control AGA group; with cross-sectional data analysis. A hundred and twenty five full-term neonates were selected at Neonatology Service in the Center of Integral Attention to the Woman's Health (CAISM) of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), São Paulo, Brazil. Ethical permission was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of UNICAMP and the parents also gave the fully informed consent. They were selected on the following criteria: subjects living in the metropolitan area of Campinas; neonates considered in good health for going home within 2 days after birth; gestational age categorized as full-term (37 - 41 weeks) by Capurro postnatal method; expected birth weight for determined gestational age by Battaglia and Lubchenco method; birth weight less than the 10 th percentile for the SGA group and between the 10 th and the 90 th percentile for the AGA group. Genetic syndromes, multiple congenital malformations and verified <b>congenital</b> infections (<b>syphilis,</b> toxoplasmosis, rubella, citomegalovirus, herpes) were excluded. The SGA group infants were classified according to body proportionality as symmetric SGA (S-SGA) and asymmetric SGA (A-SGA) for data analysis. All children were scheduled for developmental evaluation by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (Bayley, 1993) and two professionals who were unaware of the classification of the neonate's group performed the assessments of the infants, in the presence of their mothers, at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. The infant's score for each item was registered in the Mental and Motor Scale Record Form. A total of 95 infants were performed. No differences were observed in Mental and Motor Scales performance, when classified as adequate (IS = 85) or inadequate (IS < 85). In the Mental Scale, means comparison between the groups showed no statistical differences. Considering the Motor Scale the SGA group showed lower IS means in the 2 nd and in the 12 th months (p = 0, 008 and 0, 046, respectively, Mann-Whitney test) and the S-SGA group in the 2 hd month of age (p = 0, 016 Kruskal Wallis test). Considering the Behavior Rating Scale, the inadequate performance were associated in the 2 nd month of life, 5, 19 times in higher proportion to SGA group (IC 95 %: 1, 03 - 29, 12) and 8, 89 times to S-SGA group (IC 95 %: 1, 53 - 57, 40).

Considerando-se o IS na Escala Mental, o grupo PIG apresentou médias significativamente menores no 6 º mês (p = 0, 043, Teste t) e o grupo PIG-S apresentou no 3 º e no 6 º mês (p = 0, 040 e 0, 041 respectivamente, Teste Kruskal Wallis). Considerando-se o IS na Escala Motora, o grupo PIG e o grupo PIG-S apresentaram médias significativamente menores no 2 º mês (p = 0, 008 e 0, 008, Teste Mann-Whitney e Kruskal Wallis, respectivamente). Considerando-se a Escala de Classificação do Comportamento (ECC), observou-se risco de associação à performance inadequada no 2 º mês de vida: 5, 19 vezes maior no grupo PIG (IC 95 %: 1, 03 - 29, 12); 8, 00 vezes maior no grupo PIG-S (IC 95 %: 1, 37 - 51, 89) e 7, 20 vezes maior nos lactentes com baixo peso ao nascimento (IC 95 %: 1, 42 - 38, 74). Considerando o perímetro craniano ao nascimento, o lactente nascido com microcefalia teve risco 16 vezes maior de estar associado à performance inadequada na Escala Mental (IC 95 %: 1, 41 - 417, 80), no 1 º mês de vida. Na análise multivariada dos dados, empregando-se o modelo de regressão logística não condicional, nas Escalas Mental e Motora, nenhuma variável foi incluída no modelo, de tal forma que as mesmas não foram associadas ao risco de uma criança ter performance inadequada nessas escalas. Na ECC, segundo esse modelo, os lactentes que apresentaram microcefalia ao nascimento associaram-se ao maior risco de performance inadequada no 1 º mês de vida e os pertencentes ao grupo PIG-S no 2 º mês. Em nenhuma escala ou momento observou-se risco maior de associação entre o sexo do lactente e a performance inadequadaIntrauterine malnutrition {{has been associated}} to long-term neurological morbidity. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the neurodevelopment of full-term small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants and to compare with those born appropriate for gestational age (AGA), in the first six months of life. The research design was a prospective study of two cohorts, one of full-term SGA group and other of control AGA group; with cross-sectional data analysis. A hundred and twenty five full-term neonates were selected at Neonatology Service in the Center of Integral Attention to the Woman?s Health (CAISM) of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), São Paulo, Brazil. To each SGA neonate chosen, the following two AGA neonates were selected. Ethical permission was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of UNICAMP and the mothers also gave the fully informed consent. They were selected on the following criteria: subjects living in the metropolitan area of Campinas; neonates considered in good health for going home within 2 days after birth; gestational age categorized as full-term (37 - 41 weeks) by CAPURRO postnatal method (1970); expected birth weight for determined gestational age by BATTAGLIA and LUBCHENCO method; birth weight less than the 10 th percentile for the SGA group and between the 10 th and the 90 th percentile for the AGA group. Genetic syndromes, multiple congenital malformations and verified <b>congenital</b> infections (<b>syphilis,</b> toxoplasmosis, rubella, citomegalovirus, herpes) were excluded. The infants were grouped as Symmetric SGA (S-SGA), Asymmetric and Control group for data analysis. All children were scheduled for developmental evaluation and two professionals who were unaware of the classification of the neonate?s group performed the assessments of the infants, in the presence of their mothers, at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months of age. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (BSID-II) (Bayley, 1993) were used. The infant?s score for each item was registered in the Mental and Motor Scale Record Form. A total of 95 infants were studied: 63 in the 1 st month, 68 in the 2 nd and 3 rd month and 66 in the 6 th month. No differences were observed in Mental and Motor Scales performance, when classified as adequate (IS ? 85) or inadequate (IS < 85). In the Mental Scale, mean comparison using the t test showed lower IS in the SGA group with significant difference in the 6 th month (p = 0, 043) and in the S-SGA group in the 3 rd and 6 th month (p = 0, 040 and 0, 041 respectively, Kruskal Wallis test). Considering the Motor Scale, mean comparison using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests showed lower IS in the SGA and S-SGA groups respectively, with significant difference in the 2 th month (p= 0, 008 and 0, 008). Considering the Behavior Rating Scale, the inadequate performance were associated in the 2 nd month of life: 5, 19 times greater to SGA group (IC 95 %: 1, 03 - 29, 12); 8, 00 times greater to S-SGA group (IC 95 %: 1, 37051, 89) and 7, 20 times greater to low birth weight born infants (IC 95 %: 1, 42 - 38, 74). Considering the birth head circumference, the microcephalic born infants were 16, 0 times more associated to the inadequate performance in Mental Scale (IC 95 %: 1, 41 - 417, 80) in the first month of life. Analyzing the relationship between multiple variables using the multiple regression method, there was no regression for the Mental and Motor scales. In this model, in the 1 st month of life, the infants born with microcephaly were associated with inadequate performance in the Behavior Rating Scale. In the 2 nd month the SGA-S group showed higher risk for an inadequate performance in the Behavior Rating Scale. In any scale ou month, no greater risk for association of female infant to inadequate performance was observe...|$|R
