The discussion of revocation schemes follows an existing classification in the literature based on three separate dimensions: resilience, propagation, and dominance.

40|$|The {{reliable}} authentication of user attributes is {{an important}} prerequisite {{for the security of}} web based applications. Digital certificates are widely used for that purpose. However, practical certification scenarios can be very complex. Each certificate carries a validity period and can be revoked during this period. Furthermore, the verifying user has to trust the issuers of <b>certificates</b> and <b>revocations.</b> This work presents a formal model which covers these aspects and provides a theoretical foundation for the decision about attribute authenticity even in complex scenarios. The model is based on the event calculus, an AI technique from the field of temporal reasoning. It uses Clark’s completion to address the frame problem. An example illustrates the application of the model...|$|R

The cryptographic backend is OpenSSL, which {{is in no way}} a disadvantage.OpenCA is aimed to build the organizational infrastructure for a PKI.

In these scenarios, resource guards have an ACL which delegates to some authorization or naming authorities the right to manage the access to the controlled resources. These authorities can issue certificates delegating these permissions to other subordinates authorities, or to specific users. In this way, the generated structure reflects the way the authorization is managed.

40|$|International audienceIdentity-Based Encryption (IBE) {{offers an}} {{interesting}} alternative to PKI-enabled encryption as it {{eliminates the need}} for digital <b>certificates.</b> While <b>revocation</b> has been thoroughly studied in PKIs, few revocation mechanisms are known in the IBE setting. Until quite recently, the most convenient one was to augment identities with period numbers at encryption. All non-revoked receivers were thus forced to obtain a new decryption key at discrete time intervals, which places a significant burden on the authority. A more efficient method was suggested by Boldyreva, Goyal and Kumar at CCS' 08. In their revocable IBE scheme, key updates have logarithmic (instead of linear in the original method) complexity for the trusted authority. Unfortunately, security could only be proved in the selective-ID setting where adversaries have to declare which identity will be their prey {{at the very beginning of}} the attack game. In this work, we describe an adaptive-ID secure revocable IBE scheme and thus solve a problem left open by Boldyreva et al. ...|$|R
40|$|Various {{intrusion}} tolerant {{certification authority}} (CA) {{systems have been}} recently proposed to provide attack resistant certificate update/query services. However, {{it is difficult to}} compare them against each other directly due to diversity in system organizations, threshold cryptography schemes, protocols and usage scenarios. We present a framework for intrusion tolerant CA system evaluation, which consists of three components, namely, an intrusion tolerant CA model, a threat model and a metric for comparative evaluation. The framework covers system organizations, protocols, usage scenarios, period of <b>certificate</b> validity, <b>revocation</b> rate and mean time to recovery (MTTR). Based on the framework, four representative CA systems are evaluated and compared in three typical usage scenarios, producing reasonable and insightful results. The inter-dependency between usage scenarios and system characteristics is investigated, providing a guideline to design better systems for different usage scenarios. The proposed framework provides an effective method to evaluate intrusion tolerant CA systems quantitatively. Moreover, the comparison results offer valuable insights to further improve the attack resilience of intrusion tolerant CA systems...|$|R
