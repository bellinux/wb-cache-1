5000|$|A <b>commodatum</b> was a {{loan for}} use. It did not {{transfer}} ownership nor possession, {{and was also}} gratuitous (no interest could be charged). If interest was included, the agreement was instead either one of hire or an innominate contract. It {{was assumed to be}} for a [...] "reasonable time" [...] if this was not specified {{at the time of the}} agreement. Land could be the subject of a <b>commodatum</b> during the Classical period and later, though this was doubted before that. Perishables could not be loaned for use, unless they were to be used for display purposes only, or a small number of other exceptions. The lender under a <b>commodatum</b> did not have to be owner, since ownership was not transferred.|$|E
50|$|In {{civil law}} and Scots Law, a commodate (<b>commodatum)</b> is a {{gratuitous}} loan; a loan, or free concession of anything moveable or immoveable, {{for a certain}} timeframe, on condition of restoring again the same individual after a certain time.|$|E
50|$|In August, 2007, work {{started at}} the new branch {{headquarters}} of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas in the City of Oaxaca, which are lodged in an old domestic building in the Alameda de León, which dates from the eighteenth century and was received by the UNAM in <b>commodatum</b> in 2005.|$|E
50|$|In Roman law, {{contracts}} {{could be}} divided between those in re, {{those that were}} consensual, and those Thatcher were innominate contracts in Roman law. Although Gaius only identifies a single type of contract in re, it is commonly thought that there were four, as Justinian identifies: mutuum (loan for consumption), <b>commodatum</b> (loan for use), depositum (deposit) and pignus (pledge).|$|E
50|$|Justinian {{identifies}} {{four types}} of real contract - contracts in re (in a thing) - mutuum, <b>commodatum,</b> depositum and pignus. Common to all four was an agreement, and the delivery of a res corporalis. They are in contrast to consensual and inominate contracts. Real contracts were of limited significance, although they are featured prominently {{in the works of}} jurists. If a stipulatio had to be created to cover any interest, then it could be used to cover the other elements of the transaction as well.|$|E
50|$|The literal {{contract}} disappeared {{late into}} the classical age, sustained by its use in the banking trade. In Justinian's law, it {{had been replaced by}} the written form of the stipulatio, and by a form of conclusive evidence for another sort of loan (mutuum or <b>commodatum)</b> where the holder lost his exceptio that the loan had not taken place after a period of time. Authors such as W. W. Buckland and Barry Nicholas believe Justinian's claim that this was a new form of literal contracts to be badly mistaken, the latter suggesting it was created mainly to bring the number of types up to four, the preferred number of divisions. Accordingly, no mention is made in the Digest to the original form. Gaius refers to two types of document: the chirograph, made by a debtor only, and a syngraph made by both parties. He identifies them with the peregrine's law only; after the extension of citizenship to the majority of the free peoples of the Empire by Caracalla, they continued to be used, but only in an evidentiary role.|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the exegesis of certain texts in the Justinian’s Digest, namely 13. 6. 3. 6 (Ulp. 28 ad ed.), 12. 1. 18. 1 (Ulp. 7 disp.), 13. 6. 4 (Gai. 1 de verb. obl.), 46. 3. 67 (Marc. 13 dig.), the Author formulates some {{considerations}} on the <b>commodatum</b> so-called ad pompam vel ostentationem, pointing out that the applications related to that anomalous <b>commodatum</b> were more complex and not merely confined to the idea of exhibiting id quod usu non consumitur for ‘pomp’, id est (by doing) ‘ostentation’. The basic idea of the Author is that Ulpian has specifically designated two terms, ‘pompa vel ostentatio’, to refer to two different (but not opposing) application spheres, in an attempt to synthesis conceived by the jurist...|$|E
40|$|Public law {{unevenness}} of {{the territorial}} {{system in the}} Late Middle Ages resulted in the inability to interpret certain contractual obligatory institutes by using unique legal sources. For this reason, determining characteristics of certain legal institutes requires a very thorough analysis of those sources that are available, but often not applicable for representation of the institutes which were rarely implemented or implied establishing normal rules in everyday legal transactions. This is especially {{the case of the}} institute of <b>commodatum,</b> which, until the period of entry into force of the General Civil Code, was hardly subjected to formal legal regulation. This paper’s aim is, therefore, to seek to determine whether there is a general continuity in legal regulation of the institute of <b>commodatum</b> in the area which, due to the complex political circumstances, was subjected to different legal effects. This will be the way of filling the obvious gaps in the Croatian legal history science as regards loans, and of setting up a reliable basis for analyzing this institute in the contemporary law...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is to complexly discuss the rights to use the land. The purpose of this thesis is particulary to analyse the valid legal {{regulation}} {{of the right to}} use the land after the Civil Code recodification, but for better ceherence we must also discuss the history and development of the rights to use the land that the actual legislation comes from. Pivotal part of the thesis presents the institute of lease the land and emphyteutic lease, while it is just emphyteutic lease, which plays significant role in presented issue. The thesis also informs about another land-use institutes such as <b>commodatum,</b> precarium and fructus a ususfructus of the land. Last part of the thesis is focused on the special legal regulation which is contained out of the Civil Code. The thesis discusses the managment of the state property and restrictions which are contained in several special acts such as Forestry Act or Act on the Protection of Nature and the Landscape...|$|E
40|$|Contractual {{relations}} {{involving the}} use of another's property are quite common. Yet, {{the use of}} computer resources of others over the Internet and legal transactions arising thereof certainly diverge from the traditional framework embodied in the special part of contract law dealing with this issue. Modern performance concepts (such as: infrastructure, software or platform as high-tech services) are highly unlikely to be described by the terminology derived from Roman law. The overwhelming novelty of high-tech services obscures the disadvantageous position of contracting parties. In most cases, service providers are global multinational companies which tend to secure their own unjustified privileges and gain by providing lengthy and intricate contracts, often comprising a number of legal documents. General terms and conditions in these service provision contracts are further complicated by the '. service level agreement', rules of conduct and (non) confidentiality guarantees. Without giving the issue a second thought, users easily accept the pre-fabricated offer without reservations, unaware that such a pseudo-gratuitous contract actually conceals a highly lucrative and mutually binding agreement. The author examines {{the extent to which}} the legal provisions governing sale of goods and services, lease, loan and <b>commodatum</b> may apply to 'cloud computing' contracts, and analyses the scope and advantages of contractual consumer protection, as a relatively new area in contract law. The termination of a service contract between the provider and the user features specific post-contractual obligations which are inherent to an online environment...|$|E
