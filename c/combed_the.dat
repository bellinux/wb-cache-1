5|$|The {{planet is}} the only one known to be in the orbit of the star MOA-2009-BLG-387L, which is an M-type dwarf star that has a mass that is {{approximately}} 0.19 times that of the Sun. The star is located at an estimated 5700 parsecs (18,591 light years) from the Earth. The star is named for the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics group, which saw the star as a gravitational microlensing event in 2009 and <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> data in hope of discovering a planet.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Iron Duke and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard Iron Duke over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Iron Duke returned to Scapa Flow, arriving at 11:30. Over the course of the battle, Iron Duke had fired ninety rounds from her main battery, along with fifty rounds from her secondary guns.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Collingwood and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Collingwood fired a total of 52 armour-piercing, capped and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a sub-lieutenant commanding the forward turret during the battle and sat in the open on the turret roof during a lull in the action.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{torpedo boat}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Benbow {{and the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further {{significant}} action in the battle. This was, in part, due to poor communication between Jellicoe and his subordinates over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. Benbow fired briefly at a group of torpedo boats at about 21:10, with a salvo of 6-inch shells and a single 13.5-inch round. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, Benbow had fired forty 13.5-inch armour-piercing, capped shells and sixty 6-inch rounds.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E
5|$|While Royal Oak was {{attacking the}} battlecruisers, a German torpedo boat {{flotilla}} launched {{an attack on}} the British line. Royal Oaks secondary guns were the first to open fire, at 19:16, followed quickly {{by the rest of the}} British line. Following the German destroyer attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Royal Oak and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action.

50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular <b>combing.</b> <b>The</b> Noble <b>comb</b> {{is an example of}} circular <b>combing.</b> <b>The</b> French <b>comb</b> is an example of linear <b>combing.</b> <b>The</b> process of <b>combing</b> is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When <b>combing</b> wool, <b>the</b> discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Holden <b>comb</b> was {{suited for}} <b>the</b> <b>combing</b> of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are {{fed into the}} machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by <b>the</b> lashing action of the filling heads. As <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle rotates, <b>the</b> fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by <b>the</b> keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle carries <b>the</b> remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur <b>combs,</b> <b>the</b> drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final <b>combing</b> by removing <b>the</b> long fibres from the pins of <b>the</b> nacteur <b>comb</b> and <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle; <b>the</b> short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in <b>the</b> nacteur <b>combs</b> are transferred to <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|R
25|$|At {{the bottom}} of the scale were the {{ubiquitous}} discentes ("those learning") or medical apprentices. Roman doctors of any stature <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> population for persons in any social setting who had an interest in and ability for practicing medicine. On the one hand the doctor used their services unremittingly. On the other they were treated like members of the family; i.e., they came to stay with the doctor and when they left they were themselves doctors. The best doctors were the former apprentices of the Aesculapia, who, in effect, served residencies there.|$|E
25|$|In February 1967, the {{authorities}} launched a violent campaign to extinguish religious life in Albania, claiming that religion had divided the Albanian nation {{and kept it}} mired in backwardness. Student agitators <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> countryside, forcing Albanians to quit practicing their faith. Despite complaints, even by APL members, all churches, mosques, monasteries, and other religious institutions were closed or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, and workshops by year's end. A special decree abrogated the charters by which the country's main religious communities had operated. The campaign culminated in an announcement that Albania had become the world's first atheistic state, a feat trumpeted as one of Enver Hoxha's greatest achievements.|$|E
25|$|After the {{discovery}} of Martin's body, approximately 75 state troopers <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> area in search of clues.

According to The Citizens' Voice, burned cloth matching the clothing Martin was wearing when she was last seen was discovered at an abandoned sawmill near Forkston. However, an article in The Kane Republican stated {{that this was not}} the origin of the cloth. An incident involving a bundle of clothing being thrown from a car near Orwigsburg proved to be unrelated to Martin's killing.|$|E

25|$|Naval ships <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> Makassar Strait while {{military}} personnel went through jungles and mountains of Sulawesi. In {{the face of}} heavy rain and strong winds in the area, the search efforts, coordinated from Makassar city, were focused in the area between the coastal town of Majene and the mountainous region of Toraja. The search in the two areas was due to twin signals, each carrying different emergency locator transmitter frequencies, received by the Singaporean satellite and an Indonesian military air base. The two separate locations produced on radar screens were {{a spot on the}} sea in Majene and on land in Rantepao, Tana Toraja. Searches were then expanded throughout the Island of Sulawesi; some were triggered by unknown distress signals received by a commercial Lion Air flight and an airport. A police officer at the Barru district police operational centre said that all the districts with stretches of coastline along the Makasser Strait had teams searching for the plane.|$|E
25|$|The state {{government}} of Andhra Pradesh and the Government of India launched {{one of the}} largest search and rescue operations {{in the history of the}} country. The state's security officials mentioned that bad weather was hindering the search and rescue efforts. The Home Ministry of India dispatched 5000 CRPF soldiers for the operation while the Defence Ministry of India ordered the Indian Air Force to comb the area using low altitude planes and the Sukhoi-30MKI equipped with thermal imaging systems. In addition, police personnel from six districts were involved in the ground search. Andhra Pradesh's elite anti-Naxal troops, Greyhounds, were also deployed in the area, owing to their extreme familiarity with the jungle terrain of the area. Local tribal residents from this part of the state assisted with the search mission. Patrol parties also <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> Krishna river for the remains of the helicopter. ISRO's RISAT-2 satellite was also deployed to search the area, but the 41 high-resolution images of the area were unable to trace the helicopter.|$|E

25|$|There are {{preserved}} observations of solar and lunar eclipses from Babylonian astronomy and Chinese astronomy beginning from the 8th century BCE.

The ancient observations are consistent with the Earth having rotated a significant fraction of a total turn than would result from today's value of the speed of rotation would indicate: The Earth was turning ever faster throughout the past. The cumulative effect of the faster turn, of a magnitude of milliseconds per day per century, 36,525 days per century, shows up in a magnitude of hours and thousands of kilometers in observations.

25|$|On 13 May, {{they sat}} in the square, writing postcards waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed through an adoring and excited crowd of supporters, Aƒüca fired four shots at 17:17 with a 9mm Browning Hi-Power {{semi-automatic}} pistol, and critically wounded him. He fled the scene as the crowd was in shock and disposed of the pistol by throwing it under a truck, but was grabbed by Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin, a nun, and several spectators who prevented him from firing more shots or escaping, and he was arrested. All four bullets hit John Paul II; two of them lodged in his lower intestine while the other two hit his left index finger and right arm and also injured two bystanders: Ann Odre, of Buffalo, New York, was struck in the chest, and Rose Hall was slightly wounded in the arm.

[...] "It is impossible that {{there would have been no}} noticeable effects that later would have been identifiable as nuclear," [...] they wrote. [...] "Yet rescue and investigating personnel <b>combed</b> <b>the</b> area immediately after the blast, and the ammunition depot, which was quickly rebuilt, is in use today. These activities, without any reported injuries resulting from residual radioactivity, clearly indicate that only conventional explosives were detonated." [...] They criticized Vogel for being [...] "silent" [...] about all of the evidence against his theory, and found the persistence in the propagation of the Vogel theory in the media [...] "even in the face of evidence to the contrary" [...] as exemplifying [...] "...the process by which conspiracy theories and other astounding knowledge claims gain popular attention." ...|$|E
