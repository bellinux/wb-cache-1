40|$|Abstract. An <b>edge</b> <b>cover</b> of a graph {{is a set}} of edges {{in which}} each vertex has at least one of its {{incident}} edges. The problem of counting the number of <b>edge</b> <b>covers</b> is #P-complete and was shown to admit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) recently [10]. Counting weighted <b>edge</b> <b>covers</b> is the problem of computing the sum of the weights for all the <b>edge</b> <b>covers,</b> where the weight of each <b>edge</b> <b>cover</b> is defined to be the product of the edge weights of all the <b>edges</b> in the <b>cover.</b> The FPTAS in [10] cannot apply to general weighted counting for <b>edge</b> <b>covers,</b> which was stated as an open question there. Such weighted counting is generally interesting as for instance the weighted counting independent sets (vertex covers) problem has been exhaustively studied in both statistical physics and computer science. Weighted counting for <b>edge</b> <b>cover</b> is especially interesting as it is closely related to counting perfect matchings, which is a long-standing open question. In this paper, we obtain an FPTAS for counting general weighted <b>edge</b> <b>covers,</b> and thus solve an open question in [10].

40|$|Abstract: Automated Visual Inspection Systems (AVIS) are {{becoming}} increasingly popular due to low cost maintenance and high accuracy. Ceramic tile factories, for example, are very much interested in these sorts of systems. This paper introduces a different strategy in ceramic tile inspection system to reveal four major problems, namely, edge curvature, thickness, size measuring and edge crack defects. It is believed that this method will <b>cover</b> <b>edge</b> curvature defects and thickness measuring of ceramic tiles in AVIS with recommending an individual algorithm for each defect based on line feature extraction techniques. In addition, {{it is assumed that}} our model makes size measuring and edge defects detection easier and more accurate rather than previous approaches. This proposed model will allow ceramic tile companies to perform quality control inspection without costly measuring tools or error-prone inspection by humans. Moreover, factories have to install and apply Flatness Control Machine (FCM) to measure the flatness curvature of ceramic tiles. This machine keeps the ceramic tiles in fixed position to investigate the upper surface only. But our strategy is independent of a specific position through inspection in various angles from top and side views. We hope that our model, which is prominent in low cost implementation, will enable companies to apply this method in different situations in their manufacturing production line systems. Hence, it will assist them to produce not only more accurate reports on defects but also permit improve...|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{following}} {{variant of the}} set cover problem. We are given a universe U={ 1, [...] .,n} {{and a collection of}} subsets C = {S_ 1, [...] .,S_m} where each S_i is a subset of U. For every element u from U we need to find a set phi(u) from collection C such that u belongs to phi(u). Once we construct and fix the mapping phi from U to C a subset X from the universe U is revealed, and we need to cover all elements from X with exactly phi(X), that is {phi(u) }_{all u from X}. The goal is to find a mapping such that the cover phi(X) is as cheap as possible. This {{is an example of a}} universal problem where the solution has to be created before the actual instance to deal with is revealed. Such problems appear naturally in some settings when we need to optimize under uncertainty and it may be actually too expensive to begin finding a good solution once the input starts being revealed. A rich body of work was devoted to investigate such problems under the regime of worst case analysis, i. e., when we measure how good the solution is by looking at the worst-case ratio: universal solution for a given instance vs optimum solution for the same instance. As the universal solution is significantly more constrained, it is typical that such a worst-case ratio is actually quite big. One way to give a viewpoint on the problem that would be less vulnerable to such extreme worst-cases is to assume that the instance, for which we will have to create a solution, will be drawn randomly from some probability distribution. In this case one wants to minimize the expected value of the ratio: universal solution vs optimum solution. Here the bounds obtained are indeed smaller than when we compare to the worst-case ratio. But even in this case we still compare apples to oranges as no universal solution is able to construct the optimum solution for every possible instance. What if we would compare our approximate universal solution against an optimal universal solution that obeys the same rules as we do? We show that under this viewpoint, but still in the stochastic variant, we can indeed obtain better bounds than in the expected ratio model. For example, for the set cover problem we obtain $H_n$ approximation which matches the approximation ratio from the classic deterministic setup. Moreover, we show this for all possible probability distributions over $U$ that have a polynomially large carrier, while all previous results pertained to a model in which elements were sampled independently. Our result is based on rounding a proper configuration IP that captures the optimal universal solution, and using tools from submodular optimization. The same basic approach leads to improved approximation algorithms for other related problems, including Vertex <b>Cover,</b> <b>Edge</b> Cover, Directed Steiner Tree, Multicut, and Facility Location...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Urbanisation is an ever-growing global {{phenomenon}} {{which creates}} altered environments characterised by increased human habitation, exotic species, impermeable surfaces, artificial structures, landscape fragmentation, habitat loss, and modified energy– and resource pathways. The vulnerable Rand Highveld Grassland vegetation {{unit in the}} Tlokwe Municipal area, South Africa, has been extensively degraded and transformed by urbanisation and agriculture. Only 1 % of this endangered ecosystem is currently being actively conserved. Grassland fragments in urban areas {{are considered to be}} less species rich and less functional than their more “natural” counterparts, and are therefore not a priority for conservation. In this study the effects of landscape matrix quality on intra patch variables, namely plant species diversity and functional diversity, and fine-scale biogeochemical landscape function (as determined by Landscape Function Analysis or LFA) of 30 fragments of the Rand Highveld Grassland vegetation unit were explored. Four urbanisation measures (percentage urban land cover, percentage grass land <b>cover,</b> <b>edge</b> density, and density of people), acting as indicators for patterns and processes associated with urban areas, were calculated for matrix areas with a 500 m radius surrounding each selected grassland fragment to quantify the position of each grassland remnant along an urban-to-rural gradient. Using the specific urbanisation measures, the grassland fragments were objectively classified into two classes of urbanisation, namely “rural/peri-urban” and “urban”, to allow for statistical comparisons between intra-patch variables for grassland remnants exposed to similar urbanisation pressures. Plant species composition and diversity were determined in the selected grassland fragments and nine functional traits were described for each species. Plant functional diversity was determined by five functional diversity indices, namely functional richness, evenness, divergence, dispersion, and specialisation. Fine-scale biogeochemical landscape function was determined by executing the LFA method. LFA assesses fine-scale landscape patchiness and 11 soil surface indicators to produce three main LFA parameters (stability, infiltration, and nutrient cycling), which indicates how well a system is functioning in terms of resource conservation and soil processes. Possible relationships between fine-scale biogeochemical landscape function and plant species- and functional diversity were also investigated. NMDS ordinations and basic statistics were used to determine trends and effects within the data. The results indicated that urban grassland remnants had lower mean plant species richness, Shannon species diversity (significantly), and Pielou species evenness than rural/peri-urban grassland fragments. Urban grassland fragments also contained significantly higher percentage of exotic species. Correlations were found between the four urbanisation measures and percentage species of the total species richness possessing certain functional attributes. This indicated that increased urbanisation may influence the species composition and the occurrence of certain plant traits in the selected grassland fragments. Urbanisation seems to have no effect on fine-scale landscape heterogeneity of the selected grassland fragments. Rural/peri-urban grassland fragments had higher infiltration capacity, nutrient cycling potential, and total SSA functionality (although not significantly), which may be ascribed to differences in management practices, such as mowing in urban areas and grazing in rural areas. Rand Highveld Grassland fragments in the urban landscape matrix of Potchefstroom city are just as conservable in terms of plant species diversity and functional diversity, as well as on a biophysical function level involving soil processes than rural/peri-urban grassland fragments. High plant species diversity and the presence of certain plant traits did not contribute to high soil surface stability, infiltration capacity, nutrient cycling potential and total soil surface functioning.
