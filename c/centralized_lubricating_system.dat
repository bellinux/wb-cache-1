Plate mills {{hydraulic}} system {{is made up}} of several hydraulic stations, lubrication stations and grease stations, these hydraulic stations and lubrication stations are distributed around the mills. Each hydraulic station possesses qualities of successive long working time, high reliability and signal complexity, and it can satisfy diverse demands of high grade pressure or temperature control, etc. This paper is based on these demands, assembling control missions of hydraulic and lubricating stations. Several PLC S 7 - 300 were chosen to match the need of controlling mills hydraulic and <b>lubricating</b> <b>system</b> for a certain plate factory, and the HMI monitoring system for mill hydraulic and lubricating stations was developed by WINCC, which achieved central control and monitoring the hydraulic and <b>lubricating</b> <b>system</b> of plate mills...|$|R

Here, a novel <b>lubricating</b> <b>system</b> where graphene sliding against graphene is developed to achieve low friction in macroscale contact. And the large area graphene film used here were prepared by a unique self-assembly technique based on Marangoni effect. Low friction coefficient of about 0. 05 is obtained, and it is demonstrated that the film thickness, applied normal load and annealing process all have important influences on the tribological properties of graphene.

40|$|Reliability and {{performance}} of modern engines are directly dependent {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>lubricating</b> <b>systems.</b> To be effective, an engine <b>lubricating</b> <b>system</b> must successfully perform the functions of minimizing friction between the bearing surfaces of moving parts, dissipating heat, and keeping the engine parts clean by removing carbon and other foreign matter. In almost all modern internal-combustion engines, the system that provides the lube for these functions is the forced-lubrication system. Although there are many variations in <b>lubricating</b> <b>systems</b> for internal-combustion engines, the components and method of operation are basically the same. Steady state thermal analysis is carried out for the thermal fluid flow in the engine. Solidwork software is used for modeling the design and steady state analysis. The upper piston with variation of groove has been design for this simulation. For each piston, four different radius of groove design at the upper piston are use to analyze the thermal effect to the cylinder head and engine oil temperature. For conclusion, the quality of engine lubrication depends upon how much oil is supplied and how the lubricant is fed under thermal load of the components. This state of lubrication is closely related to the safe operation of an engine and its lifetime. Therefore, a practically optimized analytical method has been required by engine designers...|$|R

5000|$|Not all engines {{have the}} same oiling needs. High {{performance}} engines, for example, place higher stress on the <b>lubricating</b> <b>system.</b> In this case, the <b>lubricating</b> <b>system</b> must be especially robust to prevent engine damage. [...] Most engines in {{cars on the road}} today don’t run much past 5,000-6,000 rpm, but that isn’t always the case in performance engines, where engine speeds could reach up to 8000-9000 rpm. In engines like these, it is imperative that the oil circulates quickly enough, or air may become trapped in the oil. Also, to free up power, some engines in performance applications run lower weight oil, which requires less power to run the oil pump. Common oil weights in engines today are usually either 5w30 or 10w30 oil, whereas performance engines might use 0w20 oil, which is less viscous.|$|R
