40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{significant}} volume {{of research has}} been undertaken {{in order to understand}} the recent failures in oil insulated power apparatus due to deposition of copper sulphide on the conductors and in the insulation paper. Dibenzyl Disulfide (DBDS) has been found to be the leading <b>corrosive</b> <b>sulphur</b> compound in the insulation oil [1]. The process of copper sulphide formation and the deposition in the paper is still being investigated, but a recently proposed method seems to be gaining some confidence [1]. This method suggests a two-step process; initially the DBDS and some oil soluble copper complexes are formed. Secondly the copper complexes are absorbed in the paper insulation, where they then decompose into copper sulphide [2]. The most commonly used mitigating technique for <b>corrosive</b> <b>sulphur</b> contaminated oil is passivation, normally using Irgamet 39 or 1, 2, 3 -benzotriazole (BTA). The passivator is diluted into the oil to a concentration of around 100 ppm, where it then reacts with the copper conductors to form a complex layer around the copper, preventing it from interacting with DBDS compounds and forming copper sulphide. This research project will investigate the electrical properties of HV transformers which have tested positive for <b>corrosive</b> <b>sulphur,</b> and the evolution of those properties as the asset degrades due to sulphur corrosion. Parallel to this the long term properties of transformers with passivated insulation oil will be analysed {{in order to understand the}} passivator stability and whether it is necessary to keep adding the passivator to sustain its performance. Condition monitoring techniques under investigation will include dielectric spectroscopy, frequency response analysis, recovery voltage method (aka interfacial polarisation) amongst others. Partial discharge techniques will not be investigated, as the voltage between the coil plates is low and therefore it will not contribute significantly to the overall insulation breakdown, in corrosive oil related faults [3]. The goal of this research is to establish key electrical properties in both passivated and non-passivated power transformers that demonstrate detectable changes as the equipment degrades due to the insulation oil being corrosive...|$|E
40|$|Deposit induced {{corrosion}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} mechanisms for attack on heat exchangers in biofuel boilers. This severe corrosion decreases the obtainable steam temperature in boilers, thereby the efficiency in production of electricity is reduced. Deposit formation from the gas on superheater tubes are is generally referred to as fouling. Fouling decreases the heat transfer from the gas to the steam. Alkali and chlorine rich biofuels, and especially waste, will form deposit rich in alkali chlorides and sulphates that are <b>corrosive.</b> High <b>sulphur</b> contents in the fuel and gas reduces the corrosion attack. Waste can also be rich in heavy elements such as lead and zinc that can form low-melting-point eutectic chloride melts. Alloys rich in nickel, chromium and molybdenum are used to improve the corrosion resistance in biofuel boilers. In order to investigate candidate alloys for waste boilers a field test was performed including two test panels in the waterwall at 300 and 338 °C as well as a superheater test coil at 460 - 540 °C. The alloys ranged from carbon steel to nickel based Sanicro 65. The deposits and corrosion products were characterised by X-ray microanalysis (EDX), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were done on selected samples. Both in the waterwall and on the superheater thicker deposits formed on the ferritic steels. In the waterwall the addition of chromium and nickel only decreased the corrosion rate at the higher temperature. Protective Cr-Ni-Fe oxide separated the chlorides from the metal on Sanicro 28 and Sandvik 625. In the superheater the corrosion rates were high, up to 34 mm/year for T 22. Sanicro 28 and the more Cr and Ni rich alloys performed the best. The austenitic alloys were preferentially attacked on the side of the deposit crest and Sanicro 65 directly under the deposit crest. Alloy 310 suffered severe pitting corrosion in a line at the side of the deposit crest. The scales in the superheater were porous and cracked. Chlorides were observed in the metal/scale interface. Sanicro 28 formed chromium oxide that separated the chlorides from the metal in the interface. Grain boundary attack and local attack under a thick porous chromium oxide was observed on Sanicro 65. Laboratory tests were done with coupons of the austenitic steels 310 and Sanicro 28 imbedded in KCl-tablets at 500 °C in 5 %O 2 - 10 %H 2 O-N 2 gas. The aim was to mimic the deposit and its morphology on superheater tubes and to investigate how this affects the corrosion. Consistent with field behaviour, it was shown that transport through the KCl-deposit controlled the corrosion rate. The corrosion rate decreased with increasing thickness after reaching a maximum at 1 mm. The rim of the coupons was preferentially attacked due to microcracks through the tablet. Scale growth was investigated after 24, 168 and 672 h. The corrosion products after 24 h consisted of FeCr oxide and potassium chromate. The chromates grew laterally, consuming the chromium in the surrounding oxide. After 168 h an oxide was formed under the chromate and chlorine was enriched in the scale/metal interface. Finally after 672 h the oxides were 5 &# 956;m thick and few chromates were seen. Similar to fouling, crystals of KCl formed near thicker iron oxide after 168 h in these tests...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to deposist thick-film (low-frequency) s-mode CdS piezoelectric transducers directly onto copper or aluminium rods which formed part of the welding-electrode of a spot-welding machine. These transducers were to replace the discrete transducers used in a set-up for the "on-machine" evaluation of spot-welds. A secondary aim was to deposit very thin CdS films on glass slides for use as microwave resonators. The dependence of film adhesion on film thickness, and crystallographic orientation changes with thickness imposed an upper limit on the thickness of transducers with adequate properties for applications. The final goal, established through experience on the project, was to determine how thick piezoelectric films could be deposited to make useful transducers. Highly stoichiometric (deviations from stoichiometry {{of the order of}} 1 part in 10 ^ 13) and highly resistive (> 10 ^ 10 Ω. m.), and highly oriented films up to 100 μm thick have been successfully deposited on Ae rod substrates. Two deposition techniques were used : CdS/S electron beam bombardment evaporation and Cd/S isothermal cells. Provided that the temperature of the vapour molecules was less than 400 degrees C and that the pumping speed could be increased at will, then, the faster the deposition rate, the sharper the oblique c-axis preferred orientation, and the better the piezoelectric performance of the films. The pumping speed limited the deposition rate to 10 μm. h^- 1. Appreciable thermal stresses in the films gave rise to large forces which induced the thick-films to flake off or disintegrate. The dependence of film adhesion on film thickness is explained in terms of the inequality between the forces which bind the film to the substrate (independent of thickness) and the forces which induce the film to flake off (proportional to thickness). Thick CdS films were made to adhere to the substrate by making the substrate surface rouqher so that the films "keyed-in". No appreciable temperature gradients existed in the CdS films during growth, either across their thicknesses or along their surfaces. No changes in temperature gradients occurred in the films due to changes in film orientation, and vice versa. Up to a certain critical thickness, the c-axes of most CdS film crystallites aligned themselves with the direction of the vapour beam. When the thickness of the film exceeded the critical thickness, the growth of oblique crystallites was stifled and the film's c-axis tilted towards the substrate-normal and eventually became parallel to it. This was confirmed by etching-back a thick CdS film which was deposited at oblique vapour incidence. A model is presented for the "stifling process” which gives the relation between the critical thickness, the grain size and the deposition angle of the film. For a given deposition environment, the stifling process imposed an upper limit on the thickness of an s-mode transducer. The use of copper substrates, and of copper parts inside the deposition chamber, was abandoned because of the <b>corrosive</b> action of <b>sulphur</b> on copper. Cu/CdS junctions were nearly ohmic, and the anomalous behaviour of these junctions is explained in terms of the reaction between Cu and S to form Cu 2 S. CdS s-mode transducers with untuned two-way insertion loss of 35 dB in a 50 ohm system have been successfully deposited on glass slides for operation at frequencies down to 20 MHz. The stress in CdS films on glass slides was much less than that on Ae rods. It is possible that the higher stress in films on Ae rods weakened their piezoelectric performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>corrosive</b> <b>sulphur</b> in {{oil-filled}} power assets have been extensively studied {{over the last}} decade, as have remedial strategies to combat their impact.

40|$|Several power {{apparatus}} {{use some}} type of oil insulation system. Transmission level transformers, {{one of the most}} expensive components in power networks, use mineral oil as both electrical insulation and cooling. Due to the financial risk posed, if this equipment fails unexpectedly, several quality and condition monitoring techniques are used to test the insulation system. Nevertheless, in 1990 approximately 50 % of the mineral oils used in transformers was contaminated with <b>corrosive</b> <b>sulphur</b> species [1], which passed undetected by the standard corrosion tests at the time, resulting in transformers failures worldwide. CIGRE estimates that between 2000 and 2009 there were approximately 100 related failures, not considering small distribution transformers too small for any investigation to be carried out. The work presented investigates how CuxS faults develop, examines possible techniques to monitor the corrosion process and the failure scenarios caused by sulphur corrosion. A sample production method capable of generating 90 mm square Kraft paper samples with homogeneous CuxS deposition, with a less than 1 % variation, and a reproducibility of 3 : 5 % is detailed. Empirical data demonstrate how the generation of CuxS deposits to DBDS concentration, temperature, ageing atmosphere, paper-copper interfaces and location of deposits. Based on the empirical data obtained, a copper sulphide deposition model using multiple parallel CuxS formation mechanisms was developed. The development of condition monitoring techniques and laboratory-scale validation experiments have been completed successfully, with the use of both field and laboratory samples. It has been shown that x-ray fluorescence (XRF) is technically capable of quantifying very accurately sulphur and copper in oil, with a limit of quantization at 4. 05 and 1. 95 ppm respectively. In addition, XRF measurements demonstrated that through historical sulphur trends, sulphur depletion rates can be calculated to extrapolate if there is an onset sulphur corrosion. Frequency dielectric spectroscopic analysis of CuxS contaminated Kraft paper demonstrated empirically that CuxS deposits have resonance frequency, at approximately 1 mHz, and that the magnitude of the resonance relates to the quantity of CuxS. Furthermore, laboratory samples accurately replicate field samples containing CuxS deposits and other impurities in terms of dielectric data analysis. The effect of sulphur corrosion and possible failure scenarios are investigated. The electrical breakdown experiments demonstrate that the CuxS deposits reduced the electrical breakdown strength of each Kraft paper layer by 79. 5 %. By applying DP life expectancy models to empirical data it is demonstrated that the corrosion process reduces 25 % of the transformer life expectancy at normal working conditions. The excess dielectric loss, generated from a CuxS contaminated insulation paper system, has increased by a factor of approximately 27. 5. The thermal conductivity also increased 75 %. It is demonstrated the generation of a hotspot is very likely, which then generates a snowball effect of generating further CuxS deposits and further increasing the local temperature. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Several power {{transformers}} has, {{during the}} last two decades, broken down due to the copper sulphideproblem. <b>Corrosive</b> <b>sulphur</b> reacts with the copper conductor contaminating the surroundinginsulating paper. To this day there are no reliable nondestructive methods to detect copper sulphidecontamination in a power transformer. Dielectric frequency measurement is a nondestructive tool used in the transformer industry. Themeasurements can give important information about the condition of the transformer insulation. Inthis master thesis the usage of dielectric frequency measurement as a tool to detect copper sulphideon insulation paper has been investigated. The task has been divided into two subtasks: 	Subtask I: Develop and test different methods to create and classify copper sulphide contamination on paper samples. 	Subtask II: Examine the dielectric frequency response of the contaminated samples as a function of copper sulphideSolution and results for Subtask IFor sample creation two methods were used: 	Creating samples out of paper strips taken from existing transformers 	Growing copper sulphide on paper in the laboratory for three, ffve, eleven and fourteen daysFor copper sulphide classiffcation three methods were used: 	Resistance measurement 	Area percentage calculation 	Classiffcation by the number of days grown. For sample creation the growth of copper sulphide samples seemed to be the better choice as the gapsbetween the samples of strips gave large uncertainties in the dielectric frequency response. The growthvaried in some extent and days of growth some times became insuffcient in classifying degree of coppersulphide. Good connection between the copper and paper may be an important factor, and the sizeof the samples is recommended to be kept small. For all samples, contamination got heaviest at theedge. For the samples grown for fourteen days the paper became too fragile for dielectric frequencytesting. The resistance measurement classiffcation method seemed to be the best choice, as it could copewith large variations in the contamination. The area percentage calculation method worked undervery limiting conditions as the contamination had to be of a certain brightness level and with lowvariations in colour. The classiffcation due to days of growth came too short as the contaminationbetween ffve and seven days were not that signiffcant. Larger time intervals can be a solution. Solutions and Results from Subtask IIDielectric frequency measurements were tested with two separate equipments: 	The Insulation Diagnostic Analyser: Frequency range: 1 mHz- 1 kHz 	. The Alpha-Analyser: Frequency range: 100 Hz- 1 MHzAll tests where performed in equilibrium with air humidity at the time of testing. The gaps between the strips, used in the samples, gave a substantial effect to the dielectric frequencyresponse. This effect was clearest at the lower frequencies, but some effect can also be seen inthe higher region. At the lower frequencies the results gave no indication of any effect in the dielectricresponse due to copper sulphide. However, the gap effect may have concealed the effect, and testingwithout gaps is recommended. At the higher frequencies the grown copper sulphide samples gave some variations in the dielectricfrequency response. The variations in results also occurred between samples with the same creationconditions. This may still indicate a relation between copper sulphide and dielectric response at higherfrequencies. Even with the large deviations there were, at frequencies above 100 kHz, a steeper increasein losses for the contaminated samples. Of the grown samples created only samples of ffve and sevendays growth were tested. This gives a limited research foundation and further investigation is needed. Conclusions and Future WorkIn general there might be a correlation between copper sulphide and dielectric frequency measurement. Growing samples has turned out to work well as the test object provider. By combining days of growthwith resistance measurements the classiffcation of the contamination should be suffcient. However,more research is absolutely needed and some suggestions for further work are as follows: 	Dry the samples to minimise the water effect on the dielectric frequency measurement. 	Creating a new smaller sample cell for the Insulation Diagnostic Analyser, so the sample size can be reduced and sample without gaps can be run in the lower frequency range. 	Increase the time gap between the samples grown to get larger differences in contamination, and reduce the effect of variations. 	Reducing the temperature may be a way to increase days of growth. However, in this case more research on the temperature dependencies of copper sulphide growth is needed...|$|E
