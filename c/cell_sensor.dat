Previously, a flexible force sensor was reported from our group, which can detect both normal and shear forces by using liquid metal alloy (Ga-In-Sn) as piezoresistive gauge material encapsulated in a PDMS substrate. Based on this method, we propose an artificial hair <b>cell</b> <b>sensor</b> which can detect two-axis tactile force with a standing artificial hair shaft. Since the liquid-metal piezoresistors deform with the elastomeric substrate, normal and shear force can be detected with resistance changes of the piezoresistors.

40|$|This article uses {{finite volume}} and finite element methods for {{optimization}} of the artificial hair <b>cell</b> <b>sensor.</b> The {{performance of the}} sensor was investigated for different materials such as sicon and polysilicon and by varying hair cell dimensions including width and length. The silicon material which has low young modulus was proposed based on the simulation performance. The performance of the hair <b>cell</b> <b>sensor</b> was achieved by increasing the hair cell length while increasing the width did not significantly influence the performance. The performance of the sensor was studied for its viscous force, deflection, von mises stress and sensitivity. From the simulation, the hair cell with a length of 1600 μm and 80 μm width was suggested for the subsequent analysis. Another way to improve the performance was by modifying the hair cell geometry and it was proved that the modified hair cell was more sensitive, based on the deflection. The angle of flow that hit the hair cell also affected the deflection of the sensor where the zero angle flow which was parallel to the substrate was the most effective angle.

40|$|Cellular {{interaction}} with and adhesion on different biological surfaces {{is a dynamic}} and integrated process requiring the par-ticipation of specialized cell surface receptors, structural proteins, signaling proteins, and the cellular cytoskeleton. In this re-port, the authors describe a label-free and real-time method for measuring and monitoring cell adhesion on special microplates integrated with electronic <b>cell</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays. These plates were {{used in conjunction with}} the real-time cell elec-tronic sensing (RT-CES™) system to dynamically and quantitatively monitor the specific interaction of fibroblasts with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and compared with standard adhesion techniques. Cell adhesion on ECM-coated <b>cell</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays is dependent on the concentration of ECM proteins coated and is inhibited by agents that disrupt the interaction of ECM with cell surface receptors. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is re-quired for productive cell adhesion and spreading on ECM-coated microelectronic sensors. Confirming earlier results, it is shown that interfering with Src expression or activity, via siRNA or small molecule, results in the disruption of adhesion and spreading of BxPC 3 cells. The results indicate that the RT-CES system offers a convenient and quantitative means of assessing the kinetics of cell adhesion in a high-throughput manner.
