A racetrack channel was devised to provide data for the validation of numerical models, which are intended to model the transport of fibre agglomerates. The racetrack channel provides near uniform and steady conditions that lead to either the sedimentation or suspension of the agglomerates. Various experimental techniques {{were used to determine}} the velocity conditions and the distribution of the fibre agglomerates in the channel. The fibre agglomerates are modelled as fluid particles in the Eulerian reference frame. Simulations of pure sedimentation of a known mass and volume of agglomerations show that the transport of the fibre agglomerates can be replicated. The suspension of the fibres is also replicated in the simulations; however, the definition of the fibre agglomerate phase is strongly dependent on the selected density and diameter. Detailed information on the morphology of the fibre agglomerates is lacking for the suspension conditions, as the fibre agglomerates may undergo breakage and erosion. Therefore, ongoing work, which is described here, is being pursued to improve the experimental characterisation of the suspended transport of the fibre agglomerates. 1...|$|R

The strong radiological impact of iodine on man health and environment, mostly through its isotope I- 131, has made it a key point to get an accurate prediction of the potential iodine release from the NPP containment to the environment in the low probable event of an accident leading to core melt. Released from the fuel as a gaseous form, iodine enters the containment in gaseous or particulate form and undergoes deposition processes that eventually take it to the <b>containment</b> surfaces and <b>sump.</b> Once in the sump, iodine, when present as soluble compounds, gets dissolved as non volatile iodide (I-).

40|$|Mineral wool {{insulation}} material {{applied to the}} primary cooling circuit of a nuclear reactor maybe damaged {{in the course of}} a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The insulation material released by the leak may compromise the operation of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS), as it maybe transported together with the coolant in the form of mineral wool fiber agglomerates (MWFA) suspensions to the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> strainers, which are mounted at the inlet of the ECCS to keep any debris away from the emergency cooling pumps. In the further course of the LOCA, the MWFA may block or penetrate the strainers. In addition to the impact of MWFA on the pressure drop across the strainers, corrosion products formed over time may also accumulate in the fiber cakes on the strainers, which can lead to a significant increase in the strainer pressure drop and result in cavitation in the ECCS. Therefore, it is essential to understand the transport characteristics of the insulation materials in order to determine the long-term operability of nuclear reactors, which undergo LOCA. An experimental and theoretical study performed by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf and the Hochschule Zittau/GÃ¶rlitz 1 is investigating the phenomena that maybe observed in the containment vessel during a primary circuit coolant leak. The study entails the generation of fiber agglomerates, the determination of their transport properties in single and multi-effect experiments and the long-term effects that particles formed due to corrosion of metallic containment internals by the coolant medium have on the strainer pressure drop. The focus of this presentation is on the numerical models that are used to predict the transport of MWFA by CFD simulations in the <b>containment</b> <b>sump.</b> Two dispersed phases were conditions to determine the influence of entrained air from a jet on the transport of fibre agglomerates through the sump.

No coherent swirl or vortex activity was noted on the water surface during the testing which included various water levels and prototype velocity tests.

The proposed amendment is required to support safe operation of the plant during the next operating cycle (Cycle 28). During the current operating cycle (Cycle 27), KPS has experienced two prolonged shutdown periods, the first between February 20 and July 2 of 2005 and the second between April 26 and May 23 of 2006.

40|$|A {{consequence}} of a {{loss of coolant accident}} is the damage of adjacent insulation materials (IM). IM may then be transported to the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> strainers where water is drawn into the ECCS (emergency core cooling system). Blockage of the strainers by IM lead to an increased pressure drop acting on the operating ECCS pumps. IM can also penetrate the strainers, enter the reactor coolant system and then accumulate in the reactor pressure vessel. An experimental and theoretical study that concentrates on mineral wool fiber transport in the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> and the ECCS is being performed. The study entails fiber generation and the assessment of fiber transport in single and multi-effect experiments. The experiments include measurement of the terminal settling velocity, the strainer pressure drop, fiber sedimentation and resuspension in a channel flow and jet flow in a rectangular tank. An integrated test facility is also operated to assess the compounded effects. Each experimental facility is used to provide data for the validation of equivalent computational fluid dynamic models. The channel flow facility allows the determination of the steady state distribution of the fibers at different flow velocities. The fibers are modeled in the Eulerian-Eulerian reference frame as spherical wetted agglomerates. The fiber agglomerate size, density, the relative viscosity of the fluid-fiber mixture and the turbulent dispersion of the fibers all affect the steady state accumulation of fibers at the channel base. In the current simulations, two fiber phases are separately considered. The particle size is kept constant while the density is modified, which affects both the terminal velocity and volume fraction. The relative viscosity is only significant at higher concentrations. The numerical model finds that the fibers accumulate at the channel base even at high velocities; therefore, modifications to the drag and turbulent dispersion forces can be made to reduce fiber accumulation...|$|E
40|$|During a {{hypothetical}} severe accident, {{most of the}} iodine entering the containment would be in particulate form that would undergo transport and deposition phenomena of aerosols. After {{a certain period of}} time, a large fraction of this aerosol would be deposited in the <b>containment</b> <b>sump,</b> either by settling or by diffusiophoresis. Dissolution of iodine compounds would result in the formation of involatile aqueous iodide ions. Under radiation, the aqueous iodide in the sump is a potential source of volatile iodine compounds. Radiolytic oxidation of the iodide ions in the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> to produce molecular iodine (I 2) was considered as a major issue in the PIRT of the EURSAFE project and it is being investigated within the Source Term area (WP 16) of the SARNET project. There are two major reasons for this. Firstly, I 2 is a highly volatile compound, which is much more difficult to trap by physical methods than aerosols. Secondly, it can act as a precursor for organic iodide compounds, which may be even more volatile than I 2. This paper presents a review of the modelling fundamentals currently implemented in the main iodine chemistry codes underlying reactor accident predictions (IMPAIR 3, INSPECT, IODE from ASTEC, MAAP). Some tests from the available database (AEAT tests, University of Toronto tests and others) have been simulated with those tools and the remaining uncertainties are assessed by comparison of the predictions with the data. In addition, a discussion based on a specific comparison between the two existing models in ASTEC resulted in a recommendation concerning their adequacy.

40|$|During a LOCA in a LWR, a containment-sump {{strainer}} filters debris, {{generated from}} fibrous thermal insulation, {{from the water}} collected in the <b>containment</b> <b>sump.</b> The buildup of debris on the strainer and the bypass of debris through the strainer lead to upstream and downstream effects, respectively. The objective {{of this research was}} to create a methodology for obtaining PSDs for this debris upstream and downstream of a sump strainer in multiple size ranges. Fibrous debris was injected into an experimental facility which simulated the conditions in a LWR <b>containment</b> <b>sump.</b> Samples were taken downstream of the strainer during the experiment. Using a NanoSight LM 10 and two optical microscope systems, size measurements of particles were made. The fractional number of particles between 55 - 188 nm increased from 0. 591 to 0. 734 upstream to downstream; the number of all other particle sizes decreased. This trend is consistent with Hutten?s [8] statements about the MPPS. For AMIS- 1, from upstream to downstream, the fraction of particles smaller than 55 ?m increased from 0. 77 to 0. 89; almost all of the larger particles sizes decreased in number. This demonstrates larger particles being more efficiently filtered. For AMIS- 2, from upstream to downstream, the fraction of particles smaller than 340 ?m increased from 0. 536 to 0. 668; all of the larger particle sizes decreased in number. This again demonstrates higher filtration efficiency for larger particles. Different PDFs provided the best fit for the PSDs in each of the size ranges measured. For the nanometer range, the Johnson?s SB function provided the best fit. For the 10 - 500 ?m range, the upstream and downstream results were fit best with the log-logistic and lognormal functions, respectively.

Drag properties are derived from the measured sinking velocities of the fibres and observed geometric parameters for an adequate CFD modelling. In the test rig "Ring line-II" {{the influence of the}} insulation material on the head loss is investigated for debris loaded strainers. Correlations from the filter bed theory are adapted with experimental results and are used to model the flow resistance depending on particle load, filter bed porosity and parameters of the coolant flow. This concept also enables the simulation of a particular blocked strainer with CFDcodes. During the ongoing work further results of separate effect and integral experiments and the application and validation of the CFD-models for integral test facilities and original <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> conditions are expected...|$|E
40|$|Fibrous porous {{media has}} been found in a variety of {{industrial}} applications including filters and insulation materials. In nuclear power plants, fibrous media are found as insulation materials to prevent heat loss and protect the containment structures and other components from thermal effects. However, in spite of efficient thermal insulation, fibrous media have been focused on as a hazard in the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCSs). Fibrous debris generated from fiberglass insulation materials during a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) might accumulate on the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> strainer causing loss of Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH), called the upstream effect, or it might penetrate through the strainer becoming a source of clogging for flow channels in the core (downstream effect). In the present work, head loss through fibrous porous media made of the same fiberglass insulation material used in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) were experimentally investigated to study upstream effects. Porosity of fibrous porous media was also considered by measuring build-up of debris beds. In order to study downstream effects, quantity of debris bypass was examined by changing the type of water, concentration of debris, fluid approach velocity, and temperature. As results, a head loss model, a compression model, and a debris bypass model were proposed for the given conditions in this study. Additionally, a microscope system was developed to characterize size distribution of irregular-shaped fibrous debris. The methodology was applied to three samples and the maximum fraction of debris bypass was found in the size range of 10 to 250 ?m...|$|E

" As indicated in these submittals, SNC has performed extensive analysis, testing and plant modifications {{in addressing the}} concerns of the GL. Part of the technical basis for SNC's approach for resolving the issues associated with the GL relies on results from testing at the VUEZ facility by Alion Science and Technology. As discussed with Mr. Jared S. Wermiel, Deputy Director of the Division for Engineering and Safety Systems, in a telephone call with SNC on September 11, 2008, the NRC identified several critical issues with the test protocol used in the testing at VUEZ, as re 1 'Iected in the request for additional information (RAI) provided in NRC-to-SNC letter dated September 17, 2008. The NRC staff has stated that based on their review of information provided by Alion on the VUEZ testing, {{it is highly unlikely that}} SNC's reliance on the VUEZ testing performed to date to demonstrate strainer adequacy will provide an adequate technical basis to resolve GL 2004 - 02. Progress has been made in resolving some of these issues; however, the most significant issues affecting the VUEZ test protocol have not been adequately addressed to NRC staff satisfaction as noted in the transmittal letter of the VEGP RAls.

40|$|Public safety {{has long}} {{been one of the}} chief design {{concerns}} for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). For this reason, the design of a NPP must include plans for different accident scenarios called Design Basis Accidents (DBAs). One such DBA is called a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA); Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) are particularly prone to them. In order to better understand the phenomena associated with a LOCA, a great deal of research has been undertaken. In particular, many studies have been done under the designation Generic Safety Issue- 191 (GSI- 191). GSI- 191 seeks to better understand the secondary effects of a LOCA such as the pressure drop and debris bypass of the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> strainer and the impact that both can have on the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS). The present study was undertaken to build upon previous work that sought {{to determine whether or not}} a voltage applied to the sump strainer would affect the amount of fibrous debris bypass. To this end, a vertical strainer made from a perforated steel plate was installed in a horizontal flow loop. A filter bag was installed downstream from the strainer to collect the debris bypass. The fibrous debris was made from one-side baked NUKON fiberglass insulation. Measurements were also taken of the pressure drop across the debris beds. A total of 19 tests were carried out across five different voltages. No significant difference was observed in either the bypass or the pressure drop between the different voltages. The test results may have been affected by the fact that the present study involved water that was cooler than previous studies. The results may have also been affected by leaks in the test section. Furthermore, the use of multiple NUKON mats may also have affected the results. A study on the sensitivity of the debris bypass to kinematic viscosity could help shed some light on the former problem...|$|E
40|$|Damage to {{insulation}} materials located near to a primary circuit coolant leak may compromise {{the operation of}} the emergency core cooling system (ECCS). Insulation material in the form of mineral wool fiber agglomerates (MWFA) maybe transported to the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> strainers, where they may block or penetrate the strainers. Though the impact of MWFA on the pressure drop across the strainers is minimal, corrosion products formed over time may also accumulate in the fiber cakes on the strainers, which can lead to {{a significant increase in the}} strainer pressure drop and result in cavitation in the ECCS. An experimental and theoretical study performed by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf and the Hochschule Zittau/GÃ¶rlitz is investigating the phenomena that maybe observed in the containment vessel during a primary circuit coolant leak. The study entails the generation of fiber agglomerates, the determination of their transport properties in single and multi-effect experiments and the long-term effect that corrosion and erosion of the containment internals by the coolant has on the strainer pressure drop. The focus of this paper is on the verification and validation of numerical models that can predict the transport of MWFA. A number of pseudo-continuous dispersed phases of spherical wetted agglomerates represent the MWFA. The size, density, the relative viscosity of the fluid-fiber agglomerate mixture and the turbulent dispersion all affect how the fiber agglomerates are transported. In the cases described here, the size is kept constant while the density is modified. This definition affects both the terminal velocity and volume fraction of the dispersed phases. Note that the relative viscosity is only significant at high concentrations. Three single effect experiments were used to provide validation data on the transport of the fiber agglomerates under conditions of sedimentation in quiescent fluid, sedimentation in a horizontal flow and suspension in a horizontal flow. The experiments were performed in a rectangular column for the quiescent fluid and a racetrack type channel that provided a near uniform horizontal flow. The numerical models of sedimentation in the column and the racetrack channel found that the sedimentation characteristics are consistent with the experiments. For channel suspension, the heavier fibers tend to accumulate at the channel base even at high velocities, while lighter phases are more likely to be transported around the channel...|$|E
40|$|The International Phebus Fission Product programme, {{initiated}} in 1988 and {{performed by the}} French Institut de adioprotection et de SuretÂ´e NuclÂ´eaire (IRSN), investigates {{through a series of}} in-pile integral experiments, key phenomena involved in light water reactor (LWR) severe accidents. The tests cover fuel rod degradation and the behaviour of fission products released via the primary coolant circuit into the containment building. The results of the first two tests, called FPT 0 and FPT 1, carried out under low pressure, in a steam rich atmosphere and using fresh fuel for FPT 0 and fuel burned in a reactor at 23 GWdtâ 1 for FPT 1, were immensely challenging, especially with regard to the iodine radiochemistry. Some of the most important observed phenomena with regard to the chemistry of iodine were indeed neither predicted nor pre-calculated, which clearly shows the interest and the need for carrying out integral experiments to study the complex phenomena governing fission product behaviour in a PWR in accident conditions. The three most unexpected results in the iodine behaviour related to early detection during fuel degradation of a weak but significant fraction of volatile iodine in the containment, the key role played by silver rapidly binding iodine to form insoluble AgI in the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> and the importance of painted surfaces in the containment atmosphere for the formation of a large quantity of volatile organic iodides. To support the Phebus test interpretation small-scale analytical experiments and computer code analyses were carried out. The former, helping towards a better understanding of overall iodine behaviour, were used to develop or improve models while the latter mainly aimed at identifying relevant key phenomena and at modelling weaknesses. Specific efforts were devoted to exploring the potential origins of the early-detected volatile iodine in the containment building. If a clear explanation has not yet been found, the non-equilibrium chemical processes favoured in the primary coolant circuit and the early radiolytic oxidation of iodides in the condensed water films are at present the most likely explanations. Models that were modified or developed and embodied in the computer codes for organic iodide formation/destruction in the gas phase and AgâI reactions in the sump lead, in agreement with the Phebus findings respectively to greatly enhanced organic iodide formation kinetics and long term concentration in the containment atmosphere on one hand and, in the conditions of Phebus experiments, to significantly limited molecular iodine volatilisation from the sump in so far as silver was in excess compared to iodine, on the other hand. Organic iodides then quickly gain in importance and become the predominant volatile iodine species at long term. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|E
40|$|Debris {{generated}} {{during the}} blowdown {{phase of a}} Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) is a big concern {{in the safety of}} the Light Water Reactors under such accident scenarios. Debris transported by the water flow through the reactor containment floor may reach the sump strainers. During the long-term cooling phase of the accident, the accumulation of debris in the sump screens could impact the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) performance. Small size debris could also pass through the debris bed and sump strainers and be injected in the primary system, reducing the core cooling capabilities (downstream effects). A typical Westinghouse 4 -loop Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) was modeled using RELAP 5 - 3 D to simulate the reactor system response during the phases of the accident, under different LOCA scenarios. To account for the multi-dimensional flow behavior, the main regions of the reactor vessel were simulated using multi-dimensional components. The present work provides the results of the simulations performed for a LOCA in two of the main break locations of interest, such as the cold and the hot leg. The main objectives of these calculations are: â¢ To validate a new RELAP 5 - 3 D nodalization, used to model the reference nuclear power plant, in which have been entered multi-dimensional components that provide a better estimation of the flow path inside the reactor vessel and through the core during long-term cooling when strong asymmetries are expected due to the different possible break-injection location combinations. â¢ To study the response of the plant during selected accident scenarios and to provide important information and boundary conditions for the development of other project models, such as the break jet boundary conditions and reactor containment calculations. â¢ To analyze the behavior of the reactor system during a hypothetical core blockage, due to the accumulation of small sizes debris at the core inlet that could preclude the passage of water flow into the core. The simulations were repeated for three different break sizes (2 and 6 inch, and Double-Ended Guillotine) as representative cases for small, medium and large break respectively, to provide a complete spectrum of the system behavior. Moreover, since the purpose of the calculation was to provide a best estimate evaluation of the system behavior, all the safety features of the reactor were assumed to be available during the transient and the boundary conditions defined in the input deck (including initial operating conditions, scram, injection and other setup points, ECCS flow rates, auxiliary injection rate and temperature, etc.) were assumed to be realistic. Basic thermal-hydraulic parameters such as primary pressure, break and SI flow rates, core coolant temperatures and maximum cladding temperature were selected to monitor the system behavior during the transient. The liquid inventory in the steam generators tubes, the refilling time and, subsequently the potential circulating flow through the cooling loops were found {{to play an important role}} during the phases of the accident. The results obtained also showed important features of the coolant flow paths inside the reactor vessel during the long term cooling phase, when different safety injection configurations (cold and/or hot leg injection) are possible. For a specific break size, the HL break cases showed a higher flow rate through the core since the flow is forced by the SI trains to pass through the core from the injecting cold legs to reach the break. The core mass flow rate for the CL break scenarios was observed to be limited since most of the injected flow left the vessel through the broken cold leg from the upper section of the downcomer. A decrease in the core flow rate was usually predicted at the HL injection switchover, as a result of a different injection path. As a consequence, an increase in the core coolant and peak cladding temperatures is expected during the early stage of this phase. Such features should be considered when studying the effects of the debris transport and deposition inside the reactor vessel during the long-term cooling phase of the accident, when water from the <b>containment</b> <b>sump</b> is pumped by the safety injection system into the primary system. Assuming an excessive accumulation of debris at the core inlet, a full blockage of the bottom of the core and core bypass was imposed at the beginning of the long-term cooling phase. Under such conservative conditions, scenarios that did not lead to potential core damage were identified. The peak cladding temperature was selected as representative thermal-hydraulic parameter to define whether possible core damage was achieved. For all the break sizes analyzed, hot leg break scenarios were found not to lead to core damage due to the alternative coolant flow path through the steam generators (from the cold leg injection site to the SG U-tubes and to the hot leg and top of the core) which guarantees the decay heat removal under core blockage. For medium and large break size, cold leg break was found to lead potential core damage due to the unavailability of alternative flow paths to the top of the core at the time or immediately after the core blockage. It has to be marked that the core damage, when achieved during the simulations, was found to occur within a short period of time from the sump switchover time (approximately 1000 s), while the HL injection switchover occurring much later in the transient. To take into account also of the cross flows existing inside the core, a new nodalization was developed replacing the two pipe components which constituted the core (the average and hot channel) with four multi-dimensional components with which the fuel assemblies were individually simulated. First, preliminary simulations of the blowdown and long-term cooling phases were performed with the same boundary conditions used in the previous simulations to validate the new nodalization. Analyzing the behavior of the 3 D core model for small, medium and large break LOCA, in both cold and hot leg, the results obtained with the 1 D core model described above were confirmed. After, additional simulations were performed assuming again the total blockage of the bottom of the core and core bypass at the beginning of the long-term cooling, focusing on those scenarios that lead potential core damage and particularly on the 6 -inch cold leg break. Also this case showed what was previously found: the peak cladding temperature steadily increases reaching the maximum limit, confirming that the full core and core bypass blockage assumption may lead to core damage...|$|E
