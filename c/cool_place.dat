5|$|Carrots can {{be stored}} for several months in the {{refrigerator}} or over winter in a moist, <b>cool</b> <b>place.</b> For long term storage, unwashed carrots can {{be placed in a}} bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 32 to 40°F (0 to 5°C) is best.|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a <b>cool</b> <b>place.</b> Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, <b>cool</b> <b>place</b> such as a shed.|$|E

5|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continue}} their struggling {{investigation into the}} murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson. Bayliss wants to question an arabber who he maintains is the killer, but Pembleton believes that lead has already been exhausted. Pembleton instead pursues a theory posed by Felton (Daniel Baldwin) that Watson was killed one day earlier than they first believed, and rigor mortis was slowed because her body was stored in a <b>cool</b> <b>place.</b> Felton and Pembleton identify a possible suspect who lived near the murder scene, and learn his car was impounded shortly after her body was found. As they search impound lots for the car, the two detectives bicker {{with each other and}} Pembleton accuses Felton of racism. They eventually find the car, but uncover no evidence linking it to Watson.|$|E

25|$|Depending on the species, a {{nematode}} may {{be beneficial}} or detrimental to plant health. From agricultural and horticulture perspectives, the two categories of nematodes are the predatory ones, which will kill garden pests like cutworms and corn earworm moths, and the pest nematodes, like the root-knot nematode, which attack plants, and those that act as vectors spreading plant viruses between crop plants. Predatory nematodes can be bred by soaking a specific recipe of leaves and other detritus in water, in a dark, <b>cool</b> <b>place,</b> and can even be purchased as an organic form of pest control.|$|E
500|$|After planting, {{sprouting}} {{requires a}} warm place (about 20°C). Bulbs need light watering until the leaves and buds emerge, {{and need to be}} situated in a well-lit, <b>cool</b> <b>place</b> and watered as needed to maintain moderate soil moisture. [...] Overwatering will cause bulb and root rot. Plants may be fed with common fertilizers that contain iron and magnesium. Blooming takes place about two months after planting. The plant's leaves should continue to grow after the flowers have faded. Summering outdoors in four or five hours of direct sunlight, plus fertilizing lightly as the season progresses, will help develop buds for the next year.|$|E

500|$|Traditionally, {{clotted cream}} {{was created by}} {{straining}} fresh cow's milk, letting it stand in a shallow pan in a <b>cool</b> <b>place</b> for several hours to allow the cream {{to rise to the}} surface, then heating it either over hot cinders or in a water bath, before a slow cooling. The clots that formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long-handled cream-skimmer, known in Devon as a reamer or raimer. [...] By the mid-1930s, the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a cream separator actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force, which produced far more clotted cream than the traditional method from the same amount of milk. As a farmer's wife in Poundsgate said, [...] "the separator saves a whole cow!" ...|$|E

[...] "That was that first sketch that we slid across the table to Hasbro and said 'What do you guys think?' [...] And that's where it all started" [...] said Tieger. High Moon presented the idea of setting the game on Cybertron during the Transformers' civil war between the Autobots and Decepticons. [...] Aaron Archer, Senior Design Director for Hasbro, stated of the Cybertron-based setting [...] "that's a really <b>cool</b> <b>place</b> [...] and the early days of that civil war between the Autobots and Decepticons was a story that hadn't really been fleshed out in any format." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{underlying}} cause must be removed. [...] Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion {{on a hot}} day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased water consumption and resting in a <b>cool</b> <b>place.</b> [...] Hyperthermia that results from drug exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures. [...] Antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have no role in the treatment of heatstroke because antipyretics interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, {{as in the case of}} heatstroke. In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies.|$|E
