50|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of circular <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> are {{the difficulty in}} locating figures along a dish, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> use on the linear <b>slide</b> <b>rules,</b> and did not find reason to switch.|$|R
50|$|In measurement, the Coggeshall <b>slide</b> <b>rule,</b> {{also called}} a carpenter's <b>slide</b> <b>rule,</b> was a <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> {{designed}} by Henry Coggeshall in 1677 {{to help in}} measuring the dimensions, surface area, and volume of timber. With his original design and later improvements, Coggeshall's <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> brought the tool its first practical use outside of mathematical study. It would remain popular {{for the next few}} centuries.|$|R

50|$|The Bygrave <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> is a <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> {{named for}} its inventor, Captain L. G. Bygrave of the RAF. It was used in {{celestial}} navigation, primarily in aviation.

50|$|Most {{people find}} <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> {{difficult}} {{to learn and}} use. Even during their heyday, they never caught on with the general public. Addition and subtraction are not well-supported operations on <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> and doing a calculation on a <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> tends to be slower than on a calculator. This led engineers to take mathematical shortcuts favoring operations that were easy on a <b>slide</b> <b>rule,</b> creating inaccuracies and mistakes. On the other hand, the spatial, manual operation of <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> cultivates in the user an intuition for numerical relationships and scale {{that people who have}} used only digital calculators often lack. A <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> will also display all the terms of a calculation along with the result, thus eliminating uncertainty about what calculation was actually performed.|$|R
50|$|All premium <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> had {{numbers and}} scales engraved, and then filled with paint or other resin. Painted or {{imprinted}} <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> {{were viewed as}} inferior because the markings could wear off. Nevertheless, Pickett, probably America's most successful <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> company, made all printed scales. Premium <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops. The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel-wool. For painted <b>slide</b> <b>rules,</b> use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth.|$|R

50|$|Many sailors keep <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> as backups for {{navigation}} in case {{of electric}} failure or battery depletion on long route segments. <b>Slide</b> <b>rules</b> are still commonly used in aviation, particularly for smaller planes. They are being replaced only by integrated, special purpose and expensive flight computers, and not general-purpose calculators. The E6B circular <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> used by pilots has been in continuous production and remains available {{in a variety of}} models. Some wrist watches designed for aviation use still feature <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> scales to permit quick calculations. The Citizen Skyhawk AT is a notable example.|$|R

50|$|The <b>slide</b> <b>rule,</b> {{also known}} colloquially in the United States as a slipstick, is a {{mechanical}} analog computer. The <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> is used primarily for multiplication and division, {{and also for}} functions such as exponents, roots, logarithms and trigonometry, but typically not for addition or subtraction. Though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler, the <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> {{is not meant to}} be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in touch screen technology {{have increased the}} prevalence of touch screens and have prompted a wave of new touch screen-based devices. However, touch screens are still largely inaccessible to blind users, who must adopt error-prone compensatory strategies to use them or find accessible alternatives. This inaccessibility is due to interaction techniques that require the user to visually locate objects on the screen. To address this problem, we introduce <b>Slide</b> <b>Rule,</b> a set of audiobased multi-touch interaction techniques that enable blind users to access touch screen applications. We describe the design of <b>Slide</b> <b>Rule,</b> our interaction techniques, and a user study in which 10 blind people used <b>Slide</b> <b>Rule</b> and a button-based Pocket PC screen reader. Results show that <b>Slide</b> <b>Rule</b> was significantly faster than the button-based system, and was preferred by 7 of 10 users. However, users made more errors when using <b>Slide</b> <b>Rule</b> than when using the more familiar button-based system. Categories and Subject Descriptors...|$|R

50|$|Celluloid {{was also}} a popular {{material}} {{in the construction of}} <b>slide</b> <b>rules.</b> It was primarily used to coat wooden <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> faces, such as in early A.W. Faber rules, as well as cursor end pieces, such as in Keuffel and Esser rules.|$|R
25|$|Since real numbers can be {{represented}} as distances or intervals on a line, the <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> was invented in the 1620s, shortly after Napier's work, to allow multiplication and division operations {{to be carried out}} significantly faster than was previously possible. Edmund Gunter built a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale at the University of Oxford. His device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations, including multiplication and division. William Oughtred greatly improved this in 1630 with his circular <b>slide</b> <b>rule.</b> He followed this up with the modern <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> in 1632, essentially a combination of two Gunter rules, held together with the hands. <b>Slide</b> <b>rules</b> were used by generations of engineers and other mathematically involved professional workers, until the invention of the pocket calculator.|$|R

50|$|In {{its most}} basic form, the <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> uses two {{logarithmic}} scales to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers. These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More elaborate <b>slide</b> <b>rules</b> allow other calculations, such as square roots, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development and}} evaluation of a simple <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> that enables the bedside determination of the infusion rate for a particular target plasma concentration of propofol. The infusion rate to reach this target concentration at time (t) {{is the product of}} the target concentration, body weight, and a correction factor that depends on the time elapsed {{from the start of the}} initial infusion. Our target-controlled infusion (TCI) <b>slide</b> <b>rule,</b> constructed along this principle, performs the multiplications, analogous to the principle of the classical <b>slide</b> <b>rule,</b> as addition of logarithms. We calculated the percentage deviation of the predicted concentration obtained by STANPUMP versus predicted concentrations obtained using the infusion rates determined from the TCI <b>slide</b> <b>rule.</b> The evaluation using STANPUMP simulations showed, for a constant target concentration of 3 micro g/mL of propofol, a mean deviation of 4. 05 % (max, 6. 97 %) in the first 15 min and a mean deviation of 0. 5 % (max, 2. 03 %) between 16 and 300 min. The mean deviation after changing the target from 3 micro g/mL to 1, 2, 4, or 5 micro g/mL ranged from 1. 15 % to 17. 76 %. This pocket-sized TCI <b>slide</b> <b>rule</b> combines the advantages of minimal financial and technical cost with reasonable accuracy.
