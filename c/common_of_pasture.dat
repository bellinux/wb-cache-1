The adaptation and formalization of PES to the context <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>pastures</b> are <b>of</b> great interest in the developing countries.

The interest of PES is discussed first in light of a rapid assessment of two Morocc{{an incentive}} based experiences for pasturelands enclosure. The main lessons raise theoretical questions we tried to analyze by examining the role of economic rationality, organization and preferences of people in the common pastures with special regard to the decision formulation and the adoption of new management rules in the presence of an incentive. Moroccan experiences are analyzed on the basis of information from twenty semi-structured interviews with government actors and national experts. The results of our analyzes show a potential benefit of PES to promote the conservation <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>pastures</b> via enhanced and socially appropriate compliance and the need for a political vision accompanied by a redefinition of governance and suitable territorial scale able to sustain conservation...|$|R

Furthermore, Q methodology is {{used to assess the}} impact of broader contextual variables on the sustainability <b>of</b> <b>common</b> property <b>pastures.</b> It is shown that the strongest associations exist between (a) socio-economic attributes and change in livestock endowment; (b) norms and appropriation behaviour; and (c) area and pay-off and provision behaviour. Relevant contextual variables are the economic value of the resource units, off-farm income opportunities, and the subsidy structure.

30|$|Pastoral herding in dryland Africa {{was long}} {{misunderstood}} by scholars, governments and institutions. Pastoralists were generally blamed for their illogical over-accumulation of cattle, their alleged mismanagement <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>pastures,</b> which {{was said to}} lead to overgrazing and land degradation, and the mobility of their herds, which was perceived as irrational straying by animals. Fortunately, since the mid- 1990 s, as Turner (2011) shows in his recent review, these views have been challenged by a ‘new pastoral development paradigm’ that ‘incorporates a widespread acceptance {{of the importance of}} livestock mobility within the context of devolving greater rangeland management authority to local groups’. Pastoral mobility and management <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>pastures</b> were revalued, and scholars evidenced the efficiency of pastoralism in the Sudano-Sahelian region of West Africa (Turner et al. 2014). But, regrettably, this scholarly consensus has had difficulty imposing itself in policy and development arenas (Hagmann and Ifejika-Speranza 2010). And finally, abstract conceptualization of mobility, which does not match ground reality, and outdated analysis of pastoralism still underpin livestock policies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Laws that deal with pastoral mobility generally fail to protect the resources the pastoralists need (Mattee and Shem 2006; Mwangi 2009).|$|R
40|$|Stinting – the {{numerical}} limitation of grazing rights – {{was one of}} the primary methods for governing livestock numbers on common land in England. This paper charts the growth of stinting, explores the reasons behind its introduction, and considers the role of stinting in sustainable management of grazing reserves and in the evolution of concepts of property rights on common land since the medieval period. It is argued that growing pressure on grazing was only one driver behind the introduction of stinting and that some stinted rights in upland northern England originated in agistment on private forest pastures. The paper also considers the consequences of stinting, one of which was to convert a <b>common</b> right <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> into a more adaptable, transferable and potentially profitable commodity, which could be severed from the holding to which it originally belonged, breaking a link which lay {{at the heart of the}} law on commons...|$|R
50|$|On most <b>commons,</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> and pannage {{for each}} {{commoner}} are tightly defined by number {{and type of}} animal, {{and by the time}} of year when certain rights could be exercised. For example, the occupier of a particular cottage might be allowed to graze fifteen cattle, four horses, ponies or donkeys, and fifty geese, whilst the numbers allowed for their neighbours would probably be different. On some commons (such as the New Forest and adjoining commons), the rights are not limited by numbers, and instead a marking fee is paid each year for each animal turned out. However, if excessive use was made <b>of</b> the <b>common,</b> for example, in overgrazing, a common would be stinted, that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure. Thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further.|$|R

The number of active users here is decreasing, and those who have more animals are increasingly grazing their animals on long-term leased or private land, thus effectively no longer participating in the commons.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{examines the}} management and sustainability <b>of</b> wood <b>pasture</b> on the <b>commons</b> <b>of</b> Norfolk from the medieval period until the early nineteenth century. It has been generally accepted that areas <b>of</b> <b>common</b> wood <b>pasture</b> were particularly unstable environments, subject to overgrazing and tree removal with little means of maintaining the dual resources <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> and wood. However, evidence from the populous and intensively farmed county of Norfolk challenges that assertion. Using sources including manorial records, manuscript maps and the documentation associated with Parliamentary Enclosure this paper demonstrates that individual tenants and groups of commoners defended their right to use and maintain wooded common pastures. Manorial records defined customary rights to manage existing pollards and for the regular planting of young trees on commons. Peasant farmers continued to exercise these rights throughout {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries and, when challenged, took their grievances to the law courts, making full use of the contemporary judicial system. The evidence from Norfolk suggests that wood pastures were managed and replenished by those with common rights, who sustained this resource despite opposition and the potential for overuse. Only when the commons themselves succumbed to Enclosure in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century did common wood pasture cease to be a customary part of the Norfolk landscape...|$|R

Mean plot species richness was used as a measure of local species richness (= α diversity) and regional species richness was estimated at the pasture level (= γ diversity) with the ‘first-order-Jackknife’ estimator. Three related issues were addressed: (i) the role of estimated regional species richness and variables operating at the local scale (vegetation structure and diversity) in determining local species richness; (ii) quantification of the relative contributions of α and β diversity to regional diversity using additive partitioning; and (iii) the occurrence of consistent patterns in different years by analysing independently between-year data. Species assemblages of spiders were saturated at the local scale (similar local species richness and increasing β-diversity in richer regions) and were more dependent on vegetational structure than regional species richness. Sucking insect herbivores, by contrast, exhibited a linear relationship between local and regional species richness, consistent with the proportional sampling model. The patterns were consistent between years. These results imply that for spiders local processes are important, with assemblages in a particular patch being constrained by habitat structure.
