Shashenok received deep thermal and radiation burns over his entire body when the overpressure spike destroyed the isolation membranes and the impulse pipes of the manometers in his instrument room just before the explosion, which then demolished the room itself. The landing was found damaged, covered with ankle-deep water, and there were leaks of boiling water and radioactive steam. Shashenok was found unconscious in Room 604, pinned under a fallen beam, with bloody foam coming out of his mouth. His body was severely contaminated by radioactive water. He was carried out by Gorbachenko and Palamarchuk and died at 6:00 am in the Pripyat hospital under care of the chief physician, Leonenko Vitaliy, without regaining consciousness.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Circulation in industrial boiler is the continuous supply of water to the boiler heated tubes in order to sustain steady steam output without overheating tubes. Adequate circulation occurs when there is sufficient flow of water into tubes for adequate cooling. In natural circulation industrial boiler system the rate of flow in the circulation system is governed by flow resistances and differences in density between downcomer tube circuits and heated riser circuits. Control of these resistances allows adequate flow of water to parallel circuits. Adequate water flow through the boiler's heat absorbing circuits is necessary to cool the tubes. To insure proper boiler circulation, a simple, clear and comprehensive approach will be described in this paper covering all aspects in boiler circulation analysis. The analysis will detail all boiler <b>circulation</b> <b>circuits</b> explaining all forces imposed on them including thermosyphon as well as friction forces. ej 201...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the results of a computational analysis into the thin-wall sample cooling during in-pile irradiation in a two-body ampoule channel with heat transfer by natural convection. A two-body design of the channel makes it possible to change the channel wall heat resistance with the channel heat leak regulation by varying the gas composition and pressure inside the gap between the bodies. The purpose of the study is to determine the feasible sample cooling conditions in the considered channel. The computational analysis was based on a thermal-hydraulic code, RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2. For the calculations, helium and nitrogen were assumed to be the filling gas for the gap between the bodies. Major regularities in the variation of irradiation temperatures have been shown depending on the power density in the channel and irradiation device structural materials, the <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> height, and the channel wall heat resistance. By varying the <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> height and the power density in the structural materials, it is possible to provide inside the ampoule channel the sample cooling temperatures in a range from the circumambient primary coolant temperature to the boiling temperature at a given pressure (50 – 331 °C). With no coolant boiling on samples and with the maximum (8 m) <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> height, not more than 55 kW (14 W/g on samples) is removed when helium is used as the gap filling gas and not more than 15 kW (3. 7 W/g on samples) is removed when nitrogen is used, while, with the minimum (1 m) <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> height, the respective values are not more than 10 kW (2. 5 W/g on samples) and 5 kW (1. 2 W/g on samples) ...|$|E

Not only now was it feasible and justifiable to treat formerly inoperable patients, this new treatment options also made it possible to shift patients with very high operative risk and expected poor outcome to alternative ways of aortic valve implantation as transcatheter (TAVI) and Sutureless prostheses. The previous decision of performing conventional surgery in a very high risk patient or leaving him with a very bad quality of life suddenly had a third option.

Finally, the left renal vein was reconstructed by suturing to the artificial graft. Therefore, the bilateral kidneys were protected from ischemia or congestion during the operation, and postoperative renal function was preserved.|$|E
40|$|The safety {{basis for}} RBMK {{reactors}} follows generally used safety principles of “defence in depth”. In-service inspection has revealed widespread intergranular {{stress corrosion cracking}} in the safety related austenitic piping of the main <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> in RBMK reactors. IGSCC in the safety related main <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> piping of RBMK reactors increases the probability of core damage due to pipe break. Therefore, IGSCC in RBMK reactors is an important safety issue. Operators of BWR reactors in western countries experienced a similar problem starting in the late 1970 ’s. As a consequence, successful strategies for managing IGSCC degradation in BWR reactors were developed. Design differences between BWR and RBMK reactors preclude the use of BWR strategies without adapting the technology to the RBMK case. Recognising {{the importance of this}} issue the IAEA organised a Workshop on “Environmental Assisted Cracking of NPP Austenitic Stainless Steel Piping ” [1] and subsequently an experts’ meeting on this issue specifically for RBMK reactors [2] in 1998. Experts who participated concluded that a comprehensive programme is needed to address the issues of IGSCC in all RBMK reactors. The experts meeting in October 1998 developed project outlines for seven technical areas that were felt necessary to address IGSCC in RBMK designed reactors. To coordinate the efforts of these projects the IAEA convened the first meeting of the most general and broadest scope group, the Safety Assessment Group with the objective to advise on the overall programme planning, co-ordination and prioritisation. 2.

40|$|Based on the {{equations}} of energy, mass and momentum conservation for the three-dimensional unsteady {{flow of the}} two-phase mixture, simulations were made of reactor plant disturbed cooling condition modes caused by the VVER secondary circuit using computer thermohydraulic codes. The use of computer codes to investigate these modes {{makes it possible to}} analyze transient and some emergency processes, without involving the industrial testing method; this helps create a basis for solving the problems of reliability, operational safety, and efficiency of nuclear power plants. A modern nuclear reactor is a complex system which cannot be investigated or calculated by using only simple theoretical models. Thermohydraulic calculations are an essential part of most of the design and technological developments in the nuclear power industry. Since the NPP conditions exclude the traditional technical way to check and specify the results and conclusions of an aprioristic analysis based on industrial testing, in some instances, it is possible to examine and predict the parameters of thermohydraulic processes in the reactor <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> involving computer simulations. The primary objective of this work is to calculate and investigate reactor disturbed plant cooling condition modes caused by the VVER secondary circuit in order to determine whether the calculated parameters conform to the acceptance criteria established in the regulatory documents. Based on the RELAP- 5, TRAC, and TRACE software codes, reactor plant cooling condition malfunction modes caused by the VVER- 1000 secondary circuit were simulated and investigated. Experimental data on the mode with the turbine-generator stop valve closing are presented. The obtained dependences made it possible to determine the maximum values of pressure and temperature in the <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> as well as estimate the Minimum Critical Heat Flux Ratio (MCHFR). It has been found that, if any of the initial events occurs, safety systems are activated according to the set points; transient processes are stabilized in time; and the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) limit is provided.

Recently, some authors have suggested that MECC may be an alternative to OPCAB in patients undergoing CABG; the aim of this article is to systematically analyze and compare the impact of CABG with MECC with that of OPCAB, studying the adverse outcomes related to CECC. We performed a systematic search to identify all studies directly comparing OPCAB and MECC. Endpoints were subcategorized into four key areas of interest: length of stay (LOS), hemorrhage, cerebrovascular injury, and 30 -day mortality. Random effect modeling techniques were applied to identify differences in outcomes between the two groups. Six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, incorporating 2, 072 patients of whom 930 underwent OPCAB and 1, 142 underwent revascularization supported by MECC.

40|$|Two common {{factors that}} can cause {{complications}} with indwelling biomedical devices are thrombus and infection. Nitric oxide (NO) {{is known to be}} a potent inhibitor of platelet activation and an antimicrobial agent. In this dissertation work, two novel approaches to achieving long-term NO release from polymers were studied and evaluated for their potential biomedical applications. First, S-nitroso-N-acetypenicillamine (SNAP) -doped Elast-eon E 2 As creates an inexpensive polymer that can locally deliver physiologically relevant levels of NO. SNAP was found to be stable in E 2 As during shelf-life stability and ethylene oxide sterilization studies. The SNAP/E 2 As polymer was coated on the inner walls of extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> (ECC) <b>circuits</b> and was found to preserve the platelet count at ~ 100 % of baseline and reduce thrombus area after 4 h blood flow in a rabbit model. The SNAP/E 2 As polymer was also used to fabricate NO-releasing catheters that were implanted in sheep veins for 7 d. The SNAP/E 2 As catheters significantly reduced the amount of thrombus and bacterial adhesion. In the second approach, the NO release from diazeniumdiolated dibutylhexanediamine (DBHD/N 2 O 2) -doped polymers was significantly improved using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) additives. Acid-capped PLGA additives were found to cause high initial bursts of NO, while ester-capped PLGA additives extended the NO release for up to 14 d. Poly(vinyl chloride) - and Elast-eon E 2 As were used as the base polymers for combined DBHD/N 2 O 2 and PLGA coatings on the inner walls of ECC circuits. After 4 h of blood flow, the E 2 As-based NOrel circuits preserved platelets at a higher level than PVC-based NOrel circuits (97 % and 80 % of baseline, respectively). This demonstrates that the inherent hemocompatibility properties of the base polymer can also influence the efficiency of the NO release coatings. A DBHD/N 2 O 2 -doped SG- 80 A polymer material was also studied and used to fabricate patches that were applied to scald burn wounds infected with Acinetobacter baumannii. The NO released from these patches applied to the wounds is shown to significantly reduce the A. baumannii infection after 24 h.

40|$|Background: Endothelium-derived microparticles (EMPs) are {{submicron}} vesicles {{released from}} the plasma membrane of endothelial cells in response to injury, apoptosis or activation. We have previously demonstrated EMP-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in animal models and endothelial barrier dysfunction in vitro. Current treatment options for ALI are limited and consist of supportive therapies. We hypothesize that standard clinical continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) reduces serum EMP levels and may be adapted as a potential therapeutic intervention. Materials and methods: EMPs were generated from plasminogen activation inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) -stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Flow cytometric {{analysis was used to}} characterize EMPs as CD 31 - and annexin V-positive events in a submicron size gate. Enumeration was completed against a known concentration of latex beads. Ultimately, a concentration of ~ 650, 000 EMP/mL perfusate fluid (total 470 mL) was circulated through a standard CVVH filter (pore size 200 μm, flow rate 250 mL/hr) for a period of 70 minutes. 0. 5 mL aliquots were removed at 5 - to 10 -minute intervals for flow cytometric analysis. EMP concentration in the dialysate was measured at the end of 4 hours to better understand the fate of EMPs. Results: A progressive decrease in circulating EMP concentration was noted using standard CVVH at 250 mL/hr (a clinical standard rate) from a 470 mL volume modelling a patient's circulation. A 50 % reduction was noted within the first 30 minutes. EMPs entering the dialysate after 4 hours were 5. 7 % of the EMP original concentration. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that standard CVVH can remove EMPs from <b>circulation</b> in a <b>circuit</b> modelling a patient. An animal model of hemofiltration with induction of EMP release is required to test the therapeutic potential of this finding and potential of application in early treatment of ALI...|$|R
40|$|Activation of {{coagulation}} during hemodialysis (HD) is {{a relevant}} clinical problem, especially when patients {{at risk of}} bleeding are treated. However, {{little is known about}} the relative contribution of the various components of the circuit to the thrombotic process. Thus, an experimental model was developed that is aimed at evaluating biochemical markers of coagulation activation at different times and sites throughout the HD circuit. A HD blood-tubing set with integrated arterial and venous chambers (cartridge-line set) was used, which was added with the following sampling points: at the beginning of the arterial line (P 1), before the blood pump (P 2), after the blood pump (P 3), and at the end of the venous line (P 4). A bypass system allowed us to circulate the blood only into the blood lines for the first 20 min of the extracorporeal <b>circulation.</b> The extracorporeal <b>circuit</b> was rinsed with 1. 7 L of heparinized saline (2, 500 IU/L) that was completely discarded before patient connection. A continuous administration of unfractionated heparin (500 - 800 IU/h) without a starting bolus was adopted as a low heparin extracorporeal treatment. Samples were collected before the start of the extracorporeal circulation from the fistula needle (T 0 P 0), after 5 (T 1), 10 (T 2), and 20 min (T 3) from P 1, P 2, P 3, and P 4. After 20 min, the blood was returned to the patient using only saline and HD was then started, circulating the blood through the dialyzer. Further samples were obtained from P 1 and P 4 after 5 (T 4) and 210 min (T 5). Plasma levels of coagulation activation markers-thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2) -were evaluated in all the samples in 12 stable HD patients. In each patient, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was measured at T 0 P 0 and T 1 -T 5 from P 1. No significant changes were found at any time as far as F 1 + 2 is concerned. However, TAT levels increased over time only after the start of HD, suggesting that the latter test could be more useful in order to detect coagulation activation during HD. The same experiments performed with nonheparin-primed extracorporeal circuit showed similar results. The blood lines used did not significantly activate coagulation during the first 20 min, whereas only 5 min of blood circulation throughout the whole circuit increased TAT values, which still remained lower than previous reports, even after 210 min of treatment...|$|R
40|$|The main {{goals of}} the {{research}} project carried out in this thesis have been: - to design a teaching-learning sequence about electric circuits to be implemented in a teacher education scenario with the aim of: identifying conceptual nodes; promoting the overcoming of difficulties related to conceptual shifts from a local to a global perspective and from a sequential to a systemic reasoning; enhancing prospective teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge and competencies of developing suitable teaching plans, - to study {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed teaching-learning sequence. Two pillars constituted the methodological framework of this thesis work: the Educational Reconstruction Model and the Pedagogical Content Knowledge construct. The model of Educational Reconstruction has been adopted to inform the overall design of this thesis work and of the proposed teaching-learning sequence which is based on an innovative approach called “Functional Approach”. The construct of Pedagogical Content Knowledge has been adopted as reference model to inform the methodology enacted in the validation process of the proposed teaching-learning sequence The thesis work was informed by the rich science education literature about electric circuits, the history of the development of electric circuits’ theory and preliminary studies carried out in informal learning contexts. From the literature review, we found that alternative reasoning strategies and incorrect models of current <b>circulation</b> in electric <b>circuits</b> (as, e. g., the “Current Consumption” or the “Clashing Currents” and the “battery as a constant current source” issues) are mainly related to the failure in performing the “local to global” and “sequential to systemic” transitions. The historical analysis allowed to identify the Equivalent Circuit and the Equivalent Resistance as key concepts to help students to overcome such difficulties. Moreover, preliminary studies about logic circuits (i. e. circuits with a battery, a bulb and one or two switches) suggested to adopt them as typical examples of electric circuits to be treated as unique systems, characterized by a well defined functioning. Equivalent circuit, equivalent resistance and logic circuits constitute the conceptual references of the innovative approach developed in this thesis work, namely the Functional Approach. The Functional Approach has been exploited to inform the design of a 8 -hours teaching-learning sequence and adapted to a teacher education scenario in order to promote prospective and in-service teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge about electric circuits. The actual design of the teaching-learning activities called for some preliminary studies which involved primary and middle school students in an informal setting. The evaluation of the teaching-learning sequence involved in-service middle school and prospective primary teachers. These results have informed the subsequent optimization of the teaching-learning sequenc...|$|R
40|$|Rationale and Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{feasibility}} and accuracy of three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction techniques for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in planning and evaluation of minimally invasive image-controlled therapy. Materials and Methods. Using a standard, commercially available system, the authors acquired DSA images and corrected them for inherent distortions. They designed and implemented parallel and multiresolution versions of cone-beam reconstruction techniques to reconstruct high-resolution targeted volumes in a short period of time. Testing was performed on anatomically correct, calibrated in vitro models of a cerebral aneurysm. These models were used with a pulsatile <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> to allow for blood flow simulation during DSA, computed tomographic (CT) angiography, and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography image acquisitions. Results. The multiresolution DSA-based reconstruction protocol and its implementation allowed the authors to achieve reconstruction times and levels of accuracy for the volume measurement of the aneurysmal cavities that were considered compatible with actual clinical practice. Comparison with data obtained from other imaging modalities shows that, besides vascular tree depiction, the DSA-based true 3 D technique provides volume estimates at least as good as those obtained from CT and MR angiography. Conclusion. The authors demonstrated the feasibility and potential of true 3 D reconstruction for angiographic imaging with DSA. On the basis of the model testing, this work addresses both the timing and quantification required to support minimally invasive image-controlled therapy...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveIncreasing {{evidence}} shows that some cardiac defects may benefit from fetal interventions, including fetal cardiac surgery. We attempted to develop an in vivo animal model of fetal cardiopulmonary bypass with cardioplegic arrest. MethodsOperations were performed on 14 pregnant goats. The extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> consisted of a centrifugal pump, silicone tubings with an inner diameter of 6 mm, a roller pump, and a reservoir. The placenta was the sole oxygenator. Cardiopulmonary bypass was maintained at a mean flow rate of 344 ± 68 mL/kg/min, including 30 minutes of cardiac arrest and 15 minutes of reperfusion. Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. Arterial blood samples were analyzed. The pulse index and resistance index of the fetal umbilical artery were monitored. ResultsExperiments were completed in 11 cases (79 %), with the fetuses weighing 0. 65 to 1. 8 kg. Fetal mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate remained stable throughout the experiments. A decrease in partial pressure of oxygen with concomitant increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure was noted, but trends were relatively stable. Metabolic acidosis was recognized during and after cardiac bypass. The pulse index and resistance index of the umbilical artery increased significantly after 2 hours off bypass. ConclusionsWe confirmed the technical feasibility of establishing an in vivo model of fetal cardiac bypass with cardioplegic arrest. This fetal goat model provides reproducible data and is suitable to study clinically relevant problems related to fetal cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial protection, and hemodynamics...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cardiopulmonary bypass {{components}} need to {{be tested}} on an animal model before their clinical application. Because their weight {{is similar to that}} of man, the calf and pig are often used. This study compares the impact of prolonged perfusion on hemolysis and hematology profile in both species. METHODS: Three calves (mean bodyweight: 77. 2 +/- 4. 4 kg) and three pigs (80 +/- 5. 3 kg) were connected to an extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> by jugular venous and carotid arterial cannulation, with a mean flow rate of 3. 5 L/min for 6 h. After 7 days, the animals were sacrificed. A standard battery of blood samples was taken before, throughout, and 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after bypass. ANOVA was used for repeated measurements. RESULTS: Absolute values of red cell count were higher in the calf (p< 0. 001), while normalized values were higher in the pig (p< 0. 001). Absolute values of white cell count were higher in the pig, while normalized values diverged toward the end of the perfusion with an increase in the calf and a decrease in the pig (p< 0. 001). Free plasma Hb and LDH exhibited similar profiles in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of prolonged perfusion, species type [...] bovine or porcine [...] has an impact on hematology profile, but not on hemolytic parameters. These findings should be taken into account when cardiopulmonary bypass components are tested...|$|E
40|$|International audienceArgillaceous {{formations}} {{are thought}} to be suitable natural barriers to the release of radionuclides from a radioactive waste repository. However, the safety assessment of a waste repository hosted by an argillaceous rock requires knowledge of several properties of the host rock such as the hydraulic conductivity, diffusion properties and the pore water composition. This paper presents an experimental design that allows the determination of these three types of parameters on the same cylindrical rock sample. The reliability of this method was evaluated using a core sample from a well-investigated indurated argillaceous formation, the Opalinus Clay from the Mont Terri Underground Research Laboratory (URL) (Switzerland). In this test, deuterium- and oxygen- 18 -depleted water, bromide and caesium were injected as tracer pulses in a reservoir drilled in the centre of a cylindrical core sample. The evolution of these tracers was monitored by means of samplers included in a <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> for a period of 204 days. Then, a hydraulic test (pulse-test type) was performed. Finally, the core sample was dismantled and analysed to determine tracer profiles. Diffusion parameters determined for the four tracers are consistent with those previously obtained from laboratory through-diffusion and in-situ diffusion experiments. The reconstructed initial pore-water composition (chloride and water stable-isotope concentrations) was also consistent with those previously reported. In addition, the hydraulic test led to an estimate of hydraulic conductivity in good agreement with that obtained from in-situ tests...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} an experimental study into the thermal-hydraulic {{performance of the}} VK- 300 reactor based on {{a model of a}} single draft tube at a pressure of 3. 4 MPa, various flow rates and the model inlet relative enthalpies of – 0. 05 to 0. 2. The experimental procedures include generation of a steam-water mixture circulation with a preset flow rate and a relative enthalpy through the test section at a pressure of 3. 3 to 3. 4 MPa, and measurement of thermal-hydraulic parameters within the circuit's representative upflow and downflow lengths of practical interest. There have been confirmed the designs used to support the reactor facility serviceability and the assumptions concerning the thermal-hydraulic performance of a natural <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> used in the analysis thereof. It has been shown that, across the analyzed range of the relative enthalpy values, the draft tube has an annular-dispersed or an annular flow of the steam-water mixture, both providing for the significant separation of the steam-water mixture (Ksep= 0. 4) at the draft tube edges and in the mixing chamber. The perforation in {{the upper part of the}} draft tubes allows the separation coefficient to be increased at the first stage and creates more favorable conditions for the second-stage separation. The measured values of the void fraction in the mixing chamber and in the draft tube are in a satisfactory agreement with calculations based on Z. L. Miropolskiy's method and the RELAP code and may be used to verify the VK- 300 thermal-hydraulic codes. It has been shown that steam may enter the ring slit that simulates the annular space and reach the reactor core inlet. Further investigations need to be conducted to study this effect for its guaranteed exclusion and for the development of emergency response procedures...|$|E
40|$|Recently, an {{oxygenator}} with {{an integrated}} centrifugal blood pump (IP) {{was designed to}} minimize priming volume and to reduce blood foreign surface contact even further. The use of this oxygenator with or without integrated arterial filter was compared with a conventional oxygenator and nonintegrated centrifugal pump. To compare the air removal characteristics 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were alternately assigned into one of three groups to be perfused with a minimized extracorporeal circuit either with the conventional oxygenator, the oxygenator with IP, or the oxygenator with IP plus integrated arterial filter (IAF). Air entering and leaving the three devices was measured accurately with a bubble counter during cardiopulmonary bypass. No significant differences between all groups were detected, considering air entering the devices. Our major finding was that in both integrated devices groups incidental spontaneous release of air into the arterial line in approximately 40 % of the patients was observed. Here, detectable bolus air (> 500 µm) was shown in the arterial line, whereas in the minimal extracorporeal <b>circulation</b> <b>circuit</b> (MECC) group this phenomenon was not present. We decided to conduct an amendment of the initial design with METC-approval. Ten patients were assigned to be perfused with an oxygenator with IP and IAF. Importantly, the integrated perfusion systems used in these patients were flushed with carbon dioxide (CO 2) prior to priming of the systems. In the group with CO 2 flush no spontaneous air release was observed in all cases and this was {{significantly different from the}} initial study with the group with the integrated device and IAF. This suggests that air spilling may be caused by residual air in the integrated device. In conclusion, integration of a blood pump may cause spontaneous release of large air bubbles (> 500 µm) into the arterial line, despite the presence of an integrated arterial filter. CO 2 flushing of an integrated cardiopulmonary bypass system prior to priming may prevent spontaneous air release and is strongly recommended to secure patient safet...|$|E
