40|$|In this work, {{triggered}} by the initial suggestion and the preliminary results obtained at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), we have explored the possible application of a microwave resonant cavity to realise a reference standard hygrometer. Particularly, we have measured the microwave resonance frequencies of a small volume (69 cm^ 3) triaxial elipsoidal cavity to determine the water vapor mole fraction x_w of H 2 O/N 2 and H 2 O/air mixtures. The mixtures were prepared using the INRiM standard humidity generator for frost-point temperatures T_fp in the range between 241 K and 270 K and a commercial two-pressure humidity generator operated at dew-point temperature T_dp between 272 K and 291 K. Following these tests, we demonstrated {{the performance of the}} QSR operated as a <b>condensation</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> For this demonstration, a suitable experiment was prepared in cooperation with the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), which allowed to compare the performance of the QSR with that of a calibrated chilled-mirror hygrometer. Finally, with the aim of reducing the uncertainty currently associated to the literature values of the constants in the Debye equation, we have measured the dielectric constant of pure water vapour in the temperature range from 320 K to 470 K at pressures up to 1. 7 MPa. As a whole, the results obtained in these experiments demonstrated the validity and satisfactory performance of the microwave technique for hygrometr...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{was carried}} out inside of the {{temperature}} and humidity laboratory (LabTH) of the Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA), which is the Spanish Designated Institute (DI) for the field of humidity and, therefore, holder {{of the national standards}} in such quantity. Among many other duties of a DI are to promote and participate in national and international R&D projects whose goals set were in line with those scored in the last European Roadmaps for the hygrometry field, for this particular case. For these reasons, and as a part of such participation in research projects, it is essential to emphasize that part of this thesis was developed inside of the framework of the joint research project “ENG 01 -Gas. Characterization of Energy Gases” which running under the European Metrology Research Program (EMRP), with the main target of supporting the natural gas industry to overcome its current big challenges. Moisture content is a key factor inside the natural gas (NG) industry. Not only does decrease the efficiency of the final product when the water content is high, but it can also trigger potentially dangerous conditions due to the formation of hydrates, that can block pipelines and damage pumping devices and produce other negative effects. For these reasons, accurate measurement and control of humidity is essential in all processing step of natural gas. However, current practice for such moisture measurements is for the devices to be calibrated at atmospheric pressure and in nitrogen or air as the matrix gas, conditions that vary significantly from those present in the actual industrial process, so their performance in real industrial conditions could be much smaller than expected and even insufficient. Besides, technologies traditionally used by NG industry, such us, <b>condensation</b> <b>hygrometers</b> and metal oxide capacitive probes, have some drawbacks that not always allow to measure and control humidity of NG with the accuracy and reliability desired.
