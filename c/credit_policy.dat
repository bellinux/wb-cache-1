In particular, it assesses the <b>credit</b> <b>policies</b> of the Macedonian banks and whether and how the policies were amended following the global recession. The research is based on a qualitative approach using interviews with senior and middle managers in eight out of total of fourteen banks in Macedonia to analyze the changes in their <b>credit</b> <b>policies</b> due to the 2008 financial crisis. The results indicate that the <b>credit</b> <b>policies</b> of the Macedonian banks are conservative in both observed periods. Yet, the financial crisis was affecting banking credits by tightening their <b>credit</b> <b>policies</b> and procedurs. The results of this research might be of interest for ongoing improvement of the banks` credit and risk management, {{as well as for the}} policy makers to prevent future financial crises...|$|R

25|$|A typical cycle {{begins with}} a {{relaxation}} of central government credit and industrial policy. This allows local governments to push investment aggressively, both through state-sector entities they control directly and by offering investment-promotion incentives to private investors and enterprises outside their jurisdictions. The resulting boom puts upward pressure on prices and may also result in shortages of key inputs such as coal and electricity (as {{was the case in}} 2003). Once inflation has risen to a level at which it begins to threaten social stability, the central government will intervene by tightening enforcement of industrial and <b>credit</b> <b>policy.</b> Projects that went ahead without required approvals will be halted. Bank lending to particular types of investors will be restricted. Credit then becomes tight and investment growth begins to decline.|$|E

Seeing the big agriculture sector’s need for crediting, this paper is focused on <b>credit</b> <b>policies</b> of micro financial institutions, by emphasizing their impact in the development of agriculture. Since the number of micro financial institutions in Kosovo is quite big and analyzing the <b>crediting</b> <b>policies</b> of all of them is impossible, for comparing analyzes this paper focuses in three of them.   Several clients of the micro financial institutions were surveyed to check the impact that the loans they took had on the development of their agricultural activity. The survey includes the entire territory of Kosovo, meaning, clients of different regions were surveyed including minority-inhabited zones. Micro loan has become a support for many farmers, artisans and traders of various Kosovo rural zones. The micro loan makes it possible to have access to financial services for funding small projects in the field of agriculture, cattle-raising or in service sectors, such as artisans, small grocery shops, etc. The main goals of this research is to analyze the <b>credit</b> <b>policies</b> of MFIs operating in Kosovo and their impact in development of agriculture; a comparative analyses of impact of these <b>credit</b> <b>policies</b> in development of agriculture and identification of new <b>crediting</b> <b>policies</b> that might impact further agricultural development...|$|R
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Panic of 1819—the first major financial crisis in United States history—the primary political issue of the day was debt relief. [...] The federal government had created the Second Bank of the United States in 1817, and its strict <b>credit</b> <b>policy</b> hit Kentucky's large debtor class hard. [...] Sitting governor Gabriel Slaughter had lobbied for some measures favored by the state's debtors, particularly punitive taxes against the branches of the Bank of the United States in Louisville and Lexington. [...] The Second Party System had not yet developed, but there were nonetheless two opposing factions that arose around the debt relief issue. The first—primarily composed of land speculators who had bought large land parcels on credit and were unable to repay their debts due to the financial crisis—was dubbed the Relief Party (or [...] "faction") and favored more legislation favorable to debtors. [...] Opposed to them was the Anti-Relief Party; it was composed primarily of the state's aristocracy, many of whom were creditors to the land speculators and demanded that their contracts be adhered to without interference from the government. [...] They claimed that no government intervention could effectively aid the debtors and that attempts to do so would only prolong the economic depression.|$|E

At the time both HBOS and the CBA reported provisions for remaining consideration of circa $300 million. The acquisition was completed on 19 December 2008. (refer note 14 of the CBA 11 February 2009 half year profit announcement). The BankWest performing loan book as at 18 December 2008, had a value of approximately $57 billion, $18 billion of which were S (Standard and Poors) rated B+ or worse.(Refer the BankWest <b>Credit</b> <b>Policy,</b> the BankWest 2008A financial statements and the CBA Answers to Questions on Notice to the Parliamentary Inquiry(PJC)). As at 18 December 2008 BankWest owed its Parent HBOS a net figure of $21,076 million, and HBOS had secured a further $3,767 million loan from the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) to support the funding of the BankWest loan book. The BankWest Parent Company Funding therefore can be calculated as $17.3 billion being ($21,076 million minus $3,767 million). On completion, the CBA paid $14.513 to HBOS and $3,767 million to the RBA [...] leaving a loan from HBOS to the CBA of $2,797 million called the Excess Facility Amount loan.|$|E

They emphasize participatory government intervention, wherein <b>credit</b> <b>policies</b> could be viewed as part of an internal allocation mechanism: government, banks, and large industrial firms may be said to have formed what the authors call a "government led internal organization" (GLIO). They examine the theoretical foundations for this view and discuss the implications for the efficiency of credit allocations. They argue that in early economic development such a participatory approach may have helped overcome pervasive market imperfections. But there were also significant dangers: problems of entrenched interests and institutional inertia. In both countries, the relative importance of GLIO gradually diminished as competitive capital markets and large conglomerates ("privately led internal government organizations") expanded with economic growth...|$|R
