It basically executes a portion of algorithm 1, the section between the two gather sections. This is intuitive, since in a non-coordinated scenario, user demands are kept within providers. Since the data pertaining to users demands are estimated using statistical techniques that are stochastic, hence, once the demands are generated, the demand vector for users are used for both the coordinated and non-coordinated counterparts. Besides, for the simulation purposes, the number of cloud providers have been limited to 10, so we do not use statistical methods to further complicate scenarios, rather consider a fixed set of combinations of users for each of the 10 cloud providers.|$|R

External connectivity of the facility to other tiers of the Large Hadron Collider Optical Private Network (LHCOPN) is largely via dedicated lightpaths as required to meet Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) commitments. Our primary dedicated link to CERN has an independent, although smaller capacity, dedicated backup link for redundancy. Dedicated lightpaths to the Canadian Tier- 2 facilities, and the international partner Tier- 1 facilities failover to national and international research networks in the event of failure. The distance between TRIUMF and CERN, and even TRIUMF to some of it's Tier- 2 facilities in Canada is thousands of kilometers. Transferring data at the hundreds of terabytes of data level (per year) over such distances and complex networks requires both dedicated bandwidth and network resiliency. Failure scenario, including both failover and fail-back, must be handled efficiently {{and for the most part}} automatically. Although modern network routing protocols handle this well, monitoring processes become key to management of the infrastructure as the complexity of our Tier- 1 site connectivity grows. Internal networking efficiency is also vital to the ATLAS computing model.

One goal is to reduce waste and maximize value, and other goals include improving the quality of the design and the reducing the time to achieve the final solution. The method has been used in architecture, healthcare, product development, processes design, information technology systems, and even to create lean business models.

Participants’ resource levels moderate this relationship. While, extant literature on legislative behavior finds that Congress is more likely to reflect the preferences of white and affluent constituents than their low <b>resource</b> <b>counterparts,</b> I make the counterintuitive argument that following collective action legislators are often more likely to represent the preferences of low resource collective action participants.

40|$|Mobile-edge {{computation}} offloading (MECO) offloads intensive mobile computation to clouds {{located at}} the edges of cellular networks. Thereby, MECO is envisioned as a promising technique for prolonging the battery lives and enhancing the computation capacities of mobiles. In this paper, we study resource allocation for a multiuser MECO system based on time-division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). First, for the TDMA MECO system with infinite or finite computation capacity, the optimal resource allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem for minimizing the weighted sum mobile energy consumption under the constraint on computation latency. The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based structure with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields priorities for users according to their channel gains and local computing energy consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given threshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Moreover, for the cloud with finite capacity, a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is proposed to reduce the computation complexity for computing the threshold. Next, we consider the OFDMA MECO system, for which the optimal resource allocation is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer problem. To solve this challenging problem and characterize its policy structure, a sub-optimal low-complexity algorithm is proposed by transforming the OFDMA problem to its TDMA <b>counterpart.</b> The corresponding <b>resource</b> allocation is derived by defining an average offloading priority function and shown to have close-to-optimal performance by simulation.

Although thermodynamics-based resource accounting methods are available for calculating overall resource efficiency from a life cycle perspective, their accounting for bio productive land resources as an input during quantification of efficiencies is unclear. This paper aims {{to fill the gap}} in scientific literature about how to calculate a cumulative overall resource efficiency indicator by developing a framework, called Cumulative Overall Resource Efficiency Assessment (COREA). COREA (i) takes into account bio-productive land resources and (ii) addresses the non-renewable character of fossil resources. To account for bio-productive land resources, two methodological questions need to be addressed: 1) “how to define the system boundary of the solar energy input in the primary biomass production system?” and 2) “how to choose the temporal system boundary of this system?”. Resource efficiencies are calculated for three cases at crop level and two cases at bio-based product level. To account for the non-renewable character of fossil resources, we propose an accounting approach that includes the ancient solar energy consumption of fossil resources. This methodological choice is illustrated through comparing the resource efficiencies of the two bio-based products with their fossil-based counterparts. The results showed that the bio-based products only had a higher resource efficiency than their fossil-derived <b>counterparts</b> if fossil <b>resources</b> were considered as ancient consumers of solar energy.

However, despite its prevalence, the epidemiology of the disease is not uniform. The disease disproportionally affects minorities and those living in poverty. In the United States, the prevalence of the disease is not well understood in the American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) population. Some studies have identified significant variability across regions and therefore it is necessary to characterize the disease regionally. Here data from the cross-sectional survey, the 2009 California Health Interview Survey, is used to examine if the theory of resource deprivation explains the disparity in self-reported asthma attacks in AIAN asthmatic adults. The odds of an AIAN asthmatic adult reporting an asthma attack is 1. 71 times greater (95 % CI 1. 19, 2. 44) than his White asthmatic counterpart. After controlling for 7 variables addressing resource deprivation and smoking, the odds of an AIAN asthmatic adult reporting an asthma attack is 1. 57 times greater (95 % CI 1. 07, 2. 32) than his White <b>counterpart.</b> Though the <b>resource</b> deprivation variables examined here account for some of the disparity in asthma attack, the disparity remains significant, implying that there are other factors at work that must be identified in any future effort to eliminate the disparity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} assesses current {{patterns of}} socioeconomic inequalities in marriage and cohabitation along {{the dimensions of}} socioeconomic background, individual socioeconomic resources, and gender. Three broad groups of research questions are posed: When (i. e., the association between socioeconomic family background and timing of first union), with whom (i. e., partner choice with regard to education), and whether (i. e., whether or not cohabitors have definite plans to marry, whether cohabitors and those married differ with regard to relationship assessments, and whether women keep their given last name upon marriage). Of central importance is to investigate whether the patterns which have been found for marriage also apply to cohabitation. Synthesizing the findings, there clearly are continuing socioeconomic inequalities in union formation and relationship behavior. First, young adults with higher educated parents {{as well as those}} reporting material well being during childhood start their first unions later than those from less privileged backgrounds. Next, the majority of parental couples are educationally homogamous and cohabiting parental couples {{are more likely to be}} homogamous than their married <b>counterparts.</b> Also, socioeconomic <b>resources</b> are positively associated with cohabitors’ marriage plans. The marriage plans of female cohabitors are less affected by their education and income than their male counterparts. Moreover, cohabitors are overall less committed to and satisfied with their relationships than are married respondents. The views of cohabitors who intend to marry their partners, however, differ much less from those of married respondents than cohabitors with no marriage plans. Last, the vast majority of women still change to the husband’s surname when marrying and the likelihood of being a name keeper increases with women’s socioeconomic status. Women marrying between 1990 and 2002 were less likely to be name keepers than women marrying in the 1980 s...|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{world of}} digital technologies, {{cultural}} heritage institutions, particularly in developed countries, are seeking ways to create national digital memories {{for the future}} of the citizenry. However, rapidly developing technologies and their concomitant technological obsolescence put future memories at risk. The challenge is enormous in developing countries that, when compared to their developed <b>counterparts,</b> lack adequate <b>resources</b> and technologies for effective digital resources management and preservation. As a developing country, Ghana appears ready to face the challenges of effective digital resources management. The country has developed programmes and a national policy on information and communication technologies (ICTs) for accelerated development. However, Ghana does not appear to be effective in managing or preserving digital cultural heritage resources. An interpretive case research design involving 27 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from 23 institutions was used to explore the various contextual factors influencing the management and preservation of digital cultural heritage resources (or DPM). Rogers’ (2003) “diffusion of innovation” (DOI) theory and Davies’ (2000) “policy, strategy and resources” (PSR) troika model provided a basis for a preliminary model of factors to guide the research. Although the DPM innovation was not fully diffused in Ghana, related activities at the base, middle and higher levels of the Ghanaian social system were unintentionally fostering the adoption process. Four main clusters of contextual factors that were influencing the DPM adoption process in Ghana were identified: attitudinal, resources-related, policy-related, and managerial factors. Key stakeholders perceived the design of appropriate strategies, adequate resource allocation, and proper implementation of policies as key enabling factors for effective adoption of DPM in Ghana. However, a general lack of interest in cultural institutions (libraries, archives and museums) and in information management on the part of decision makers and the Ghanaian stakeholders as a whole was found to hinder DPM adoption. This study extends Information Systems (IS) research involving DOI theory and the PSR troika model into a developing country context. Attitudinal-based complexities involving misunderstandings among various tribal groups in Ghana, and resources-based complexities surrounding technology access and use, were found from the interview data and were added to the initial model which was expanded to aid in understanding the various contextual factors that influence DPM adoption in Ghana. In addition to the study contributing to theoretical understandings in IS research, it provides Ghanaian policy developers with an empirical base for accelerating adoption of DPM in Ghana. It also provides New Zealand and other digital preservation advanced countries with a deeper understanding from which to provide contextually designed advisory services to other developing countries (particularly in the Pacific Island regions) as it enables the contextual understanding of the factors from Ghana...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{programmable}} baseband processors {{are important}} to enable true multi-standard radio platforms as convergence of mobile communication devices and systems requires multi-standard processing devices. The processors do not only need the capability to handle differences in a single standard, often {{there is a great}} need to cover several completely different modulation methods such as OFDM and CDMA with the same processing device. Programmability {{can also be used to}} quickly adapt to new and updated standards within the ever changing wireless communication industry since a pure ASIC solution will not be flexible enough. ASIC solutions for multi-standard baseband processing are also less area efficient than their programmable <b>counterparts</b> since processing <b>resources</b> cannot be efficiently shared between different operations. However, as baseband processing is computationally demanding, traditional DSP architectures cannot be used due to their limited computing capacity. Instead VLIW- and SIMD-based processors are used to provide sufficient computing capacity for baseband applications. The drawback of VLIW-based DSPs is their low power efficiency due to the wide instructions that need to be fetched every clock cycle and their control-path overhead. On the other hand, pure SIMD-based DSPs lack the possibility to perform different concurrent operations. Since memory access power is the dominating part of the power consumption in a processor, other alternatives should be investigated. In this dissertation a new and unique type of processor architecture has been designed that instead of using the traditional architectures has started from the application requirements with efficiency in mind. The architecture is named ``Single Instruction stream Multiple Tasks'', SIMT in short. The SIMT architecture uses the vector nature of most baseband programs to provide a good trade-off between the flexibility of a VLIW processor and the processing efficiency of a SIMD processor. The contributions of this project are the design and research of key architectural components in the SIMT architecture as well as development of design methodologies. Methodologies for accelerator selection are also presented. Furthermore data dependency control and memory management are studied. Architecture and performance characteristics have also been compared between the SIMT and more traditional processor architectures. A complete system is demonstrated by the BBP 2 baseband processor that has been designed using SIMT technology. The SIMT principle has previously been proven in a small scale in silicon in the BBP 1 processor implementing a Wireless LAN transceiver. The second demonstrator chip (BBP 2) was manufactured early 2007 and implements a full scale system with multiple SIMD clusters and a controller core supporting multiple threads.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{resource}} allocation problems {{that arise in}} the context of stochastic sequential decision making problems. The practical utility of optimal algorithms for these problems is limited due to their high computational and storage requirements. Also, an increasing number of applications require a decentralized solution. We develop techniques for approximately solving certain class of resource allocation problems that arise {{in the context of}} stochastic sequential decision making problems that are computationally efficient with a focus on decentralized algorithms where appropriate. The first resource allocation problem that we study is a stochastic sequential decision making problem with multiple decision makers (agents) with two main features 1) Partial observability Each agent may not have complete information regarding the system 2) Limited Communication - Each agent {{may not be able to}} communicate with all other agents at all times. We formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for this problem. The features of partial observability and limited communication impose additional computational constraints on the exact solution of the MDP. We propose a scheme for approximating the optimal Q function and the optimal value function associated with this MDP as a linear combination of preselected basis functions. We show that the proposed approximation scheme leads to decentralization of the agents' decisions thereby enabling their implementation under limited communication. We propose a linear program, ALP, for selecting the parameters for combining the basis functions. We establish bounds relating the approximation error due to the choice of the parameters selected by the ALP with the best possible error given the choice of basis functions. (cont.) Motivated by the need for a decentralized solution to the ALP, which is equivalent to a resource allocation problem with separable, concave objective function, we analyze a general class of resource allocation problems with separable concave objective functions. We propose a distributed algorithm for this class of problems when the objective function is differentiable and establish its convergence and convergence rate properties. We develop a smoothing scheme for non-differentiable objective functions and extend the algorithm for this case. Finally, we build on these results to extend the decentralized algorithm to accommodate non-negativity constraints on the resources. Numerical investigations on the performance of the developed algorithm show that our algorithm is competitive with its centralized <b>counterpart.</b> The second <b>resource</b> allocation problem that we study is the problem of optimally accepting or rejecting arriving orders in a Make-To-Order (MTO) manufacturing firm. We model the production facility of the MTO manufacturing firm as a queue and view the time of the production facility as a resource that needs to be optimally allotted between current and future orders. We formulate the Order Acceptance Problem under two arrival processes - Poisson process (OAP-P), and Bernoulli Process (OAP-B) and formulate both problems as MDPs. We provide insights into the structure of the optimal order acceptance policy for OAP-B under the assumption of First Come First Served (FCFS) scheduling of accepted orders. (cont.) We investigate a class of randomized order acceptance policies for OAP-B called static policies that are practically relevant due to their ease of implementation and develop a procedure for computing the policy gradient for any static policy. Using these results for OAP-B, we propose 4 heuristics for OAP-P. We numerically investigate the performance of the proposed heuristics and compare their performance with other heuristics reported in literature. One of our proposed heuristics, FCFS-ValueFunction outperforms other heuristics under a variety of conditions while also being easy to implement. by Hariharan Lakshmanan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Background Depression is a {{major public}} health problem {{worldwide}} and is currently ranked second to heart disease for years lost due to disability. For many decades, international {{research has found that}} depressive symptoms occur more frequently among low socioeconomic (SES) individuals than their more-advantaged peers. However, the reasons as to why those of low socioeconomic groups suffer more depressive symptoms are not well understood. Studies investigating the prevalence of depression and its association with SES emanate largely from developed countries, with little research among developing countries. In particular, there is a serious dearth of research on depression and no investigation of its association with SES in Vietnam. The aims of the research presented in this Thesis are to: estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms among Vietnamese adults, examine {{the nature and extent of}} the association between SES and depression and to elucidate causal pathways linking SES to depressive symptoms Methods The research was conducted between September 2008 and November 2009 in Hue city in central Vietnam and used a combination of qualitative (in-depth interviews) and quantitative (survey) data collection methods. The qualitative study contributed to the development of the theoretical model and to the refinement of culturally-appropriate data collection instruments for the quantitative study. The main survey comprised a cross-sectional population–based survey with randomised cluster sampling. A sample of 1976 respondents aged between 25 - 55 years from ten randomly-selected residential zones (quarters) of Hue city completed the questionnaire (response rate 95. 5 %). Measures SES was classified using three indicators: education, occupation and income. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale was used to measure depressive symptoms (range 0 - 51, mean= 11. 0, SD= 8. 5). Three cut-off points for the CES-D scores were applied: ‘at risk for clinical depression’ (16 or above), ‘depressive symptoms’ (above 21) and ‘depression’ (above 25). Six psychosocial indicators: life time trauma, chronic stress, recent life events, social support, self esteem, and mastery were hypothesized to mediate the association between SES and depressive symptoms. Analyses The prevalence of depressive symptoms were analysed using bivariate analyses. The multivariable analytic phase comprised of ordinary least squares regression, in accordance with Baron and Kenny’s three-step framework for mediation modeling. All analyses were adjusted for a range of confounders, including age, marital status, smoking, drinking and chronic diseases and the mediation models were stratified by gender. Results Among these Vietnamese adults, 24. 3 % were at or above the cut-off for being ‘at risk for clinical depression’, 11. 9 % were classified as having depressive symptoms and 6. 8 % were categorised as having depression. SES was inversely related to depressive symptoms: the least educated those with low occupational status or with the lowest incomes reported more depressive symptoms. Socioeconomicallydisadvantaged individuals were more likely to report experiencing stress (life time trauma, chronic stress or recent life events), perceived less social support and reported fewer personal resources (self esteem and mastery) than their moreadvantaged <b>counterparts.</b> These psychosocial <b>resources</b> were all significantly associated with depressive symptoms independent of SES. Each psychosocial factor showed a significant mediating effect on the association between SES and depressive symptoms. This was found for all measures of SES, and for males and females. In particular, personal resources (mastery, self esteem) and chronic stress accounted for a substantial proportion of the variation in depressive symptoms between socioeconomic groups. Social support and recent life events contributed modestly to socioeconomic differences in depressive symptoms, whereas lifetime trauma contributed the least to these inequalities. Conclusion This is the first known study in Vietnam or any developing country to systematically examine the extent to which psychosocial factors mediate the relationship between SES and depression. The study contributes new evidence regarding the burden of depression in Vietnam. The findings have practical relevance for advocacy, for mental health promotion and health-care services, and point to the need for programs that focus on building a sense of personal mastery and self esteem. More broadly, the work presented in this Thesis contributes to the international scientific literature on the social determinants of depression...|$|R
