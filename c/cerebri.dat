5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx <b>cerebri.</b>|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of an {{allergic}} reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor <b>cerebri),</b> a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage.|$|E
25|$|Toxic effects {{occur with}} {{prolonged}} high intake. The specific toxicity {{is related to}} exposure time and the exposure concentration. A medical sign of chronic poisoning {{is the presence of}} painful tender swellings on the long bones. Anorexia, skin lesions, hair loss, hepatosplenomegaly, papilloedema, bleeding, general malaise, pseudotumor <b>cerebri,</b> and death may also occur.|$|E
25|$|Willis's {{anatomy of}} the brain and nerves, as {{described}} in his <b>Cerebri</b> anatome of 1664, is minute and elaborate. This work coined the term neurology, and was not the result of his own personal and unaided exertions; he acknowledged his debt to Sir Christopher Wren, who provided drawings, Thomas Millington, and his fellow anatomist Richard Lower. It abounds in new information, and presents an enormous contrast with the vaguer efforts of his predecessors.|$|E
25|$|In 1667 Willis {{published}} Pathologicae <b>cerebri,</b> et nervosi generis specimen, {{an important}} {{work on the}} pathology and neurophysiology of the brain. In it he developed a new theory of the cause of epilepsy and other convulsive diseases, {{and contributed to the}} development of psychiatry. In 1672 he published the earliest English work on medical psychology, Two Discourses concerning the Soul of Brutes, which is that of the Vital and Sensitive of Man.|$|E
25|$|The brain {{itself is}} not {{sensitive}} to pain, because it lacks pain receptors. However, several areas {{of the head and}} neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain. These include the extracranial arteries, middle meningeal artery, large veins, venous sinuses, cranial and spinal nerves, head and neck muscles, the meninges, falx <b>cerebri,</b> parts of the brainstem, eyes, ears, teeth and lining of the mouth. Pial arteries, rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production.|$|E
25|$|Meningiomas {{arise from}} arachnoidal cells, {{most of which}} are near the {{vicinity}} of the venous sinuses, and this is the site of greatest prevalence for meningioma formation. They most frequently are attached to the dura over the superior parasagittal surface of frontal and parietal lobes, along the sphenoid ridge, in the olfactory grooves, the sylvian region, superior cerebellum along the falx <b>cerebri,</b> cerebellopontine angle, and the spinal cord. The tumor is usually gray, well-circumscribed, and takes on the form of the space it occupies. They usually are dome-shaped, with the base lying on the dura.|$|E
25|$|Excessive vitamin A {{consumption}} {{can lead}} to nausea, irritability, anorexia (reduced appetite), vomiting, blurry vision, headaches, hair loss, muscle and abdominal pain and weakness, drowsiness, and altered mental status. In chronic cases, hair loss, dry skin, drying of the mucous membranes, fever, insomnia, fatigue, weight loss, bone fractures, anemia, and diarrhea can all be evident {{on top of the}} symptoms associated with less serious toxicity. Some of these symptoms are also common to acne treatment with Isotretinoin. Chronically high doses of vitamin A, and also pharmaceutical retinoids such as 13-cis retinoic acid, can produce the syndrome of pseudotumor <b>cerebri.</b> This syndrome includes headache, blurring of vision and confusion, associated with increased intracerebral pressure. Symptoms begin to resolve when intake of the offending substance is stopped.|$|E
500|$|... 1881: German {{physician}} Hartdegen {{described the}} case of a two-day-old baby who died in status epilepticus. Post-mortem examination revealed small tumours in the lateral ventricles of the brain and areas of cortical sclerosis, which he called [...] "glioma gangliocellulare <b>cerebri</b> congenitum".|$|E
500|$|In 1839, Guillaume Dupuytren {{described}} brain contusions, {{which involve}} many small hemorrhages, as contusio <b>cerebri</b> {{and showed the}} difference between unconsciousness associated with damage to the brain parenchyma and that due to concussion, without such injury. [...] In 1941, animal experiments showed that no macroscopic damage occurs in concussion.|$|E
500|$|The Hippocratic Corpus, {{collection}} of medical works from ancient Greece, mentions concussion, later translated to commotio <b>cerebri,</b> and discusses loss of speech, hearing and sight {{that can result}} from [...] "commotion of the brain". This idea of disruption of mental function by [...] "shaking of the brain" [...] remained the widely accepted understanding of concussion until the 19thcentury. The Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi {{was the first to}} write about concussion as distinct from other types of head injury in the 10thcentury AD. He may have been the first to use the term [...] "cerebral concussion", and his definition of the condition, a transient loss of function with no physical damage, {{set the stage for the}} medical understanding of the condition for centuries. In the 13thcentury, the physician Lanfranc of Milan's Chiurgia Magna described concussion as brain [...] "commotion", also recognizing a difference between concussion and other types of traumatic brain injury (though many of his contemporaries did not), and discussing the transience of post-concussion symptoms as a result of temporary loss of function from the injury. In the 14thcentury, the surgeon Guy de Chauliac pointed out the relatively good prognosis of concussion as compared to more severe types of head trauma such as skull fractures and penetrating head trauma. In the 16thcentury, the term [...] "concussion" [...] came into use, and symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and memory problems were described. [...] The 16thcentury physician Ambroise Paré used the term commotio <b>cerebri,</b> as well as [...] "shaking of the brain", [...] "commotion", and [...] "concussion".|$|E
500|$|Thomas Willis is {{considered}} a second pioneer {{in the study of}} neurology and brain science. In 1664 in <b>Cerebri</b> Anatome (...) , followed by Cerebral Pathology in 1667. In these he described the structure of the cerebellum, the ventricles, the cerebral hemispheres, the brainstem, and the cranial nerves, studied its blood supply; and proposed functions associated with different areas of the brain. The circle of Willis was named after his investigations into the blood supply of the brain, and {{he was the first to}} use the word [...] "neurology." [...] Willis removed the brain from the body when examining it, and rejected the commonly held view that the cortex only consisted of blood vessels and the view of the last two millennia that the cortex was only incidentally important.|$|E

2500|$|Subdural hematomas occur {{most often}} around the tops {{and sides of}} the frontal and parietal lobes. They also occur in the {{posterior}} cranial fossa, and near the falx <b>cerebri</b> and tentorium cerebelli. [...] Unlike epidural hematomas, which cannot expand past the sutures of the skull, subdural hematomas can expand along {{the inside of the}} skull, creating a concave shape that follows the curve of the brain, stopping only at the dural reflections like the tentorium cerebelli and falx <b>cerebri.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{ophthalmic}} segment, or C6, {{extends from}} the distal dural ring, which is continuous with the falx <b>cerebri,</b> to {{the origin of the}} posterior communicating artery. [...] The ophthalmic segment courses roughly horizontally, parallel to the optic nerve which runs superomedially to the carotid at this point.|$|E
2500|$|In cingulate or subfalcine herniation, {{the most}} common type, the {{innermost}} part of the frontal lobe is scraped under part of the falx <b>cerebri,</b> the dura mater {{at the top of}} the head between the two hemispheres of the brain. Cingulate herniation can be caused when one hemisphere swells and pushes the cingulate gyrus by the falx <b>cerebri.</b> This does not put as much pressure on the brainstem as the other types of herniation, but it may interfere with blood vessels in the frontal lobes that are close to the site of injury (anterior cerebral artery), or it may progress to central herniation. [...] Interference with the blood supply can cause dangerous increases in ICP that can lead to more dangerous forms of herniation. [...] Symptoms for cingulate herniation are not well defined. [...] Usually occurring in addition to uncal herniation, cingulate herniation may present with abnormal posturing and coma. [...] Cingulate herniation is frequently believed to be a precursor to other types of herniation.|$|E
2500|$|The pineal gland, {{also known}} as the conarium or {{epiphysis}} <b>cerebri,</b> is a small endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain. The pineal gland produces melatonin, a serotonin derived hormone which modulates sleep patterns in both circadian and seasonal cycles.The shape of the gland resembles a pine cone, hence its name. [...] The pineal gland is located in the epithalamus, {{near the center of the}} brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join.|$|E
2500|$|Willis's work gained {{currency}} in France through {{the writings of}} Daniel Duncan. The philosopher Richard Cumberland quickly applied the findings on brain anatomy {{to argue a case}} against Thomas Hobbes's view of the primacy of the passions. Willis's books, including [...] <b>Cerebri</b> anatome and selected works in 5 volumes (1664) are listed as once in the library of Sir Thomas Browne. His son Edward Browne (physician), who was President of the Royal College of Physicians from 1704-1707 also owned books by Willis.|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{herniation}} is {{a potentially}} deadly {{side effect of}} very high pressure within the skull that occurs when {{a part of the}} brain is squeezed across structures within the skull. The brain can shift across such structures as the falx <b>cerebri,</b> the tentorium cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain). [...] Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Wren's {{youthful}} exercises preserved or recorded (though few are datable) {{showed that}} he received a thorough grounding in Latin and also learned to draw. According to Parentalia, he was [...] "initiated" [...] in the principles of mathematics by Dr William Holder, who married Wren's elder sister Susan (or Susanna) in 1643. His drawing was put to academic use in providing many of the anatomical drawings for the anatomy textbook of the brain, <b>Cerebri</b> Anatome (1664), published by Thomas Willis, which coined the term [...] "neurology." [...] During this time period, Wren manifested {{an interest in the}} design and construction of mechanical instruments. It was probably through Holder that Wren met Sir Charles Scarburgh whom Wren assisted in his anatomical studies.|$|E
