40|$|AbstractThis work {{focuses on}} the {{optimization}} of the catalytic degradation of malachite green dye (MG) by Fenton process “Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2 ”. A 24 full factorial experimental design {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of four factors considered in the optimization of the oxidative process: <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> MG (X 1), <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> Fe 2 + (X 2), <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> H 2 O 2 (X 3) and temperature (X 4). Individual and interaction effects of the factors that influenced the percentage of dye degradation were tested. The effect of interactions between the four parameters shows that there is a dependency between <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> MG and <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> Fe 2 +; <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> Fe 2 + and <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> H 2 O 2, expressed by the great values of the coefficient of interaction. The analysis of variance proved that, the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> MG, the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> Fe 2 + and the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> H 2 O 2 have an influence on the catalytic degradation while it is not the case for the temperature. In the optimization, the great dependence between observed and predicted degradation efficiency, the correlation coefficient for the model (R 2 = 0. 986) and the important value of F-ratio proved the validity of the model. The optimum degradation efficiency of malachite green was 93. 83 %, when the operational parameters were malachite green <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 10 mg/L, Fe 2 + <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 10 mM, H 2 O 2 <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 25. 6 mM and temperature of 40 °C...|$|R
