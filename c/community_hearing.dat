Results indicated that 182 children (7. 9 %) did not complete the screening for both ears within the time constraint (usually 15 min) of a child health clinic visit. Three hundred and sixty-two children (15. 7 %) failed the first screening. Of the 226 children who returned for a second screening test, separated from the first by at least two weeks, 121 children failed. With parents' consent, 107 children (4. 6 % of all participants) were referred for diagnostic or medical assessment.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the community capacity for sustainable community-based dengue prevention and control, this paper proposes the approach of a previous study about meaning and domains of dengue prevention and control, an assessment tool and a community capacity building model for sustainable community-based dengue prevention and control in the Southern Thailand. A study of dengue community capacity domains was conducted by utilizing a qualitative method, whereby ten initial community domains were identified by means of a literature review, in-depth interviews of sixty community leaders, and eight focus group discussions with sixty non-leaders in four sub-districts of southern Thailand. In the final study, there were 14 identifiable domains in leaders group and 11 domains in non-leaders. The resulting dengue community capacity-assessment tool (DCCAT) consisted of two parts: one for leaders (DCCAT-L) and the other for non-leaders (DCCAT-NL). DCCAT-L was composed of 115 items within 14 domains and 83 items within 11 domains for the DCCAT-NL. The key domains of leaders and non-leaders had a partial overlap of domains such as critical situation management, personal leadership, health care provider capacity, needs assessment, senses of community, leader group networking, communication of dengue information, community leadership, religious capacity, leader group and community networking, resource mobilization, dengue working group, community participation, and continuing activities. The application of the new tool consisted of five steps: 1) community preparation, 2) assessment, 3) a <b>community</b> <b>hearing</b> meeting, 4) interventions, and 5) conclusion and improvement step. All stakeholders in the community should use the new tool based on a clear understanding of the measurement objectives, the desired outcomes, resources available and characteristics of their community.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an approach for sustainable dengue problem solution {{by the community}} capacity building model {{and the results of}} two studies from implementation the model in Southern region, Thailand. The conceptual framework of the CCB-SDPS model consisted of three dimensions; 1) community-based (leader and non-leader in community), 2) community capacity building process, and 3) sustainable dengue problem solution (outcomes). The outcomes of studies focused on the capacity level by the DCCAT (14 domains of leader group, and 11 domains of non-leader group), dengue entomology (Larval) index, and epidemiological (morbidity and mortality) rate. The two studies were pilot study in high risk dengue areas. These studies were application of CCB-SDPS model. First study was the process of using the tool for testing the DCCAT in two communities. The results showed only three steps of using assessment tool; community preparation, assessment, and <b>community</b> <b>hearing.</b> The second study was the fully testing model in three communities. Participatory action research and mix methods; quantitative and qualitative collecting data were preparation community-based, building capacity process (assessment, plan, implement, and reassessment), and outcomes monitoring. The results of second study showed three models of the CCB-SDPS. The two studies confirmed the sustainable in after intervention of community capacity building such as increased capacity level of leader and non-leader group, deceased entomological indices (HI, BI, and CI), and non presentation of morbidity and mortality rate in during study period. These results showed the model conducing on contexts of each community such the three dimensions of the conceptual framework of the model, community-based, building capacity process, and measurement of outcomes of sustainable dengue problem solution. These experiences in Southern Thailand demonstrated the main keys to the approach of CCB-SDPS were in the use of strategies planning to initiate community capacity building towards sustained dengue problem solution...|$|E

40|$|The global {{need for}} {{increased}} hearing health care currently far exceeds {{the capacity for}} delivering these services, especially in developing countries where the ratio of audiologists to the population is often less than one per every million. The imbalance is further compounded by the requirement for diagnostic assessments to be conducted in an audiometric (sound proof) booth, as {{a large proportion of}} the population has limited access to centres where these booths can be found. A tele-audiology approach utilising a portable diagnostic audiometer could provide the solution, enabling hearing assessments to be conducted remotely and without an audiometric booth. This would obviate the necessity for people from rural communities having to travel long distances, often with great difficulty and at great expense, to the nearest sound (audiometric) booth. An additional advantage would be that an audiologist could service a range of remote communities at the same time. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of pure tone air conduction (AC) thresholds obtained using a synchronous telehealth approach without a sound booth in a rural South African <b>community.</b> <b>Hearing</b> thresholds in a sound booth and in a natural environment were obtained from an initial sample of 20 adults (range 19 to 63 years; mean age 50 ± 13 years; 55 % female), recruited from a rural agricultural community. A subgroup of ten adults (20 ears) volunteered for the tele-audiology threshold testing. AC thresholds (250 - 8000 Hz) were determined and subsequently compared in these environments. Typical threshold variability was determined using test-retest correspondence as a reference for the threshold correspondence using a telehealth mode. Test-retest threshold correspondence in the booth and natural environments were within ± 5 dB in 96. 7 % and 97. 5 % of comparisons respectively. No significant differences were noted when AC hearing thresholds determined in the telehealth configuration were compared to those recorded in the gold standard booth environment. Threshold correspondence between the telehealth environment on the one hand and booth and natural environments on the other hand were within ± 5 dB in 82 % and 85 % of comparisons, respectively. The current study is the first of its kind to report synchronous telehealth hearing assessments conducted in a natural environment in a rural community. It demonstrates the validity of using synchronous tele-audiology for conducting hearing assessments in a remote rural agricultural community without a sound booth. It also highlights the potential for using non-clinical facilitators in remote locations, which could reduce the burden on the limited number of audiologists. These technologies make it possible for diagnostic hearing assessments to be included as part of a remote telemedicine kit and open up new possibilities in telehealth and tele-audiology support.

The research includes the testimonios of six Northern Cheyenne women gathered on or near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. The findings suggest that the following story threads were significant to Northern Cheyenne women in their educational journeys and experiences: spirituality; family especially grandparents and parents; cultural traditions- especially language and ceremonies; cultural values of honesty, integrity, generosity, hard work; value for land, cultural pride and identity even when it's fragmented or a struggle to maintain; Cheyenne lifeways meals, cooking, gathering, hunting, singing, spending time with family, and social events; the opportunity of access to higher education; living between two worlds; remembering our past history and using it as a guide for now and the future; and finally thinking of future generations. The findings suggest the tools needed for Northern Cheyenne women to succeed academically and educationally, already inherently exist in Northern Cheyenne social and cultural structures.
