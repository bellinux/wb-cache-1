5000|$|<b>Computational</b> <b>Lithography</b> {{means the}} use of {{computers}} to simulate printing of micro-lithography structures. Pioneering work was done by Chris Mack at NSA in developing PROLITH, Rick Dill at IBM and Andy Neureuther at University of California, Berkeley from the early 1980s. These tools were limited to lithography process optimization as the algorithms were limited to a few square micrometres of resist. Commercial full-chip optical proximity correction, using model forms, was first implemented by TMA (now a subsidiary of Synopsys) and Numerical Technologies (also part of Synopsys) around 1997. Since then the market and complexity has grown significantly. With the move to sub-wavelength lithography at the 180 nm and 130 nm nodes, RET techniques such as Assist features, Phase Shift Masks started to be used together with OPC. For the transition from 65 nm to 45 nm nodes customers were worrying that not only that design rules were insufficient to guarantee printing without yield limiting hotspots, but also that tape-out time may need thousands of CPUs or weeks of run time. This predicted exponential increase in computational complexity for mask synthesis on moving to the 45 nm process node spawned a significant venture capital investment in Design for Manufacturing start-up companies. A number of startup companies promoting their own disruptive solutions to this problem started to appear, techniques from custom hardware acceleration to radical new algorithms such as Inverse Lithography were touted to resolve the forthcoming bottlenecks. Despite all this activity, incumbent OPC suppliers were able to adapt and keep their major customers, with RET and OPC being used together as for previous nodes, but now on more layers and with larger data files, and turn around time concerns were met by new algorithms and improvements in multi-core commodity processors. The term <b>computational</b> <b>lithography</b> was first used by Brion Technology (now a subsidiary of ASML) in 2005 to promote their hardware accelerated full chip lithography simulation platform. Since then the term has been used by the industry to describe full chip mask synthesis solutions. As 45 nm goes into full production and EUV lithography introduction is delayed, 32 nm and 22 nm are expected to run on existing 193 nm scanners technology. Now, not only are throughput and capabilities concerns resurfacing, but also new <b>computational</b> <b>lithography</b> techniques such as Source Mask Optimization (SMO) is seen as a way to squeeze better resolution specific to a given design. Today, all the major Mask Synthesis vendors have settled on the term [...] "Computational Lithography" [...] to describe and promote the set of Mask Synthesis technologies required for 22 nm.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{resolution}} enhancements in photolithography {{have been}} achieved through the progression of stepper illumination sources to smaller and smaller wavelengths [...] - [...] from [...] "g-line" [...] (436 nm) and [...] "i-line" [...] (365 nm) sources based on mercury lamps, to the current systems based on deep ultraviolet excimer lasers sources at 193 nm. However the progression to yet finer wavelength sources has been stalled by the intractable problems associated with extreme ultraviolet lithography and x-ray lithography, forcing semiconductor manufacturers to extend the current 193 nm optical lithography systems until some form of next-generation lithography proves viable (although 157 nm steppers have also been marketed, they have proven cost-prohibitive at $50M each). Efforts to improve resolution by increasing the numerical aperture {{have led to the}} use of immersion lithography. As further improvements in resolution through wavelength reduction or increases in numerical aperture have become either technically challenging or economically unfeasible, much {{attention has been paid to}} reducing the k1-factor. The k1 factor can be reduced through process improvements, such as phase-shift photomasks. These techniques have enabled photolithography at the 32 nanometer CMOS process technology node using a wavelength of 193 nm (deep ultraviolet). However, with the ITRS roadmap calling for the 22 nanometer node to be in use by 2011, photolithography researchers have had to develop an additional suite of improvements to make 22 nm technology manufacturable. While the increase in mathematical modeling has been underway for some time, the degree and expense of those calculations has justified the use of a new term to cover the changing landscape: <b>computational</b> <b>lithography.</b>|$|E

40|$|Lithography {{techniques}} {{have long been}} the driving power {{for the advancement of}} Moore’s law for the semiconductor industry. In recent years, next generation lithog- raphy techniques, such as extreme ultraviolet lithography, have been extensively de- layed. ArF (Argon Fluoride) immersion lithography with a wavelength of 193 nm is still the primary technique for high volume integrated circuit manufacturing at the 10 nm technology node, and extensive resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) are required to its lifespan. <b>Computational</b> <b>lithography</b> techniques, including source mask optimization (SMO) and inverse lithography technology (ILT), have gained widespread interest due to their strong abilities to enhance the resolution. Yet, it is very challenging to solve <b>computational</b> <b>lithography</b> problems since they are in- trinsically ill-posed, large-scale, and nonlinear, frequently requiring a large amount of computation. At the same time, the solution needs to meet certain requirements, such as the control of source and mask manufacturability and mask shape uncer- tainty. The purpose of this dissertation is to harness the recent development of algorithms, such as convex optimization and sparse optimization, to cope with the challenges arising with <b>computational</b> <b>lithography.</b> First, {{to reduce the number of}} variables in the optimization problems, a repre- sentation method with basis functions is proposed for both source and mask opti- mizations. The source patterns are represented as a superposition of pre-defined Zernike basis functions weighted by a series of coefficients. Similarly, the mask patterns are represented by a linear combination of discrete cosine basis functions. The source optimization problem is then formulated as a convex problem, and can be solved efficiently. The number of iterations in mask optimization can also be significantly reduced, and thus accelerating the optimization computation. Second, a sparse nonlinear inverse imaging method is proposed to tackle mask manufacturability problem in ILT. The mask patterns are represented with pixel- based images to enlarge the solution space in ILT; however, the optimized mask usually contains complex features which are difficult to produce with the current e-beam writers. In order to reduce the complexity of the optimized patterns, a model-based fracturing (MBF), which is formulated as a sparse nonlinear inverse imaging problem, is integrated into the ILT process. It is shown that the integra- tion can effectively reduce the complexity of the optimized pattern and improve the manufacturability. Third, a random field method is proposed to incorporate the mask shape un- certainty into <b>computational</b> <b>lithography.</b> Fabricating the mask after ILT usually introduces shape errors, which are amplified by the imaging system to the wafer especially when the feature sizes are extremely small. In order to reduce the errors propagated to the wafer, the potential mask errors are considered to be a form of mask shape variation, and they are modeled with a random field. Then, an opti- mization technique, which incorporates the random field, is used to derive an opti- mized mask robust against the shape variations. It is demonstrated that the method is effective in reducing the mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) and improving critical dimension (CD) uniformity.

40|$|Image {{modeling}} and simulation are critical to extending the limits of leading edge lithography technologies used for IC making. Simultaneous source mask optimization (SMO) has become an important objective {{in the field of}} <b>computational</b> <b>lithography.</b> SMO is considered essential to extending immersion lithography beyond the 45 nm node. However, SMO is computationally extremely challenging and time-consuming. The key challenges are due to run time vs. accuracy tradeoffs of the imaging models used for the <b>computational</b> <b>lithography.</b> We present a new technique to be incorporated in the SMO flow. This new approach is based on the reduced basis method (RBM) applied to the simulation of light transmission through the lithography masks. It provides a rigorous approximation to the exact lithographical problem, based on fully vectorial Maxwell's equations. Using the reduced basis method, the optimization process is divided into an offline and an online steps. In the offline step, a RBM model with variable geometrical parameters is built self-adaptively and using a Finite Element (FEM) based solver. In the online step, the RBM model can be solved very fast for arbitrary illumination and geometrical parameters, such as dimensions of OPC features, line widths, etc. This approach dramatically reduces computational costs of the optimization procedure while providing accuracy superior to the approaches involving simplified mask models. RBM furthermore provides rigorous error estimators, which assure the quality and reliability of the reduced basis solutions. We apply the reduced basis method to a 3 D SMO example. We quantify performance, computational costs and accuracy of our method. Comment: BACUS Photomask Technology 201...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to design numerical methods that remain stable as the wavenumber varies in the complex plane. For example, in applications like <b>computational</b> <b>lithography,</b> one finds absorbing materials with complex refractive index {{in parts of the}} domain of simulation. Other examples are furnished by meta-materials. A separate and important reason for requiring such stability emerges in the computation of resonances by iterative searches in the complex plane. It is common for such iterative algorithms to solve a source problem with a complex wavenumber as its current iterate. Within such algorithms, if the HDG method is used for discretizing the source problem, it is imperative that the method remains stable for all complex wavenumbers.|$|E
40|$|The lithographic {{performance}} of a photomask is sensitive to shape uncertainty caused by manufacturing and measurement errors. This work proposes incorporating the photomask shape uncertainty in <b>computational</b> <b>lithography</b> such as inverse lithography. The shape uncertainty of the photomask is quantitatively modeled as a random ?eld in a level-set method framework. With this, the shape uncertainty can be characterized by several parameters, making it computationally tractable to be incorporated in inverse lithography technique (ILT). Simulations are conducted to show the e€ectiveness of using this method to represent various kinds of shape variations. It is also demonstrated that incorporating the shape variation in ILT can reduce the mask error enhancement factor (MEEF) values of the optimized patterns, and improve the robustness of imaging performance against mask shape ?uctuation. © 2016 SPIE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|A {{bottleneck}} for <b>computational</b> <b>lithography</b> {{and optical}} metrology are long computational times for near field simulations. For design, optimization, and inverse scatterometry usually {{the same basic}} layout has to be simulated multiple times for different values of geometrical parameters. The reduced basis method allows to split up the solution process of a parameterized model into an expensive offline and a cheap online part. After constructing the reduced basis offline, the reduced model can be solved online very fast {{in the order of}} seconds or below. Error estimators assure the reliability of the reduced basis solution and are used for self adaptive construction of the reduced system. We explain the idea of reduced basis and use the finite element solver JCMsuite constructing the reduced basis system.

We derive algorithms to compute the inner products with the continuous basis functions directly from the vertices of the polygons. We show that the overall computational complexity of those algorithms is {{lower than that of}} the traditional corresponding discrete transforms when the number of vertices is small, in addition to sparing the memory needed for a discrete image. This makes those continuous transforms particularly suitable for applications in <b>Computational</b> <b>Lithography</b> (CL) where speed and memory are critical requirements. We validate the presented algorithms through an implementation in a CL software under development at the IBM Zürich Research Laboratory and benchmark against discrete state of the art transforms on real Integrated Circuit (IC) layouts.

40|$|At the 20 nm {{technology}} node, it {{is challenging}} for simple resolution enhancements techniques (RET) to achieve sufficient process margin due to significant coupling effects for dense features. Advanced <b>computational</b> <b>lithography</b> techniques including Source Mask Optimization (SMO), thick mask modeling (M 3 D), Model Based Sub Resolution Assist Features (MB-SRAF) and Process Window Solver (PW Solver) methods are now {{required in the}} mask correction processes to achieve optimal lithographic goals. An OPC solution must not only converge to a nominal condition with high fidelity, but also provide this fidelity over an acceptable process window condition. The solution must also be sufficiently robust to account for potential scanner or OPC model tuning. In many cases, {{it is observed that}} with even a small change in OPC parameters, the mask correction could have a big change, therefore making OPC optimization quite challenging. On top of this, different patterns may have significantly different optimum source maps and different optimum OPC solution paths. Consequently, the need for finding a globally optimal OPC solution becomes important. In this work, we introduce a holistic solution including source and mask optimization (SMO), MB-SRAF, conventional OPC and Co-Optimization OPC, in which each technique plays a unique role in process window enhancement: SMO optimizes the source to find the best source solution for all critical patterns; Co-Optimization provides the optimized location and size of scattering bars and guides the optimized OPC solution; MB-SRAF and MB-OPC then utilizes al...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} and production of integrated circuits at the 22 nm node, optical lithography faces increasing challenges {{to keep up with}} the specifications on its performance along various metrics, such as pattern fidelity and process window. The past few years saw the emergence of source mask optimization (SMO) as an important technique in <b>computational</b> <b>lithography,</b> which allows lithographers to rise to the challenges by exploiting a larger design space on both mask and illumination configuration, and integrates with methods such as inverse imaging. Yet, many methods that are used to tackle SMO problem arising in the inverse imaging involve heavy computation and slow convergence, making the technique unappealing for full-chip simulations or large circuits. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to take advantage of computational imaging technologies to solve source and mask design problems, extending the lifetime of optical lithography. The computational burden results in part from identical optimization over the whole mask pattern, consequently, we propose a weighted SMO scheme which applies different degrees of correction in the corresponding regions so that the optimal solutions are reached with fewer iterations. Additionally, undesirably long time is also attributed to the algorithm adopted to solve SMO problem. A fast algorithm based on augmented Lagrangian methods is therefore developed, which use the quasi-Newton method to accelerate convergence, thereby shortening the overall execution time. However, as semiconductor lithography is pushed to even smaller dimensions, mask topography effects have to be taken into account for a more accurate solution of SMO. At this stage, intensive computation is spent mainly in rigorous 3 D mask modeling and simulations. To address this issue, we devise an optimization framework incorporating pupil aberrations into SMO procedure, which is performed based on the thin mask model so as to ensure a faster speed. We apply the above approaches to various mask geometries with different critical dimensions. Compared to conventional SMO, simulation results show that the proposed methods lead to better pattern fidelity and larger process window, especially in rigorous calculations. This demonstrates that the source and mask design generated through our algorithms are more practical. More importantly, the improved performance is not at the cost of speed. Instead, our methods take the least time to achieve it. This allows the advantages of computational imaging technologies to be worth exploring for further applications in optical lithography. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
