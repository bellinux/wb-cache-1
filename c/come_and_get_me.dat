500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / <b>Come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
2500|$|During the Test, former South African opening batsman Barry Richards bemoaned {{the lack}} of fight in the England team, commenting that [...] "...it puzzles me why {{the new breed of}} England batsmen are failing to stamp their {{authority}} on an innings. People like Stewart and Hick have all the ability at Test level but they do not seem to want to grab the game by the scruff of its [...] neck and say to the opposition bowlers: 'I'm here. <b>Come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> if you can.'". [...] meanwhile, in The Guardian, Mike Selvey praised the South African seamers, and Scyld Berry singled out Fanie De Villiers' bowling on the second day as the turning point of the match, and the above commentators pointed out England's lack of success at the home of cricket and questioned {{the lack of}} a left-handed batsman in the eleven.|$|E

In Alabama a family gave me help when I was considered ‘nothing.’ They gave me a job, so I promised them that whenever I find somebody in the same shape and wearing the same shoes I wore, I would do for them {{what they had done}} for me,” said Harris, who studied cosmetology and later operated her own beauty shop in Detroit, MI, before moving to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. “I won’t stop. I’ll be doing this until the Lord <b>comes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> <b>me</b> because I love it. I love to see people smile and I know how good they feel, because I know how good I felt.".|$|R

Give dear mamma my love, and tell her that when I am quiet for the night I want her to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> to sleep with the old lullaby she used to sing when I was a little child." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{tribunal}} asked international {{experts in}} policing and psychological experts {{to examine the}} Abbylara scenario for evidence of suicide by cop.While some of the police experts suspected it, {{the majority of the}} psychological experts with experience and expertise in this area said it was probably not the case. Carthys bipolar disorder was in the manic or 'elated' stage where one is pumped up rather than depressed, as evidenced by him pacing around the house, engaging in bravado and banging his shotgun on the table beside the window he used to talk to the negotiator. However, because he had several times yelled shoot <b>me</b> or <b>come</b> in <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> the tribunal found that suicide by cop had to be explored.|$|R
5000|$|Misiti {{grew up in}} East Keilor and {{attended}} Keilor Heights Primary School and Keilor Heights High School. Misiti grew up being an Essendon supporter and often got his father and uncle {{to take him to}} watch the team play. [...] "They built me a little stool to stand on so I could watch from behind the cheer squad. They would sneak off for a couple of quiet ones <b>and</b> then <b>come</b> back <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> {{at the end of the}} day and we would have a kick on the ground," [...] Misiti said. Noel Judkins, Essendon's then recruiting manager, witnessed Misiti playing in an Under-15 team as a centre half-back. Although Judkins was impressed with what he saw, Misiti was [...] "a bit slack at training." [...] Nevertheless, he continued to perform, playing for the Essendon Under-19s in the next season, and also won the best and fairest in the process. However, the under-age team was abolished in 1991, with Essendon's senior club list cut back to 45. [...] "We kept 11 guys who were eligible for what would have been the under-19s," [...] said Judkins. [...] "Joey was probably the last guy we kept, because we were worried about his attitude. He had to convince coach Kevin Sheedy and the match committee that he was fair dinkum," [...] something he managed to do.|$|R
5000|$|I {{followed}} {{along for}} about a hundred yards into the bush. There, {{after just a few}} stumbling steps, I fell apart. My sense reeled. I was hit by such weakness that I dropped my carbine and could not unbuckle my belt, {{but that was not the}} worst of it. within seconds my nerve had gone completely and I shook all over from fear. I lay flat under a pandanus tree, telling myself: 'It's combat fatigue. You've been kidding yourself. You are too old for the wars.' Being unable to walk, and scarcely able to think, I decided to stay where I was, wait for a stretcher-bearer to <b>come</b> along <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> back to the Calvert (a ship) where I would stay...before any aid man came my way, a rifleman stopped and stared at me. Then he took a bottle of pills from his jacket and downed a couple of them. I asked weakly, 'What you got?' 'Salt.' 'Gimme some. Nothing can make me feel worse than I do.' He gave me the bottle ... I washed down eleven salt tablets with the lukewarm water from my canteen. ...Within the next ten minutes my nerve and strength were fully restored, and I was never again troubled; yet that lesson had to be learned the hard way. No one had ever told me that one consequence of dehydration is cowardice in its most abject form.|$|R

Born in Hollywood, California in 1918 into a show business family, McKenzie made her screen debut {{at the age of}} 10 weeks old as Gloria Swansons baby in Station Content (1918). After several other child roles, she completed her education. She returned to the screen in 1934, appearing in mostly uncredited roles for the next few years. In 1940, she received her first major recognition in the stage production of Meet the People. She came to Republic Pictures through her sister who introduced her to family friend Herbert J. Yates, the head of Republic. After a quick screen test, she was cast in Autrys next film, Down Mexico Way. In 1946 she left movies to raise a family with her husband Tom Waldman. In 1959 she returned to films and television for occasional roles. In 2003, McKenzie would recall her days working with Gene Autry: I loved working with Gene, he was terrific! I could sing and that was something the earlier girls couldn’t do. Yates knew I had done Broadway; that helped! I could do more than smile and wave at the cowboy! ... He was also a brilliant businessman! Not a fly-by-night. It was a wonderful, rich experience. I would get to the studio early, about 5, go past the publicity department, and often someone would <b>come</b> out <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> to sign some piece of paper. ... I never read the papers, as I was so protected by my family and never suspected anything could be wrong. One day Gene arrived at the same time I did, and saw what was happening. He ragged me all day long! You could have signed away your salary! That is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen! And he was right! ...|$|R
