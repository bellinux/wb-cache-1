During {{laser welding}} process of {{high-strength}} galvanized steel, adopting guiding arc plate and the <b>connecting</b> <b>arc</b> plate can avoid harmful effect resulted in unstable melting width.

The test results indicate that the corrosion rates of the joint are different under different welding parameters during laser welding of high-strength galvanized steel; their average corrosion rates are coincident with that of base metal and laser welding technology hardly effect corrosion resistance of the joint...|$|E

A lot of research has been conducted in this field. While the researchers treat logistics networks design problem as a traditional multistage logistics network model, in which <b>arcs</b> should <b>connect</b> the two adjoining echelons in the network and there are no arcs striding over any abutting echelons, thereby the problem can be solved stage by stage. However, in practice this kind of traditional multistage logistics network (tMLN) model sometime causes problems, such as too-long delivery path, slow response etc. In this paper, we address flexible multistage logistics network (fMLN) design problem with nonadjacent structure, i. e. in this problem some non-neighboring echelons are <b>connected</b> with <b>arcs</b> (nonadjacent <b>connecting</b> <b>arcs).</b> In some practical cases, the nonadja-cent <b>connecting</b> <b>arcs</b> make the logistics networks cost-effective and adaptable to changes in situation. On the other hand, the existence of them makes the problem much more difficult by traditional optimi-zation methods.

We then highlight recent and previous findings from preclinical mouse models that elucidate how Arc genetic modifications might recapitulate schizophrenia-relevant behavioral phenotypes following the novel Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework.

Despite being only initial, accumulating and compelling data are showing that Arc {{might be one of}} the primary biological players in schizophrenia. Synaptic plasticity alterations in the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders might be a rule, not an exception.

This reflection of the inadequacy of the Singaporean dream is an important step towards the realization that, while we enjoy economic success, there are grave social problems that merit examination. This paper aims to analyze 12 Storeys and how it depicts the isolation suffered by various Singaporeans despite living in close proximity and how this sense of isolation is relevant in today’s society. Eric Khoo opens 12 Storeys with a montage of different scenes around a residential estate, followed by the suicide of a disaffected person who jumps off the twelfth storey of the Housing Development Board (HDB) flat where he stays in.

40|$|Robustness of {{ecological}} flow networks under random failure of arcs is considered {{with respect to}} two different functionalities: coherence and circulation. In our previous work, we showed that each functionality {{is associated with a}} natural path notion: lateral path for the former and directed path for the latter. Robustness of a network is measured in terms {{of the size of the}} giant laterally <b>connected</b> <b>arc</b> component and that of the giant strongly <b>connected</b> <b>arc</b> component, respectively. We study how realistic structures {{of ecological}} flow networks affect the robustness with respect to each functionality. To quantify the impact of realistic network structures, two null models are considered for a given real ecological flow network: one is random networks with the same degree distribution and the other is those with the same average degree. Robustness of the null models is calculated by theoretically solving the size of giant components for the configuration model. We show that realistic network structures have positive effect on robustness for coherence, whereas they have negative effect on robustness for circulation. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the plasma}} spray process, the {{particle}} thermal treatment is strongly {{linked to the}} arc root fluctuations. These fluctuations are due {{to the effect of}} two forces on the <b>connecting</b> <b>arc</b> column: the drag force issued from the gas flow in the cold boundary layer (CBL) and the electromagnetic self-induced forces, resulting in its continuous fluctuations along the anode wall. The connecting column lengthens and when the arc voltage, increasing with it, reaches the breakdown voltage, a new arc root is created with lower voltage drop (Ref 1). This movement, depending on the CBL thickness, induces a periodic variation in the arc voltage, modifying the enthalpy input to the gas, the plasma jet velocity and temperature, its length, and width. These arc fluctuations are function of the plasma torch geometry (anode shape and internal diameter), the plasma spray parameters (mass flow rate, secondary gas percentage, and arc current), and the nature of primary plasma gas (argon or nitrogen) (Ref 2 - 4). During the process, the plasma momentum continuously varies following the voltage fluctuations, at a few kHz, but the momentum of particles injected remains constant. Therefore, the particle trajectories fluctuate and correlatively their temperatures and velocities (Ref 5). The measurements of Bisson and Moreau performed on alumina particles with a size distribution between 32 and 45 lm for an Ar-H 2 plasma (35 SLPM/ 10 SLPM), working at 550 A have shown that, due to the arc root fluctuations, at the same location, particle temperatures vary between 2400 and 2900 K, while their velocities range between 260 and 430 m/s (Ref 6, 7). BOC Edwards Society uses nitrogen as primary gas to achieve zirconia coatings, although argon is usually employed. One of the objectives of this project is to compare the properties of the two different plasma jets (argon or nitrogen with hydrogen) in terms of arc voltage fluctuations and CBL thickness. The aim is to determine the effects on the particle thermal treatment and thus on the coating densit...|$|E
