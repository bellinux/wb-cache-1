5|$|Two {{standard}} Hotspur fuselages {{and outer}} wing panels joined together with common <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> and tailplane; single prototype made. This variant {{did not enter}} series production.|$|E
5|$|The B.1 {{had four}} {{elevators}} (inboard) and four ailerons (outboard). In the B.2, these {{were replaced by}} eight elevons. The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (in, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> and two in the lower. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.|$|E
5|$|The Monkland Canal (completed 1791) {{was used}} in the 19th and 20th century to {{transport}} coal and iron to Glasgow. The town <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> of the canal was interred in pipe between Sikeside and Blair Road in the mid-1970s. Some sections of the Monkland Canal can still be seen today between Townhead and Drumpellier. Coatbridge is adjacent to the M8 and M73 motorways. The M74 motorway is also a short drive away. The major cities of Edinburgh, Stirling and Glasgow are all within commuting distance.|$|E
50|$|In city <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> {{the rail}} tracks are underground, but run {{on their own}} {{separated}} section at ground level in the suburbs.The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs with a 7.5- to 10-minute frequency which combines to approx 3-5 minutes on the city <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> served {{by more than one}} line.|$|R
50|$|Conversion of two An-22s {{to carry}} wing <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> or outer wings of Antonov An-124 or An-225 {{externally}} above fuselage. Fitted with third centreline fin.|$|R
50|$|The R.F.D. 2 was {{a single}} seat, wooden {{sailplane}} built in the UK in 1930. Interchangeable <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> allowed it to be configured either as a sailplane or a shorter span secondary (advanced training) glider. Only one was completed.|$|R
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the <b>centre</b> <b>section,</b> a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|This latter {{theory is}} not heraldically tenable as the {{quarters}} in an achievement {{after the first}} and pronominal quarter brought into the family by marriage to heraldic heiresses cannot meaningfully exist {{on their own to}} represent the person who now quarters them. It is more probable then that the arms of the College really are those of Archbishop Rotherham and were assumed to be those of the College by John Speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map. Lawrence Hall in Ship Street was given to Rotherham in 1476 and leased to Jesus in 1572. It may well have displayed the Archbishop’s arms in its structure as did the building {{on the south side of}} the front quad of Lincoln which he completed. These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that College, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> had been changed to Or (gold) and their attitude to statant.|$|E
25|$|The Rhönbussard had its wing {{over the}} cockpit, {{limiting}} the pilot's view, {{but on the}} Rhönsperber it was lowered to mid fuselage. It is an entirely wood and fabric aircraft with a wing built around a single spar. Forward of the spar the wing is plywood covered around the leading edge, forming a torsion-resisting D-box. Aft of the spar, the covering is fabric. Each wing has two sections, a parallel-chord <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> and a double straight tapered outer panel, ending with semi-elliptical tips. The only dihedral, 5°, is on the <b>centre</b> <b>section,</b> forming the gull wing. Airbrakes are centrally placed on the upper <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> surface and fabric-covered ailerons fill the trailing edges of the outer panels.|$|E
50|$|In 1951, Aviation Traders (Engineering), {{a sister}} company of Aviation Traders, won a {{contract}} from Bristol Aircraft to manufacture wing <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> for Bristol Freighters. Between {{the beginning of}} 1952 {{and the end of}} 1955, Aviation Traders (Engineering) built 50 wing sections for Bristol Aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Races are {{sometimes}} held in sports halls and other venues. The events {{are the same}} but the solid and smooth surface makes speeds higher. A sectional track is taken around sports centres in Britain for national events. <b>Centre</b> <b>sections</b> are added or removed to fit locations.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, ATL won a {{contract}} from Bristol Aircraft to manufacture wing <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> for Bristol Freighters. Between {{the beginning of}} 1952 {{and the end of}} 1955, ATL built 50 wing sections for Bristol Aircraft. During that period ATL had grown into a large engineering and manufacturing organisation.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} extra engines {{and the very}} {{different}} crew compartment, together with the removal of passenger accommodation, the AB-20 and DB-70 had much in common: the thick <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> and high-mounted outer wings, twin fuselages carrying a long horizontal stabilizer, and twin fins and rudders. Both aircraft had conventional undercarriages with pairs of mainwheels widely separated on V-struts attached to the lower longerons of the <b>centre</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
25|$|Special {{two-seater}} <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> with tandem {{seats for}} training purposes. Four aircraft were built with one being converted to the sole H.IIIh.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, the <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> of the Compton Street Terrace was re-roofed and {{a wooden}} {{television}} gantry added, the only notable ground {{work in the}} decade.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Graz was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Bombardier Transportation's Cityrunner design, with {{the acquisition of}} 18 27 m long five-section trams. These were the city's first 100% low-floor trams, although the concept was introduced in 1999 by the fitting of new low-floor <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> to 12 existing trams.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1935 the SFCA {{produced}} {{a version of the}} Maillet 21 fitted with a retractable undercarriage and named the Maillet-Lignel 20. The legs were mounted at the same positions on the <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> as with the earlier models but retracted into the outer wing panels. Five were built.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s, {{the remains}} of WD 356 were {{discovered}} at Konini, near Pahiatua. It had been dumped for erosion protection during World War II; the frames of the locomotive had been separated into three sections, comprising the front, <b>centre</b> and trailing <b>sections</b> and buried along the riverbank. The front and <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> were salvaged by Hugh McCracken and moved to Steam Incorporated's depot at Paekakariki. The remains of the locomotive were moved to the Rimutaka Incline Railway's workshops at Maymorn in 2006, pending restoration.|$|R
25|$|Similar to Il-18I, but {{equipped}} with an extra <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> fuel tank for increased range. The Il-18D is fitted with four 3,169ekW (4,250hp) Ivchenko AI-20M turboprop engines.|$|E
25|$|A motorglider {{version of}} the H.III was {{produced}} by attaching standard H.IIIb wings to a special <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> housing the cockpit and a 32hp Volkswagen engine driving a folding propeller.|$|E
25|$|The Sprat, {{though a}} smaller aircraft, had strong family resemblances {{to the earlier}} Velos torpedo bomber. The Sprat was a staggered, single-bay biplane with equal-span wings that could be folded for carrier stowage. The {{fuselage}} <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> was built around a tubular-steel structure which linked the engine mounting and the wooded-framed rear fuselage. The two dual-control open cockpits were both behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing for optimum visibility. Unusually, the instruments were placed on the rear spar of the upper wing <b>centre</b> <b>section,</b> where they could be read from both cockpits. The rudder area was large compared to that of the fin and a braced tailplane was placed on top of the rear fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Straight {{and long}} {{expressway}} between Shah Alam city <b>centre</b> and <b>Section</b> 24.|$|R
50|$|The Caproni Vizzola Calif was {{a family}} of {{sailplanes}} produced in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s. Of typical sailplane configuration with T-tails, they featured distinctive wings with <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> of constant chord and trapezoidal outer panels. The forward fuselage was constructed of fibreglass over an alloy frame, while the rear fuselage, wings, and empennage were metal-covered.|$|R

25|$|The wings were {{of equal}} span {{and almost no}} stagger, with slight sweep on the section {{outboard}} of the engines. These outboard sections each had two sets of simple vertical interplane struts, carried balanced ailerons on upper and lower planes and a V-bottomed stabilising float mounted clear of the lower wing. The wings were wooden structures with canvas covering, as was the upper <b>centre</b> <b>section.</b> The lower wing <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> was Consuta covered, mounted on a low pylon on the hull and braced to it with large N shaped struts. The centre sections were joined by three sets of steel V-form struts, from which the Valkyrie's three 680hp (505kW) Rolls-Royce Condor water-cooled engines were mounted midway between the wings.|$|E
25|$|A higher bridge {{relative}} to the bow, as the superstructure has been raised by 1.3 metres by the <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> of the safety deck, and also by {{the removal of the}} sheer. This negates the requirement on the original Titanic for lookouts.|$|E
25|$|The P.40 is a {{tailless}} aircraft with a swept, cantilever, low wing. In plan, the wing has a rectangular <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> and straight tapered outer panels with elevons. There are wing tip fins and outward opening rudders which extend a little below the wing.|$|E

50|$|By April 1852 {{the lower}} {{sections}} of the gates had been installed, decorated {{with a combination of}} elements from the interior balconies; four great panels of rope-work with central mermaid and trident figures identical to those inside. The two outer panels were fixed whilst the two <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> rolled behind them on rails where they were hidden from sight while the Home was open for business.|$|R
50|$|The Wolston Park Hospital Complex {{comprises}} {{a number}} of public health institutions, several {{of which have been}} decommissioned. The complex includes The Park Centre for Mental Health (former Wolston Park Hospital), Basil Stafford Centre, Wacol Rehabilitation Centre (male and female), Wacol Repatriation Pavilion, Barrett Psychiatric Centre and the John Oxley <b>Centre.</b> <b>Sections</b> of the reserve are leased to the Gailes Golf Club and the Wolston Park Golf Club.|$|R
25|$|The C.180 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} undercarriage. Each main wheel was {{mounted on a}} {{half-axle}} hinged from the lower fuselage and located by a hinged trailing strut, with a vertical, shock absorbing leg to the outer wing <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> below the engine, providing a wide track.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 1972, while {{descending}} to Kharkiv International Airport an An-10 crashed, killing eight {{crew and}} 113 passengers. An investigation revealed fatigue cracking {{of the wing}} <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> stringers {{on many of the}} remaining aircraft. Following this accident, Aeroflot ceased operating the An-10.|$|E
25|$|The wings were braced to the {{fuselage}} with a parallel pair of struts {{from the lower}} longerons to the spars at about mid-span assisted by N-form, cross-braced jury struts at right angles. Four very short struts from the upper fuselage longerons to the wing <b>centre</b> <b>section</b> formed a low cabane.|$|E
5000|$|The service makes 69 stops {{along the}} 68 km long line, with a tram running every ten minutes {{during the peak}} summer months (every 20 mins in the winter months), during which it is used by over 3 million passengers. The service has {{recently}} been made more accessible through the addition of low-floor <b>centre</b> <b>sections</b> to existing vehicles, {{and the introduction of}} a few new HermeLijn low-floor trams.|$|R
