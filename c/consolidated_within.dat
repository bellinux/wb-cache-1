5|$|On August19, 2014, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa. The system traversed the Atlantic over the next week with no signs of development. Convection finally increased once the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on August27; however, it was not until August30 when interaction with a Kelvin wave spurred organization. An area of low pressure <b>consolidated</b> <b>within</b> the system as it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula on August31. Formation of a banding feature along the southeastern portion of the circulation on September1 marked the system's transition into {{a tropical}} depression by 18:00UTC while over the Bay of Campeche. Although situated over warm waters of , strong wind shear created an unfavorable environment and hindered intensification. During this formative stage, the depression tracked northward as its center relocated before turning to the northwest and later west. It was uncertain if a closed circulation truly existed due to conflicting data and the depression could have remained a trough until the afternoon of September2.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Krovanh {{can be traced}} back to an area of {{persistent}} convection well east of Chuuk State on August13. Over the course of the day the disturbance gradually <b>consolidated</b> <b>within</b> favorable atmospheric conditions, and at 1800UTC that day the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) assessed the system to have organized sufficiently to be classified as a tropical depression. Shower activity was suppressed by a nearby upper-level low for much of the storm's early existence; however, at 0600UTC on August15, the system was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) as a tropical depression. The depression tracked northwestward under the influence of a nearby ridge. Strengthening and development of the tropical cyclone was very minimal over the next few days, and on August18, both tracking agencies discontinued monitoring the system due to the lack of an identifiable low-level circulation center.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Marie is tied as the seventh-most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} on record, attaining a {{barometric pressure}} of 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg) in August2014. On August10, a tropical wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean. Some organization of shower and thunderstorm activity initially took place, but dry air soon impinged upon the system and imparted weakening. The wave trekked westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean for several days. On August19, an area of low pressure <b>consolidated</b> <b>within</b> the wave west of Central America. With favorable atmospheric conditions, convective activity and banding features increased around the system and by August22, the system acquired enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E while situated about 370mi (595km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Development was initially fast-paced, as the depression acquired tropical storm-force winds within sixhours of formation and hurricane-force by August23. However, due to some vertical wind shear its intensification rate stalled, and for a time it remained a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E

500|$|On July24, 2014, a westward moving {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west}} coast of Africa near the Cape Verde Islands. Following the development of convective activity —showers and thunderstorms— on July26, National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system for potential tropical cyclogenesis. A disorganized system, development was forecast to be slow due to unfavorable environmental conditions. Organization and coverage of convection began improving by July28, {{due in part to the}} passage of a Kelvin wave. An area of low pressure subsequently <b>consolidated</b> <b>within</b> the disturbance on July29 and the NHC assessed the system as having imminent potential of becoming a tropical depression. Convection soon diminished over the system, though its circulation remained well-defined. Moving west-northwest around the periphery of a strong subtropical ridge, the low acquired tropical storm-force winds early on July31 but continued to lack convection. A hurricane hunter aircraft investigated the system that afternoon and found winds of 45mph (75km/h) north and northeast of the center. In the hours following the weather reconnaissance mission, a band of deep convection blossomed near the center, prompting the NHC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Bertha at 00:00UTC on August1. Upon its classification, Bertha was situated roughly [...] east-southeast of Barbados in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

50|$|Flaser {{beds are}} a {{sediment}}ary, bi-directional, bedding pattern created when a sediment {{is exposed to}} intermittent flows, leading to alternating sand and mud layers. While flaser beds typically form in tidal environments, they can (rarely) form in fluvial conditions - on point bars or in ephemeral streams. Individual sand ripples are created, which are later infilled by mud during quieter flow periods. These mud drapes are typically a minor constituent of the deposit; they can <b>consolidate</b> <b>within</b> three hours, protecting the underlying layer from erosion. Flaser bedding typically forms in high-energy environments but some have also been described in turbiditic sediments reworked by contour currents (Rebesco, 2014).|$|R
500|$|On July28, 1976, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa. An unusually well-organized system for the time of year and location, considerable deep convection accompanied it. A possible low-level circulation <b>consolidated</b> <b>within</b> the system by July31 as it raced west across the Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the Lesser Antilles in early August, convection separated from the system and moved north of the islands while the wave itself continued into the Caribbean Sea. [...] The northern portion of the system eventually reached a point north of the Bahamas on August5 and grew increasingly organized. Well-defined upper-level outflow became established that evening. A low-level center formed early on August6 and became {{a tropical}} depression by 06:00UTC while situated roughly 290mi (465km) east-northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. Over the next 24hours, the system remained almost stationary and executed a small counter-clockwise loop. Early on August7, the depression acquired gale-force winds and became a tropical storm. Accordingly, it was assigned the name Belle. Acquiring a slow northwest trajectory, Belle steadily intensified on August 7. Reconnaissance aircraft investigating the storm revealed the system to have achieved hurricane strength by 18:00 UTC as its pressure fell to 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Additionally, a well-defined eye was present by this time.|$|E
500|$|On June25, 2014, {{an area of}} {{showers and}} {{thunderstorms}} developed over the northern Gulf of Mexico ahead of a shortwave trough in Texas. That day, National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis off the Southeast United States over the following week as the system was expected to encounter favorable environmental conditions. An area of low-level vorticity <b>consolidated</b> <b>within</b> the system on June26 as it moved northeast across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. [...] The following day it became intertwined with a frontal boundary over Georgia and South Carolina before emerging over the far western Atlantic Ocean early on June28. An {{area of low pressure}} soon formed within the system just off the coast of South Carolina. Generally favorable environmental conditions fostered further organization of the low, though convection remained minimal for several days. During the latter half of June30, a United States Air Force weather reconnaissance mission into the system confirmed the presence of a well-organized circulation; however, displacement of showers and thunderstorms from its center delayed its classification. Subsequent organization of convection into a banding feature along the system's southern flank, as depicted by radar imagery, prompted the NHC to designate the low as Tropical Depression One at 00:00UTC on July1. Situated 70mi (110km) east-southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida, the newly christened depression moved slowly westward within an area of weak steering currents. A turn northward was forecast as a mid-level ridge built over the Atlantic.|$|E
