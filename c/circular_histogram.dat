40|$|ABSTRACT. In this contribution, {{we study}} Monge-Kantorovich {{distances}} between discrete {{set of points}} on the unit circle S 1, when the ground distance between two points x and y on the circle is defined as c(x, y) = min(|x − y|, 1 − |x − y|). We first prove that computing a Monge-Kantorovich distance between two given sets of pairwise different points boils down to cut the circle at a well chosen point and to compute the same distance on the real line. This result is then used to prove a formula on the Earth Mover’s Distance [3], which is a particular Monge-Kantorovich distance. This formula asserts that the Earth Mover’s Distance between two discrete <b>circular</b> normalized <b>histograms</b> f = (f[i]) i= 0, [...] .,N− 1 and g = (g[i]) i= 0, [...] .,N− 1 on N bins can be computed by (1) CEMD(f, g) = min k∈{ 0, [...] .,N− 1 } ‖Fk − Gk‖ 1, where Fk and Gk are the cumulative histograms of f and g starting at the k th quantization bin.

To that end, we model the impact of the embedding process and of database modifications on the probability distribution of the center of mass position.

Biometric based authentications have emerged as promising components of information security. Biometric is used for two major purposes: identification and authentication.

The method of <b>circular</b> <b>histogram</b> analysis has been used to enable the definition of the angular orientation of palm representation and the corner of turn where it is necessary to turn the image for correct determination of supporting points which is based on two-dimensional discrete differentiations of image with the next analysis of given points of brightness projections forming the curves of peaks and cavities of hand- fingers and facilitating the searching process for such given points.

40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} of spatial relations between objects in digital images plays {{a crucial role}} in various application domains related to pattern recognition and computer vision. Classical models for the evaluation of such relations are usually sufficient for the handling of simple objects, but can lead to ambiguous results in more complex situations. In this article, we investigate the modeling of spatial configurations where the objects can be imbricated in each other. We formalize this notion with the term enlacement, from which we also derive the term interlacement, denoting a mutual enlacement of two objects. Our main contribution is the proposition of new relative position descriptors designed to capture the enlacement and interlacement between two-dimensional objects. These descriptors take the form of <b>circular</b> <b>histograms</b> allowing to characterize spatial configurations with directional granularity, and they highlight useful invariance properties for typical image understanding applications. We also show how these descriptors can be used to evaluate different complex spatial relations, such as the surrounding of objects.

International audience 3 D coronary modeling extracts the centerlines and width of the coronary arteries from a rotational sequence of angiographies. This process heavily relies on a preliminary filtering of the 2 D angiograms that enhances the vessels. We propose an improved vessel enhancement method specifically designed for this application. It keeps the advantages of Hessian-based extraction methods (speed, robustness, multiscale) while bypassing its more important limitations: the blurring of bifurcations, and the incomplete filling of very large vessels. The major contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the classical centered kernel used in Hessian-based methods is substituted with an elongated off-centered kernel. The new filter detects the different orientations involved at a bifurcation: it can answer properly to 'half vessels' beginning at the considered pixel (as opposed to the centered classical filter). The proposed ”semi-oriented ridge” filter is also more robust to noise, and it stays multi-scale and quickly computable. Second, an original bifurcation detection and enhancement method is presented, based on the following heuristics: ”bifurcations have three vessels (at least) in their immediate neighborhood”. More precisely, the semi-oriented ridges answers in each tested orientation theta in [−Pi, Pi] are stored in a <b>circular</b> <b>histogram.</b> The proposed bifurcation energy is the height of the third peak in this histogram: it will have a significant value at bifurcations only. The performance of the complete framework is demonstrated both on the produced vessel maps and on the final modeling results. Copyright 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

30|$|Various {{computing}} techniques inspired {{from nature}} {{has been extensively}} used in solving problems spanning from optimization, pattern recognition, machine learning, image detection to computer vision. There is hardly any field that is left uninfluenced by the nature-based computing techniques. Image Processing is one such field where recently biomimicry methods are being used invariably. One such application of nature-inspired computation is {{in the field of}} medical image processing, especially focused on object localization. In this paper, the problem of object localization in medical images has been solved with the application of the highly efficient plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA) (Li and Wang 2008) applied to the analysis of white blood cell (WBC) images. WBCs, also known as leukocytes, play a very important role in the diagnosis of a myriad of diseases. In most haematology labs, such cell differential analyses are performed using manual microscopy but this traditional process is not without its limitations. Such analysis require the availability of highly experienced personnel. Due to the substantial possibility of an inter and intra-observer variability in these manual examinations and due to the highly labour intensive routine procedures, new methods for cell analysis are being developed using digital image processing techniques to form better and reliable systems for disease diagnosis. However, high variability of cell shape, edge, localized features, the contrast between cell boundaries and background, cell size and positions have posed as challenges for the efficient object localization during the analysis of such smear images. In this paper, the process of detecting the white blood cells have been undertaken because as per haematology, the WBC tests are tougher and analysing them manually are more difficult as compared to red blood cells. The WBC detection problem has been solved in this article by viewing it as a circle detection problem because WBCs can be approximated as circular in shape. In medical imaging, detecting circular features holds huge significance (Karkavitsas and Rangoussi 2007). As per the existing conventional method of Hough Transform for circle detection in digital images (Muammar and Nixon 1989), an edge detector is used to first find the two necessary and sufficient parameters for circles i.e. the coordinates and the radius of the circle. Upon finding these, the image is averaged over its pixels, followed by filtration for detecting the image peaks. Finally, the image is transformed using a histogram. However, in order to cover all parameters (x, y, r), a lot of memory is required by this method. It also implies a high computational time complexity decreasing its processing speed. Also, the method is not resistant to noise thereby resulting in even lower accuracy (Atherton and Kerbyson 1993). To overcome such a problem, some other approaches based on the Hough transform, for instance the probabilistic Hough transform (Fischler and Bolles 1981; Shaked et al. 1996), the randomized Hough transform (RHT) (Xu et al. 1990), the fuzzy Hough transform, Circular Hough transform with local maximization (Yadav et al. 2014), one-dimensional Hough Transform (Zhou et al. 2014), Hough Transform of curves (Campi et al. 2013) and recently scanline-based hybrid Hough Transform (Seo and Kim 2015) have been proposed with better time complexities but having average memory usage and no noise resistance. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the Hough Transforms, many optimization techniques have been applied to the circle detection problem. These methods have produced much higher accuracy, stability, computational speed and robustness as compared to the discussed Hough Transform as well as other methods like Otsu method based on <b>circular</b> <b>histogram</b> (Wu et al. 2006), WBC identification based on support vector machines (Wang and Chu 2009), and modified transformation methods as proposed in the scientific literatures (Becker et al. 2002; George et al. 2014). These optimization techniques are nature-inspired methods including genetic algorithms (GA) (Ayala-Ramirez et al. 2006), simulated annealing with differential evolution (DE) (Das et al. 2008), harmony search algorithm (Pan et al. 2010, 2011; Cuevas et al. 2012 a, b, c), swarm intelligence methods like ant colony optimization based on ant regeneration and recombination to solve the circle detection problem (Chattopadhyay et al. 2008), adaptive bacterial foraging algorithm with adaptive chemotactic step size to facilitate faster convergence (Dasgupta et al. 2008), artificial bee colony algorithm for circle detection (Cuevas et al. 2012 a, b, c), clonal selection algorithm for circle detection based on artificial immune system (Isa et al. 2010) and fuzzy cellular neural network (Tong et al. 2005; Wang and Cheng 2007 a, b), all of which has been discussed in context of solving the circle detection problem.|$|E

This paper presents a novel non-object centric approach for complex scene analysis. Similarly to previous methods, we use low-level cues to individuate atomic activities and create clip histograms. Differently from recent works, the task of discovering high-level activity patterns is formulated as a convex prototype learning problem. This problem results into a simple linear program that can be solved efficiently with standard solvers. The main advantage of our approach is that, using as objective function the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), the similarity among elementary activities is taken into account in the learning phase. To improve scalability we also consider some variants of EMD adopting L 1 as ground distance for one and two dimensional, linear and <b>circular</b> <b>histograms.</b> In these cases only the similarity between neighboring atomic activities, corresponding to adjacent histogram bins, is taken into account. Therefore we also propose an automatic strategy for sorting atomic activities.

40|$|Although fish escape trajectories are linearly {{related to}} {{stimulus}} direction, they vary considerably {{after the initial}} {{turn away from the}} stimulus. Past studies of escape trajectories in fish and other animals have been analysed by employing linear plots of stimulus angle v rsusbody turning angle. Here, we define escape trajectories as a circular variable, with 0 ˚ as stimulus direction. Angelfish (Pterophyllum eimekei) escape in non-random trajectories when the stimulus is presented laterally, within an angular zone of approximately 30 – 120 ˚ (discriminating zone). The circular plot of escape trajectories shows a bimodal pattern that cannot be revealed by linear analysis. Angelfish escape preferentially at 180 ˚ and 130 ˚ away from the stimulus, maximizing the distance covered from the stimulus and escaping at the limit of their discriminating zone, respectively. Angelfish correct their responses when turning towards the stimulus, suggesting that escape trajectories are modulated by sensory feedback. Re-analysis of published work on other animals, by employing <b>circular</b> <b>histograms</b> of escape trajectories, reveals multimodal patterns which are also not apparent from the linear plots.

In this paper, we propose a new method to probabilistically model and recognize actions of articulated objects, such as hand or body gestures, in image sequences.

At the low level, we first extract a feature vector invariant to scale and in-plane rotation by using the Fourier transform of a <b>circular</b> spatial <b>histogram.</b> Then, spectral partitioning [20] is utilized to obtain an initial clustering; this clustering is then refined using a temporal smoothness constraint. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based clustering and density estimation in the subspace of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are then applied to thousands of image feature vectors to obtain an intermediate level representation. Finally, at the high level we build a temporal multiresolution histogram model for each action by aggregating the clustering weights of sampled images belonging to that action. We discuss how this high level representation can be extended to achieve temporal scaling invariance and to include Bi-gram or Multi-gram transition information. Both image clustering and action recognition/segmentation results are given to show the validity of our three tiered representation. ...|$|R
