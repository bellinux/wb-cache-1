50|$|The Island Caribs were of {{a medium}} height but in general {{were of a}} taller stature than the Arawaks. They were {{described}} as being stronger than the Arawaks reportedly due to the emphasis placed on training for warfare. Their skin was of a brown hue and they were usually naked and suggested {{that it was very}} rare for their loins to be covered. The women painted their skin with a red dye called Roucou, with which they made fantastical decorations of many colours. The eyes of the females were usually circled with black. The men also painted their bodies and on occasion wore feathered headdresses, jewellery through their lips, and jewellery through their noses. They also wore the <b>Caracoli</b> which was a necklace of small bones along with the teeth of defeated enemies from which a crescent shaped ornament was suspended.

50|$|Moist {{forests are}} {{classified}} as being either lowland mesic, montane mesic, lowland wet, or montane wet. Characteristic lowland species are Haitian catalpa (Catalpa longissima), particularly in well-drained soils, and West Indian mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni). Puerto Rican royal palm (Roystonea borinquena) is common where soil is calcareous. Paradise tree (Simarouba glauca), anón de majagua (Lonchocarpus heptaphyllus), jagua (Genipa americana), black olive (Bucida buceras), West Indian lancewood (Oxandra lanceolata) and amacey (Tetragastris balsamifera) are found in small secondary stands. Isolated trees are home to fustic (Maclura tinctoria), logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum), iris (Hippeastrum puniceum), <b>caracolí</b> (Abarema glauca), córbano (Albizia berteriana), West Indian elm (Guazuma ulmifolia), palo de leche (Rauvolfia nitida), and spiny fiddlewood (Citharexylum spinosum). Areas where soils are superficial or savannas have formed from degraded forest are indicated by trees such as the sandpaper tree (Curatella americana), grandleaf seagrape (Coccoloba pubescens), Jamaican nettletree (Trema micrantha) and Tabebuia species. Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) are present in zones that have marginal earth and precipitation closer {{to that of the}} dry forests. Yellow olivier (Buchenavia capitata), sablito (Schefflera morototoni), maricao (Byrsonima spicata) aguacatillo (Alchornea latifolia), West Indian cherry (Prunus myrtifolia), árbol de Santa Maria (Calophyllum brasiliense), cocuyo (Hirtella triandra), American muskwood (Guarea guidonia), palo de yagua (Casearia arborea), locust (Hymenaea courbaril), balatá (Manilkara domingensis) and sierra palm (Prestoea montana) grow in mesic forests. Hispaniolan pine (Pinus occidentalis) is common on lateritic soils. Wet forests consist of trees covered by parasitic plants and epiphytes. The principal indicator species include tree ferns (Cyathea spp.) and Chionanthus species. At higher elevations, characteristic species are the trembling schefflera (Schefflera tremula), black sapote (Diospyros digyna), almendrón (Prunus occidentalis), Fadyen's silktassel (Garrya fadyenii), Weinmannia pinnata, Oreopanax capitatus, Brunellia comocladifolia, Hispaniolan pines, and Cyathea species.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Coffee phenols were identified, {{quantified}} and {{correlated with}} antioxidant activity {{determined by the}} ABTS •+ (2, 2 ’-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid)) and DPPH • (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical) assays. Melanoidins (Maillard reaction products) were determined for green and processed coffee. For green Arabica beans and its products, results suggest that roasting decreases antioxidant activity. However, torrefacto roasted coffee showed greater antioxidant activity than <b>Caracoli</b> beans. Instant coffee showed greater antioxidant activity than green Robusta beans by both assays. A high correlation was found between antioxidant activity and melanoidins, total phenols, caffeic acid, and caffeine...|$|E
40|$|Placemaking in the {{developed}} world can be understood as a concept where through a social and political process, value and meaning in a particular setting is created. This focus of placemaking revolves around a setting in the urban environment, its role as a unique setting and, importantly, the people that make up this place: all of which is focused on a highly structured and formal participatory planning process. The role of placemaking in Latin America’s informal settlements, however, is largelyuntested. With more than 75 % of Latin America’s population living in cities since 2001 and over 30 % (128 million people) of the urban population estimated to reside in what the United Nations define as slums; these informal settlements can offer alternative ways of thinking about urban space and the transformation of spaces people live in. In essence, informal settlements are, to a large extent, what people make of them through their own initiative and imagination. What they achieve is remarkable considering their limited resources and sometimes nonexistent participation in formal planning. Through empirical data collected in 2013 and 2014, this paper discusses how in theabsence of a formal participatory planning process (as the west or developed worldmay perceive it) and lack of resources the barrio of <b>Caracoli,</b> in Bogotá has been ableto create value and meaning in their place. This has been possible, despite social and economic difficulties –which are not to be forgotten-, through inventiveness and the richness of community members’ lives. In this sense, {{it can be argued that}} informal settlements can offer a different path to understanding the concept of placemaking currently dominating {{the developed}} world...|$|E
