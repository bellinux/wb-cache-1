5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on <b>CD-ROM</b> and floppy disk. A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase <b>CD-ROM</b> drives. The <b>CD-ROM</b> format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog to fit the game onto six diskettes.|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} the OPAS (Optical Patent Archiving System) project {{undertaken}} at BASF is outlined. The system was designed {{in the first stage}} to cope with a storage capacity of 2000 <b>CD-ROMs</b> and to print from the <b>CD-ROMs</b> 10, 000 pages of patent documents per week, with the capability for individual manual processing of less frequently used <b>CD-ROMs.</b> It is based on jukeboxes supplied by the NSM company which hold 100 <b>CD-ROMs</b> in stacks of 50. Many difficulties were experienced initially, mainly due to incompatabilities of software, but the system is now working very satisfactorily and currently prints about 15, 000 pages per week, which is about 75 per cent of the documents supplied to inhouse customers. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{title was}} the first LucasArts {{adventure}} game to incorporate voice work on release. The game was not originally planned to include voice work, as at the time, the install base for <b>CD-ROM</b> was too low. As they neared the end of 1992, <b>CD-ROM</b> sales grew significantly. The general manager of LucasArts, Kelly Flock, recognizing that the game would not be done in time {{by the end of}} the year to make the holiday release, suggested that the team include voice work for the game, giving them more time to complete the title.|$|E
5|$|Curse of Enchantia {{was officially}} {{revealed}} under this title at the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) in April 1992. The game was originally {{planned to be}} released in September 1992, but got delayed two months to November 1992. It was the first adventure game by Core Design as well {{as one of the first}} <b>CD-ROM</b> adventure games. Virgin Games bundled it with many of the earliest PC <b>CD-ROM</b> drives in 1993. It was also re-released on CD as part of Encore Multipack, together with Heimdall and Thunderhawk. The game's original release was accompanied by a promotional campaign with valuable prizes (computers and money) in some magazines such as France's Joystick. Owners of computers with newer PC operating systems need to run it using DOSBox.|$|E

5|$|Night Trap {{was ready}} for the launch of the NEMO in 1989 {{alongside}} another interactive movie, Sewer Shark. Both games had a combined budget of about $4.5 million USD ($1.5 for Night Trap, and $3 million for Sewer Shark) making them two of the most expensive video games of the era. However, just before the launch of the NEMO in early 1989, which was now called the Control-Vision, Hasbro canceled the system release. The company cited high hardware costs as the reason. The system was originally intended to sell for $199, but the high manufacturing costs of the system's DRAM drove it to $299. In contrast, the market-leading Nintendo Entertainment System sold for around $100 in 1989. Riley also cited the high cost of filmmaking for giving Hasbro cold feet. Disappointed by the whole affair, Fulop went on to form PF Magic, which later created the Petz virtual pet simulation series. Zito purchased the rights to the abandoned Control-Vision games, and after learning that Sony was considering Sewer Shark for a release on their forthcoming Super NES <b>CD-ROM,</b> he founded his own company to bring them to the system, Digital Pictures. When the Super NES <b>CD-ROM</b> failed to materialize, Zito began working with Sega for a release on the Sega CD. Night Trap transitioned from VHS to <b>CD-ROM</b> and was released in 1992 for the Sega CD, five years after it was originally filmed.|$|E

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of multimedia software {{as a special}} feature was a novelty when Chrysalis Records released the Billy Idol's Cyberpunk diskette. This was also widely adopted by the music industry years later. <b>CD-ROMs</b> were initially considered as a medium for Cyberpunks multimedia features, but were too expensive {{at the time of}} production, and so floppy disks were used instead. Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren had previously experimented with <b>CD-ROMs,</b> but it was hoped that if Idol's album had proved popular, it could have been reissued with <b>CD-ROMs,</b> catapulting the format into the music industry's mainstream. This never materialised due to the album's general failures. However, during the late '90s it became increasingly common for some limited edition digipaks to include <b>CD-ROMs,</b> evolving by the early 2000s into the {{inclusion of}} DVDs.|$|R

The <b>CD-ROM</b> version of 15th Anniversary Edition contains strict digital rights management technology– upon installation, the game verifies the user's serial number through the Internet, allowing only for five installations of the game using any given serial number. Uninstallation does not reset the count, so after five installations, the player must purchase a new copy. This problem does not exist on the digital copy sold by GOG.com.|$|E
