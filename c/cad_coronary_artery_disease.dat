In the instances where people experience sudden death, it is most commonly found that they were suffering from <b>CAD</b> (<b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease)</b> or ASCAD (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease), or any level of stress. However, studies reveal that people experienced early symptoms within the week before the terminal event such as chest pain at ~52% of victims, dyspnea at ~22%, syncope at ~7% and ~19% who experienced no symptoms. Scientists have also associated this syndrome with the gene SCN5A that is mutated and affects the function of the heart.

To this end, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association.

All observational and comparative studies directly investigating the relationship between decreased BMD and clinical consequences of atherosclerotic vascular abnormalities, including carotid artery calcification (CAC), cardiovascular <b>disease</b> (<b>CAD),</b> and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> (<b>CAD)</b> were obtained, without limitation of language or publication year. A total of 25 studies involving 10, 299 patients were included. The incidence of atherosclerotic vascular abnormalities was significantly increased in low BMD patients, {{compared to patients with}} normal BMD (OR, 1. 81, 95 % CI [1. 01, 2. 19], p< 0. 00001)). Similar results were also observed for postmenopausal women (OR, 2. 23, 95 % CI [1. 72, 2. 89], p< 0. 00001). Subgroup analyses of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and normal BMD also revealed that the combined ORs for the incidence of atherosclerotic vascular abnormalities increased as BMD decreased.

40|$|Waqas Khan, Jeffrey S BorerDivision of Cardiovascular Medicine and the Department of Medicine, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center and College of Medicine, Brooklyn and New York, NY, USAAbstract: Angina pectoris is {{the most}} common symptom of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> (<b>CAD).</b> Angina results from an {{imbalance}} between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Heart rate (HR) reduction can beneficially alter both elements of this imbalance by increasing diastolic filling time and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. Therefore, HR reduction is an accepted approach to angina prevention. &szlig;-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates are currently the cornerstones in prevention and management of stable angina. However, use of these treatments may be limited by adverse effects or development of tolerance. Thus, additional approaches to angina prevention may be useful for many patients with CAD. The discovery of the f-channel and the resulting current, If, that modulates the rate of spontaneous diastolic depolarization of sinoatrial nodal (SAN) myocytes led to the study of these channels as targets for lowering HR. This resulted {{in the development of a}} novel agent, ivabradine, a selective and specific If inhibitor. Ivabradine slows the slope of diastolic depolarization of the action potential in the SAN cells, decreasing HR at rest and during exercise, but has no other cardiovascular effects. In different subpopulations with chronic stable angina, ivabradine markedly improves exercise capacity and significantly decreases the number of ambient angina attacks. In a post-hoc analysis of the BEAUTIFUL trial (morBidity-mortality EvAlUaTion of the If inhibitor ivabradine in patients with coronary disease and left-ventricULar dysfunction), ivabradine also reduced mortality, myocardial infarctions, and heart failure hospitalizations among patients with angina. To date, the drug has been well tolerated; transient visual disturbances and bradycardia are the only potentially important, though relatively infrequent, concerns and are readily reversible with drug cessation. This article will review and critically evaluate the data supporting use of ivabradine in patients with CAD and angina, both in preventing the symptom and, potentially, in altering the natural history of <b>CAD.</b> Keywords: <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease,</b> cardiovascular pharmacology, clinical trial...|$|R

BackgroundIHD {{is the leading cause}} of mortality, and its pathogenesis is diverse in women. Fingertip RH-PAT is a new device that provides noninvasive, automatic, and quantitative evaluation of endothelial dysfunction. MethodsRH-PAT was measured using Endo-PAT 2000 (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) before cardiac catheterization in 140 stable women scheduled for hospitalization to examine chest pain. NOCAD was diagnosed by angiography with measurement of coronary blood flow and cardiac lactate production during intracoronary acetylcholine provocation test and cardiac scintigraphy with stress tests. ResultsSixty-eight women (49 %) had obstructive CAD and 42 women (30 %) had NOCAD. RH-PAT indexes were significantly attenuated in both obstructive CAD and NOCAD as compared with non-IHD (n = 30) (obstructive CAD: median 1. 57, interquartile range [IQR] 1. 42 to 1. 76; NOCAD: median 1. 58, IQR 1. 41 to 1. 78; non-IHD: median 2. 15, IQR 1. 85 to 2. 48, p < 0. 001). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, only RH-PAT index was significantly associated with IHD, including obstructive CAD and NOCAD (odds ratio 0. 51; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 38 to 0. 68; p < 0. 001). In receiver-operating characteristic analysis, RH-PAT index was a significant predictor of IHD (area under the curve 0. 86; p < 0. 001). Furthermore, only RH-PAT was useful for the prediction of NOCAD after excluding obstructive CAD (area under the curve 0. 85; p < 0. 001; RH-PAT index of < 1. 82 had 81 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity). ConclusionsRH-PAT indexes were significantly attenuated in women with IHD. Digital RH-PAT can predict patients with IHD, especially NOCAD before angiography.

40|$|Identification of {{individuals}} {{who are at risk}} of suffering from acute coronary syndromes (ACS) may allow to introduce preventative measures. We aimed to identify ACS-related urinary peptides, that combined as a pattern can be used as prognostic biomarker. Proteomic data of 252 individuals enrolled in four prospective studies from Australia, Europe and North America were analyzed. 126 of these had suffered from ACS within a period of up to 5 years post urine sampling (cases). Proteomic analysis of 84 cases and 84 matched controls resulted in the discovery of 75 ACS-related urinary peptides. Combining these to a peptide pattern, we established a prognostic biomarker named Acute Coronary Syndrome Predictor 75 (ACSP 75). ACSP 75 demonstrated reasonable prognostic discrimination (c-statistic = 0. 664), which was similar to Framingham risk scoring (c-statistics = 0. 644) in a validation cohort of 42 cases and 42 controls. However, generating by a composite algorithm named Acute Coronary Syndrome Composite Predictor (ACSCP), combining the biomarker pattern ACSP 75 with the previously established urinary proteomic biomarker <b>CAD</b> 238 characterizing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> as the underlying aetiology, and age as a risk factor, further improved discrimination (c-statistic = 0. 751) resulting in an added prognostic value over Framingham risk scoring expressed by an integrated discrimination improvement of 0. 273 ± 0. 048 (P < 0. 0001) and net reclassification improvement of 0. 405 ± 0. 113 (P = 0. 0007).

We investigated endothelial function, mtROS production and AMPK activation in saphenous veins from patients with advanced CAD. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was impaired in patients with CAD and T 2 D relative to those with CAD alone. Levels of mitochondrial H 2 O 2 and activity of AMPK were significantly elevated in primary HSVECs (human saphenous vein endothelial cells) from patients with CAD and T 2 D compared with those from patients with CAD alone. Incubation with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ 10 significantly reduced AMPK activity in HSVECs from patients with CAD and T 2 D but not in cells from patients with CAD alone. Elevated mtROS production in the endothelium of patients with CAD and T 2 D increases AMPK activation, supporting a role for the kinase in defence against oxidative stress. Further investigation is required to determine whether pharmacological activators of AMPK will prove beneficial in the attenuation of endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAD and T 2 D...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we sought to}} {{evaluate}} the role of three polymorphisms in the ecNOS (endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase) gene {{in relation to the}} existence, severity and progression of <b>CAD</b> (<b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease),</b> MI (myocardial infarction) and the occurrence of ischaemia in a predominantly Caucasian population. Patients with CAD (n = 760) and age- and sex-matched population-based controls (n = 691) were genotyped for the - 786 T/C, E/D 298 and 4 a/b polymorphisms. Patients were randomized to pravastatin (40 mg) or placebo. Progression of atherosclerosis was evaluated by sequential angiography. Functionality was assessed by ST segment analysis of ambulant ECGs. The E 298 (P = 0. 003) and 4 a (P = 0. 001) alleles were associated with CAD. Furthermore, E 298 (P = 0. 009) and - 786 T (P = 0. 022) alleles were associated with previous MI among patients, predominantly smokers. D/D 298 homozygotes, but not - 786 T/C or 4 a/ 4 b mutants, had longer-lasting ischaemia than others (P < 0. 05). We found no differences in progression of atherosclerosis, irrespective of pravastatin use. We conclude that the E/D 298 polymorphism is most consistently associated with CAD, but not with progression of atherosclerosis. The E allele is associated with CAD and MI, whereas the ID allele is associated with ischaemi...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, <b>CAD</b> (<b>Coronary</b> <b>Artery</b> <b>Disease)</b> {{has been the}} leading cause of death {{worldwide}} [1]. Extraction of arteries is a crucial step for accurate visualization, quantification, and tracking of pathologies. However, coronary artery segmentation is one of the most challenging problems in medical image analysis, since arteries are complex tubular structures with bifurcations, and have possible pathologies. Moreover, appearance of blood vessels and their geometry can be perturbed by stents, calcifications and pathologies such as stenosis. Besides, noise, contrast and resolution artifacts can make the problem more challenging. In this thesis, we present a novel tubular structure segmentation method based on an intensity-based tensor that fits to a vessel, which is inspired from diffusion tensor image (DTI) modeling. The anisotropic tensor inside the vessel drives the segmentation analogously to a tractography approach in DTI. Our model is initialized with a single seed point and it is capable of capturing whole vessel tree by an automatic branch detection algorithm. The centerline of the vessel as well as its thickness is extracted. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on 3 complex tubular structured synthetic datasets, and on 8 CTA (Computed Tomography Angiography) datasets (from Rotterdam Coronary Artery Algorithm Evaluation Framework) for quantitative validation. Additionally, extracted arteries from 10 CTA volumes are qualitatively evaluated by a cardiologist expert's visual scores...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{our study}} was to examine the {{possibility}} of ventricular extrasystole (VES) management in <b>CAD</b> (<b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease)</b> patients by attenuating the sympathetic activity with a course of electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. Methods: A decrease in sympathetic tone was achieved via vagus nerve electrical stimulation (VNES). VNES was performed in 48 male CAD patients, mean age 53. 5 ± 4. 1 years. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy was canceled prior to VNES therapy. The effect of VNES on heart rate variability (HRV) and VES were carefully studied. All the patients received a 24 -hour ECG monitoring. HRV was calculated for high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) bands and the LF/HF index was determined. Results: Immediately following VNES therapy, 30 patients (group 1) reported alleviation of angina signs and the LF/HF index was significantly decreased (p= 0. 001). Eighteen patients (group 2) showed no change either in health or the LF/HF index. According to ECG and echocardiography, the VES number did not significantly change immediately after VNES therapy. One month after the VNES course, group 1 reported further improvement in health; the LF/HF index approached normal values. In group 2, the LF/HF significantly decreased (p= 0. 043). However, in the entire study sample, the VES number significantly decreased overall (p= 0. 025). Conclusion: VNES attenuated the cardiac effects of hypersympathicotonia decreased the ischemic impact on the myocardium, alleviated the cardiac angina signs, and beneficially influenced the VES number in CAD patients...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the effects of coronary atherosclerosis morphology and extent on myocardial flow reserve (MFR). BackgroundAlthough the relationship between coronary stenosis and myocardial perfusion is well established, little is known about the contribution of other anatomic descriptors of atherosclerosis burden to this relationship. MethodsWe evaluated the relationship between atherosclerosis plaque burden, morphology, and composition and regional MFR (MFRregional) in 73 consecutive patients undergoing Rubidium- 82 positron emission tomography and coronary computed tomography angiography for the evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease. ResultsAtherosclerosis was seen in 51 of 73 patients and in 107 of 209 assessable coronary arteries. On a per-vessel basis, the percentage diameter stenosis (p = 0. 02) or summed stenosis score (p = 0. 002), integrating stenoses in series, was the best predictor of MFRregional. Importantly, MFRregional varied widely within each coronary stenosis category, even in vessels with nonobstructive plaques (n = 169), 38 % of which had abnormal MFRregional (< 2. 0). Total plaque length, composition, and remodeling index were not associated with lower MFR. On a per-patient basis, the modified Duke <b>CAD</b> (<b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease)</b> index (p = 0. 04) and the number of segments with mixed plaque (p = 0. 01) were the best predictors of low MFRglobal. ConclusionsComputed tomography angiography descriptors of atherosclerosis had only a modest effect on downstream MFR. On a per-patient basis, the extent and severity of atherosclerosis as assessed by the modified Duke CAD index and the number of coronary segments with mixed plaque were associated with decreased MFR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is an {{independent}} risk factor for coronary artery disease (<b>CAD).</b> <b>Coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> {{is the leading cause}} of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. The outcomes of CAD are poorer in patients with CKD. In addition to traditional risk factors, several uremia-related risk factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification, hyperhomocysteinemia, and immunosuppressants have been associ-ated with accelerated atherosclerosis. A number of uremia-related biomarkers are identified as predictors of cardiac out-comes in CKD patients. The symptoms of CAD may not be typical in patients with CKD. Both dobutamine stress echo-cardiography and radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging have moderate sensitivity and specificity in detecting ob-structive CAD in CKD patients. Invasive coronary angiography carries a risk of contrast nephropathy in patients with ad-vanced CKD. It should be reserved for those patients with a high risk for CAD and those who would benefit from revas-cularization. Guideline-recommended therapies are, in general, underutilized in renal patients. Medical therapy should be considered the initial strategy for clinically stable CAD. The effects of statins in patients with advanced CKD have been neutral despite a lipid-lowering effect. Compared to non-CKD population, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is as-sociated with higher procedure complications, restenosis, and future cardiac events even in the drug-eluting stent era in patients with CKD. Compared with PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) reduces repeat revascularizations but is associated with significant perioperative morbidity and mortality. Screening for CAD is an important part of preoperative evaluation for kidney transplant candidates...|$|E

Recent research on the adverse cardiovascular consequences of feelings of exhaustion and acute psychological arousal is reviewed, and a classification of psychological risk factors is presented distinguishing (1) chronic psychological risk factors, such as hostility; (2) episodic risk factors, such as exhaustion, with a duration ranging from several months to 2 years; and (3) acute psychological triggers, including mental activity and anger. The distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms by which these psychological risk factors promote coronary disease progression and cardiac ischemia are described, including hemodynamic reactivity, blood clotting, and inflamma-tory processes.

40|$|Aims: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> (<b>CAD)</b> affects {{not only the}} conduit epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> but also the microvascular coronary bed. Moreover, coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMVD) often precedes the stage of clinically overt epicardial <b>CAD.</b> <b>Coronary</b> <b>artery</b> calcium (CAC) and carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT) measured with computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound, respectively, are among the available techniques to non-invasively assess atherosclerotic burden.

It is therefore of interest to explore and compare the potential of CAC against C-IMT to predict minimal coronary vascular resistance (CVR).
