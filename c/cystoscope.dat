The diagnosis of IP and its differentiation from a malignant pathology is a diagnostic dilemma for Urologist and Pathologist as both entities share certain similar morphological and histo-pathological appearance as well as immuno-histo chemistry staining. It is however crucial to avoid misdiagnosis as the treatment option varies significantly between a radical or partial cystectomy with future surveillance <b>cystoscopes.</b> Hereby, we highlight a case of a benign variant of spindle cell tumour of bladder which needed second pathology review for confirmation and thus avoiding a radical cystectomy.

40|$|Orthophthalaldehyde {{high level}} {{disinfectants}} are contraindicated {{for use with}} urological instruments such as <b>cystoscopes</b> due to anaphylaxis-like allergic reactions during surveillance of bladder cancer patients.

Possibly these endoscopes were not adequately rinsed after disinfection by orthophthalaldehyde. We examined this possibility {{by means of a}} zone-of-inhibition test, and also a test to extract residues of orthophthalaldehyde with acetonitrile, from sections of endoscope insertion tube materials, to measure the presence of alkaline glutaraldehyde, or glutaraldehyde plus 20 % w/w isopropanol, or ortho-phthalaldehyde that remained on the endoscope materials after exposure to these disinfectants followed by a series of rinses in water, or by aeration overnight. Zones of any size indicated the disinfectant had not been rinsed away from the endoscope material. There were no zones of inhibition surrounding endoscope materials soaked in glutaraldehyde or glutaraldehyde plus isopropanol after three serial water rinses according to manufacturers' rinsing directions. The endoscope material soaked in orthophthalaldehyde produced zones of inhibition even after fifteen serial rinses with water. Orthophthalaldehyde was extracted from the rinsed endoscope material by acetonitrile. These data, and other information, indicate that the high level disinfectant orthophthalaldehyde, also known as 1, 2 -benzene dialdehyde, cannot be rinsed away from flexible endoscope material with any practical number of rinses with water, or by drying overnight...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{increasing}} body {{of evidence}} suggests a possible role of suburothelial myofibroblasts (MFs) in bladder mechanosensation and in the pathophysiology of detrusor overactivity (DO). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether markers of MFs, including gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx 43) and c-kit have altered immunohistochemical expression in the suburothelium of patients with neurogenic DO (NDO) or idiopathic DO (IDO) and whether this is affected by successful treatment of DO with botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with NDO (n= 10) or IDO (n= 11) were treated in a single-centre, open-label study of intradetrusor BoNTA injections. Control tissue was obtained from 10 patients undergoing pelvic-floor repair procedures who had no overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00662064. INTERVENTIONS: Bladder biopsies performed with flexible <b>cystoscopes</b> were obtained from control subjects and from NDO and IDO patients before BoNTA treatment and at 4 wk and 16 wk after treatment. They were studied with quantitative immunofluorescence using antibodies to connexin 43 (Cx 43), vimentin, and c-kit. MEASUREMENTS: Differences in Cx 43, vimentin, and c-kit immunoreactivity between control subjects and NDO or IDO patients (primary outcomes). Changes in NDO or IDO, Cx 43 immunoreactivity, and c-kit immunoreactivity after BoNTA treatment (secondary outcomes). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Cx 43 immunoreactivity was increased in both IDO and NDO patients compared to controls, but remained unchanged after BoNTA treatment. C-kit immunoreactivity was similar in NDO/IDO patients and controls and remained unchanged after BoNTA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Increased gap junction formation in the suburothelium has been demonstrated in biopsies from humans with DO. It is hypothesised that this change could have {{a significant role in}} the pathogenesis of the detrusor abnormality. Successful treatment of NDO or IDO does not appear to be associated with changes in the expression of Cx 43 or c-kit on suburothelial MFs...|$|R
