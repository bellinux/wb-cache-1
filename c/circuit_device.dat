50|$|A {{well-known}} integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> around 1980, the Reticon SAD-1024 implemented two 512-stage analog delay {{lines in}} a 16-pin DIP.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{magnetostrictive}} phased array sensor (MPAS) with a polycrystalline nickel patch of a circular comb shape {{in order for the}} use of the ultrasonic guided Lamb wave inspection technique. The MPAS was comprised of two main components of the surface-mounted nickel patch and a mobile magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> enclosing six sensing coils and center-positioned cylindrical biasing magnets. The magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> detects the magnetic property change induced by the elastic wave propagation through the magnetostrictive nickel patch bonded to a thin aluminum plate. The individual sensing coils were configured to have directional preferences specified along the perpendicular direction of the coil winding, and they were arranged in a hexagon with a radius of 0. 5 ” to form a compact-sized phased array sensor. Although the magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> contains only six physical sensing coils, the MPAS enables to increase the total numbers of sensing positions by altering the orientation of the magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device.</b> The enhanced directional sensing capability of the presented MPAS was achieved as a result of the combined effect on the high magnetic shape anisotropy feature along the individual comb finger directions of the nickel patch and the directional sensitivity of the hexagon magnetic <b>circuit</b> <b>device</b> itself...|$|E
