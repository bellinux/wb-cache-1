40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of latent fingerprint development techniques is {{heavily influenced by}} the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the deposition surface. The use of powder suspensions is increasing for development of prints on a range of surfaces. We demonstrate that carbon powder suspension development on polymers is detrimentally affected by the presence of common white pigment, titanium dioxide. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that patches of the compound are clearly associated with increased levels of powder adhesion. Substrates with nonlocalized titanium dioxide content also exhibit increased levels of carbon powder staining on a surface-wide basis. Secondary ion mass spectrometry and complementary techniques demonstrate the importance of levels of the pigment within the top 30 nm. The association is independent of fingermark deposition and may be related to surface energy variation. The detrimental effect of the pigment is not observed with small-particle reagent (MoS 2 SPR) or <b>cyanoacrylate</b> (superglue) <b>fuming</b> techniques that exploit different development mechanisms...|$|R

Subsequent VMD processing results in additional areas of development, for example, between pores. However, the primary mode of deposition of zinc is by interaction with the polymerized CA, the fibrils of which become decorated with zinc nanoparticles.

Midkiff and Codell (1995) observed that thickness, type and consistency of adhesive affect the quality of cyanoacrylate-fumed developed fingermarks. A novel luminescent cyanoacrylate such as lumicyano was used to develop latent fingerprints on glass and a number of semiporous and nonporous surfaces in a single processing step without any further treatment (Prete et al. 2013).

In addition, the amount of time required to develop a high quality latent print was found to be minimal. The cyanoacrylate polymerization process is extremely rapid.

They also compared two-step <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> using basic yellow 40 (LCA 4 %[*]→[*]LCA 4 %[*]→[*]BY 40) and a one-step fluorescent <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> using Lumicyano and observed that two-step process gave better quality prints than one-step process under vacuum conditions. They also observed that increase in amount of Lumicyano 4 % cyanoacrylate and fuming time gave lower detection rate than double process with Lumicyano 4 %. However, double process with conventional cyanoacrylate did not improve the detection rate. In another study, Farrugia et al. (2014 a) advocate the use of Lumicyano™ (one-step fluorescent cyanoacrylate product) followed by basic yellow 40 dyeing (LCA 1 %[*]→[*]BY 40) over <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> followed by basic yellow 40 dyeing (CA[*]→[*]BY 40) and powder suspensions for developing latent fingermarks on plastic carrier bags as its use is easy, safe and fast requiring no drying or dyeing process without compromising the quality of developed prints.

Four percent Lumicyano[*]→[*]BY 40 in place of solvent black 3 and iron-oxide powder suspensions was also suggested to develop greasy fingermarks on semiporous surfaces. Payne et al. (2014) observed that sebaceous prints on bass surface degrade more quickly in light than in dark. They suggested that silver electroless deposition (SED) is a suitable alternative method to <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> method for development of latent fingermarks on brass surfaces except for metals which are coated in a lacquer. Snyder (2009) suggested the use of Sudan black over magnetic powder, ninhydrin, physical developer, cyanoacrylate with Sudan black, cyanoacrylate with ninhydrin and cyanoacrylate with physical developer to develop latent fingermarks in petroleum jelly. Boateng et al. (2016) used ABC dry fire extinguisher powder to develop latent fingermarks on heated and unheated tile, metal and glass surfaces. They compared fire extinguisher powder method with fluorescent powder, magnetic powder, granular white or black powder and cyanoacrylate[*]→[*]rhodamine methods and observed that quality of prints developed with fire extinguisher powder is comparable to prints developed by these methods on both heated and unheated surfaces. They suggested that fire extinguisher powder binds to metal ions present in latent fingermark residues.|$|E
30|$|Day et al. (2004) {{observed}} that <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> process {{did not cause}} any interference in the detection of drugs of abuse (codeine phosphate, cocaine hydrochloride, amphetamine sulphate, barbital and nitrazepam) and potential adulterants (caffeine, aspirin, paracetamol, starch and talc) by Raman spectroscopy. Raman bands due to cyanoacrylate polymer were present but their presence did not cause any difficulty in establishing the identity of these drugs in even {{in the presence of}} adulterants. Sundar and Rowell (2014) identify drugs of abuse (cocaine and methadone) and therapeutic drugs (aspirin, caffeine and paracetamol) by Surface Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (SALDI-TOFMS) or Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation TOF-MS (MALDI-TOF-MS).

30|$|With {{the passage}} of time, natural {{dehydration}} occurs in latent fingermark deposit. Development of these latent fingermarks is difficult due to their exposure to harsh environmental conditions such as low humidity, UV light, or heat. Several pretreatment methods intended to reintroduce moisture to dehydrated fingermarks have been reported. These methods include exposure to acetic acid vapor, ammonia vapor and heated water vapor. Pre-exposure to UV and X-ray radiations was suggested for developing age-degraded latent fingermarks on glass by <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> method (Ristova et al. 2016). Pretreatment with vapors of ammonia (a weak base) was also suggested to reintroduce the moisture in dry latent fingermarks and thus improve the results of <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> on aged latent fingermarks (McLaren et al. 2010; Burns et al. 1998). Pre-treatment with valine-based and red fluorescent powders were suggested to develop aged latent fingerprints on black polyvinyl chloride by <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> method. It was observed that degradation of latent fingermarks depends on moisture (Nixon et al. 2013). The use of 10 %[*]w/v methylamine solution over dimethylamine, ethylamine and trimethylamine was suggested as an effective pretreatment solution to develop dry, depleted and aged latent fingermarks {{on a wide range}} of surfaces including polyethylene. They observed that pretreatment of aged latent fingermarks with 10 %[*]w/v methylamine solution improves the polymerization of cyanoacrylate (McLaren et al. 2010; Montgomery et al. 2012). Steele et al. (2012) observed that pre-cooling of non-porous (glass, copper, zinc-steel alloy) items prior to <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> significantly increases the detection sensitivity of developed prints due to the increased deposition of cyanoacrylate on latent fingermark residues which resulted due to modification in pseudo-crystalline structure of polymer. The process also increases the adherence of dye staining during post-treatment of cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints. Bouwmeester et al. (2016) suggested that lumicyano can be used in place of conventional cyanoacrylate as a preparatory (or pretreatment) step to develop latent fingermarks in blood on black polypropene sheet with SPR- W (small particle reagent white) and acid yellow 7. They observed that different processing methods did not affect the DNA recovery. Photography of developed fingermarks on the same day of their development was also advised.|$|E
30|$|On semi-porous items, MMD II offers {{better results}} as {{compared}} to <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> and luminescent staining (Jones, 2002).

30|$|Scott (2009) {{observed}} that treatment of adhesive side of some items (latex and nitrile gloves, duct, masking and scotch tape) with <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> causes interference with subsequent powder suspension processing.

30|$|<b>Cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> is a {{chemical}} method {{for development of}} latent fingermarks on non-porous surfaces.

It develops stable white colored fingerprints. The quality of developed prints can be improved by subsequent powdering and/or staining procedures. It is an efficient, non-destrcutive and excellent procedure for developing latent fingermarks.|$|E
30|$|Different {{methods have}} been {{reported}} for the processing of developing latent fingermarks using <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming.</b> Simple homemade system consisting of a chamber, such as a glass aquarium, {{can be used to}} develop cyanoacrylate vapors by suitable heat source like hot plate, heater etc. and fumed the articles bearing latent impression at minimal cost. Articles to be processed are suspended in chamber and small amount of liquid cyanoacrylate is heated to around 80 to 100  °C to produce sufficient vapor. A container of water must also be placed in the tank to provide sufficient humidity for the development of prints. Low humidity causes the appearance of weakly developed prints with poor contrast. Development process should be regularly inspected to avoid over-development. Temperature control, proper vapor circulation and automatic removal of the cyanoacrylate vapor are some of the added advantages of commercial fuming chamber over home-made chamber. Some systems also have humidity control (Champod et al. 2004). Stokes and Brennan (1995) developed a reliable, robust and easy to use free standing cabinet for the automatic development of latent fingermarks using <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming.</b> Some authors used cyanoacrylate treated neutral filter paper to develop latent fingermarks on cadavers, living skin, currency, kraft paper, leather, wood and silk fabric. The neutral filter paper was brushed or sprayed with cyanoacrylate ester or cyanoacrylate ether solution allowed to dry for several minutes. The treated paper was then put on the surface bearing latent fingermarks. This paper should be left on the surface for 5 to 60  min depending upon the nature of surface (Jian and Dao-an 1991). Almog and Gabay (1986) used glass desiccators and polythene bag as a fuming cabinet to develop latent fingermarks on different kinds of porous surfaces using <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> method.|$|E
30|$|It was {{observed}} that relative humidity {{and long term}} storage of latent fingermarks prior to processing had negligible effect {{on the quality of}} cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints on polypropylene foils (Schwarz and Hermanowski 2012). In contrast to this, other authors observed that relative humidity during <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> effects the quality of developed prints and microstructure of the polycyanoacrylate. However, relative humidity has less influence on sebaceous marks (Paine et al. 2011). Kendall observed that several hours to several days may take place to develop latent fingermarks using super glue fuming (Kendall 1982). However, heating of cyanoacrylate reduces the time required to develop latent fingermarks (Olenik 1984). Overheating of cyanoacrylate ester should be avoided as it produces toxic hydrogen cyanide, if heated above approximately 220  °C (Mock 1985; Masters 2002). Kendall and Rehn (1983) observed that polymerization of cyanoacrylate reduces the time required to develop latent fingermarks. Pires and Springer (2016) observed that aluminum did not retard the polymerization of cyanoacrylate prior to vaporization. However, in contrast to this, some studies reported that aluminum acts as a polymerization retardant in developing latent fingermarks using <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> method (Olenik 1984; Olenik 1983; Lewis et al. 2001; Tuthill 1982).|$|E
30|$|<b>Cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> is a {{chemical}} method {{for the detection}} of latent fingermarks on non-porous surfaces such as plastic, glass, rubber bands, finished and unfinished wood etc. The method relies on the deposition of polymerized cyanoacrylate ester on latent fingermark residue (Ramotowski 2012). In 1978, Criminal Identification Division of the Japanese National Police Agency devised this method (Carrick 1983). L.W. Wood, in May of 1979, at the Northampton Police Headquarters in the United Kingdom, and, Louis Bourdon, in July of 1980, of Ontario, Canada also concurrent discovered this method (German 2003).|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the optimal method for latent fingerprints development on dry non-porous surfaces submerged in aquatic environments at different time interval.

Therefore, latent fingerprints were deposited on metallic, plastic and glass objects and submerged in fresh and sea water for 1, 2, and 10 days. After recovery, the items were processed by black powder, small particle reagent and <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> and the prints were examined.

30|$|Since {{the late}} 1970 s, <b>Cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> (super glue) {{continues}} to be adaptable, effective and popular development technique on almost all non-porous surfaces and some porous surfaces. Paine et al. demonstrated how Cyanoacrylate vapor is selectively attracted to fingerprint residues, where it polymerizes on the fingerprint ridges to form a hard, white polymer known as poly- ethylcyanoacrylate (PECA). The study also clarified the importance of humidity {{and its effect on}} cyanoacrylate enhancement being a primary initiator of polymerization (Paine et al. 2011). Fully developed CA prints are a white three-dimensional matrix, often visible to the unaided eye, and can be further enhanced with a variety of techniques. This method should to be done in an enclosed space to enclose the fumes and because oxygen is considered a terminating agent for the polymerization process. Fuming with cyanoacrylate can be achieved by several means, ranging from inexpensive home-made chambers to large expensive commercial units (Dadmun 2009; Wargacki et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{degradation}} of sebaceous fingerprints on brass surfaces using silver electroless deposition (SED) as a visualization technique. We have stored fingerprints on brass squares either (i) in a locked dark cupboard or (ii) in glass-filtered natural daylight for periods of 3 h, 24 h, 1 week, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks. We find that fingerprints on brass surfaces degrade much more rapidly when kept in the light than they do under dark conditions with a much higher proportion of high-quality prints found after 3 or 6 weeks of aging when stored in the dark. This process is more marked than for similar fingerprints on black PVC surfaces. Identifiable prints can be achieved on brass surfaces using both SED and <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming</b> (CFM).

However, before immunolabeling can be used in forensic practice more information on the possibilities and limitations of this technique is required. In this study, our aim was to investigate if immunolabeling is compatible with standard development protocols (indanedione-zinc, indanedione-zinc followed by ninhydrin spraying, physical developer, <b>cyanoacrylate</b> <b>fuming,</b> cyanoacrylate followed by basic yellow staining, lumicyanoacrylate fuming and polycyanoacrylate fuming). Immunolabeling was carried out successfully on all developed fingermarks, whereby dermcidin was selected as antigen of interest. We can conclude that immunolabeling is compatible {{with a wide variety of}} different fingermark developers. This finding in combination with previous findings, makes immunolabeling an interesting technique, which can be of great value in the forensic field.
