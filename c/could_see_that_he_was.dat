25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland's men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they stepped over Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose. Moore <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being significantly outflanked on the right and chose to fall back rather than be surrounded.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> already there.|$|E
2500|$|Nechayev {{began to}} tell me his plans for {{carrying}} out a revolution in Russia in the near future. I felt terrible: it was really painful {{for me to say}} [...] "That's unlikely," [...] "I don't know about that". I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very serious, that this was no idle chatter about revolution. He could and would act – wasn't he the ringleader of the students? ... I could imagine no greater pleasure than serving the revolution. I had dared only to dream of it, and yet now he was saying that he wanted to recruit me... And what did I know of [...] "the people"? I knew only the house serfs of Biakolovo and the members of my weaving collective, while he was himself a worker by birth.|$|E
60|$|Miller was shaken. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> sat {{like one}} who has been dealt a {{stunning}} blow.|$|R
60|$|Later {{in the day}} {{he came to me}} again. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had made}} no fresh discovery.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I {{looked upon}} him I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> spoke words of truth. The light {{in his eye}} told me <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was indeed beyond {{the power of the}} elixir.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the unfortunate}} {{individual}} came in sight. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> completely exhausted.|$|E
60|$|Chauncey Dike {{stopped in}} his tracks and haw-hawed with laughter. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not very much pleased.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me! Me, of {{all people}} in the world!" [...] he {{repeated}} portentously. But I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> frightened. Such want of tact! ...|$|E
60|$|One day {{he came to}} me as I {{was sitting}} in the club, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had had an idea. He looked happier than he had done in weeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{thinking}} all isn't {{quite as}} it should be aboard of this ship, sir," [...] said he. He was a hard-faced man, and yet I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been startled.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{knew what}} had made me {{possibly}} as sick as Harrison, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was trying to draw me, and I answered, “It {{was because of the}} brutal treatment of that boy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Palliser!" [...] said she;--and {{though she}} made no scene, though she merely glanced upon him once, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} George doubtfully. Harold {{looking down}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> holding the lantern {{above his head}} and staring at something very hard.|$|E
60|$|He {{nodded his}} head, {{and even in}} the gloom I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> smiling the gentle, wistful smile which I {{connected}} with him.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped and}} chafed his red hands abstractedly together. She <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had evidently just washed them--and the glaring ring was more in {{evidence}} than ever. But the thought {{gave her an}} inspiration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he is sensitive, {{and could}} not stay to face such an accusation. Of course Roland did not say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was foolish, but I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>that</b> it was an awful pity." ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had already}} {{gathered}} spirit for new endeavor with the play, {{and her heart}} yearned upon him in pride and fondness. [...] "Oh, you dear! What {{do you intend to}} do next?" ...|$|R
60|$|His {{face grew}} a trifle more animated; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> recovering. The dumb stupor which had held his {{features}} rigid was passing away.|$|E
60|$|My ready {{acquiescence}} pleased him. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> relieved. I {{think he}} had expected me to jib {{at the prospect of}} actual work.|$|E
60|$|He {{placed the}} lantern upon an upright sack of mealies, and {{carefully}} balanced {{it before he}} answered. Jess <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taking time to consider.|$|E
6000|$|Maisie considered. [...] "She wouldn't have me even now." [...] She <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had his idea, {{but that}} her tone {{impressed}} him. That disappointed her a little, though {{in an instant}} he rang out again.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} who should appear {{from behind the}} angle of some building--we were talking in the stableyard, near the gun-room--but Lord Ragnall himself. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had overheard the conversation, for he looked angry.|$|R
60|$|Well, I scolded Hans {{because he}} {{believed}} in what this doctor said, for I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did believe it, then went to question Umslopogaas, whom I found looking quite pleased, which annoyed me still more.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> interested, and I {{knew that}} as I spoke {{he had looked}} {{through the window and}} seen the man writing the letter.|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} table. As I had expected, de Cartienne was {{watching}} us, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> straining every nerve to overhear our conversation.|$|E
60|$|She leant back in {{her chair}} and looked laughingly at the young man. She <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{genuinely}} cross, if at the same time slightly excited.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he turned}} off, and walked hastily away. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had spoken with difficulty, and that, {{in spite of}} his efforts to appear {{composed}} and tranquil, his mouth was twitching, and his eyes moist.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'd {{go round}} the miserable old house {{a dozen times}} and never turn a hair!' he cried, trying to speak mighty brave, but I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wasn't hankering for any such job, so I said soothing-like: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{regularly}} stared, my daughter. In any {{one else}} I {{should have said}} it was rude. But his situation is so peculiar; and one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> admired you still." [...] And Mrs. Vivian gave a little soft sigh.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked to}} the door, gave her another bow, and left the room, and Jane Gladys <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{laughing}} to himself as if very much amused.|$|E
6000|$|... "I trust so," [...] said Ben, but Bertha <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> losing {{hope and}} that his life was being darkened by the {{presence}} of the death angel.|$|E
60|$|He bowed, waved, and was {{off down}} the steps to his brougham. As he drove away, Lady Clara <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> already deeply absorbed in a paper-covered novel.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{spoke as}} bravely {{as he could}} to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken down, now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress. He was {{thinking}} of his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Every one of {{the choir}} was ready to sink into the earth with concern at the fix Andrew was in. We <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had fallen into a cold sweat, and how he {{would get out of}} it we did not know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] {{said the}} young fellow. [...] "Do you think <b>that</b> follows because <b>he</b> doesn't live in it?" [...] I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not quite}} like what I had said. [...] "I suppose ours is rather a small world." ...|$|R
