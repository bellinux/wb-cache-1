50|$|It was Tim Johns (1991), however, {{who raised}} {{the profile of}} the use of <b>concordancers</b> in the {{language}} classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL). DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of <b>concordancers</b> and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy & Klarskov Mortensen (2011).|$|E

5000|$|Computer-assisted {{language}} learning (CALL) is succinctly defined in a seminal work by Levy (1997: p. 1) as [...] "the search for and study of {{applications of the}} computer in language teaching and learning".

It also extends to the use of corpora and <b>concordancers,</b> interactive whiteboards, Computer-mediated communication (CMC), {{language learning}} in virtual worlds, and mobile-assisted language learning (MALL).|$|E

5000|$|A crucial {{issue is}} the extent to which the {{computer}} is perceived as taking over the teacher's role. Warschauer (1996: p. 6) perceived the computer as playing an [...] "intelligent" [...] role, and claimed that a computer program [...] "should ideally be able to understand a user's spoken input and evaluate it not just for correctness but also for appropriateness. It should be able to diagnose a student's problems with pronunciation, syntax, or usage and then intelligently decide among a range of options (e.g. repeating, paraphrasing, slowing down, correcting, or directing the student to background explanations)." [...] Jones C. (1986), on the other hand, rejected the idea of the computer being [...] "some kind of inferior teacher-substitute" [...] and proposed a methodology that focused more on what teachers could do with computer programs rather than what computer programs could do on their own: [...] "in other words, treating the computer as they would any other classroom aid". Warschauer's high expectations in 1996 have still not been fulfilled, and currently there is an increasing tendency for teachers to go down the route proposed by Jones, making use of a variety of new tools such as corpora and <b>concordancers,</b> interactive whiteboards and applications for online communication.|$|E
5000|$|The {{emergence}} of the World Wide Web (now known simply as [...] "the Web") in the early 1990s marked {{a significant change in}} the use of communications technology for all computer users. Email and other forms of electronic communication had been in existence for many years, but the launch of Mosaic, the first graphical Web browser, in 1993 brought about a radical change in the ways in which we communicate electronically. The launch of the Web in the public arena immediately began {{to attract the attention of}} language teachers. Many language teachers were already familiar with the concept of hypertext on stand-alone computers, which made it possible to set up non-sequential structured reading activities for language learners in which they could point to items of text or images on a page displayed on the computer screen and branch to any other pages, e.g. in a so-called [...] "stack" [...] as implemented in the HyperCard program on Apple Mac computers. The Web took this one stage further by creating a world-wide hypertext system that enabled the user to branch to different pages on computers anywhere in the world simply by pointing and clicking at a piece of text or an image. This opened up access to thousands of authentic foreign-language websites to teachers and students that could be used in a variety of ways. A problem that arose, however, was that this could lead to a good deal of time-wasting if Web browsing was used in an unstructured way (Davies 1997: pp. 42-43), and language teachers responded by developing more structured activities and online exercises (Leloup & Ponterio 2003). Davies (2010) lists over 500 websites, where links to online exercises can be found, along with links to online dictionaries and encyclopaedias, <b>concordancers,</b> translation aids and other miscellaneous resources of interest to the language teacher and learner.|$|E

In this talk I will look at direct classroom applications of corpora and <b>concordancers.</b> I will look at classroom concordancing from two perspectives – teacher and learner - considering ways in which <b>concordancers</b> can be used by teachers to illustrate some particularly challenging phenomena in academic writing, and the ways in which students can develop learner autonomy through the use of <b>concordancers...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{set out to}} {{determine}} whether a parallel corpus and a <b>concordancer</b> would be appropriate tools to supplement a teaching programme of German at the beginners' level in an unsupervised environment.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the monolingual and parallel corpora {{which can be}} accessed through two <b>concordancers</b> on the server nl. ijs. si. Twelve monolingual corpora contain Slovene language texts, one contains Japanese and one English texts, and comprise reference corpora, such as Gigafida for written contemporary Slovene, IMP for historical Slovene, and GOS for spoken Slovene and specialised corpora, such as the corpus of texts from the informatics domain and the corpus of Slovene tweets. The five parallel corpora contain Slovene texts sentence aligned with, variously, English, Japanese, French, German, and Italian from domains such as EU law, literature and journalism. Although most of the corpora have been produced in the past, they have now been newly annotated, some have been extended with additional texts, and a few are completely new. The texts in the corpora are supplied with meta-data, while their word tokens are either manually or automatically annotated with at least lemmas and morphosyntactic descriptions. Most of the corpora are freely available through two web <b>concordancers,</b> the noSketch Engine and CUWI. These two corpus analysis tools support searching large annotated corpora, various types of search result display, the possibility to filter the searches according to meta-data, and saving the search results locally.

If we could use both corpus made up from electronic texts on the internet and a <b>concordancer,</b> it would make the above efforts much easier. In this essay Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles was examined by using three tools of WordSmith, a concordance software, in comparison with George Eliot's Middlemarch and Sommerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage. WordSmith is a set of programs, which has three main tools called Wordlist, Keywords, and Concord. Wordlist as a tool makes {{a list of all the}} words in a text, set out in frequency order. With Keywords, the key words can be observed by comparing its wordlist with that of other reference text(s). Concord, a <b>concordancer,</b> can be used to plot any keyword or phrase in context to check what sort of wording it accompanies. With these tools we could get a lot of linguistic information about the text, which leads us deeper understanding of the novel. Especially, Concord gives useful information on wording about keywords of a novel. How to select keywords is up to each researcher; however, concordance lines can help us to gain a clear view about a theme. In this way a <b>concordancer</b> is a useful tool for literary criticism...|$|R
