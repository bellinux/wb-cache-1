40|$|The {{mechanism}} and kinetics of <b>chemical</b> <b>pickling</b> of hot-rolled {{304 stainless steel}} oxidized at high temperatures was investigated in HCl-based electrolytes with weight loss, corrosion potential, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Corrosion products were characterized with scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The mechanism of <b>chemical</b> <b>pickling</b> in HCl-based electrolytes is associated with anodic brightening. A highly ionically conductive corrosion product layer covering the brightened surface ensures a high corrosion rate of the underlying stainless steel. The addition of ferric ions to HCl-based electrolytes significantly enhances the corrosion rate. On the contrary, the influence of HCl becomes less important because it is highly concentrated, resulting in a brightening of the stainless steel surface. The effect of ferrous ions on the corrosion rate is negligible. The charge-transfer resistance of hot-rolled stainless steel decreases with pickling time due to the progressive removal of oxide layers. (c) 2006 The Electrochemical Society. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The oxygen {{evolution}} reaction (OER) {{was investigated}} at 60 ‘C in 15 wt% NaOH solution on nickel electrodes. Different surface treatments such as sandblasting and/or <b>chemical</b> <b>pickling</b> were employed. Fresh and aged electrodes {{were subjected to}} electrochemical measurements. The galvanostatic electrochemical ageing was performed for 21 days, applying an anodic current equal to 150 mAcm-“. From the Tafel plots for the OER, two well-defined Tafel slopes were observed for all the electrodes, {{before and after the}} electrochemical ageing. This behaviour is due to the transformation of Ni(OH), to p-NiOOH, which is the “right type of oxide” for the oxygen evolution reaction. The kinetic parameters obtained on the electrodes with different surface finishing show that the sandblasted/pickled nickel substrate loses its electrocatalytic properties for the OER early on in the experiment. 80 1997 International Association for Hydrogen Energ...|$|E
40|$|Stainless steels and {{corrosion}} resistant alloys may suffer localised corrosion, such as pitting and crevice corrosion, in chloride containing oxidizing environments. Pitting and crevice initiation occur when chloride ions concentration in solution exceeds a critical value. This value depends principally on materials properties (composition, deformation degree, heat treatment, surface finishing) and environment (temperature, pH, presence of oxidizing environment, flow regime). In this work, influence of different surface treatments on corrosion behaviour of AISI 316 L {{austenitic stainless steel}} welded by TIG method has been evaluated through potentiodynamic polarisation tests.

40|$|Welded tubular {{products}} play a {{vital role}} in virtually every industrial segment supporting our daily lives. Stainless steel pipe and tubes have good to excellent corrosion resistance and high quality surface finish characteristics, and are for these reasons used in demanding applications such as food processing and pharmaceutical production, for the conveyance and processing of liquids, gases and semi-solids in solution. Their high strength makes them ideally suitable for pressure applications within the oil & gas, petrochemical, chemical, energy, pulp & paper industries, etc. Initially all stainless steel tubular products were of seamless construction, but with improved metallurgy and welding processes, the benefits of welded products have diminished the use of seamless. Most tubes are produced from strip material or plate and can be 100 % non-destructive tested (NDT) to ensure best possible weld quality. By choosing the optimum welding procedure followed by heat treatment and <b>chemical</b> cleaning (<b>pickling)</b> the corrosion resistance of the weld equals that of the base metal. The main advantages of welded tubes and pipes are their lower inherent cost, narrower tolerances for wall thickness, concentricity (OD/ID) and internal surfaces that can be checked prior to manufacture. They also allow larger diameters and longer lengths to be produced. Although welde...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{describes a}} process {{for the production of}} an easily solderable metallization layer on a non-solderable surface. In known processes, in particular for fast oxidizing surfaces such as aluminium, a previous process step is required to destroy the surface oxide layer which is difficult to handle in plasma etching or when using aggressive <b>chemical</b> <b>pickling</b> agents. In the process according to the invention, the oxide layer is broken up and a seeding material is deposited in a simple manner in one step. The seeding material on a substrate is transferred to the aluminium surface by means of energy-rich radiation, whereby the oxide layer is previously broken up by the energy beam and particles of the seeding material are excited by the said beam. Using a reflecting device for the energy beam relative to the non-solderable surface, any desired metallization layer structure can be quickly and precisely applied using seeding material. In order to obtain a subsequent selective metalli zation of the seeded surface areas, no-flow, low-cost mass processes in baths can be preferably used...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} an {{industrial}} research on ecological innovative descaling treatments for stainless steels, in substitution of the acid etching process: {{from the study}} and the research on samples, the most efficient techniques and their application to industrial purpose are explained. The research has basically covered the study of two pre-finishing treatments (high pressure water blasting and “dry ice”-blasting) and two etching treatments (electropolishing with ionic liquids and in aqueous media). In the field of stainless steels, the surface oxide of iron Fe (III) is combined with the multiple elements added to alloys {{in order to increase}} their characteristics (carbon, chromium, nickel and other). Moreover, the surface oxide is presented as a layer very tenacious and compact. In addition, heat treatment leads to the formation of a layer without chromium more readily attacked by oxygen from the atmosphere.

5000|$|The {{production}} at the Honeywell plant of hydrofluoric acid (HF) was suspended in October 2013 in favour of a plant in Geismar, Louisiana. The Honeywell plant {{is used in the}} production of fuels, refrigerants and other materials. HF is a precursor to numerous pharmaceuticals as well as being used to produce Teflon, fluoropolymers and fluorocarbons. Because of its highly corrosive nature, HF is also used to dissolve glass, in glass etching and frosting, and is used in quartz purification, <b>chemical</b> milling, steel <b>pickling</b> and cleaning silicon wafers. It is produced by treating the mineral fluorite with sulfuric acid, which produces hydrogen fluoride and calcium sulfate. The plant, which is located at 395 Front Rd, North, had previously suspended its operations between 1992 and 1996, so there is hope that production will resume at some future time.

30|$|The most {{important}} applications of Pb and Pb alloys are of widespread usage in acid storage batteries. The corrosion product films form good mechanical barriers against the environment. However, with long immersion time {{the depth of}} layers increases and the crystals become more adherent on the surface [1, 2]. Corrosion process is playing {{an important role in}} the field of economics and safety. Hydrochloric acid solutions are used for <b>pickling,</b> <b>chemical</b> and electrochemical etching of metals and alloys [2, 3, 4]. Pb forms many alloys, which increases its use in both of industry and daily life. It is well known that alloying content plays {{an important role in the}} improvement of the battery grid properties. Previously, the authors [5] studied the effect of indium alloying with Pb on the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Pb–In alloys in sulfuric acid solution. They found that indium alloying with Pb increases its hardness, reduces its electrochemical activity, and improves its stability of corrosion [5]. Acid-induced corrosion is an important and expensive problem in industry and represents a significant portion of loss as a result of lost production, inefficient operation, high maintenance and the cost of corrosion control chemicals. Therefore, study of corrosion inhibition of Pb and Pb alloys in HCl solution is of great importance [6].|$|R
40|$|The {{oxide scale}} created during {{manufacturing}} {{of stainless steel}} is often removed by a <b>chemical</b> <b>pickling</b> with mixed acid. Various pre-treatments to pickling are also applied {{to increase the efficiency}} of the oxide scale removal. Shot blasting is one such pre-treatment, which operates to remove a certain amount of oxide and also to generate cracks and openings for the subsequent pickling. In this work, three materials, AISI 2205, 430 and 304 have been blasted and later exposed to mixed acid. This was conducted to quantify the effect shot blasting has on the subsequent pickling of stainless steel. Three shot products and two blasting parameters were investigated and varied. Shot blasting significantly reduced the oxide scale but was unable to remove the chromium oxide layer closest to the steel surface. No significant difference was observed when comparing the result from the three shot products after blasting. Increasing the particle velocity or the coverage rate further enhanced the pickling but reduced the amount of oxide removed during blasting. These effects are however relative small, so in practise relatively mild conditions seems preferable for economic reasons. Oxide scale containing hematite was difficult to remove by both shot blasting and pickling. ...|$|E
40|$|Stainless steels {{were first}} {{developed}} in the early 20 th century and have since then emerged as a very diverse class of engineering materials. Along with steels having new combinations of properties, there is a continuous development of new technologies allowing the material to be produced in a faster and more energy effcient manner. A prerequisite for new technologies to be adapted quicklyis a fundamental understanding of the microstructure evolution throughout theprocess chain. The {{first part of this}} thesis has been dedicated to the annealing and pickling processes from a process-microstructure perspective. In the second part the concept of utilising crystallographic texture as a way to attain microstructures with new combinations of properties has been evaluated. In the first part, annealing can be regarded as a high temperature oxidation process, resulting in chromium depletion that necessitate subsequent <b>chemical</b> <b>pickling.</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>pickling,</b> on the other hand, is basically a wet-corrosion process and hence more difficult for highly corrosion-resistant grades. The chromium depleted layer was found to be enriched in austenite in case of duplex stainless steel UNS S 32205 (Paper I) and this may inuence the pickling process. Proper pretreatment like shot-blasting dramatically increases the pickling rate because it provides the pickling acid with access to the chromium depleted layer (Paper II). Oxidation kinetics for S 30400 in conditions relevant to strip annealing {{do not seem to be}} affected by the choice of air/oxygen as oxidiser even though the latter results in substantially higher water content (Paper III). This gives new possibilities regarding both cost savings and increased throughput. In the second part, the effect of crystallographic texture on resistance towards corrosion of S 31603 in a solution of FeCl 3 and AlCl 3 in ethanol/glycerol and in 30 vol% H 2 SO 4 is investigated. In the former, high density surfaces { 1111 } and { 100 } are less prone for pit nucleation, however the effect is relativelysmall. In H 2 SO 4 pronounced crystallographic anisotropy is observed inwhich the corrosion rate increase in the order { 111 } < { 110 } ≤ { 100 } (Paper IV). For corrosion at high temperatures, chromium diffusion is governed by randomhigh angle boundaries with ~ 20 — 55 ° misorientation. The possibilities to alter the texture in austenitic stainless steels by means of warm-rolling and annealing has been evaluated for S 30403 and S 31603. During warm-rolling, both steels develop the copper-type texture in contrast to the brass-type texture observedat room temperature. However only S 30403 is prone to recrytallise cube texture during subsequent annealing (Paper V). QC 20150121 </p...|$|E
40|$|Laser milling {{is a new}} {{application}} that is challenging for the power contained in the laser light. Due to its small unit of material removal, accuracy and repeatability, laser milling has found an application area in micro manufacturing, especially the manufacturing of microtools. There is a number of micro manufacturing and replication processes on the market at present. Their needs raise the requirements {{that have to be}} met by the microtool manufacturing process. Initially, the requirements of micro manufacturing processes, such as micro-injection moulding and hot-embossing, are identified and compared to what the laser milling process can achieve. An investigation is carried out to identify the capabilities of the laser milling process and match them to these requirements. The investigated process characteristics are surface finish, aspect ratio, accuracy and minimum feature size. Furthermore, as surface finish is identified to be a considerable constraint, an investigation is undertaken to improve the resulting surface finish obtained from the laser milling process. A two-dimensional theoretical model is developed to investigate the crater formation on a metal target by a microsecond laser pulse. The model takes into account the absorption of the laser light by the target, and simulates the heating and vaporisation of the material, including an adjustment to compensate for the change of state. A simple numerical technique is employed to describe the major physical processes taking part in the laser milling process. Experimental validation of the proposed model is provided for two common tooling materials. To investigate the formation of the material surface after laser milling, a complex 3 D surface model is presented based on the single crater profiles of the 2 D theoretical model together with a consideration for the overlapping of the craters. Additional factors, that are influential {{in the formation of the}} final material surface, are also considered and their effect on the surface roughness estimated. Finally, a number of techniques for reducing surface roughness are presented. Laser cleaning is a technique that utilises the de-focused laser beam to "smooth out" the material surface irregularities. The other three techniques are applied after laser milling, and are ultrasonic cleaning bath, <b>chemical</b> <b>pickling</b> and electro-chemical polishing.
