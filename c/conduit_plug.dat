40|$|We explore {{physical}} mechanisms controlling {{formation of}} a confining <b>conduit</b> <b>plug</b> using 1 D, steady-state numerical models of magma ascent. Model results for the welldocumented 1997 Vulcanian explosions at Soufrie`re Hills volcano were compared against subsurface conditions constrained by geophysical and petrologic analysis. We suggest that, if magma is permeable and overpressured and rock surrounding the conduit is permeable, degassing occurs both vertically and through conduit walls. This outgassing creates a region of low-vesicularity, dense magma near the surface (magma plug) which eventually seals the conduit and promotes system overpressure. Driving pressure increases with increasing magma flow rate, hindering volatile exsolution and shifting open-system degassing to shallower levels of the conduit. As a result, increasing magma flow rate for a fixed conduit width creates a vertically thinner plug and increases the magnitude and vertical extent of conduit overpressure. Plug thickness and density are also controlled by magma and edifice permeabilit...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of hazardous silicic eruptions {{are controlled by}} complex, poorly-understood conduit processes. Observations of recent Chilean rhyolite eruptions have revealed the importance of hybrid activity, involving simultaneous explosive and effusive emissions from a common vent. Such behaviour hinges upon the ability of gas to decouple from magma in the shallow conduit. Tuffisite veins are increasingly suspected {{to be a key}} facilitator of outgassing, as they repeatedly provide a transient permeable escape route for volcanic gases. Intersection of foam domains by tuffisite veins appears critical to efficient outgassing. However, knowledge is currently lacking into textural heterogeneities within shallow conduits, their relationship with tuffisite vein propagation, and the implications for fragmentation and degassing processes. Similarly, the magmatic vesiculation response to upper conduit pressure perturbations, such as those related to the slip of dense magma plugs, remains largely undefined. Here we provide a detailed characterization of an exceptionally large tuffisite vein within a rhyolitic obsidian bomb ejected during transitional explosive-effusive activity at Chaitén, Chile in May 2008. Vein textures and chemistry provide a time-integrated record of the invasion of a dense upper <b>conduit</b> <b>plug</b> by deeper fragmented magma. Quantitative textural analysis reveals diverse vesiculation histories of various juvenile clast types. Using vesicle size distributions, bubble number densities, zones of diffusive water depletion, and glass H 2 O concentrations, we propose a multi-step degassing/fragmentation history, spanning deep degassing to explosive bomb ejection. Rapid decompression events of ~ 3 - 4 MPa are associated with fragmentation of foam and dense magma at ~ 200 - 350 metres depth in the conduit, permitting vertical gas and pyroclast mobility over hundreds of metres. Permeable pathway occlusion in the dense <b>conduit</b> <b>plug</b> by pyroclast accumulation and sintering preceded ultimate bomb ejection, which then triggered a final bubble nucleation event. Our results highlight how the vesiculation response of magma to decompression events is highly sensitive to the local melt volatile concentration, which is strongly spatially heterogeneous. Repeated opening of pervasive tuffisite vein networks promotes this heterogeneity, allowing juxtaposition of variably volatile-rich magma fragments that are derived {{from a wide range of}} depths in the conduit. This process enables efficient but explosive removal of gas from rhyoliti...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing eruptive {{cycle of}} Tungurahua volcano (Ecuador) since 1999 has been characterised by over 15  paroxysmal phases {{interrupted}} by periods of relative calm. Those phases included one Subplinian {{as well as}} several Strombolian and Vulcanian eruptions and they generated tephra fallouts, pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) and lava flows. The 1  February 2014 eruption occurred after 75  days of quiescence and only 2 days of pre-eruptive seismic crisis. Two short-lived Vulcanian explosions marked the onset of the paroxysmal phase, characterised by a 13. 4  km eruptive column and the trigger of PDCs. After 40  min of paroxysm, the activity evolved into sporadic Strombolian explosions with discrete ash emissions and continued for several weeks. Both tephra fall and PDCs were studied for their dispersal, sedimentology, volume and eruption source parameters. At large scale, the tephra cloud dispersed toward the SSW. Based on the field data, two dispersal scenarios were developed forming either elliptical isopachs or proximally PDC-influenced isopachs. The minimum bulk tephra volumes are estimated to 4. 55 [*]×[*] 10 6  m 3, for an eruption size estimated at volcanic explosivity index (VEI)   2 – 3. PDCs, although of small volume, descended by nine ravines of the NNW flanks down {{to the base of the}} edifice. The 1  February 2014 eruptions show a similar size to the late 1999 and August 2001 events, but with a higher intensity (I   9 – 10) and shorter duration. The Vulcanian eruptive mechanism is interpreted to be related to a steady magma ascent and the rise in over-pressure in a blocked <b>conduit</b> (<b>plug)</b> and/or a depressurised solidification front. The transition to Strombolian style is well documented from the tephra fall componentry. In any of the interpretative scenarios, the short-lived precursors for such a major event as well as the unusual tephra dispersion pattern urge for renewed hazard considerations at Tungurahua...|$|E
40|$|For the {{protection}} of wetland and water resources it would be beneficial to understand when collapse conduits function as recharge points to the underlying aquifer. Inexpensive, noninvasive methods to detect recharge are desirable. Previous studies show negative self-potential (SP) anomalies over sinkholes that correspond to the expected electrokinetic effects of groundwater flowing downward through a conduit. SP surveys are less labor-intensive than high-resolution 3 D GPR and resistivity, and continuous long-term monitoring is possible. However, before SP surveys can be reliable indicators of flow, SP contributions from ET, conductivity changes, redox reactions, thermoelectric effects, cultural noise, and lateral flow must be understood. A year of continuous SP monitoring was combined with high-resolution 3 -D GPR surveys, and intermittent water table monitoring over two small covered-karst sinkholes in Tampa, Florida. Positive and negative SP anomalies episodically manifested over conduits, suggesting that conduit flow is dynamic, not static. Three distinct SP flow regimes in the conduits are postulated: fast flow open to the aquifer, slow flow open to the confining layer through the collapse conduit walls, and a <b>conduit,</b> <b>plugged</b> high enough to behave {{like the rest of}} the confining layer. SP responses after rain events also appear to measure the effects of two moving Gaussian wetting front curves, one striking the monitoring electrode, one the reference. viii The wetting front volumes are differently dispersed by traveling different distances. By comparing curve shapes for all possible pairs of electrodes, it may be possible to establish surficial infiltration and flow patterns. Temporal SP response clearly shows SP is also affected by soil conductivity, rainfall history, and cultural noise. Ultimately, SP changes too frequently to rely on measurements many hours or days apart. Over the course of the year, the electrodes became less responsive to rainfall and more erratic. Extremely wet and dry conditions seemed to affect responses. The porous faces of the electrodes or the bentonite clay gel used to enhance contact may decline. It appears a better design for electrodes and electrode contact needs to be developed. To test the intermittent behavior hypothesis, more conduits need to be studied, and moisture and SP must be studied concurrently. Several reference electrodes placed in various topographic, vegetative, geologic, and climatic settings could help distinguish groundwater flow from other SP sources. SP is a valuable research tool; however external complexities such as cultural noise, sinkhole lithology, and the state of the unsaturated zone make SP data difficult to interpret without ancillary information...|$|R
40|$|The last 35 {{years have}} seen rapid {{advances}} in our knowledge of climate change during the Quaternary Period in Tasmania. Extensive mapping and new dating studies, particularly {{since the advent of}} exposure dating, have revealed that maximum ice advance occurred 1 Ma ago and later advances were less extensive. Ice advances occurred several times during the last 100 ka, not only during the Last Glacial Maximum. Deglaciation was rapid after 18 ka and complete by 14 ka. Ice strongly affected limestone and produced extensive glaciokarst with deranged surface drainage. Glacial sediment <b>plugged</b> <b>conduits</b> to underground passages partially filled with glaciofluvial gravels. Periglacial erosion, and human impact since late oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 3, enhanced sediment influxes. New pollen records, particularly from Lake Selina, provide a 125 ka vegetation and climate record representative of the Southern Hemisphere. Finally, stable isotope studies of speleothem growth have revealed wide swings in climate. The climate was warm and moist during OIS 5 e and early in OIS 1. Climate was cold and dry during OIS 5 d and 4, and prevented speleothem growth during OIS 3 and OIS 2...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model for {{explosive}} eruptions in cylindrical <b>conduits</b> generated by <b>plug</b> disruption {{at the top of}} the conduit. The eruption is calculated for a standard set of parameters for rhyolite. The model takes into account temperature variations and non-Newtonian magma rheology. We analyzed the influence of principal parameters such as fragmentation criteria, magma rheology, and initial conditions. We conclude that the variation of magma temperature is less than 70 K during eruption, and the model with bubble concentration-dependent viscosity leads to the increase of the steady discharge rate by about 40 %. The eruption model is extended to include interaction between magma in the conduit and water in a surrounding aquifer. The phreatomagmatic eruption is also initiated by plug disruption. Two cases of initial aquifer pressure are considered: magmastatic and hydrostatic. These cases are valid for confined and unconfined aquifers. For the first case (confined aquifer), water influx influences the conduit flow soon after plug disruption and leads to the additional peaks of discharge rate; for the second case (unconfined aquifer), a purely magmatic, explosive eruption of longer duration is followed by a phreatomagmatic phase. In both cases, magma discharge rate increases by 10 – 100 % in comparison with purely magmatic eruption...|$|R
40|$|Calderas {{are among}} the most active and {{dangerous}} volcanoes. Caldera unrest is defined by enhanced seismicity, gravity changes, surface deformation and degassing. Although much caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, every eruption is preceded by an unrest episode. Therefore, the proper description of unrest and the forecast of its possible outcome is a timely and challenging task. Here we review the best known unrest at calderas from 1988 to 2014, building on previous work and propose an updated database. Where established, the root cause for unrest is always magmatic; none was purely hydrothermal or tectonic. An interpretive classification of unrest invokes two spectra – compositional (mafic to felsic) and the state of magma conduits feeding from the magma reservoir(s) to the surface (from fully plugged, through semi-plugged, to open). Magma and gas in open conduits can rise and erupt freely; magma in semi-plugged conduits erupts less frequently, yet still allows some gas to escape; <b>plugged</b> <b>conduits</b> allow neither magma nor gas to escape. Unrest in mafic calderas is subtler, less pronounced and repeated, especially with open systems, ensuring the continuous, aseismic and moderate release of magma. Plugged felsic calderas erupt infrequently, anticipated by isolated, short and seismically active unrest. Semi-plugged felsic calderas also erupt infrequently and are restless over decades or centuries, with uplift, seismicity and degassing and, on the longer-term, resurgence, suggesting repeated stalled intrusions. Finally, the expected advances in better understanding caldera unrest are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Subduction zone volcanoes {{are a major}} natural hazard, {{frequently}} endangering {{lives and}} livelihoods. The eruptive history of many subduction zone volcanoes includes the extrusion of blocky, silicic lava that forms domes or flows, {{but we do not}} yet understand what determines the duration of dome-forming behaviour, what path magma may take to the surface, or how these systems may change over time. This thesis presents an investigation of the Santiaguito complex of lava domes and flows in Guatemala, which has been erupting continuously since its inception in 1922. The Santiaguito lavas are predominantly dacitic to andesitic, with a gradual reduction in SiO 2 content from ~ 66 wt% in the 1920 s, to ~ 62 wt% in 2002. This is consistent with a ~ 15 % decrease in the extent of fractional crystallization over that time. The compositions of plagioclase phenocryst cores indicate a diminished role for magma mixing after the 1940 s. I model the Santiaguito system as progressively extracting magma from an extensive, chemically-stratified storage zone. Petrological data are consistent with a storage zone extending from ~ 25 to ~ 12 km depth, and magma storage temperatures of ~ 940 to ~ 980 °C. Phenocryst-hosted apatites suggest melt in this storage zone contained 401 to 1199 ppm S, 600 to 1300 ppm F, and 4100 to 6200 ppm Cl. Ascending magma may pass slowly through a <b>conduit</b> bottleneck, or <b>plug,</b> at shallow depths; groundmass texture suggests that melt rigidifies at or near the base this plug. Pre-eruptive melt volatile concentrations suggest time-averaged fluxes of 40 to 263 Mg d- 1 SO 2, 32 to 145 Mg d- 1 HF, and 247 to 708 Mg d- 1 HCl, giving ratios of 0. 6 to 0. 8 HF/SO 2, and 2. 7 to 6. 2 HCl/SO 2. These results are consistent with the few direct measurements of SO 2 at Santiaguito, and with measured halogen emissions from other silicic dome-forming systems.
