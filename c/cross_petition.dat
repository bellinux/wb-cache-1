5000|$|On August 31, 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit {{issued its}} {{opinion in the}} case.

On December 28, 2012, Limelight filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Federal Circuit regarding the standard for induced infringement in cases where multiple parties may perform various steps of a patented claim. Akamai filed a <b>cross</b> <b>petition</b> asking the Court to also review the standard for direct infringement in those cases. On June 24, 2013, the Supreme Court asked the Solicitor General to weigh in on the petition for certiorari.

In June 1972, <b>Cross</b> <b>petitioned</b> for a new trial, a month before he took office for his seventh nonconsecutive term as sheriff.

5000|$|Cogan House Township {{was formed}} parts of Jackson and Mifflin townships on December 6, 1843. The source of Larrys Creek is in Cogan House Township, {{just south of}} the hamlet of Steam Valley. It flows west-southwest through the village of Cogan House, and then under the Cogan House Covered Bridge. The bridge is also known as the [...] "Buckhorn Covered Bridge" [...] (for a nearby {{mountain}} and vanished village) or the [...] "Larrys Creek Covered Bridge" [...] (for the creek it <b>crosses).</b> A <b>petition</b> from the citizens of Cogan House Township for a bridge to be built was filed on September 4, 1876. The 90 foot (27 m) long Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877, rehabilitated in 1998, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Larrys Creek was vitally important to the economic development of Cogan House Township. During the height of the lumber era that swept through Pennsylvania in the mid-to-late 19th century, Larrys Creek was used to float logs from the hills of the township to the lumber industry in nearby Williamsport on the West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|R

Because of this, the Red Cross asks that if nurses have been asked for and before the Red Cross can respond nurses are found, that the Red Cross is notified right away to prevent such mistakes from happening again. It is inefficient, incites unnecessary trips, and aggravates the unpleasant situations that are already brought about by the short supply of nurses. • There is a shortage of milk in Alexandria.

50|$|According to {{internal}} party protocols, presidential primaries are conducted via {{a combination of}} party member vote with 30% weighting, and nationwide opinion polling with 70% weighting. Registration and petitions were conducted between 20 April to 18 May 2015. Two candidates, including Hung Hsiu-chu, deputy speaker of the Legislative Yuan; and Yang Chih-liang, former health minister, registered. Hung garnered 35,210 signatories in her <b>petition,</b> <b>crossing</b> the eligibility threshold of 15,000 signatories; while Yang garnered only 5,234 signatories, nullifying his candidacy.

Hung garnered an average of 46.204% in the nationwide polling, crossing the eligibility threshold of 30%, and was nominated on 19 July 2015.|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to the challenge, Legacy High School student, Bailey <b>Cross,</b> created a <b>petition</b> to maintain the book in the curriculum, which amassed over 1,200 signatures. She expressed the importance of retaining the book, stating, [...] "Banning and censoring this tells students that ... racism, incest, rape, abuse, are taboo subjects {{that should not be}} mentioned." [...] Numerous teachers also spoke out against the ban, stating that the book was used to analyze Morrison's writing style and that banning this book could set a precedent for censorship in the district. Ultimately, the Adams County School Board voted to retain the Superintendent's original ruling of the 2010 challenge, which not only restricted the book to AP curriculum but also required teachers to notify parents before their child read the book, explaining that an option for an alternative book would be available. In addition, only one of the three sections of the AP class would teach the novel moving forward.|$|R
