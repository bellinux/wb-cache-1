The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or {{more closely related to}} the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, <b>Cryptogamia,</b> included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.|$|E

5000|$|Before Carl von Linné (1707-1778) {{animals and}} plants had names, but it took him to arrange the names and group the plants of this Earth {{in some sort of}} order. Carl Linnaeus (Carl von Linné) http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html was a Swedish botanist, the son of a pastor of the Lutheran church, a {{physician}} and zoologist. He laid the foundations of modern biological systematics and nomenclature in his Species Plantarum (1753). He adopted and popularized a binomial (or binary) system of designation (Morton, 1981) [...] using one name as the genus and a second name as the species name both in Latin or Latinised. This specific name hereferred to as a trivial name nomen triviale consisting of a single word, normally a Latin adjective, but any single word would suffice, to identify a particular species, but not intended to describe it. He developed a coherent system for naming organisms and divided the plant kingdom into 25 classes (according to Smith p. 1 and p. 24 according to Dixon, 1973) (Smith, 1955 p. 1), one of which, the <b>Cryptogamia,</b> included all plants with concealed reproductive organs.

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of modern liverwort nomenclature is {{marked with the}} 1753 publication of Linnaeus' Species Plantarum, although this relied heavily upon the prior work of Micheli (1729) and Dillenius (1741). [...] Linnaeus included all 25 known species of liverworts, together with mosses, algae, and fungi, within a single class <b>Cryptogamia.</b> Linnaeus' system was heavily revised by workers {{in the early nineteenth}} century, so that by the time Endlicher published his Enchiridion Botanicum in 1841, five orders of liverworts were defined, and the [...] "Frondosae" [...] were segregated as a group that is congruent with the modern concept of the Metzgeriales. [...] Endlicher's [...] "Frondosae" [...] included five subgroups (Metzgerieae, Aneureae, Haplolaeneae, Diplomitrieae, and Codonieae) with no assigned taxonomic rank, but these groups were termed Familien by Dědeček in 1886. [...] The same five subgroups of [...] "Frondosae", without significant change, were used in the Synopsis Hepaticarum of Gottsche, Lindenberg, and Nees.|$|E

50|$|In {{the work}} Linnaeus divided the plant kingdom into 24 classes, {{each of which}} he named {{according}} {{to the number of}} stamens and their arrangement in the flowers. In Ehret’s engraved plate these classes are represented by the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet. In Ehret’s original drawing for the plate, preserved in the Natural History Museum in London, he has written the name of the plant he had chosen as an example of each particular class, but only for the first ten and last four classes. Each of the first ten classes (A-K) is named according to the number of stamens, beginning with Monandria (one stamen), Diandria (two stamens), etc. up to Decandria (ten stamens). The flowers in the eleventh (L) class, Dodecandria, have 12-19 stamens. The following four classes (M-P) are characterized not only by the number of stamens but also by their position; the four classes (Q-T) have stamens united in a bundle or phalanx, the next three classes (V-Y) have stamens and pistils in separate flowers. The whole is completed with <b>Cryptogamia</b> (Z), which are plants without proper flowers. For this class Ehret chose the fig as an example.|$|E

Blagden asked {{to hear of}} their visit to Pavia, [Italy], and the chief {{circumstances}} in the [Lazzaro] Spallanzani [(1729 - 1799), physiologist] "business" [probably in reference to accussations levelled at both Spallanzani and Giovanni Scopoli of mismanagement of Univsersity of Pavia museum. Smith was a supporter of Scopoli]. Blagden still sceptical after his account and suspects it a contrived affair of [Alessandro] Volta [(1745 - 1827), physicist]. Has not seen L'Héritier but told that he is stealing new plants and claiming them as his own, as [Johan Christian] Fabricius is doing in entomology. Fabricius has described 300 species just from [William] Jones' drawings without recourse to the insects themselves. Dined with Fabricius at Dr [Matthew] Baillie's {{and took him to}} task over the difficulties of his system, particularly in the examination of minute insects, but dismissed by Fabricius. Dr Grey of the British Museum agrees that Fabricius creates difficulties. Warns Smith against "foreigners, who seem to have their own ends in every thing they do, & who deprive the English of the merit of discoveries with their voluminous publications of what things they find new among us". Fabricius accessed Linnaeus' entomological collection via [Thomas] Marsham, its current possessor, in order to describe all the new insects, and in responding to Linnaeus' descriptions "with his own barbarous words" strengthen his own "feeble" system on the "strong natural foundation" of Linnaeus'. Fabricius left London a week ago "loaded with new things, for we have a wonderful alarcity in giving to foreigners what we will not give to our own countrymen". Items collected during his time in Italy: gave Marsham several insects including 'Coleoptera' and 'Hemiptera'; possibly found Smith's 'Lampyris' close to Milan, it is 'Lampyris italica' in Banks' collection; his 'Scarabaeus sacer' is actually 'S. variolosus' on account of smoothness of thorax; the 'Chrysomela' given them by [Jacques Anselme] Dorthes at Montpellier is 'C. bankii'; unable to find a name for the insect similar to a 'Tenebrio' found on Mount Vesuvius. Has been associating with Marsham, who has given him about 80 English insects, principally 'Coleoptera' and 'Hemiptera' and some Chinese specimens. Marsham earnest about Linnean Society. Marsham showed him plate for his paper in first volume of "Linnean Transactions" ['Observations on the Phalaena Bombyx Lubricipeda']. Has not yet seen [Samuel] Goodenough, details of his movements. Shown 50 of [James] Sowerby's drawings new <b>Cryptogamia</b> found in last trip to Highlands by [James] Dixon [Dickson], to be possibly published in a new work. Smith's family is in Chelsea, including his sister Esther. Smith's father to return to Norwich so Francis can meet Smith in Paris. Box of papers Smith addressed to Banks' has arrived safely, including the two bronze figures. Not impressed with Dr Simmons rude behaviour at Soho Square. Asks Smith to procure a print fo Linnaeus for him...|$|E
40|$|Received Smith's {{letter of}} 2 July {{and parcel of}} plants via Mandrot. Apologises for {{upsetting}} Smith with anecdote of arrogant apothecary; his love of Smith and apprecitation of his work. Davall considered impertinent to be meddling with Swiss plants. Intends his herbarium to be richer and more correct herbarium than those who get their plants from botanic gardens of Gottingen and Tubingen; when François [Borone] returns to England wishes to adopt plan for receiving specimens from English gardens. Surprised {{how many of the}} Botany Bay plants received from Smith are '-oides'. Wishes to exchange plants with [Thomas] Woodward mentioned in [William] Withering's ["Botanical arrangement"]. Enjoying "English Botany" especially the maritime plants; suggests figuring 'Lichen omphalodes' because [Georg Franz] Hoffmann figured it as his 'pulvernlentus' "Enumeratio lichenum" p. 76 based on [John] Lightfoot's '[Lichen] stellaris' and Hoffmann in "Plantae Lichenosa" vol 1 p. 40 says this plant is not 'omphalodes'. Laments confusion caused by the "compilating labours of so many authors who pretend to give instruction on objects they never saw" and notes additional error in Hoffmann's "Enumeratio" regarding Lightfoot's 'plumbeus' and 'squamosus'. Intrigued by "English Botany's" 'Galium pusillum' and 'Thlaspi alpestre' and exclusively sends Smith seeds of 'Thlaspi montanum'. Botanical observations on seeds sent to exclusively to Smith: 'Avena strigosa' Retzius; 'Mespilus (Crataegus) chamaemespilus'; 'Myagrum' no. 19 of his parcel by Mandrot 1793; an 'Ononis' not in Linnaeus no. 82 of parcel by Gooch February 1790; 'Thlaspi montanum' Haller "Historia stirpium" No. 518 raised from three seeds found on wild plant 2 August 1791 near "famous 'Pierre pertuis'" as indicated by Haller not far from Soncebau, further observations on his plant; knows nothing of 'Thlaspi praecox'. Botanical observations on seeds sent to Smith and Aiton: 'Prenanthes viminea', 'Scabiosa hybrida' Allioni, 'Veronica praecox' Allioni. Critiques [Nikolaus von] Jacquin "Collectanea ad botanicam" vol 4 p. 220 citing 'Alstromeria pelegrina' in his "Hortus Botanicus Vindobonensis" without giving figure of fruit; Davall has 'Antirrhinum arvense' for Jacquin's 'A. parviflorum' in "Collectanea" vol 4 p. 204 as confirmed by Smith's answer to no. 17 of parcel by Mandrot 1791. Thanks Smith for seed of 'Silene anglica', sends seed of 'Silene bellidifolia'. Delighted by 'Orchideae' in "English Botany", especially 'Ophrys loeselii' and 'Malaxis paludosa'. Sends specimens of 'Orchis abortiva' including flowers in brandy and 'Carex' specimens for [Samuel] Goodenough's paper, one 'C. leporina' of "Flora Lapponica". 'Orchis ustulata' very common in Switzerland. Prefers Rivinus' figure of 'Melampyrum cristatum' to that in "English Botany". Instructions from Mrs Davall to Miss Smith for knitting a purse. Instructions for sending parcels to Switzerland unharmed. Intends to commission Messrs Minier, Marson & Teesdale to send provision of garden seeds every autumn. Hoping to send paper for Linnean Society on 'Schoenus ferrugineus' based on drawing and work of Mr DuCros, the only botanist he associates with in Switzerland; does not consider Wyttenbach a botanist. Recommends DuCros as an FMLS, his favourite study is mosses and he sent [James] Dickson <b>cryptogamia.</b> Postscript on left hand margin of verso of second folio: wrote glad [William] Aiton [(1731 - 1793) ] was pleased with the 'Arenaria grandiflora' he sent, they talk much of his 'Morina' and has asked Aiton to send any seeds to Smith. Additional postscript on left hand margin of verso of first folio: severe drought in Switzerland. Additional postscript on left hand margin of recto of first folio: Smith to expect plants by middle of September, and header of first folio; his infant son healthy...|$|E
