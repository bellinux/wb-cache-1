40|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>silicides</b> (CaSi and CaSi 2) are investigated through a joint experimental and theoretical study using Bremsstrahlung Isochromat spectroscopy (BIS) and self-consistent {{calculation of the}} electronic states by the Linear Muffin-Tin Orbitals (LMTO) method in the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA). The peculiar crystal structure of CaSi 2 with two inequivalent Si atoms is responsible for a well defined BIS feature. We found that the calculated high energy DOS features are consistently lower in energy compared to the BIS spectra. Inclusion of the cross-sections of different states into the calculations improves the agreement between the experimental spectra and the calculated curve.

40|$|By {{measuring}} high-resolution Si Kα {{x-ray fluorescence}} spectra, chemical shifts and effective charges of Si in both magnesium (Mg 2 Si) and <b>calcium</b> <b>silicides</b> (CaSi) have been investigated. CaSi showed {{a small but}} positive chemical shifts (+ 0. 03 eV) while chemical shift of Mg 2 Si was negative (- 0. 14 eV) as expected from their electronegativity (Ca: 1. 00, Mg: 1. 31, Si: 1. 90). The similarity of Fe silicides and calculations for free-single Si atom suggested that the effective charge of Si for CaSi was positive. The present study shows agreement with the conventional understanding for the Si charges in Mg sillicide but is completely opposite for Ca silicides, as reported for Fe silicides...|$|R

We present spectra taken in the isochromat mode in the ultraviolet photon range (10 – 25 eV), at different photon energies. The experimental data are discussed {{on the basis of}} theoretical results obtained by self-consistent calculations performed with the Andersen linear muffin-tin orbitals (LMTO) method in the atomic-sphere approximation (ASA). A general agreement between theory and experiment is found for all silicides. However, discrepancies in the energy positions of the observed structures suggest the importance of final-state effects in inverse photoemission. The orbital origin of the spectral features is also analyzed by exploiting the photon-energy dependence of the isochromat spectra...|$|R

Specification for pyrotechnic <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide</b> is MIL-C-324C. In some mixtures it may be substituted with ferrosilicon. Silicon-based fuels are used in some time delay mixtures, e.g. for controlling of explosive bolts, hand grenades, and infrared decoys. Smoke compositions often contain hexachloroethane; during burning they produce silicon tetrachloride, which, like titanium tetrachloride used in smoke-screens, reacts with air moisture and produces dense white fog.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{combined}} theoretical and experimental {{investigation of the}} electron properties of <b>calcium</b> <b>silicides</b> (Ca 2 Si, CaSi, and CaSi 2). The theoretical study is performed by a self-consistent calculation of the electron states, while the experimental analysis is based on synchrotron-radiation photoemission measurements. The overall agreement between the computed and measured spectra allows us to investigate the main features of the Ca-Si interaction in different compounds. We find that covalent character {{is present in the}} Ca-Si bond and that the strength of this interaction increases with Si concentration. Furthermore all the Ca s-p-d states are involved in this coupling with Si. In Ca 2 Si, the Si s states are found in a corelike configuration, while in the other compounds they are promoted to form an s-p valence band. The covalent interaction is not sufficient to interpret the results and some ionic character is present in the Ca-Si bond. Ca 2 Si is found to be a semimetal and many structures in the density of states can be correlated to well-defined interactions between the nonequivalent Ca-Si couples that are found in these complex compounds...|$|R

The equilibrium partial pressure of Ca(g) over the two-phase regions in the composition range 20 - 75 at. % Si has been measured and the standard enthalpy changes for the appropriate vaporization reactions were determined from the temperature dependence of the measured vapor pressures. The standard reaction enthalpy changes were also evaluated by the third-law method using the pressure data in conjunction with estimated Gibbs energy functions. Standard enthalpies of formation of the <b>calcium</b> <b>silicides</b> were derived from the standard reaction enthalpy values at room temperature.

50|$|In the 1980s the {{discovery}} of zinc peroxide’s ability to complement pyrotechnical mixtures was discovered. It was noted that ZnO2 was preferable to the usage of barium compounds, as it was deemed to be less toxic. The zinc compound proves an effective component in explosives because of its oxidizing properties. Many chemical explosives rely on rapid oxidation reactions, for this reason ZnO2 is an ideal candidate for use in pyrotechnics. Another advantage of ZnO2 was, {{as compared to the}} barium and strontium pyroingredients, it effects less corrosion in the metallic materials which contain the compounds in the pyrotechnic instrument. In one modality it is necessary for zinc peroxide to act in conjunction with a reducer like <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide,</b> to create the necessary red/ox reaction. In another modality, a ‘secondary’ explosive is mixed with zinc peroxide. Secondary explosives include nitrocellulose, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), as well as a variety of compounds, like trinitrobenzene, which provide powerful negative charge balance.These secondary explosives are relatively insensitive to stimuli such as physical impact, heat or charge. The explosive mixture would be comprised, in bulk, of the secondary explosive with a much smaller fraction of zinc peroxide, present to initiate the reaction.|$|E

40|$|It is {{virtually}} impossible to produce castings free from internal stresses using conventional methods of founding. Castings with appreciable stresses distort during storage, transportation, machining and service. Though composition and melt treatment are known to affect the magnitude of residual stress in castings, the data on the effect of carbon equivalent and inoculation on the magnitude of residual stress in castings are limited. In the present investigation, an attempt is made to study (i) the effect of carbon equivalent on residual stress in cast iron castings, and (ii) the effect of inoculants such as <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide</b> and ferrosilicon on residual stress in iron castings in the carbon equivalent range 3. 0 – 4. 0 %. The results of the investigation indicate the following: (i) the residual strains decrease linearly with increase in carbon equivalent in the uninoculated and inoculated irons; (ii) the tensile residual stresses decrease linearly with increase in carbon equivalent value of the uninoculated, calcium silicide-inoculated and ferrosilicon-inoculated cast iron castings; (iii) the ratio of UTS to residual stress increased on inoculating the grid castings. This increase is higher for calcium silicide-inoculated grids than for ferrosilicon-inoculated grid castings. This implies that from the residual stress point of view, inoculation of the iron with <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide</b> is beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new way}} of recycling aluminum and iron in boiler slag derived from coal combustion plants for the production of a sulfate-based complex coagulant containing ferric sulfate and aluminum sulfate. The boiler slag sample was determined for more complete characterization by means of scanning electron microscopy(SEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD), X-ray fluorescence(XRF) and other techniques. An analysis for the boiler slag sample collected from Baotou Steel Plant located in Inner Mongolia, PR China showed that the quantity of iron and aluminum oxides, in general, accounted for about 35 % of the boiler slag. XRD analysis indicates that predominate minerals such as kaolinite, quartz, <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide,</b> hematate and metakoalin exist in this boiler slag. This boiler salg was evaluated to determine the efficiency of converting the iron and aluminum components of the material into a sulfate-based complex coagulant when heated with sulfuric acid at different temperatures and reaction times.

40|$|Formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide</b> {{on three}} types of templates: Si(111) 7 × 7, 2 D Mg 2 Si, and 3 D Mg 2 Si, was studied during Ca {{deposition}} at 120 °C in situ by Auger and electron energy loss spectroscopy, and by differential optical reflectance spectroscopy. A continuous Ca 2 Si layer is formed on 2 D and 3 D Mg 2 Si templates; but, on an atomically clean silicon surface (Si(111) 7 × 7), a mixture of Ca 2 Si with another Ca silicide was found. The growth of a Si cap layer over the Ca silicide layers at about 100 °C studied by in situ methods demonstrated the full embedding of Ca silicide in amorphous silicon, independent of the used template. Transmission electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, and electrical characterization of Schottky junctions revealed the Ca 2 Si and Mg 2 Si nanoparticles and the redistribution of Mg and Ca during the silicon cap growth {{and its effect on}} the electronic properties of the structures.

40|$|A new rapid {{technique}} for {{the measurement of}} permittivity and dielectric loss has been developed by utilising the concept of Fourier methods of analysis. In the equipment developed an input signal, characterised by having known harmonic components, was fed (in a coaxial system) to a solid sample and the distorted output waveform could either be Fourier analysed by a computer whose output was programmed to give directly the variations of permittivity and dielectric loss with frequency or compared directly with reference waveforms stored in the computer. Trials made with standard materials showed that the results obtained by the Fourier computerised technique were in very good agreement with those obtained by the more conventional methods. The Fourier technique, together with an improved cavity perturbation method at 9. 4 GHz., {{has been used to}} make an extended study of the dielectric properties of reaction bonded silicon nitride (RBSN). Attention was particularly directed to the situation in partially nitrided materials, a region which has not been fully explored in previous studies. The salient feature of the experimental results is the presence of a peak in the variation of permittivity with weight gain. This effect has been discussed in terms of structural and microstructural studies which have shown the presence of impurity phases of iron silicide {FeSi(_ 2)) and <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide</b> (CaSi(_ 2)) in addition to the expected silicon and voids...|$|E
40|$|Spherical {{particles}} {{produced by}} firearms loaded {{with a traditional}} ammunition reveal characteristic elemental contents and so their identification may provide a significant evidence in criminal investigations. With the advent of modern technologies in manufacturing ammunition, which replace toxic compounds of lead, antimony and barium in the primer mixture by elements and compounds such as powdered aluminium, titanium, amorphous boron or <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide,</b> differentiation between gunshot residue and morphologically similar particles originating from other anthropogenic or natural sources becomes more difficult. This work provides a chemical and morphological characterisation of welding fume particles originating from both the core and the covering of electrodes used in popular manners of welding steel and aluminium alloy constructions. With the use of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry it has been established that single spherules containing aluminium, titanium or a set of such elements as aluminium, silicon, potassium and calcium may occur in result of welding processes, however, they are accompanied by great numbers of iron and iron oxide spherules. Thus, with this analytical method a population of welding particles can be distinguished from a population of gunshot residue originating from a modern type of ammunition, but a special care {{has to be taken}} when assessing the evidential value of single or few spherules consisting from light elements being detected in result of the search for gunshot residue for forensic purposes...|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{frequency}} of electrically initiated, 20 mm munition hangfires (delayed ignitions), a joint Army/NASA investigation was conducted to recommend quality evaluation improvements for acceptance of both primers and gun propellant. This effort focused only on evaluating ignition and combustion performance as potential causes of hangfires: poor electrical initiation of the primer, low output performance of the primer, low ignition sensitivity of the gun propellant, {{and the effects of}} cold temperature. The goal was to determine the "best" of the Army and NASA test methods to assess the functional performance of primers and gun propellants. The approach was to evaluate the performance of both high-quality and deliberately defective primers to challenge the sensitivity of test methods. In addition, the ignition sensitivity of different manufacturing batches of gun propellants was evaluated. The results of the investigation revealed that improvements can be made in functional evaluations that can assist in identifying and reducing ignition and performance variations. The "best" functional evaluation of primers and propellant is achieved through a combination of both Army and NASA test methods. Incorporating the recommendations offered in this report may provide for considerable savings in reducing the number of cartridge firings, while significantly lowering the rejection rate of primer, propellant and cartridge lots. The most probable causes for ignition and combustion-related hangfires were the lack of <b>calcium</b> <b>silicide</b> in the primer mix, a low output performance of primers, and finally, poor ignition sensitivity of gun propellant. Cold temperatures further reduce propellant ignition sensitivity, as well as reducing burn rate and chamber pressures...|$|E
