6000|$|They {{were very}} strange to his eyes, {{and indeed the}} whole aspect of that valley became, as he {{regarded}} it, queerer and more unfamiliar. The greater part of its surface was lush green meadow, starred with many beautiful flowers, irrigated with extraordinary care, and bearing evidence of systematic <b>cropping</b> <b>piece</b> by piece. High up and ringing the valley about was a wall, and {{what appeared to be}} a circumferential water channel, from which the little trickles of water that fed the meadow plants came, and on the higher slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty herbage. Sheds, apparently shelters or feeding-places for the llamas, stood against the boundary wall here and there. The irrigation streams ran together into a main channel down the centre of the valley, and this was enclosed on either side by a wall breast high. This gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded place, a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that a number of paths paved with black and white stones, and each with a curious little kerb at the side, ran hither and thither in an orderly manner. The houses of the central village were quite unlike the casual and higgledy-piggledy agglomeration of the mountain villages he knew; they stood in a continuous row on either side of a central street of astonishing cleanness, here and there their parti-coloured facade was pierced by a door, and not a solitary window broke their even frontage. They were parti-coloured with extraordinary irregularity, smeared with a sort of plaster that was sometimes grey, sometimes drab, sometimes slate-coloured or dark brown; and it was the sight of this wild plastering first brought the word [...] "blind" [...] into the thoughts of the explorer. [...] "The good man who did that," [...] he thought, [...] "must have been as blind as a bat." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} {{extensive}} farming {{can be seen}} in the massive cattle ranches of Brazil. These involve clearing vast areas of rainforest (the trees are often burnt rather than chopped down and sold) to make way for the cattle ranch. The cattle quickly eat the remaining vegetation and begin to cause massive problems of soil erosion. Extensive farming is also the production of livestock and <b>crops</b> on large <b>piece</b> of land having small output in return. Less attention is given here as compared to intensive farming.|$|R

These include (1) the application of WTO disciplines to regulatory schemes that require prior governmental approval to protect the environment and public health from newly-introduced products and substances; (2) the role of precaution as a public policy strategy in such regulatory structures; (3) the relevance of the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol and other international instruments to the dispute; and (4) the scope of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards...|$|R
5000|$|The head of Edaphosaurus was short, {{relatively}} broad, triangular in outline, and remarkably {{small compared}} to its body size. The deep lower jaw likely had powerful muscles and the marginal teeth along the front and sides of its jaws had serrated tips, helping Edaphosaurus to <b>crop</b> bite-sized <b>pieces</b> from tough terrestrial plants. Back parts of {{the roof of the}} mouth and the inside of the lower jaw held dense batteries of peglike teeth, forming a broad crushing and grinding surface on each side above and below. Its jaw movements were propalinal (front to back). Early descriptions suggested that Edaphosaurus fed on invertebrates such as mollusks, which it would have crushed with its tooth plates. However, paleontologists now think that Edaphosaurus ate plants, although tooth-on-tooth wear between its upper and lower tooth plates, indicates only [...] "limited processing of food" [...] compared to other early plant-eaters such as Diadectes, a large non-amniote reptiliomorph (Diadectidae) that lived at the same time. Early members of the Edaphosauridae such as Ianthasaurus lacked tooth plates and ate insects.|$|R
50|$|In 1831 Aaron Buzacott visited all {{the islands}} in the Hervey Group, with John Williams, and found them to suffer badly from hurricanes and {{cyclones}} during the winter. To help prevent famine he introduced the sweet potato, growing a <b>crop</b> in a <b>piece</b> of ground granted by the chief. Intense interest was arounsed when he showed that the crop could be sold to a passing captain in exchange for coloured calicoes. The effect was magical records Mr Buzacott, Chiefs and people were eager for 'eyes' and 'tops' for planting. a suitable district was fixed upon and in a given week the whole population turned out. In the following year Mr Buzacott and John Williams traveled to Tahiti together.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel probabilistic model for representing objects that {{change in appearance}} {{as a result of}} changes in pose, due to small deformations of their sub-parts and the relative spatial transformation of sub-parts of the object. We call the model a probabilistic montage. The model is based upon the idea that an image can be represented as a montage using many, small transformed and cropped patches from a collection of latent images. The approach is similar to that which might be employed by a police artist who might represent an image of a criminal suspect's face using a montage of face parts cut out of a "library" of face parts. In contrast, for our model, we learn the library of small latent images from a set of examples of objects that are changing in shape. In our approach, rst the image is divided into a grid of sub-images. Each sub-image in the grid acts as window that <b>crops</b> a <b>piece</b> out of one of a collection of slightly larger images possible for that location in the image. We illustrate various probability models {{that can be used to}} encode the appropriate relationships for latent images and cropping transformations among the dierent patches. In this paper we present the complete algorithm for a tree-structured model. We show how the approach and model are able to nd representations of the appearance of full body images of people in motion. We show how our approach can be used to learn representations of objects in an "unsupervised " manner and present results using our model for recognition and tracking purposes in a "supervised" manner...|$|R

This research was conducted at the experimental farm of agriculture faculty unsyiah which began in April 2013 to September 2013. This research used a randomized block design with 6 patterns of non-factorial treatment that G 1 - wilis genotype, G 2 - kaba genotype, G 3 - sinabung genotype, G 4 - agromulyo genotype, G 5 - burangrang genotype and G 6 - anjasmoro genotype with 3 replications in order to obtain 18 units of unit experiment. The parameters measured were the growth of plant height, number of leaves, leaf length and leaf width aged 30, 45, and 60 days after planting and dry weight of plants. Outcome variable measured were the number of <b>pieces</b> <b>cropping,</b> seed number, 100 seed weight, seed weight perhectare, perarea seed weight, seed weight and planting. The resul of this research indicate that there is significant influence between the appearance of the growth and yield of soybean genotypes due to different treatments. Sinabung genotype showed the highest growth and diversity, anjasmoro genotype showed the highest diversity of results. The number of leaves, dry weight, seed weight and weight of 100 seeds perarea have heritability and genetic advances higher. Significant genetic correlation between the characters and yield growth occured in the number of leaves and weight of 100 seeds were negatif. Keywords : Glycine max L.

50|$|Monoculture is a {{style of}} {{agriculture}} where only one type of crop is harvested in a field season after season. This depletes nutrients from the soil because each type of plant has {{a specific set of}} nutrients that it need to grow or can replace back into the soil. With a lack of plant diversity, only certain nutrients will be absorbed, leaving none of those in the soil, and only certain others will be returned into the land, leaving large gaps in the richness required to maintain a healthy level of production. Permaculture and holistic management are two different methods that focus on increasing biomass and returning nutrient richness and diversity to the soil. The more biomass that is present in an ongoing cycle, the more carbon that can be sequestered into the soil and that can be converted into oxygen by plant matter. To accomplish these goals, permaculture encourages the idea of planting more than one <b>crop</b> on a <b>piece</b> of land at a time. Any combination of plants that are chosen to grow together in a permaculture garden or farm would help the other plants be more healthy and grow as well. In permaculture design, each individual aspect of a farm would help other aspects attain the necessary nutrients and conditions to be as plentiful as possible. This helps to regenerate soil health because the diversity of the crops and even livestock used would help maintain a balance of all necessary nutrients, including carbon. Holistic management focuses mainly onn increasing biomass through the carefully planned grazing of livestock. The idea behind holistic management is that grazing livestock can actually help improve the growing conditions for more biomass through means such as naturally fertilizing the land and tilling with hooves.|$|R
