500|$|Cascades Diversion Dam was a timber <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> {{built in}} 1917 {{near where the}} Merced River flows out of Yosemite Valley. Originally built to {{generate}} hydropower, the dam was decommissioned in 1985 but remained standing {{for a number of}} years afterward. After the great flood of 1997, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation surveyed the dam and found it in danger of failure. Classified as a [...] "high hazard" [...] structure, it was originally considered for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places but was deemed too dangerous, and was subsequently removed. Today, the Merced River above Lake McClure is completely free-flowing and unobstructed by any dams.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1910s and 1920s, logging was a growing {{industry}} {{on the west}} side of the upper Klamath River valley, especially around Upper Klamath Lake. The Great Northern Railway and Southern Pacific Railroad built a joint-use line running along the eastern shore of the lake, delivering logs from the north side to a sawmill [...] downstream from the outlet of the lake. Many of the seasonal marshlands surrounding the lake and rivers were diked in this period to host lumber operations. In 1919, the first Link River Dam, a timber <b>crib</b> <b>dam,</b> was constructed at the outlet of Upper Klamath Lake, raising it by about [...] Steamboats continued mail, passenger and freight operations on Upper Klamath Lake until about 1928, in a period when many of the lumber companies shut down due to drought.|$|E
500|$|To {{the north}} of Jackson Hole, Yellowstone National Park had been {{established}} in 1872, and by {{the close of the}} 19th century, conservationists wanted to expand the boundaries of that park to include at least the Teton Range. By 1907, in an effort to regulate water flow for irrigation purposes, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had constructed a log <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> at the Snake River outlet of Jackson Lake. This dam failed in 1910 and a new concrete Jackson Lake Dam replaced it by 1911. The dam was further enlarged in 1916, raising lake waters [...] as part of the Minidoka Project, designed to provide irrigation for agriculture in the state of Idaho. Further dam construction plans for other lakes in the Teton Range alarmed Yellowstone National Park superintendent Horace Albright, who sought to block such efforts. Jackson Hole residents were opposed to an expansion of Yellowstone, but were more in favor of the establishment of a separate National Park which would include the Teton Range and six lakes {{at the base of the}} mountains. After congressional approval, President Calvin Coolidge signed the executive order establishing the [...] Grand Teton National Park on February 26, 1929.|$|E

2500|$|Black Eagle Dam is a {{hydroelectric}} gravity weir dam {{located on}} the Missouri River {{in the city of}} Great Falls, Montana. The first dam on the site, built and opened in 1890, was a timber-and-rock <b>crib</b> <b>dam.</b> This structure was the first hydroelectric dam built in Montana and the first built on the Missouri River. The dam helped give the city of Great Falls the nickname [...] "The Electric City."

50|$|The 1949 {{structure}} {{replaced the}} original Canyon Ferry Dam 1.5 mi upstream. The original dam was constructed between 1896 and 1898 by the Helena Water and Electric Power Company. It was a timber <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> with rock-fill and was 29 ft high and 485 ft long.|$|E
50|$|In 1899, the {{original}} rock <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> {{was completed by}} Mr. E. P. Simpson {{in order to create}} a reservoir for a small hydroelectric power plant which began operating that same year. The plant, now a historical site on the Toccoa Falls College campus and called The Old Toccoa Falls Power Plant produced 200 KW (0.2 MW) for the town of Toccoa, Georgia. After receiving the power plant in 1933, the Toccoa Falls Institute wanted to develop a more stable electric power source and built an earthen embankment dam over {{the original}} rock <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> between 1939 and 1940. After the Second World War, the dam was again raised. Barnes Lake, a 40 acre reservoir was created by the dam. The modifications provided power for Toccoa Falls Institute until 1957, when the power production was stopped, and the lake was only used for recreational purposes.|$|E
50|$|The dam {{replaced}} a wood <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> {{started in}} 1903 by J.M. Hagerty, a local entrepreneur, and completed {{a year after}} his death. The dam fed a generating plant in a wooden powerplant below the dam and falls. Power went to the towns of Nighthawk and Oroville, {{as well as the}} nearby Owasco, Ivanhoe, Ruby and Canba mines. Attempts by Hagerty's estate to sell the dam in 1913 met no interest, partly because of the poor state of the <b>crib</b> <b>dam.</b> Eugene Enloe of the Okanogan Valley Power Company was able to secure the rights to the site in 1916, hiring C.F. Uhden to design the dam that year. Construction did not start until 1919 and was completed in 1920 at a cost of $350,000, $150,000 of it Enloe's money. Enloe sold the dam and powerplant in 1923 to Washington Water Power Company, which added a second penstock.|$|E
50|$|Horn Rapids Dam (also {{known as}} Wanawish Dam) is a rock filled timber <b>crib</b> barrage <b>dam</b> on the Yakima River in Benton County, Washington near the {{intersection}} of SR 240 and SR 225. The dam is not used for hydroelectric production, rather to fill irrigation canals on either bank of the river.|$|R
25|$|Vast {{areas of}} {{farmland}} in the Sacramento Valley were deeply buried by the mining sediment. Frequently devastated by flood waters, farmers demanded {{an end to}} hydraulic mining. In the most renowned legal fight of farmers against miners, the farmers sued the hydraulic mining operations and the landmark case of Edwards Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company {{made its way to}} the United States District Court in San Francisco where Judge Lorenzo Sawyer decided in favor of the farmers and banned hydraulic mining on January 7, 1884, declaring that hydraulic mining was “a public and private nuisance” and enjoining its operation in areas tributary to navigable streams and rivers. Hydraulic mining on a much smaller scale was recommenced after 1893 when the United States Congress passed the Camminetti Act which allowed such mining if sediment detention structures were constructed. This led to a number of operations above sediment catching brush <b>dams</b> and log <b>crib</b> <b>dams.</b> Most of the water-delivery hydraulic mining infrastructure had been destroyed by an 1891 flood, so this later stage of mining was carried on at a much smaller scale in California.|$|R
50|$|The Winchester Dam {{was made}} from large timber <b>cribs.</b> Originally, the <b>dam</b> was a mere four feet high, which was raised to sixteen feet in 1907. The dam was {{the main source of}} water and {{electricity}} for the town of Roseburg until 1923.|$|R
50|$|The Green River <b>Crib</b> <b>Dam</b> is a {{historic}} 19th-century dam on the Green River in western Guilford, Vermont. Built about 1811, it {{is a reminder of}} the modest industrial enterprises once conducted in the area using the water power it provided, {{and is one of the}} state's few surviving crib dams. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concrete}} and timber <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> {{was constructed in}} 1884 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, with a height of 17 feet, and a length of 385 feet at its crest. [...] It impounds the Upper Mississippi River for flood control, navigation, and municipal drinking water. Rebuilt in 1936, the dam is {{owned and operated by}} the Mississippi Valley Division of the Corps of Engineers.|$|E
50|$|In 1894, {{prior to}} the {{construction}} of the steel dam, the Atlantic Mining Company built a timber <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> across the Salmon Trout River. The dam created a reservoir which supplied water to the Atlantic stamp mill which extracted copper from ore-bearing rock. With the growth of the Atlantic stamp mill and the construction of the Baltic Mining Company mill nearby, this reservoir proved to be insufficient, and in 1901 the steel dam was built. It was designed by J. F. Jackson and built by the Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company. The old timber <b>crib</b> <b>dam</b> remained in place, submerged, upstream of the steel dam. A system of spillways, sluices (or launders as they are referred to in contemporary texts), and pipes brought water downhill to the stamp mills. The dam itself measures 74 ft (23 m) high at its center and extends for a length of 1,006 ft (307 m) across the river. Access to the reservoir was shared by the Atlantic and Baltic mines, which had a common board of directors.|$|E
5000|$|On August 1, 1900, {{cofferdams}} {{were completed}} {{above and below}} the main <b>dam</b> <b>crib</b> section, and the river’s entire flow was channeled through the lock chamber.

50|$|Telos Lake drained {{into the}} south end of Chamberlain Lake until the Telos Cut was {{excavated}} in 1841 to allow Telos Lake to drain east into Webster Lake and the Penobscot River. In the 1850s Eben S. Coe built the timber <b>crib</b> Lock <b>Dam</b> across the outlet from Chamberlain Lake causing Chamberlain Lake to overflow southward through Round Pond, Telos Lake, Webster Lake and Webster Brook into the East Branch Penobscot River in Baxter State Park. These changes allowed logs harvested in the upper Saint John River watershed to be floated to Bangor sawmills. The combined level of Chamberlain Lake, Round Pond, and Telos Lake has subsequently been regulated by Telos Dam.|$|R

40|$|Partnering {{with the}} Farmington River Watershed Association (FRWA), {{and as part}} of an overall Farmington River Enhancement Grant from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CTDEP), Princeton Hydro was tasked with the design of fish passage {{improvements}} at two (2) dams on the Farmington River. Located within the town limits of Farmington, Connecticut, the existing dilapidated rock fill/timber <b>crib</b> Winchell-Smith <b>Dam</b> is approximately four (4) feet high, and spans the entire 200 ’+ widechannel at this location, withthe adjacent historic mill building, currently serving as a restaurant. To balance the desire for the falling water aesthetic over the dam (request of the adjacent mill restaurant owner) with the goal of providing efficient fish passage, an inverted rock ramp fish way was selected for design. This less common rock ramp configuration required detailed hydrologic and hydraulic (H 2 ̆ 6 H) modeling to ensure sufficient flow over the dam while maintaining optimal passing requirements (depths and velocities) through the rock ramp for the target fish species. To account for the range of fish passage flow conditions experienced at the Winchell-Smith dam, the proposed fishway also required the design of a staged weir configuration to allow modification of flows directed to the fishway through the use of weir boards. Design of the proposed weir inlet to the fishway ramp utilized various data sets gathered during field investigation and data collection, including nearby USGS stream gages, as well as pressure transducer (stage only) gages installed both upstream and downstream of the dam. Beyond the case-study of the Winchell-Smith design, brief discussion is included regarding regional efforts of fish passage enhancement on the Farmington River, including a significantly larger dam removal downstream of the subject dam, as well as considerations for design of inverted rock ramp fishways vs. traditional rock ramp fishways...|$|R
