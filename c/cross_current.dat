No sooner did he perceive by the bubbles that floated past, or rather appeared to float past, that his ship was dividing the water forward, than he called a trusty man to the wheel, relieving John Effingham from his watch. The next instant, Mr. Leach reported the anchor catted and fished.|$|E

This develops great surfaces for an ideal mass transfer from the aqueous phase into the organic phase. At 200-2000 g, both phases will be separated again. Centrifugal extractors minimize the solvent in the process, optimize the product load in the solvent and extract the aqueous phase completely.

40|$|The Westerschelde estuary {{is located}} in The Netherlands and is a major {{shipping}} route connecting the North Sea to the Port of Antwerp (Belgium). <b>Cross</b> <b>currents</b> up to three knots occur at high water during extreme spring tides and are increasingly hampering navigation in the Westerschelde near Hansweert resulting in one major incident leaving a container vessel stranded on a nearby sand bank. This study aimed at the simulation, prediction and assessment of a large eddy (stretching over the complete navigation channel) which produces these <b>cross</b> <b>currents.</b> A numerical model was set up and a detailed calibration of the hydrodynamic model was executed. A good agreement was obtained between model and measured data on {{the location of the}} eddy and the strength of the <b>cross</b> <b>currents.</b> Flow fields produced by the numerical model subsequently have been implemented in a nautical simulator in which pilots are trained on sailing in these exceptional conditions. Currently, a warning is sent out to Traffic Control whenever at least one of two parameters is being foreseen to pass a critical value according to forecasting models (high water level and water level gradient). This system has been proven to yield false negatives in some cases. The simulation results and analysis have clarified the conditions in which the eddy grows sufficiently (2 km across) to cause <b>cross</b> <b>currents</b> in the navigation channel. A new criterion for sending out a navigation warning is proposed. It shows a better correlation with the occurrence of <b>cross</b> <b>currents,</b> hence pilots will have a higher probability to be warned in case of <b>cross</b> <b>currents.</b> </p...|$|R
50|$|Alternative {{arrangements}} are <b>cross</b> <b>current</b> systems found in birds. and dead-end air-filled sac systems {{found in the}} lungs of mammals. In a cocurrent flow system, the blood and gas (or the fluid containing the gas) move {{in the same direction}} through the gas exchanger. This means the magnitude of the gradient is variable {{along the length of the}} gas-exchange surface, and the exchange will eventually stop when an equilibrium has been reached (see upper diagram in Fig. 2).Cocurrent flow gas exchange systems are not known to be used in nature.|$|E

As to contemporary music, he composed symphonic works, operas and ballets represented at the Scala Theatre in Milan and other Italian theatres, in addition to film scores, including Bali (1970), Your Hands on My Body (1970), <b>Cross</b> <b>Current</b> (1971), The Hassled Hooker (1972), The Night of the Devils (1972), So Sweet, So Dead (1972), When Women Were Called Virgins (1972), Five Women for the Killer (1974) and Kleinhoff Hotel (1977). In 1975 he was contacted by Dario Argento to score Deep Red, having previously scored Argento's The Five Days in 1973. Unfortunately Argento was disappointed by the music, and only three of Gaslini's original themes were retained.|$|E
