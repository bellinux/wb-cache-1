40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to describe the application of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to the performance evaluations of bank branches. Special attention is focused on how to incorporate the quality dimension into branch efficiency. DEA will apply to a set of micro-data from a Czech commercial bank branch network. In the banking sector, providing services quality {{is one of the key}} focuses. Therefore, the quality dimension should be incorporated into the DEA model. The goal of the quality adjusted DEA model is to identify best practice branches that work efficiently and at the same time provide services with high quality. This model avoids productivity-quality tradeoff, which is present by the standard DEA model. The quality of services is measured by customer service, mystery shopping and <b>calls,</b> client <b>information</b> index, <b>retention,</b> and client product penetration. Main determinants of efficiency and quality level are branch size and region via purchasing power. quality adjusted DEA, branch performance, scale efficiency, return to scale...|$|R

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{identify}} the effect of sustained maternal inflammation at mid-gestation on fetal mortality, skeletal muscle growth, and development at term. Fetal rats had reduced total mass that coincided with impaired myoblast function, as myoD was reduced and myogenin expression was increased in hindlimb muscle. Fetuses also had increased circulating TNFα at term after maternal inflammation, which decreased TNFR and IL 6 R mRNA in muscle, reducing sensitivity to cytokines. These findings indicate that sustained maternal inflammation at mid-gestation impairs fetal skeletal muscle growth near-term due to changes in myoblast responsiveness to inflammatory regulation. To evaluate the acute impact of inflammatory and adrenergic factors on muscle metabolism, basil and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and oxidation was measured in primary rat soleus muscle incubated with TNFα, IL- 6, β 1 adrenergic agonist, or β 2 adrenergic agonist with or without insulin. Βeta 2 adrenergic agonist increased basal glucose oxidation, decreased basal glucose uptake, and synergistically increased insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation and Akt phosphorylation, but β 1 agonist had no effect. Inflammatory cytokines antagonized insulin signaling but simultaneously increased glucose oxidation via MAPK. Together, our findings show acute exposure to these stress factors increases glucose oxidation independently of glucose uptake and insulin signaling.

Effective pedagogical considerations integrating the theoretical concepts related to cognitive load are reflected in the design and development of the module.

40|$|Abstract:- A system structure, i. e., how {{elements}} of a system are connected, is a key factor for <b>information</b> <b>retention</b> and transmission through its elements. From the system dynamics, i. e., {{the states of the}} elements over time, we measure the system’s ability to propagate information through its elements as the pairwise mutual information (pMI) between the elements at moments t and t + L, where L is the minimum path length between the two elements. <b>Information</b> <b>retention</b> is measured with Lempel-Ziv (LZ), a measure of the complexity of transmitted information, from the same time series of states. We propose a combined measure of information propagation and ability to retain information efficiently, to determine optimal structures for <b>information</b> propagation and <b>retention.</b> We present the results on <b>information</b> propagation and <b>retention,</b> as a function of topology (random and small world structures), connectivity, noise and clustering coefficient. The conclusions are applicable in any context where these networks are used to model the system. Here, we apply our findings to a model of human organizations and than propose a generalization of the model to capture more realistic features, such as more complex internal states for elements and simulating information exchange with the environment outside of the system. As more features are incorporated, this model will capture many important features of human organizations, and other complex systems...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of both graphics and presentation format on <b>information</b> <b>retention.</b> An additional consideration was if the learning style of these students would also influence <b>information</b> <b>retention.</b> Subjects were selected from the 2 ̆ 2 Introduction to Instructional Communications 2 ̆ 2 courses at a Slate university in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine how college students 2 ̆ 7 <b>information</b> <b>retention</b> of a reading passage would be affected by graphics supplementing text and by presentation media, which was paper copy or computer screen display. An 2 ̆ 2 Informed Consent 2 ̆ 2 form, demographics form and a Kolb Learning Styles Inventory (LSI) were completed during the initial meeting. Students were then assigned to one of four treatment groups - non-graphics/paper copy, graphics/paper copy, non-graphics /computer screen display, or graphics/computer screen display. One week later students read a short passage using one of the four treatments. Students reading from computer screen display were in a different room from those reading from paper copy. A paper and pencil, multiple choice test was given to each participant at one, two, and three week intervals following the reading. The textual material and tests for retention were materials that had been developed specifically for this study. The other instrument chosen for this study was the Learning Styles Inventory (LSI) (Kolb 1985). The graphics were developed by the investigator and were validated by experts who specializes in the design of visuals for education and instruction. Trained research assistants aided in conducting the research. A multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze the three independent variables (media, graphics and learning styles), using the subject retention scores as the dependent variable. In addition any interaction between media and graphics was examined. There was a significant difference between the graphics and the non-graphics groups in that the non-graphics groups retained more over time than the graphics groups. The findings of this study do not support the evidence from previous research that graphics have a significant positive affect on <b>information</b> <b>retention</b> or that there is no significant difference between graphics and non-graphics for retention. In contrast to these previous studies, the mean retention scores of the graphics group were consistently lower than those of the non-graphics group. This study indicates that the media had no effect on the retention scores, despite previous research indicating a preference for paper copy as well as poorer performance using the computer. Also, the students 2 ̆ 7 learning style did not have an impact on <b>information</b> <b>retention.</b> In reviewing the results of the study the reader must remember the high attrition rate and the tendency was for those who dropped out of the study to have lower GPA 2 ̆ 7 s. Therefore the results of the study can only be generalized to those with the higher GPA 2 ̆ 7 s.

Lastly, individual differences among students, such as their Need for Cognition, Sensation Seeking, and Optimal Level of Arousal impact test performance, based on note-taking method. Analyses conducted as part of this study found that there are no significant differences in how well students retain information based on note-taking method, match/mismatch in context between note-taking and test-taking, or various individual differences.

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Planning and Interpretation, 2015 Elementary {{school classes}} {{regularly}} attend natural resource interpretation programs and activities. Interpretive field trips are commonly included throughout elementary {{education as a}} way to get students out of the classroom into a different setting and connect them with the environment. However, field trip factors such as cost and time for planning and transportation are barriers for many teachers. An alternative that has been explored in education research is the use of school grounds as an educational setting. This study set out to determine whether educational setting, indoor or outdoor, has an effect on <b>information</b> <b>retention</b> in elementary school students. Using a convenience sample of twelve elementary school classes in Arcata, classes were randomly assigned to each setting so that five classes were indoors, five outdoors on school grounds, and two classes acted as the control groups. The interpreter, program content, program materials and activities were constant in each setting, the only difference being the physical setting. A series of tests consisting of a pre-test, post-test, and post-post-test assessed whether setting had any effect on <b>information</b> <b>retention.</b> After analyzing the data through a multiple comparison ANOVA and Tukey Test, the study reflected no significant difference between treatments.

40|$|Through evolution, {{animals have}} {{acquired}} central nervous systems (CNSs), which are extremely efficient information processing devices that improve an animal's adaptability to various environments. It {{has been proposed}} {{that the process of}} information maximization (infomax), which maximizes the information transmission from the input to the output of a feedforward network, may provide an explanation of the stimulus selectivity of neurons in CNSs. However, CNSs contain not only feedforward but also recurrent synaptic connections, and little is known about <b>information</b> <b>retention</b> over time in such recurrent networks. Here, we propose a learning algorithm based on infomax in a recurrent network, which we call "recurrent infomax" (RI). RI maximizes <b>information</b> <b>retention</b> and thereby minimizes information loss in a network. We find that feeding in external inputs consisting of information obtained from photographs of natural scenes into an RI-based model of a recurrent network results in the appearance of Gabor-like selectivity quite similar tothat existing in simple cells of the primary visual cortex (V 1). More importantly, we find that without external input, this network exhibits cell assembly-like and synfire chain-like spontaneous activity and a critical neuronal avalanche. RI provides a simple framework to explain a wide range of phenomena observed in in vivo and in vitro neuronal networks, and it should provide a novel understanding of experimental results for multineuronal activity and plasticity from an information-theoretic point of view.
