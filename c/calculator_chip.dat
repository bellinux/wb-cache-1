5000|$|With this {{foundation}} in <b>calculator</b> <b>chips</b> and high volume DRAM production, Mostek {{gained a reputation}} as a leading semiconductor [...] "fabrication house" [...] (fab) in the early 1970s. One of their more popular products was the Mostek 3870, which combined the two-chip Fairchild F8 (3850 + 3851) into a single chip, which they introduced in 1977. William H. Bradley designed a host of custom products based on the MK3870. Fairchild later licensed the 3870 back from Mostek.

The oil crisis of the mid-1970s and the bankruptcy of its biggest calculator customer, Bowmar Instrument, changed its fortunes, however, and in 1976 Western Digital declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After this, Emerson withdrew their support of the company, and WDC was on its own.|$|E

Mark then proceeded to write the program in assembly language, challenged by making it fit into the 512 bytes of ROM allowed by the chip. There was no sound processing hardware, so the sounds were produced by toggling the speaker in embedded timing loops from within the program itself.|$|E

Several years earlier, TI suddenly raised the prices of their <b>calculator</b> <b>chips</b> to take over that market, nearly putting Commodore out of business. To ensure this would not happen again, Tramiel purchased MOS Technology to ensure his supply of the 6502 for his computers. When TI introduced the TI99, Tramiel turned the tables on them by pricing his machines below theirs. A price war ensued, causing a breathtaking decline in home computer prices, reducing them as much as eight times over a period of a few months.|$|R

50|$|Motorola {{responded to}} MOS Technology's $20 {{microprocessor}} by immediately reducing the single-unit {{price of the}} 6800 microprocessor from $175 to $69 and then suing MOS Technology in November 1975. Motorola claimed that the eight former Motorola engineers used technical information developed at Motorola {{in the design of}} the 6501 and 6502 microprocessors. MOS Technology's other business, <b>calculator</b> <b>chips,</b> was declining due to a price war with Texas Instruments so their financial backer, Allen-Bradley, decided to limit the possible losses and sold the assets of MOS Technology back to the founders. The lawsuit was settled in April 1976 with MOS Technology dropping the 6501 chip that would plug into a Motorola 6800 socket and licensing Motorola's peripheral chips. Motorola reduced the single-unit price of the 6800 to $35.|$|R

First, George made a proof of concept prototype demonstrating a blip moving on an LED display without using a microprocessor to get approval from Mattel for further development. He then looked for a manufacturer to provide a circuit board that would fit into a compact package.

2500|$|Ed Roberts had {{designed}} and manufactured programmable calculators and {{was familiar with}} the microprocessors available in 1974. He thought the Intel 4004 and Intel 8008 were not powerful enough (in fact two microcomputers based on the Intel 8008 were already on the market: The Micral marketed in January 1973 by the French company R2E and the MCM/70 marketed in 1974 by the Canadian company Micro Computer Machines); the National Semiconductor IMP-8 and IMP-16 required external hardware; the Motorola 6800 was still in development. So he chose the 8-bit Intel 8080. At that time, Intel's main business was selling memory chips by the thousands to computer companies. They had no experience in selling small quantities of microprocessors. When the 8080 was introduced in April 1974, Intel set the single unit price at $360 (About $1,700 in 2014 dollars). [...] "That figure had a nice ring to it," [...] recalled Intel's Dave House in 1984. [...] "Besides, it was a computer, and they usually cost thousands of dollars, so we felt it was a reasonable price." [...] Ed Roberts had experience in buying OEM quantities of <b>calculator</b> <b>chips</b> {{and he was able to}} negotiate a $75 price (about $350 in 2014 dollars) for the 8080 microprocessor chips.|$|R
5000|$|On August 19, 1974, {{the former}} Motorola {{employees}} moved into MOS Technology's headquarters at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The {{goal was to}} design and produce a low cost microprocessor for embedded applications and to target as wide as possible a customer base. This would be possible only if the microprocessor was low cost - and in the semiconductor business, chip size determined cost. The size goal required n-channel [...] "depletion-mode" [...] MOS transistors, a more advanced process than MOS Technology's <b>calculator</b> <b>chips</b> used. John Pavinen was {{able to have the}} fabrication process ready by June 1975. Chuck Peddle, Rod Orgill, and Wil Mathys designed the initial architecture of the new processors. There would be two microprocessors: the 6501 would plug into the same socket as the Motorola 6800, while the 6502 would work with 6800 family peripherals and have an on-chip clock oscillator. These processors would not run 6800 software because they had a different instruction set, different registers, and mostly different addressing modes. A September 1975 article in EDN magazine gives this summary of the design:The MOS Technology 650X family represents a conscious attempt of eight former Motorola employees who worked {{on the development of the}} 6800 system to put out a part that would replace and outperform the 6800, yet undersell it.

Mostek's device took longer to develop but was a single <b>chip</b> <b>calculator</b> solution, the MK6010. Busicom used the Mostek design in a new handheld line, the Busicom LE-120A, which went on the market in 1971 and was the smallest calculator available for some time.

50|$|Around 1970, {{the first}} <b>calculator</b> and clock <b>chips</b> {{began to show}} that very small {{computers}} might be possible.

Via the 8008, 8080 and the 8086 line of designs, the 2200 became a direct ancestor to today's ubiquitous x86 family (including Pentium, Core i7 etc.); every instruction of the 2200 or 8008 has a direct equivalent in the large x86 instruction set, although the opcode values are different in the latter.|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology refers any {{technique}} that involves about object with nanoscale (10 {sup - 9 } m) or even smaller. It {{has become more}} and more important in recently years and has changed our world dramatically. Most of modern electronic devices today should thanks to the miniaturizing driven by development of nanotechnology. Recent years, more and more governments are investing huge amount of money in research related to nanotechnology. There are two major reasons that nanostructure is so fascinate. The first one is the miniaturizing. It is obvious that if we can make products smaller without losing the features, we can save the cost and increase the performance dramatically. For an example, the first computer in the world, ENIAC, which occupied several rooms, is less powerful than the cheapest <b>calculator</b> today. Today's <b>chips</b> with sizes of less than half an inch contain millions of basic units. All these should thank to the development of nanotechnology. The other reason is that when we come to nanoscale, there are many new effects due to the quantum effect which can't be found in large systems. For an example, quantum dots (QDs) are systems which sizes are below 1 {micro}m(10 {sup - 6 }m) and restricted in three dimensions. There are many interesting quantum effects in QDs, including discrete energy levels, and interdot coupling. Due to these properties and their small sizes, QDs have varies potential applications such as quantum computing, probe, light emitting device, solar cells, and laser. To meet the requirement of the nanoelectrical applications, the QDs must be grown highly uniformly because their property is highly dependent on their sizes. The major methods to grow uniform QDs include epitaxial, and lithograph. Lithography is a process to make patterns on a thin film by selectively removing certain parts of the film. Using this method, people have good control over size, location and spacing of QDs. For an example, the Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) have a wave length of 13. 4 nm so it can curve on the surface of an sample to make structure as small as the order of 10 nm. however, lithograph usually causes permanent damages to the surface and in many cases the QDs are damaged during the lithograph and therefore result in high percentage of defects. Quantum size effect has attracted more and more interests in surface science due to many of its effects. One of its effects is the height preference in film growing and the resulting possibility of uniformly sized self-assemble nanostructure. The experiment of Pb islands on In 4 x 1 phase shows that both the height and the width can be controlled by proper growth conditions, which expands the growth dimensions from 1 to 2. This discover leads us to study the In/Pb interface. In Ch. 3, we found that the Pb islands growing on In 4 x 1 -Si(111) surface which have uniform height due to QSE and uniform width due to the constriction of In 4 x 1 lattice have unexpected stability. These islands are stable in even RT, unlike usual nanostructures on Pb/Si surface which are stable only at low temperature. Since similar structures are usually grown at low temperature, this discovery makes the grown structures closer to technological applications. It also shows the unusual of In/Pb interface. Then we studied the In islands grown on Pb-{alpha}-{radical} 3 x{radical} 3 -Si(111) phase in Ch. 4. These islands have fcc structure in the first few layers, and then convert to bct structure. The In fcc islands have sharp height preference due to QSE like Pb islands. However, the preferred height is different (7 layer for Pb on Si 7 x 7 and 4 layer for Pb on In 4 x 1), due to the difference of interface. The In islands structure prefers to be bct than fcc with coverage increase. It is quantitatively supported by first-principle calculation. Unexpectedly, the In islands grown on various of In interfaces didn't show QSE effects and phase transition from fcc and bct structures as on the Pb-{alpha} interface (Ch. 6). In g(s) curve there is no clear oscillations in the g(s) curve as the In on Pb-{alpha} phase. This {{may be due to the}} extra mobility of In atoms, which causes the In bct islands to grow too fast to be observed in diffraction or STM (Ch. 5). From these experiments we can see the importance of Pb-? phase in growth of In islands. It is the best interface to grow In islands in the phases we have experimented. Recent experiments show that the Existence of Pb will decrease the diffusion speed of In. In Ch. 6 we have shown that In atoms diffusion is so fast that the bct spots are not visible in diffraction. But when we put some Pb onto the In surface, we can see the bct spots, although very weak. So Pb should play an role in slowing down the indium atoms diffusion. The interaction of Pb and In may play a role, but it is still not fully understood. So the general conclusion of this thesis is that In/Pb interface has extraordinary properties and may have potential in self-assembling growth...|$|R
