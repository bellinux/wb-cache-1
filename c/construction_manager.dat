5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of {{controversy}} surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of Bovis as <b>construction</b> <b>manager</b> after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.|$|E

40|$|Experience is a {{critical}} component of expertise for <b>construction</b> <b>managers.</b> Time allows them to inductively construct and organize knowledge about the construction management domain that often cannot be easily formalized. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the nature of expertise in <b>construction</b> <b>managers.</b> Both experts and novices represent and organize experientially gained knowledge as abstractions that we refer to as “mental models”. We investigated expertise by exploring mental models of <b>construction</b> <b>managers.</b> In this study we explored experimentally the existence of a difference in the mental models among <b>construction</b> <b>managers.</b> A group of <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> with varying levels of experience were asked to respond to a construction management crisis scenario. Using the ConProFac software to calculate an index i indicative of the structuredness of the responses we found a significant correlation between i and the number of years of experience of the respondent.

40|$|Ethics is {{important}} for business, individual career and image of industry. However, construction companies do not show high ethical standards. Studying ethical perception of manages is a popular topic at generic level, in particular professions and on construction-related professionals, but there is lack of research on studying ethical perceptions of <b>construction</b> <b>managers.</b> The aim {{of this research is}} to study the ethical perceptions of <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> and how do demographic factors influence it. The method for conducting this study is through questionnaire survey among the UK <b>construction</b> <b>managers.</b> Three hundred and seven questionnaires were distributed and ninety-three completed questionnaires are completed and returned. The <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> who appear to pay most concern on ethics are male, at middle age, at middle position in their organisations, having more than 21 years experience and are educated up to at least at degree level. The results show that the <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> found ‘producing falsifying reports,’ ‘over-claiming expenses’ and ‘having low level of personal honesty’ as the most unethical perceptions. The findings also show that the ethical perceptions of <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> are different from other construction-related professionals such as surveyors and engineers...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature and}} extent of value {{management}} (VM) practice by professional <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> and <b>construction</b> project <b>managers</b> in South Africa is investigated using a web-based, online questionnaire survey. The survey explores managers&# 039; awareness and understanding of VM, and the {{nature and extent}} of the use of VM techniques within their organisations. Descriptive statistics are used to analyse the survey response data. The results suggest that awareness of VM is not widespread among <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> and <b>construction</b> project <b>managers,</b> and that its actual practice is minimal. This is due largely to the encroachment on the traditional aims of VM by other project management techniques that also seek to facilitate the attainment of value for construction clients. Where VM is used on projects, it is invariably cost-minimisation driven in terms of both the project and the VM process itself. It is recommended that the professional association responsible for the regulation of the activities of <b>construction</b> and project <b>managers</b> should organise suitable training opportunities in value management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Construction</b> <b>managers</b> are {{decision}} makers who administer nontrivial processes. The replacement of highly experienced <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> and other <b>construction</b> professionals is a laborious {{process for the}} industry. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for the construction management practice {{that serves as the}} foundation for the development of situational simulations. Situational simulations are temporally dynamic clinical exercises with the objective of exposing participants to rapidly unfolding events and the pressure of decision making. The application of situational simulations provides <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> and other {{decision makers}} the opportunity of experiencing and responding to risky events without endangering the success of real projects, further enhancing their decision-making skills. The construction management conceptual framework includes a process, a product, and an information model. The analysis of a basic mathematical representation of the process model is the focus of this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{has a number}} of unique characteristics, including a temporary organisational structure, and {{it is one of the}} most dangerous of all industries.

As part of original plans to create an enjoyable experience for fans, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic on game days to allow spectators to park in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle and walk across the bridge to the stadium. PNC Park was built with Kasota limestone shipped from a Minnesota river valley, to contrast the brick bases of other modern stadiums. The stadium was constructed over a 24-month span—at the time of construction, three months faster than any other modern major league ballpark—and the Pirates played their first game less than two years after groundbreaking. The quick construction was accomplished with the use of special computers, which relayed building plans to builders 24hours per day. In addition, all 23labor unions involved in the construction signed a pact that they would not strike during the building process.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 827 on 27. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) <b>Construction</b> <b>managers</b> aim to deliver successful construction projects; {{however it is}} unclear how they perceive construction project success and how they influence that success. Focusing on the construction phase of the project, a Systems Conceptual Framework is induced from the literature review. In-depth interviews undertaken by 10 <b>construction</b> <b>managers,</b> whose experience accounts for over 130 construction projects, provide data to derive categories which populate the Systems Conceptual Framework initially developed. By adopting an unstructured approach to the data collection, a holistic view of how <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> impact the success of construction projects is acquired. The construction managers' influence on success is identified through the skills, competencies and characteristics which enable success of the construction phase (enablers). This inductive-deductive methodological approach allows the identification of categories and relations between them which, along with the Systems Conceptual Framework, form the Empirical Model. A Pareto analysis was carried out {{in order to determine the}} relative relevance categories have against each others. Overall, 56 relations were identified between the 37 categories derived from the data analysis. The results of the research show that the influence of <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> on project success is determined by twenty enablers. According to the Pareto analysis, 6 enablers were most relevant; they are separated into two interrelated sets: Communication, Leadership and People Management, and Ability to Pull Back, Experience and Technical Skill. This suggests that <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> consider mastering 'hard' and 'soft' aspects of the job are both equally relevant to the success of the project. The high interconnectivity between the categories is what allows the Empirical Model to be developed; making it the most important finding of this research. Evidence indicates that <b>construction</b> <b>managers</b> work with both a subjective (qualitative) and an objective (quantitative) concept of success. The quantitative concept of success can have between two and four success factors, which are prioritised according to the needs of the client; there is always one critical success factors that leads the project. The subjective concept of success incorporates aspects of the end user and personal satisfaction, and specific characteristics of the project. The results also show that the outcomes of construction projects can be three: success, failure, and a third outcome which is neither, an outcome between success and failure. Participants have identified this last outcome as being the most frequent...|$|R
