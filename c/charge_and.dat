5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape <b>charge,</b> <b>and</b> Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E

The {{more popular}} of {{electric}} vehicles is, {{the higher the}} load capacity of the battery is in the power system, therefore, the <b>charging</b> <b>and</b> discharging technology is particularly important.

5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the <b>charge),</b> <b>and</b> fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E

5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|Bayern had 19 coaches {{since its}} {{promotion}} to the Bundesliga in 1965. Udo Lattek, Giovanni Trapattoni and Ottmar Hitzfeld served two terms {{as head coach}}. Franz Beckenbauer served one term as head coach and one as caretaker, while Jupp Heynckes had four separate spells as manager, including one as caretaker manager. Lattek was the club's most successful coach, having won six Bundeslige titles, two DFB Cups and the European Cup; following closely is Ottmar Hitzfeld, who won five Bundeslige titles, two DFB cups and the Champions League. The club's least successful coach was Søren Lerby, who won {{less than a third}} of his matches in <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> presided over the club's near-relegation in the 1991–92 campaign.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive <b>charge</b> <b>and</b> a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
30|$|Electric vehicle <b>charging</b> <b>and</b> {{discharging}} technologies mainly {{have four}} modes, i.e. unidirectional disordered charging mode, unidirectional ordered <b>charging</b> mode, <b>and</b> bidirectional ordered <b>charging</b> <b>and</b> discharging modes. Unidirectional charging mode can only receive electricity from distribution networks, but cannot feed the surplus electricity of EVs back to distribution networks [36]. Bidirectional ordered <b>charging</b> <b>and</b> discharging modes {{mean that the}} EVs are connected with and controlled by the energy management system of distribution networks. The batteries of EVs are regarded as the moving power storage equipment and stand-by power source to realize the energy conversion with distribution networks [37].|$|R

Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.|$|E
