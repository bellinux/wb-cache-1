40|$|Spoilage of beer by {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp.) has considerable economic significance. Compounds derived from the hop (Humulus lupulus) possess antibacterial activity but their role in prevention of beer spoilage has been disputed. Prior to the present study, the mechanism by which such compounds inhibited growth of beer-spoilage {{lactic acid bacteria}} was unknown. A range of hop compounds (<b>colupulone,</b> (-) -humulone, (-) -cohumulone) and hop-derived compounds (trans-isohumulone, trans-isocohumulone, trans-humulinic acid, dehydrated humulinic acid) was prepared and analysed using several spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR spectrometry; mass spectroscopy; 1 H-NMR f 13 C-NMR spectroscopy). The ability of these weak acids to ionise in solution was studied. The lack of agreement between pKa values measured using potentiometric, conductimetric, spectroscopic and solubility methods suggests that, in aqueous solution, the compounds formed covalent hydrates. Antibacterial activity of the compounds against Lactobacillus brevis IFO 3960 was pH-dependent: the undissociated form of each compound was the active antibacterial moiety and the ionised form had little activity. The antibacterial activity of the undissociated forms {{of each of the}} compounds was similar. In the case of the undissociated form of trans-isohumulone, 0. 1 - 0. 4 ptM was sufficient to inhibit growth of Lact. brevis IFO 3960 in a modified version of de Man Rogosa Sharpe medium over the pH range 4. 0 - 7. 0. Trans-isohumulone acted as an ionophore of the mobile-carrier type. In lactic acid bacteria, H + was exchanged for Mn 2 + in an electroneutral process that required the presence of a second monovalent cation (e. grK +, Na +) ...|$|E
40|$|High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) {{has been}} {{extensively}} used {{in the analysis of}} hop derived components in beer, but the scope of these methods is limited by the range of attainable reference compounds. The synthesis and purification of a range of relevant components has been described by several authors, but in our laboratory these procedures fail to give compounds of sufficient purity. Modification of published procedures are described for the preparation of humulinic acids, dehydrohumulinic acids, hulupones, and <b>colupulone.</b> These procedures provide facile routes for preparation of these compounds in higher yields than was hitherto reported, and also in sufficient purity for their use as standards in quantitative HPLC analysis. Although bitterness in beer is largely due to iso - a - acids, other compounds such as hulupones are considered to have similar bitter properties. Alternative routes to hulupones using the readily available and cheap 6 -acids extracts as starting material are therefore examined. Oxidation of Bacids in the presence of sodium sulphite was established as the most feasible route to these compounds. The structural authenticity of all preparations was confirmed by infra-red, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Purity of the compounds was established using HPLC in conjunction with photodiode array detection. Developed HPLC methods, and synthesised pure reference standards are used in the quantitative analysis of humulinic acids in hop iso-a-acid extracts before, and after acid hydrolysis. HPLC methods are also developed for the quantitative analysis of hulupone formed from the oxidation of B-acids solutions. The stability of all compounds synthesised was investigated so that satisfactory conditions for their long-term storage could be identified...|$|E
40|$|Hop growers request new {{cultivar}} {{should have}} qualitative parameters of Saaz semi-early red-bine hop with higher yield potential. Therefore currently, there are efforts to breed new aroma cultivars. 	The aim of diploma thesis was {{to evaluate and}} choose new breeding aroma genotypes, which would show equal or better quality and quantity parameters than Saaz semi-early red-bine hop registered cultivar, based on production indicators, chemical and genetic analyses. Obtained data were evaluated by basic statistical characteristics, two-sided t-tests for independent selections and correlation analysis. A yield {{is the most important}} quantitative parameter, which is mainly and significantly dependent on climatic conditions. All evaluated genotypes in diploma thesis have reached higher average yields than ŽPČ cultivar, except genotype 4799. Genotype 4801 reached the highest theoretical yield (2. 2 tons of dry hops) in year 2014 and genotype 4975 (1. 77 tons of dry hops) in year 2015 from achieved results. A content of alpha bitter acids is the most important qualitative parameter. All aroma new breeding lines have shown parameters of fine aroma hops according to chemical analyses of hop resins. Aroma genotype 4975 showed the highest average contents of alpha and beta bitter acids, balanced ratio between alpha and beta bitter acids, the lowest contents of cohumulone and <b>colupulone,</b> and as well it kept a low or middle variability in all studied traits of chemical analyses of hop resins. A relative content of farnesene higher than 12 % is a typical for aroma hop cultivars with ŽPČ cultivar origin. All evaluated genotypes achieved this criteria. We evaluated the relationship to Saaz semi-early red-bine hop cultivar based on genetic analyses. Genotype 4799 has been genetically the closest to ŽPČ. Brewed beers have been a same quality as beers from Saaz semi-early red-bine hop cultivar by sensory evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Hops {{have been}} used in the brewing of {{alcoholic}} beverage for over 3000 years. Due to new consumer preferences towards sweeter drinks or 'Alcopops', beer consumption has taken a drastic decline. This has caused the economic value of hops as a commodity to decline, therefore new applications for this material are required. The hop extracts humulone (8) and lupulone (22) exist in several tautomeric forms. We present unequivocal evidence for the existence of the major tautomer of lupulone, <b>colupulone</b> and a derivative of humulone in polar media. The evidence has been obtained from single X-ray crystallographic data and computer modelling as well as IH and 13 e NMR spectroscopy. The first 2 D INADEQUATE spectrum of the tautomer of lupulone provides unambiguous chemical shift assignments for all of the structural carbon atoms. This project has also involved the investigation into known and novel derivatives of the major constituents of hops, humulone (8) and lupulone (22), as possible bactericides. The main mode of action of these compounds activity against bacterial cells is their ability to chelate metal ions and allow passive diffusion of these complexes out of cells. A number of chemical derivatives have been synthesised and, using a model developed as part of this research, tested for their potential to pass metal ions from aqueous to non-polar organic media. In addition to this some of the novel compounds have been screened on bacterial samples to determine the structure activity relationship of the known and novel derivatives. Chapter 1 covers the background ofhumulone (8) and the hop acids. Chapter 2 covers the biology ofthe hop acids including biological activity. Chapter 3 covers the structural analysis of the hop acids. collected during this project and the derivatisation work. Chapter 4 covers the physical property data and biological data collected during this project. Chapter 5 gives a brief summary of the achievements of this project and future directions. Chapter 6 covers the experimental techniques and collected data...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by the Crop Science Society of America and can be found at: [URL] (Humulus lupulus L. var. lupulus) is grown worldwide for the production of the dried female inflorescence (strobulus), or cones, used principally for the bittering and flavoring of beer. Information is scant on the inheritance of traits of economic importance in hop, and present knowledge is based on historical data rather than designed experimental investigation. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the heritability of and genetic correlation among six traits: yield (YLD), α-acid (ALP) concentration, β-acid (BET) concentration, cohumulone (COH) percentage, <b>colupulone</b> (COL) percentage, and xanthohumol (XAN) concentration. Twenty-five full-sib families were developed by crossing five randomly chosen females and five randomly chosen males in a North Carolina Design II mating design. Plants were transplanted into the field in a randomized complete block (RCB) design with four replicates. Data were recorded for two years. Heritabilities for all traits were moderate to high using variance components estimated from males. With the exception of heritability estimates for YLD and ALP, all other traits were not significantly different from zero using female variance components as estimators. Pooled estimates of heritability yielded more reasonable estimates with lowest heritability for BET (h² = 0. 57 ± 0. 19) and highest for COL (h² = 0. 89 ± 0. 02). Pooled estimates of genetic correlations ranged from r = 0. 28 (ALP and YLD) to r = 0. 92 (YLD and XAN). Finally, correlations between coefficients of coancestry (COA) between pairs and their respective mean offspring data were significant for ALP, COL, and XAN suggesting that for these traits at least, COA values may be predictive of potential heterosis. On the basis of these data, selection for COL, ALP, and YLD would be successful using simple selection protocols such as phenotypic recurrent or mass selection. The likelihood of success when selecting for BET and XAN would be low, thus requiring one of the genotypic recurrent selection techniques. Selection against COH (a negative factor in brewing) appears problematic because of positive correlations with all other traits. The information presented in this study is the first published record of field-based estimates of narrow-sense heritability and genetic correlations in hop and will aid hop breeders working with these traits...|$|E
40|$|Microbial oral {{diseases}} such as caries and periodontitis {{are among the most}} frequent human infections. Conventional chemical antiseptics used for their treatment and prevention often produce adverse side-effects, which restrict their long-term use. Although plants are considered as perspective sources of novel antimicrobial compounds, little is still known about their inhibitory properties against oral pathogens and about their safety while used on a daily basis. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate in vitro growth-inhibitory effects of ethanol Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS) plant and supercritical CO 2 hop extracts on planktonic cultures of cariogenic, periodontal and candidal human pathogens, namely Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Bifidobacterium dentium, B. longum, Candida albicans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius subsp. salivarius and S. sobrinus using the broth microdilution method. The findings showed that ethanol extracts of all 109 GRAS plant species inhibited the growth of at least one microorganism under study with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) equal or lower than 4096 ug/mL. However, only six of them possessed very interesting antiseptic potential against the oral pathogens with MIC < 100 ug/mL. Additionally, three GRAS plant species showed good inhibitory activity with MIC = 128 ug/mL. As far as the particular results are concerned, the best antiseptic effect was observed for both Humulus lupulus CO 2 supercritical and ethanol extracts that inhibited the growth of all microorganisms at MICs higher or equal to 8 ug/mL and MICs higher or equal to 16 ug/mL, respectively. Hence, the CO 2 supercritical extraction proved to be superior for extraction of active constituents of H. lupulus. Further, the ethanol extracts of Capsicum annuum and C. frutescens showed significant antiseptic potential against S. sobrinus and S. salivarius (MICs from 64 to 128 ug/mL). The oral streptococci were also inhibited by Zanthoxylum clava-herculis (MIC higher or equal to 64 ug/mL), Helichrysum angustifolium and Myristica fragrans (MIC higher or equal to 128 ug/mL) which further showed the antimicrobial activity against F. nucleatum (MIC = 64 ug/mL). Interesting inhibitory effects exhibited an extract of Punica granatum against C. albicans (MIC = 128 ug/mL) and F. nucleatum (MIC = 64 ug/mL). Moreover, the growth of F. nucleatum was inhibited by extracts of Pimenta officinalis and Thea sinensis (MIC = 128 ug/mL). The chemical analysis of the CO 2 supercritical H. lupulus extracts revealed that alpha and beta bitter acids represented the two major groups of constituents. Cohumulone was the predominant compound of the alpha acids, whereas <b>colupulone</b> was the prevalent constituent of the beta acids. Our results suggest that the six GRAS plant species, namely C. annuum, C. frutescens, H. lupulus, M. fragrans, P. granatum and Z. clava-herculis have good potential to become new safe antiseptic agents that might be used for incorporation into oral care products such as toothpastes and mouthrinses...|$|E
