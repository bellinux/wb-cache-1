2500|$|In his {{encyclopedia}} {{published in}} the late 1950s, Aref al-Aref wrote: [...] "How <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> it but Nakba? When we the Arab people generally and the Palestinians particularly, faced such a disaster (Nakba) that we never faced like it along the centuries, our homeland was sealed, we [...] expelled from our country, and we lost many of our beloved sons." [...] Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari also used the term Nakba {{in the title of}} his book [...] "Sir al Nakba" [...] (The Secret behind the Disaster) written in 1955. After the Six-Day War in 1967, Zureiq wrote another book, [...] "The New Meaning of the Disaster," [...] but the term Nakba is reserved for the 1948 war.|$|E

2500|$|The musical {{opens in}} Marietta, Georgia, {{in the time}} of the American Civil War. The sounds of drums herald the {{appearance}} of a young Confederate soldier, bidding farewell to his sweetheart as he goes to fight for his homeland. The years pass and suddenly it is 1913. The young soldier has become an old one-legged veteran who is preparing to march in the annual Confederate Memorial Day parade ("The Old Red Hills of Home"). As the Parade begins ("The Dream of Atlanta"), Leo Frank, a Yankee Jew from Brooklyn, NYC, is deeply uncomfortable in the town in which he works and lives, feeling out of place due to his Judaism and his college education ("How <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> This Home?"). His discomfort is present even in his relationship with his wife, Lucille, who has planned an outdoor meal spoiled by Leo’s decision to go into work on a holiday. [...] Meanwhile, two local teens, Frankie Epps and Mary Phagan, ride a trolley car and flirt. [...] Frankie wants Mary to go to the picture show with him, but Mary playfully resists, insisting her mother will not let her ("The Picture Show"). [...] Mary leaves to collect her pay from the pencil factory managed by Frank.|$|E
2500|$|Some thinkers like neuroscientist and philosopher Adina Roskies {{think these}} studies can still only show, unsurprisingly, that {{physical}} {{factors in the}} brain are involved before decision making. In contrast, Haggard believes that [...] "We feel we choose, but we don't". Researcher John-Dylan Haynes adds [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> a will 'mine' if I don't even know when it occurred and what it has decided to do?". Philosophers Walter Glannon and Alfred Mele think some scientists are getting the science right, but misrepresenting modern philosophers. This is mainly because [...] "free will" [...] can mean many things: It is unclear what someone means when they say [...] "free will does not exist". Mele and Glannon say that the available research is more evidence against any dualistic notions of free will – but that is an [...] "easy target for neuroscientists to knock down". Mele says that most discussions of free will are now had in materialistic terms. In these cases, [...] "free will" [...] means something more like [...] "not coerced" [...] or that [...] "the person could have done otherwise at the last moment". The existence {{of these types of}} free will is debatable. Mele agrees, however, that science will continue to reveal critical details about {{what goes on in the}} brain during decision making.|$|E
