5000|$|Air (or other gas) {{pressure}} {{is the power}} source for pneumatic valve actuators. They are used on linear or quarter-turn valves. Air pressure acts on a piston or bellows diaphragm creating linear force on a valve stem. Alternatively, a quarter-turn vane-type actuator produces torque to provide rotary motion to operate a quarter-turn valve. A pneumatic actuator may be arranged to be spring-closed or spring-opened, with air pressure overcoming the spring to provide movement. A [...] "double acting" [...] actuator use air applied to different inlets to move the valve in the opening or closing direction. A central compressed air system can provide the <b>clean,</b> <b>dry,</b> compressed <b>air</b> needed for pneumatic actuators.

50|$|Approximately 100 {{million metric}} tons of oxygen are {{produced}} yearly. Oxygen is most commonly produced by fractional distillation, in which air is cooled to a liquid, then warmed, allowing all the components of air except for oxygen to turn to gases and escape. Fractionally distilling air several times can produce 99.5% pure oxygen. Another method with which oxygen is produced is to send a stream of <b>dry,</b> <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> through a bed of molecular sieves made of zeolite, which absorbs the nitrogen in the air, leaving 90 to 93% pure oxygen.|$|R
5000|$|Oil mist {{lubrication}} oils {{are applied to}} rolling element (antifriction) bearings as an oil mist. Neither oil rings nor constant level lubricators are used in pumps and drivers connected to plant-wide oil mist systems.

The oil mist, actually a ratio of one volume of oil suspended or carried in 200,000 volumes of <b>clean,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>air,</b> moves in a piping system (header).

5000|$|Another sample {{extraction}} {{method used}} in industrial sources and utility sources with low emission rates, is {{commonly referred to}} as the [...] "hot dry" [...] extractive method or [...] "direct" [...] CEMS. The sample is not diluted, but is carried along a heated sample line at high temperature into a sample conditioning unit. The sample is filtered to remove particulate matter and dried, usually with a chiller, to remove moisture. Once conditioned, the sample enters a sampling manifold and is measured using the same methods above. One advantage of this method is the ability to measure % oxygen in the sample, which is often required in the regulatory calculations for emission corrections. Since dilution mixes <b>clean</b> <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> with the sample, dilution systems cannot measure % oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the {{compressed}} air is first filtered with a high-quality coalescing filter. This filter removes liquid water, oil and particulate from {{the compressed}} air. The water vapor-laden air then {{passes through the}} center bore of hollow fibers in the membrane bundle. At the same time, {{a small portion of}} the dry air product is redirected along the outside surface of the fibers to sweep out the water vapor which has permeated the membrane. The moisture-laden sweep gas is then vented to the atmosphere, and <b>clean,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> is supplied to the application. The membrane air dryers are designed to operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Membrane air dryers are quiet, reliable and require no electricity to operate.|$|E

50|$|A {{small sample}} of flue gas is extracted, {{by means of a}} pump, into the CEM system via a sample probe. Facilities that combust fossil fuels often use a dilution-extractive probe to dilute the sample with <b>clean,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> to a ratio {{typically}} between 50:1 to 200:1, but usually 100:1. Dilution is used because pure flue gas can be hot, wet and, with some pollutants, sticky. Once diluted to the appropriate ratio, the sample is transported through a sample line (typically referred to as an umbilical) to a manifold from which individual analyzers may extract a sample. Gas analyzers employ various techniques to accurately measure concentrations. Some commonly used techniques include: infrared and ultraviolet adsorption, chemiluminescence, fluorescence and beta ray absorption. After analysis, the gas exits the analyzer to a common manifold to all analyzers where it is vented out of doors. A Data Acquisition and Handling System (DAHS) receives the signal output from each analyzer in order to collect and record emissions data.|$|E

5000|$|Ratings {{found in}} {{centrifugal}} fan performance tables and curves {{are based on}} standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM). Fan manufacturers define standard air as <b>clean,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> with a density of 0.075 pounds mass per cubic foot, with the atmospheric pressure at sea level of 29.92 inches of mercury and a temperature of 70°F. Selecting a centrifugal fan to operate at conditions other than standard air requires adjustment to both static pressure and brake horsepower. The volume of air will not be affected in a given system because a fan will move {{the same amount of}} air regardless of the air density. [...] If a centrifugal fan is to operate at a non-standard density, then corrections must be made to static pressure and brake horsepower. At higher than standard elevation, usually sea level, and higher than standard temperature (70°F), air density is lower than standard density (0.075 pounds per cubic foot). Centrifugal fans that are specified for continuous operation at higher temperatures need to be selected taking into account air density corrections. Again, a centrifugal fan is a constant volume device that will move the same amount of air at two different temperatures.|$|E
