5|$|Most organisms {{studied to}} date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their {{behavior}} to seek food sources or to avoid dangers. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a {{specific set of}} brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected areas {{at the base of the}} forebrain. The basal ganglia are the <b>central</b> <b>site</b> at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.|$|E

40|$|Although {{crucial for}} guiding {{vegetation}} improvement efforts, soil seed bank (SSB) and extant vegetation (EV) in dry valleys remains poorly understood. A germination method and field surveys {{were applied to}} address this problem and investigate the characteristics of SSB and corresponding EV of eight sites across the dry Minjiang River valley in Southwest China. Furthermore, the relationships between SSB and EV were compared to provide guidance for vegetation enhancement. Eight sites were classified into two groups - <b>central</b> and transitional <b>sites</b> that differ according to moisture conditions. Seed density and species richness in SSB were lower in less moist <b>central</b> <b>sites</b> compared with those in more moist transitional sites of the valley as well as the coverage of the community. Moreover, species richness and litter thickness were lower in <b>central</b> <b>sites.</b> Comparing SSB strategies of species from eight sites, transient strategy was the most frequently observed category, followed by short-term persistent and long-term persistent strategies. In terms of both SSB and EV, the most abundant life forms were hemicryptophytes, intermediate phanerophytes, and therophytes, whereas less abundant were chamaephytes and cryptophytes. Low Sorenson's similarity indices (22 - 32 %) and significantly negative Kendall's correlation in species composition indicate that species composition of SSB was not closely related to corresponding EV for each of the eight sites. Low seed density, especially the lack of viable dominant shrub seeds, dominant transient SSB strategy species, and low correspondence in species composition between SSB and EV imply that the potential for vegetation enhancement in the dry valley is weak, particularly in less moist <b>central</b> <b>sites.</b> To preserve the good EV of more moist transitional sites and introduce seeds of dominant species to improve poor EV in <b>central</b> <b>sites,</b> EV {{is likely to be a}} feasible standard for improving vegetation in dry valleys.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} may {{challenge the}} sustainability of societies. This Third Semester essay in Archaeology deals with some <b>central</b> <b>sites</b> in Scandinavia during the Migration Period (c. AD 400 — 600). The research question is in what way these centres were affected by the sudden climate change in AD 536 — 37, and the Justinian pest of AD 541. There are indications that certain places maintained or even increased their power and wealth after the crisis. It is suggested that this development partly was due to an availability of land deserted during the disasters, but also a consequence of political processes already in progress. – The author is a Swedish retired social anthropologist and international development worker.

25|$|In 2001, North Dakota {{became the}} first U.S. state to pass {{regulations}} allowing retail pharmacies to operate without requiring a pharmacist to be physically present. The next year, state agencies and grants established the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project, which now supports more than fifty remote retail and hospital pharmacy sites throughout North Dakota. In this program, a licensed pharmacist at a <b>central</b> <b>site</b> communicates with remote site pharmacy technicians and patients through videoconferencing. A 2004 study of the program found that telepharmacy delivered the same quality of pharmacy services as traditional facilities, and {{a study of the}} operation of one North Dakota telepharmacy business from 2002 through 2004 found that, while medication inventory turnover was lower than the industry average, the remote sites were able to be operated profitably. The success and expansion of this program were an inspiration and model for programs and laws in other states.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown clear, {{predictable}} successional trends in habitat characteristics and community structure in tubeworm aggregations at 3 similar hydrocarbon-seep <b>sites</b> on the <b>central</b> upper Louisiana slope of the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, we examine these trends in quantitative community collections from 7 additional hydrocarbon-seep sites widely distributed in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The relative proportions and sizes of Lamellibrachia luymesi and Seepiophila jonesi in tubeworm aggregations were similar at new and <b>central</b> <b>sites,</b> though S. jonesi dominated some collections from new sites, a situation not previously observed at <b>central</b> <b>sites.</b> In general, sulfide declined with increasing aggregation age (average size of tubeworms), {{but there was more}} variability in this trend at the new sites. Tubeworm-associated community composition was similar at new and <b>central</b> <b>sites,</b> with only a few rare species collected at the new sites for the first time. The most significant differences in the communities at new sites were the lower relative abundance of various gastropod species, and the absence of gastropods from collections made at the Viosca Knoll site. This community type was largely restricted to young aggregations at new sites that were more isolated from other tubeworm aggregations and consisted of higher proportions of S. jonesi. As succession proceeds from young to old aggregations, many of the previously described processes were apparent at the new sites including a reduction in biomass and a shift in trophic structure from endemic primary consumers to non-endemic higher order predators. Regardless of community composition in young aggregations, succession converges on similar late-stage community types...|$|R

We presented emotional pictures and self-referential stimuli (stimuli that accelerate and improve processing and improve memory of information related to an individual’s self-concept) in sequence.

ERP results showed that the target stimuli elicited larger P 2 amplitudes under neutral conditions than under negative emotional conditions. Under neutral conditions, N 2 amplitudes for highly self-relevant names (target stimulus) were smaller than those for any other names. Under negative emotional conditions, highly and moderately self-referential stimuli activated smaller N 2 amplitudes. P 3 amplitudes activated by self-referential processing under negative emotional conditions were smaller than neutral conditions. In the left and <b>central</b> <b>sites,</b> highly self-relevant names activated larger P 3 amplitudes than any other names.

2500|$|The {{organizers}} of the New York Public Library, wanting an imposing main branch, chose a <b>central</b> <b>site</b> available at the two-block section of Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets.

Following a competition among the city's most prominent architects, Carrère and Hastings was selected to design and construct the building. The cornerstone was laid in May 1902, and the building's completion was expected to be in three years.

The circular Radio <b>Central</b> <b>site</b> encompassed 10 square miles (25 square kilometers), with a transmission building, located at the hub, projected to ultimately house ten Alexanderson alternator transmitters. The plan called for 12 [...] "antenna spokes" [...] to be built, stretching out in all directions from the center. Each spoke was nearly three miles (4.8 kilometers) long, and consisted of sixteen wires supported by a line of six 410-foot-tall (125 meter) towers topped with 150-foot-wide (45 meter) crossbars. Construction began in July 1920, and the site was dedicated on November 5, 1921, after two of the antenna spokes had been completed, {{and two of the}} 200-kilowatt alternators installed.
