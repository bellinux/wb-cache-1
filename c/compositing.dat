5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen <b>compositing,</b> opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, {{and would make}} sense for elements such as the Enterprises bridge viewer, where <b>compositing</b> would lack the softness of a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the animatics cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E
5|$|Software {{packages}} that were primarily used are 3ds Max (for modeling, lighting, rendering), Softimage (for rigging and animation), Digital Fusion (for <b>compositing),</b> Real Flow (for fluid dynamics), Sony Vegas (for editorial), Zbrush and Mudbox (for organic modeling), and VRAY (for rendering).|$|E

40|$|The {{coating of}} {{nanosized}} Chitosan/TiO 2 <b>composit</b> on cotton fabrics substrate and its performance for dye of Rhodamine B was studied. Nanosized Chitosan/TiO 2 <b>composit</b> coated on cotton fabrics {{was done by}} dip-coating method through pad-dry-cure technic. Cotton fabric thats was coated by nanosized Chitosan/TiO 2 <b>composit</b> was characterized by SEM, XRD, and FTIR. Photodegradation Performance test of cotton fabric coated Nanosized Chitosan/TiO 2 <b>composit</b> for dye of Rhodamine B was done under UV ray and sun ray.   It was concluded that was cotton fabric coated nanosized Chitosan/TiO 2 can decompose dye of Rhodamine B with UV ray more effective than sun ray.

5|$|The beam {{of light}} seen shining from beneath the UFO in the episode was {{achieved}} by <b>compositing</b> several shots together, with elements including a crane carrying a spotlight—borrowed from the Canadian Coast Guard—and the spray from an aerosol combined to create the final shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Sarah {{encounters}} the Fire Gang {{had to be}} altered in post-production {{as it had been}} filmed against black velvet cloth, to disguise the puppeteers, and a new forest background was added behind. Jim Henson was unhappy with the <b>compositing</b> of the finished scene, although he considered the puppetry featured in it worthy of inclusion.|$|E
5|$|In one Vietnam War scene, Gump carries Bubba {{away from}} an {{incoming}} napalm attack. To create the effect, stunt actors were initially used for <b>compositing</b> purposes. Then, Hanks and Williamson were filmed, with Williamson supported by a cable wire as Hanks ran with him. The explosion was then filmed, and the actors were digitally added to appear {{just in front of}} the explosions. The jet fighters and napalm canisters were also added by CGI.|$|E
40|$|The terms {{recycling}} and material <b>composit</b> are discussed first.

5|$|The 24-man {{animation}} {{team was}} {{split into two}} groups. Half {{were assigned to the}} creation of the 15 new CGI creatures populating noitulovE (in Maya), while the other half created the backgrounds (in Houdini). <b>Compositing</b> work – combining the greenscreen shots with stock footage and CGI elements – was performed in Flame and Inferno. As the final commercial was to be shown on cinema screens, the animators worked at a resolution higher than that afforded by the 576i definition used by British PAL-encoded television sets, to improve the appearance of the advert when projected.|$|E
5|$|The Stargazer was to {{originally}} {{be represented}} by the movie-era Enterprise model, but producers were convinced to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's ready room in the series pilot. Several camera and <b>compositing</b> techniques were used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard {{the bridge of the}} Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge set.|$|E
5|$|The art {{department}} {{made sure}} that the 2035 underground world would only use pre-1996 technology {{as a means to}} depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft, and Crispian Sallis (set decorator) went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets. The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio that Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston (The Golden Compass, Casino Royale). Additional digital <b>compositing</b> was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.|$|E

5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and <b>compositing</b> system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
5|$|The Little Mermaid vigorously relaunched a {{profound}} {{new interest in}} the animation and musical film genres. The film {{was also the first}} to feature the use of Disney's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, which had grown into a commercial computer animation and technology development company, CAPS would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer-generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint and <b>compositing</b> techniques. The Little Mermaid was {{the first of a series}} of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated by the term Disney Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The film also {{features}} extensive miniature effect shots provided by 32TEN Studios, {{under the supervision}} of ILM VFX Producer Susan Greenhow and ILM VFX Supervisors John Knoll and Lindy DeQuattro. Shot using RED Epic cameras on 3D rigs, the scenes produced by 32TEN involved the creation of a quarter-scale office building interior which was destroyed by the fist of a Jaeger robot which was on a separate pneumatically controlled rig, as well as a sequence which depicted several rows of seats in a soccer stadium being blown apart as a Jaeger lands in the stadium, which was created by using quarter-scale seats blown apart by air cannons. Additionally 32TEN provided several practical elements for ILM’s <b>compositing</b> team including dust clouds, breaking glass and water effects.|$|E

50|$|Though {{this is true}} for Microsoft's {{implementation}} of a <b>composited</b> desktop under Windows Vista, on the other hand, a <b>composited</b> desktop need not theoretically require a new display driver model to work as expected. Successful implementations of <b>composited</b> desktops were done before Windows Vista on other platforms such as Quartz, Compiz, WindowFX. The approach Microsoft attempted was to try to make sure WDDM was a unified experience across different GPUs from multiple vendors by standardizing their features and performance. The software features missing from other driver models could be made immaterial by extensions or if a less restrictive or simply different driver model was in place.|$|R
5|$|The film's animators {{had little}} {{experience}} with computer-animation and feature-length films, {{and had to}} be trained by the producers {{over the course of the}} film's production. Since none of the animators were specialists, they were not divided into specific teams, but instead each worked on all areas of the animating process. The filmmakers found this to be a poor method though, because it kept the individual skills of the animators from being optimized. Due to their independent backgrounds, the animators were accustomed to working at fast paces, and despite their small numbers, each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time. Still, schedule and budget restraints led the filmmakers to enlist Prana Studios in Mumbai, India to perform lighting and <b>compositing.</b>|$|E
5|$|With filming complete, MJZ {{contacted}} post-production company Asylum {{to begin}} work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life. The team, led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach, tripled in size as {{the scale of the}} work required became apparent, given the deadline of three weeks. Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy, requiring the creation of only minor elements such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors. The same was true for the training sequence, where only minimal tracking work and <b>compositing</b> of matte backgrounds was required. The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence. This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting and reflections from visors and armor, to particle effects for the background smoke and dust, plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games. The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies. While the Brute was partially animatronic, substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost twice the size and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made. Other elements, such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop-pods, were created entirely through the use of CGI. Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for <b>compositing,</b> Maya for animation, RenderMan and Mantra for rendering, SynthEyes for tracking, Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work.|$|E
5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen <b>compositing</b> work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E

5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. <b>Compositing</b> miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} of the Stumpf was filmed using an actual New Orleans ferry in {{a portion of the}} Mississippi River sectioned off especially for the event; the occurrence took over four hours to prepare. Under the supervision of pyrotechnics expert John Frazier, the ferry was coated entirely with fire retardant and rigged with fifty gasoline bombs including black dirt and diesel, each one set to detonate within a five-second range. People and cars were added in later as elements of computer-generated graphics. Chris Lebenzon was largely responsible for moving clips from each of the sixteen cameras in place to create the sensation of an extended explosion sequence. The spectacular explosion actually caused no significant structural damage to the ferry; after a bout of sandblasting and repainting, the ferry was very similar to its previous state. The ferry was returned into service four days after the production of the film's scene concluded. During filming of the underwater car scenes, actual cars were dropped into the water; computer-generated effects were later added, simulating the entities' explosions. <b>Compositing</b> was done on the Autodesk Inferno special effects program.|$|E
