Rainbow holography makes use of <b>common</b> <b>white</b> <b>light</b> to visualize holograms rather than lasers, thereby leading [...] "holography out of the lab". This type of hologram is commonly seen as the dove on the VISA card. The first rainbow hologram, termed [...] "Motif 1," [...] was presented on a 4-by-5-inch glass plate. It consisted of three chess pieces illuminated by a single white light bulb. Dr. Benton first presented his invention to the optical society in California in 1968. This discovery was also {{of great interest to}} the artistic community, as [...] "fiercely bright images which could be manipulated in an artistic context were observed". Since the rainbow hologram was very easy to mass-produce, today, credit card companies and state agencies widely make use of rainbow holograms to deter counterfeiting of credit cards and identification cards.|$|E

40|$|Male firemouth cichlids, Cichlasoma meeki, have red {{pigmentation}} covering {{large areas}} of their ventral surface, which is displayed during aggressive interactions. We manipulated the levels of red pigmentation by assigning the fish {{to one of two}} diets, which were as similar as possible except that one was high in carotenoids while the other was low in carotenoids. During diadic trials under <b>white</b> <b>light,</b> fish kept on the high carotenoid diet won a higher proportion of contests than fish kept on the low carotenoid diet. Under green light, where differences in redness cannot be discriminated, there was no effect of diet on the outcome of contests. These experiments demonstrate that it is the effect of the diet on red pigmentation that is important rather than some confounding variable such as differential growth rates. The weight of the two fish was also important; there was a tendency for the heavier fish to win more contests. The mass effect was subordinate to color under <b>white</b> <b>light</b> but was the dominant factor under green light. The nature of the contests under the different light conditions also varied; the display in which the red pigmentation is most obvious was not used under green light, but was <b>common</b> under <b>white</b> <b>light.</b> This suggests that the display strategies are flexible and can be altered according to which displays are most effective in a given environment. Previous studies of other species of fish and birds have shown that the degree of redness influences mate choice and is affected by parasite infestations. We propose that carotenoid pigmentation is likely to reflect a general quality, influenced by several factors, rather than a context-specific quality such as fighting ability.

40|$|Background: Bright light therapy, an {{effective}} therapeutic option for depressive adults, could provide safe, economic, and effective rapid recovery also in adolescents. Method: This was a randomized cross-over trial, i. e. that 14 patients received first dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> (50 lux) one {{hour a day}} for one week and then Bright light therapy (2500 Lux) for one week. 14 patients received first Bright light therapy and then dim <b>white</b> <b>light.</b> For assessment of depressive symptoms, Beck depression inventory scales were administered 1 week before and one day before dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment, on the day between dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> and bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment, {{on the day after}} bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment and one week after bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment.

The result is a photograph that has the capability of registering all the views of an object in a continuous sequence, which is called holophotography and was previously obtained by means of a hologram.

We also show the existence of orthoscopic (normal depth) images within the same system, constituting a direct image system whose appearance resembles a holographic image.
