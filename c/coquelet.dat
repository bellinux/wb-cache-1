5000|$|Bernard <b>Coquelet</b> {{argues that}} the [...] "groove is the way an {{experienced}} musician will play a rhythm compared with {{the way it is}} written (or would be written)" [...] by playing slightly [...] "before or after the beat." [...] <b>Coquelet</b> claims that the [...] "notion of groove actually has to do with aesthetics and style"; [...] "groove is an artistic element, that is to say human,...and [...] "it will evolve depending on the harmonic context, the place in the song, the sound of the musician's instrument, and, in interaction with the groove of the other musicians", which he calls [...] "collective" [...] groove." [...] Minute rhythmic variations by the rhythm section members such as the bass player can dramatically change the feel as a band plays a song, even for a simple singer-songwriter groove.|$|E

It is sometimes also called spring chicken, although the term spring chicken usually refers to chickens weighing 750 - 850 g. The word is the French language term for the same thing. Normally a portion is a whole poussin per person.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} {{site for}} the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene AnTat 1. 3 A of Trypanosoma brucei is 45 kilobases long and encompasses seven expression site-associated genes (ESAGs) (E. Pays, P. Tebabi, A. Pays, H. <b>Coquelet,</b> P. Revelard, D. Salmon, and M. Steinert, Cell 57 : 835 - 845, 1989). After UV irradiation, several large transcripts from the putative promoter region were strongly enriched. We report that one such major transcript starts near the poly(A) addition site of the first gene (ESAG 7), spans the intergenic region, and extends to the poly(A) addition site of the second gene (ESAG 6), thus bypassing the normal 3 ' splice site of the ESAG 6 mRNA. Since this transcript is spliced, we conclude that UV irradiation does not inhibit splicing but stabilizes unstable processing products. This demonstrates {{that at least some}} intergenic regions of the VSG gene expression site are continuously transcribed in accordance with a polycistronic transcription model.
