40|$|Abstract. Because {{the dynamic}} soft {{reduction}} of continuous casting process {{is based on}} the computation of the solidification end point, using model to simulating the steel solidificating process is more and more interesting. Especially, the influence of the heat flux to the solidification end point is needed to research thoroughly. In this paper the heat transfer model for the simulation of the solidification of steel droplet is established. The simulation reveals that the steel droplet (the radium is 7. 2 mm) is solidified quickly in 4. 3 seconds on water <b>cooling</b> copper <b>plate,</b> and in 3 seconds there is half of the droplet is frozen to solid. If there are materials resisting heat transfer inserted between <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> and liquid <b>steel,</b> the solidification end position would be moved to the deeper place below the shell in obvious extent, and the influence of heat flux to the ratio of mushy zone is weaker than that to solidification end point position...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{accelerated}} <b>cooling</b> of <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> is {{an already}} standard process {{that increases the}} competitiveness of this product and their users, as it allows {{the adoption of a}} leaner alloy design and the development of new mechanical property combinations with improved weldability. The maximum cooling rate achievable under industrial conditions depends on plate thickness, from 80 °C/s � 10 mm � to about 1 °C/s � 80 mm�, in order to assure minimum temperature gradients along plate thickness and greater uniformity of mechanical properties. The main process variants of this process apply cooling over different temperature ranges: interrupted accelerated cooling, between 800 and 500 °C, and direct quenching, between 900 and 200 °C. In the first case it is aimed at a microstructural grain refining effect; in the latter one a fully martensitic microstructure is desired. The advantages promoted by these new process routes are already benefiting the main fields of application of heavy <b>steel</b> <b>plates,</b> like shipbuilding, civil construction, linepipes, penstocks, and so on.

40|$|To provide uniform cooling for a {{fuel cell}} stack, a <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> concept was evaluated. This concept {{utilized}} thin <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> to extract heat from the interior of {{a fuel cell}} stack and move this heat to a cooling manifold where it can be transferred to an external cooling fluid. The advantages of this cooling approach include a reduced number of ancillary components and the ability to directly utilize an external cooling fluid loop for cooling the fuel cell stack. A number of different types of <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> and manifolds were developed. The <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> consisted of two main types; a plate based on thermopyrolytic graphite (TPG) and a planar (or flat plate) heat pipe. The plates, along with solid metal control samples, were tested for both thermal and electrical conductivity. To transfer heat from the <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> to the <b>cooling</b> fluid, a number of manifold designs utilizing various materials were devised, constructed, and tested. A key aspect of the manifold was {{that it had to be}} electrically nonconductive so it would not short out the fuel cell stack during operation. Different manifold and <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> configurations were tested in a vacuum chamber to minimize convective heat losses. <b>Cooling</b> <b>plates</b> were placed in the grooves within the manifolds and heated with surface-mounted electric pad heaters. The plate temperature and its thermal distribution were recorded for all tested combinations of manifold cooling flow rates and heater power loads. This testing simulated the performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>plates</b> and manifold within an operational fuel cell stack. Different types of control valves and control schemes were tested and evaluated based on their ability to maintain a constant temperature of the <b>cooling</b> <b>plates.</b> The control valves regulated the cooling fluid flow through the manifold, thereby controlling the heat flow to the cooling fluid.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about flow {{analysis}} and improvement, {{with the help}} of CFD software, of heat exchange in a <b>cooling</b> <b>plate.</b> CFD software is a simulation tool that treats different types of flows and facilitates the testing of models. It is a numerical method to approximately solve various issues concerning flow. ScandiNova Systems AB, Uppsala, uses a heat exchanger, developed by themselves, in the smaller modulators. There is a tank containing transformer, electrical components and oil. When the transformer gets warm during operation, it emits heat to the oil in the tank. The oil flows through a <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> {{with the help of}} a pump to be cooled, which in turn cools the transformer. The results of the CFD analysis showed that the company's existing <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> was not utilized in the best way because the oil was not distributed evenly over the channels in the <b>cooling</b> <b>plate.</b> The channels in the <b>cooling</b> <b>plate</b> was redesigned which led to a more efficient heat exchange.
