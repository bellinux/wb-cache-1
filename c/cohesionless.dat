50|$|When the {{gravitational}} force {{acting on a}} slope exceeds its resisting force, slope failure (mass wasting) occurs. The slope material's strength and cohesion {{and the amount of}} internal friction between material help maintain the slope's stability and are known collectively as the slope's shear strength.

50|$|A river bank can {{be divided}} into three zones: Toe zone, bank zone, and overbank area. The toe zone is the area which is most {{susceptible}} to erosion. Because it is located in between the ordinary water level and the low water level, it is strongly affected by currents and erosional events. The bank zone is above the ordinary high water level, but can still be effected periodically by currents, and gets the most human and animal traffic. The overbank area is inland of both the toe and bank zones, and can be classified as either a floodplain or a bluff, depending on its slope. A river bank will respond to erosional activity based on the characteristics of the bank material. The most common type of bank is a stratified or interstratified bank, which consists of <b>cohesionless</b> layers interbedded with cohesive layers. If the cohesive soil is at the toe of the bank, it will control the retreat rate of the overlying layer. If the <b>cohesionless</b> soil is at the toe of the bank, these layers are not protected by the layers of cohesive soil. A Bedrock bank is usually very stable and will experience gradual erosion. A cohesive bank is highly susceptible to erosion in times of lowering water levels due to its low permeability. Failures in cohesive soils will be in rotational or planar failure surfaces, while in non-cohesive soils failures will be in an avalanche fashion.|$|E

50|$|Geotechnical failure usually occurs due to {{stresses}} on {{the bank}} exceeding the forces the bank can accommodate. One example is oversaturation of the bank following a lowering of the water level from the floodplain to normal bank levels. Pore water pressure in the saturated bank reduces the frictional shear strength of the soil and increases sliding forces. This type of failure is most common in fine grained soils because they cannot drain as rapidly as coarse grained soils. This can be accentuated if the banks had already been destabilized due to erosion of <b>cohesionless</b> sands, which undermines the bank material and leads to bank collapse. If the bank has been exposed to freeze thaw, tension cracks may lay lead to bank failure. Subsurface moisture weakens internal shear. Capillary action can also decrease the angle of repose of the bank to less than the existing bank slope. This oversteepens the slope {{and can lead to}} collapse when the soil dries.|$|E
50|$|Liquefied/fluidized flow - Form in <b>cohesionless</b> {{granular}} substances. As grains at {{the base}} of a suspension settle out, fluid that is displaced upward by the settling generates pore fluid pressures that may help suspend grains in the upper part of the flow. Application of an external pressure to the suspension will initiate flow. This external pressure can be applied by a seismic shock, which may transform loose sand into a highly viscous suspension as in quicksand. Generally as soon as the flow begins to move, fluid turbulence results and the flow rapidly evolves into a turbidity current. Flows and suspensions are said to be liquefied when the grains settle downward through the fluid and displace the fluid upwards. By contrast, flows and suspensions are said to fluidized when the fluid moves upward through the grains, thereby temporarily suspending them. Most flows are liquefied, and many references to fluidized sediment gravity flows are in fact incorrect and actually refer to liquefied flows.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{failure of}} a sloping ground due to static {{liquefaction}} occurs when the shear stress applied by a monotonic triggering load exceeds the undrained yield (peak) shear strength of the saturated liquefiable <b>cohesionless</b> soil. Current practices for determining the in-situ undrained yield strength for grounds subjected to static shear stress rely on either a suite of costly laboratory tests on undisturbed field samples or empirical correlations based on in-situ penetration tests, which fail {{to account for the}} effect of soil dilatancy in decreasing the degree of strain-softening and the brittleness of <b>cohesionless</b> soils with an increasing penetration resistance. In this study, the effect of soil dilatancy on the static liquefaction failure of <b>cohesionless</b> soils is characterized by an empirical relationship between the soil brittleness index and the undrained yield strength from a database of 813 laboratory shear tests collected from the past literature. The application of this relationship for estimating the static liquefaction-triggering strength of <b>cohesionless</b> soils under sloping ground conditions is validated by comparing several cases of liquefaction flow failures. Finally, a procedure is briefly demonstrated for evaluating the triggering of static liquefaction in a dyke to the north of Wachusett Dam and Duncan Dam which incorporates the dilatancy behavior of <b>cohesionless</b> soils in a semi-empirical procedure based on in-situ penetration tests...|$|E

The method includes a simplified model for the distribution of applied stresses with depth, incorporates certain experimental results concerning the stress-strain relation in <b>cohesionless</b> soils, and proposes a formula for selection of the effective depth below which the deformations can be considered negligible.

40|$|Temporary {{vertical}} excavations in <b>cohesionless</b> (granular soils) pose {{a problem}} for conventional ‘two-phase’ soil mechanics theory since non-zero collapse height is not predicted using the classical ‘dry/saturated’ shear strength criterion, given that <b>cohesionless</b> soils above the water table {{are assumed to be}} dry.
