50|$|The {{pieces are}} laid out to a design, similar to {{traditional}} stained-glass work. The pieces are laid {{on a bed of}} sand, bounded by a wooden <b>casting</b> <b>frame.</b> A matrix material, sand and cement or epoxy resin, is poured between the glass pieces and allowed to dry, typically requiring 24 hours to harden. The visible glass faces are then cleaned and the resulting solid panel can be relocated, embedded or hung as required.|$|E
50|$|Ganz {{recognized}} that {{to develop his}} factory {{he had to make}} products that are mass-produced. In 1846 the Pest-Vác railway line was built. In that time the European foundries made wrought iron rims for spoked wagon wheels. They poured the casts in shapes in the sand, and leave it there to cool down. Meanwhile, in the United States and England they used a better method, the chill casting which was invented by the Englishman John Burn in 1812. The essence of this process is if you cool down the cast faster, the metal will be harder, and wear-proofer. That is possible if the <b>casting</b> <b>frame</b> is made of a good heat conductor. Ganz could made one in 1853 for the first time. And he could also improve this method by using antimony. He got a patent for this invention in 1856.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe cost efficient, high {{throughput}} {{production of}} metal-and semiconductor alloys {{is the foundation}} of many advanced technologies. With the development of the Ribbon Growth on Substrate (RGS) technology, a new crystallization technique is available that allows the controlled, high crystallization rate production of silicon wafers and advanced metal-silicide alloys. Compared to other crystallization methods, such as melt spinning, the RGS process allows better crystallization control, high volume manufacturing and high material yield due to the substrate driven process. In order to optimize RGS further, insights from modelling the liquid metal in the <b>casting</b> <b>frame</b> under electromagnetic fields are very desirable. We performed numerical investigations in order to study the involved AC magnetic fields, which are {{an essential part of the}} RGS process to realize a magnetic retention effect. Our simulation results demonstrate the effect of the applied AC magnetic fields on the silicon melt flow. The main focus is thereby devoted to the simulation of the melt surface deformation based on a complex modelling approach. This time-dependent free-surface flow under the influence of magnetic forces is the key for optimizing the RGS process...|$|E

30|$|We {{routinely}} {{apply the}} body casts under general endotracheal anesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, a bite block is placed {{to protect the}} tongue and cheeks, {{as well as the}} tube, from accidental bite as traction is applied with a halter strap. A cast t-shirt is placed on the patient and two stacked towels are placed under the t-shirt to prevent the cast from being too tight. A stockinet may be used instead of the cast t-shirt. A towel is wrapped around the patient’s occiput and covers the ears as well as the eyes. This towel helps protect the ears from the pressure of the halter strap and is also useful to protect the face from the saw dust {{at the end of the}} procedure. Then, a halter strap is placed around the occiput and under the chin. Long straps are cut from a cloth wrap and placed around the patient’s waist above the iliac wings on both sides. These straps are placed over the cast t-shirt to prevent skin irritation during removal. The patient is then transferred onto the <b>cast</b> <b>frame.</b> Different <b>cast</b> <b>frames</b> are available commercially depending on the surgeon’s preference.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{locomotives}} {{were designed}} and built according to Soviet designs, the American plants implemented {{some of their own}} technologies, as well as changes in design of individual units. Thus, the plant Baldwin locomotives #2624 to Alco #2200 were issued with rocking grates. Most of the Еа and Ем locomotives were issued with bar frames, but some were released with <b>cast</b> <b>frames,</b> which included not only a sidewall with better fixtures, but cylinders integrated with the support for the boiler, the buffer timber with support for the truck, smaller tender coupling, brackets for balancing the spring suspension and brake support shaft. Also, the last thirteen locomotives built by ALCO, issued in 1947, were equipped with feedwater heaters. These 13 locomotives were given the designation Емв. In 1946, at the Yaroslavl locomotive plant, two locomotives were weighed: one was an Еа with bar frames, and the other was an Ем with a <b>cast</b> <b>frame.</b> It was found that the engine Е-2001, Е-2988 and Ем-3892 have common operating weights which were, respectively, 102.8, 99, 6, and 103.5 tonnes, and the adhesion weight was 91.2, 88.7 and 91.5 tonnes.|$|R

The locomotive was tested on the October Railway, based out of Moscow, where it was tested severely including pulling freight trains on passenger train schedules. Results proved to be positive, with the locomotive typically developing 2500-2600 hp or as high as 3077 hp at 86.4 km/h.

The whole work {{is divided into two}} sections. First section consists of the research including a brief mention of the grinding technology in the reference to the construction of the frame of the grinding machine. Further the work deals with the theoretical knowledge regarding construction of frames of the machine. Finally it describes issues related to the technology of polymer – concrete and the production technology of parts from this material. Second section of the work consists of an engineering proposal of polymer – concreted frame considering the requirement of the main functional dimensions related from the structural measures. Subsequently the system approach and the principals for transition to the polymer – concrete construction of the grinding machine are made. The work concludes with the analysis and comparison of the two concepts (<b>cast</b> iron <b>frame</b> and polymer – concrete) in the terms of the Finite element method...|$|R
