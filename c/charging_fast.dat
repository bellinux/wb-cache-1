40|$|The organisations {{cooperating}} in e‐harbours {{investigate the}} potential of electric transport (both on land and on water) for the harbour regions of North West Europe. Current types of electric vehicles still have a short driving range and limited possibilities, mainly caused by the shortcomings of the batteries applied. We need batteries that perform better, at lower costs per kWh of storage. This requires a technological breakthrough. Great investments are requested in other fields, like standardisation of techniques used, building a recharging infrastructure and developing a sound business case for that recharging infrastructure. Choices {{have to be made}} {{from a wide range of}} possibilities (slow <b>charging,</b> <b>fast</b> charging, battery swapping…) From an ecological point of view it is adamant that electric vehicles are powered by energy from renewable sources. When they use electricity from coal fuelled plants, their environmental performance is severely reduced. Harbour zones can be considered as more or less closed systems, providing an ideal environment for research and experimentation in the field of electric mobility. The e‐harbours project aims to progress the electric mobility agenda in European harbours by means of showcases in Zaanstad, Amsterdam, Malmö and the Shetland Islands.

30|$|Currently, two PEV {{charging}} modes {{are widely}} adopted: normal charging mode {{at home or}} parking lots with lower charging power level, and <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> mode at <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations with higher charging power level, the typical charging duration is 20 – 30  min [18]. Besides the charging power level, the characteristics of such two charging modes are also intrinsically different. When a PEV is driving to the destination but the SoC is too low to complete the rest trip, it should find a <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> station to get <b>charged</b> with the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> mode as soon as possible. However, the normal charging often happens when a PEV arrives at home or workplaces and it doesn’t hurry to get fully charged [19, 20].|$|R

30|$|Therefore, it {{is obvious}} that the PEV <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand is unpostponable and uninterruptible, but the PEVs with <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand can be {{scheduled}} to get charged in an optimal <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> station. The <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand of PEVs can be considered spatially schedulable but temporally unschedulable. On the contrary, the normal charging demand is interruptible, which can be shifted over time, but the charging place is totally fixed. The normal charging time can be scheduled to consume the DGs optimally with minimal cost, which means the normal charging demand can be considered temporally schedulable but spatially unschedulable.|$|R

40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{traditional}} slow charging loads, random integration of large scale <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> loads will exert more serious impacts on the security of power network operation. Besides, to maximize social benefits, effective scheduling strategies guiding <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> behaviors should be formulated rather than simply increasing infrastructure construction investments on the power grid. This paper first analyzes the charging users’ various responses to an elastic charging service fee, and introduces the index of charging balance degree to a target region by considering the influence of <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> loads on the power grid. Then, a multi-objective optimization model of the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> service fee is constructed, whose service fee can be further optimized by employing a fuzzy programming method. Therefore, both users’ satisfaction degree and the equilibrium of charging loads can be maintained simultaneously by reasonably guiding electric vehicles (EVs) to different <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations.

30|$|Norwegian EV owners suffer {{relatively}} little from range anxiety and are comfortable using on average 80 – 85  % of the battery’s range [13]. 65  % charge their vehicle daily, 20  % charge 3 – 5  days per week and another 15  % charge 1 – 2 {{times per week}} {{at home in a}} garage, carport or outdoor. Public normal charging is used at least monthly by about half the EV owners, and 7 – 14  % use it weekly. Workplace charging is more widely used than public charging. The average annual number of <b>fast</b> <b>charges</b> per vehicle is about 14. 27  % use fast chargers more than once per month, and 6  % are weekly users. EV-only owners use <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> more than owners in multicar households. Normal charging at public parking spaces is usually free.

Hence, necessary measures such as using local energy storage and voltage conditioning devices, such as SVC (Static Var Compensator), have to be used at the charging station to handle the problems.
