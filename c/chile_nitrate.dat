40|$|ABSTRACT: The Atacama Desert of South America {{contains}} the world’s only naturally occurring nitrate deposits. With {{the development of}} synthetic nitrate in Germany during WWI, <b>Chile’s</b> <b>nitrate</b> mining industry found itself overcapitalized and suffering {{from the effects of}} overproduction. By the end of the 1940 s the industry had all but collapsed. This paper will illustrate the impacts that over-reliance on primary exports has had on the desert landscape in the Tarapacá Region of northern Chile. Based on data compiled from the field and photo-interpretation a conservative estimate is that about 5 - 7 % of the desert (≈ 103, 000 acres) has been directly impacted by nitrate mining, nearly 174 million cubic yards of waste material generated, and over 100 processing plants abandoned. While the impacts on the landscape are substantial, the abandoned remains of the industry constitute an important cultural resource and offer a glimpse into the long-term effects of this failed economy of dependency...|$|R

Paleogeochemical deposits in northern Chile are {{a rich source}} of naturally occurring sodium <b>nitrate</b> (<b>Chile</b> saltpeter). These ores are mined to isolate NaNO 3 (16 ± 0 ± 0) for use as fertilizer. Coincidentally, these very same deposits are a natural source of perchlorate anion (ClO 4 �). At su�ciently high concentrations, perchlorate interferes with iodide uptake in the thyroid gland and has been used medicinally for this purpose. In 1997, perchlorate contamination was discovered in a number of US water supplies, including Lake Mead and the Colorado River. Subsequently, the Environmental Protection Agency added this species to the Contaminant Candidate List for drinking water and will begin assessing occurrence via the Unregulated Contaminants Monitoring Rule in 2001. E€ective risk assessment requires characterizing possible sources, including fertilizer. Samples were analyzed by ion chromatography and con®rmed by complexation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Within a lot, distribution of perchlorate is nearly homogeneous, presumably due to the manufacturing process. Two di€erent lots we analyzed di€ered by 15 %, containing an average of either 1. 5 or 1. 8 mg g � 1. Inadequate sample size can lead to incorrect estimations; 100 -g samples gave su�ciently consistent and reproducible results.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe Atacama {{region in}} {{northern}} Chile hosts the driest desert on Earth {{and is the}} world’s premier iodine production province. The origin of iodine enrichment in Atacama is controversial and fundamentally different processes have been invoked {{over the years that}} involve marine, eolian and more recently deep sedimentary fluid and groundwater sources. As a result of the very limited geochemical iodine data in Atacama and the western South American margin, the origin of iodine enrichment in this region still remains elusive. In this study, we present a comprehensive survey of iodine concentrations and isotopic ratios (129 I/I) of different reservoirs in the Atacama Desert of northern <b>Chile,</b> including <b>nitrate</b> soils, supergene copper deposits, marine sedimentary rocks, geothermal fluids, groundwater and meteoric water. Nitrate soils along the eastern slope of the Coastal Cordillera are found to have mean iodine concentrations of at least three orders of magnitude higher than the mean crustal abundances of 0. 12 ppm, with a mean concentration of 700 ppm. Soils above giant copper deposits in the Central Depression are also highly enriched in iodine (100 ’s of ppm range), and Cu-iodide and iodate minerals occur in the supergene enrichment zones of some of these deposits. Further east in the Precordillera, Jurassic sedimentary shales and limestones show above-background iodine concentrations, the latter averaging 50 ppm in the southern portion of the study area. The highest iodine concentrations in fluids were measured in groundwater below nitrate soils in the Coastal Range (3. 5 – 10 ppm) and in geothermal waters (1 – 3 ppm) along the volcanic arc. Although highly variable, the iodine isotopic ratios (129 I/I) of Jurassic marine sedimentary rocks (300 – 600 10 15), nitrate soils (150 – 1500 10 15) and waters (215 10 15) are consistently low (< 1500 10 15), indicating that recent anthropogenic additions are almost negligible in most surficial and deeper reservoirs. Geochemical mixing models reveal that the measured 129 I/I ratios in Atacama are in agreement with multiple sources of iodine that include variable contributions from old organic iodine sources (i. e., marine sedimentary rocks) and younger fluids such as pore waters, geothermal fluids and meteoric waters. Our results show that the large variation observed in the iodine isotopic ratios of different reservoirs (129 I/I from 150 to 1580 10 15) is indicative of significant mixing and circulation of fluids of meteoric, sedimentary and volcanic origin along the Chilean continental margin in the last 30 million years. We conclude that this protracted and large-scale fluid flow was driven by tectonic uplift and highly influenced by the climatic history of the Atacama Desert. The combination of such factors has played an unforeseen role in transporting and accumulating iodine and other soluble components in the Atacama region, and is evidence that elemental remobilization is a key process in the overall crustal cycle of iodine over scales of millions of years.

Oriental Line Announced. Considering the companys announcement from Baltimore, little hope is felt that any of these four steamers will return for service on this coast, but the company has also announced the intention of operating a line to the orient and it is presumed that some of the steamers now being built by the G.M. Standifer Construction corporation will be utilized in this service. The Green Star company has announced that it will inaugurate four distinct and regular services. One line will ply between Baltimore and the River Platte section of South America. Four of the companys large cargo carriers are to be assigned to this service. Another steamship freight service will be maintained between the Maryland port and Bordeaux. Having determined to invade the orient, the company has advised that it will operate to China, with Shanghai as the far eastern terminal. The fourth service will be established to Antwerp and Rotterdam. Philadelphia will have three lines. The Green Star line has announced that it will inaugurate services to Hamburg and Bremen, in Germany, and to Trieste, on the Mediterranean. It did not state how frequent the sailings would be and did not indicate the number of ships which would be assigned to the respective lines. At the present time, the company is continuing the operation of its New York-to-Genoa line which was started by the Nafra company during the war.
