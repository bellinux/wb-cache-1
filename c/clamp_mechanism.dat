5000|$|A cornelius keg is a {{stainless}} steel cylinder which can hold a maximum of 130 PSI. There are three openings in the keg: a large central hole which, by its design, can only be opened when the keg is not pressurized, and two ports with integral poppet valves which open when a hose with an appropriate fitting is attached to them. The central opening is used for filling and cleaning the keg, and {{is large enough to}} permit reaching inside for hand scrubbing. The two ports are used to dispense the beverage, one for [...] "gas in", and the other for [...] "liquid out". The separate metal lid for the central opening provides a <b>clamp</b> <b>mechanism</b> that closes and seals the lid against the keg with an large rubber O-ring. The lid also provides a pressure relief valve that is typically identified by a circular pull-ring (like a key ring). The relief valve can be manually opened to release the pressure in the keg; {{in the event of an}} unsafe overpressure in the keg, the relief valve automatically opens to avoid the hazard of bursting the cylinder. Two metal tubes are attached to the ports on the inside of the keg. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has a short tube, not reaching the fluid. The [...] "liquid out" [...] port has a long tube (a [...] "dip tube") which reaches to the bottom of the keg. Headspace gas pressure (usually carbon dioxide and sometimes nitrogen forced into the [...] "gas in" [...] port) pushes the drink from the bottom of the keg, up the tube, and then out of the [...] "liquid out" [...] port connected to a tap or other dispensing device.|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} miniaturisation {{of components}} {{which has to}} be handled and exactly examinated, the accuracy requirements of positioning systems are rising. Such high accuracy requirements can be meet by piezoelectric actuators, because {{it is easy to}} control their displacement on the order of submicrons by voltage control. However, in applying such actuators it is difficult to realize a rotary motion. At the Fraunhofer Institution in Jena the positioning device for precise rotary motion has been developed, which is driven by piezoelectric multilayer actuators. The deformation of one actuator generates a precise linear motion, which is transformed by an elastic hinge to the rotary motion. This elastic hinge constitutes the pivot point of the positioning system. The reachable angular resolution depends on the actuator, his distance to the pivot point and the control. The angular resolution of our new developed device with a volume of the whole lower than 3 cm 3 is better than 0. 4 seconds of arc. The generated rotary motion is transmitted to the rotor by the <b>clamp</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The <b>clamp</b> <b>mechanism</b> contains a further piezoelectric multilayer actuator, which is driven by a voltage up to 150 V. The motion generated in this way is transformed by elastic hinges, too. If the actuator is activated, the rotor is unclamped; if it is not driven, the clamps hold the rotor. There is no need for conventional bearing, whose production and assembly would be problematic in the miniaturized scale. To avoid complicated micro-assembly techniques in general, the mechanical body of the positioning device consists of only one part. Merely the actuators has to be arranged and attached. The simple structure of the miniaturized positioning device has the additional advantage, that the behaviour referring to vibrations is optimized. For this reason, considering the reachable angular resolution, a relative high speed is expected. The range of rotation is free. The miniaturized positioning device was d eveloped for high accuracy positioning of objects for handling and examination, for adjustment and quality control and for precise alignment of sensors. Due to the clamping without power consumption it is a long-time stable adjusting device. It can be coupled with linear positioning systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of Mycobacterium smegmatis single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) {{has been determined}} using three data sets collected from related crystals. The structure {{is similar to that}} of its homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, indicating that the clamp arrangement that stabilizes the dimer and the ellipsoidal shape of the tetramer are characteristic features of mycobacterial SSBs. The central OB fold is conserved in mycobacterial SSBs as well as those from Escherichia coli,Deinococcus radiodurans and human mitochondria. However, the quaternary structure exhibits considerable variability. The observed plasticity of the subunit is related to this variability. The crystal structures and modelling provide a rationale for the variability. The strand involved in the <b>clamp</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which leads to higher stability of the tetramer, appears to occur in all high-G+C Gram-positive bacteria. The higher stability is perhaps required by these organisms. The mode of DNA binding of mycobacterial SSBs is different from that of E. coli SSB partly on account of the difference in the shape of the tetramers. Another difference between the two modes is that the former contains additional ionic interactions and is more susceptible to salt concentration...|$|E

A {{previous}} {{study found that}} the electrophysiological response to ischemia is altered in hypertrophic myocardium, resulting in prolonged transmural activation time (TAT) associated with induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. This study investigated the role of hemodynamics in modulating TAT and the cycle length of induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) in dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Methods and Resuts. Anesthetized open-chest dogs underwent 3 hours of uninterrupted circumflex coronary occlusion. During atrial drive, TAT was recorded between endocardial and epicardial bipolar pairs on the same multipolar plunge needle placed in nonischemic and ischemic zones, documented by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. TAT and VT induced by up to three extrastimuli were studied during hypertension (control), during normotension produced most frequently by nitroprusside infusion (3 - 6 ag/kg/min), and during further hypertension most frequently produced by phenylephrine infusion (1 - 5 jLg/kg/min). Twenty-five dogs with chronic hypertension and LVH (group 1) produced by a single-kidney renal <b>clamp</b> <b>mechanism</b> and 15 control dogs were studied. In the latter, neither intervention altered TAT, and no VT was inducible.

40|$|M-current {{mediating}} KCNQ (Kv 7) potassium channels play {{an important}} role for electrical properties of neuronal cells. They serve as an intrinsic voltage <b>clamp</b> <b>mechanism</b> by stabilizing the neuron's membrane resting potential and preventing overexcitability, as highlighted by human mutations in genes for KCNQ 2 and KCNQ 3 that underlie certain forms of epilepsy. Besides their expression in the brain, neuronal KCNQ subunits 2 – 5 are also found in the somatosensory system. Here, KCNQ 2, - 3 and - 5 have previously been associated with nociception, while KCNQ 4 expression was identified in a subset of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons that correspond to rapidly-adapting low-threshold Aβ-fibers. Thus, KCNQ 4 was shown to be required for tuning the coding of vibrotactile stimuli. In addition, expression of KCNQ channels has been pharmacologically described in Aδ low-threshold D-hair fibers; however the KCNQ subunit has not been identified so far. In order to find out about the KCNQ subunit(s) in D-hair fibers, the electrophysiological skin-nerve preparation method was established in our lab. A constitutive KCNQ 5 knock-out mouse model was generated and investigated together with several other KCNQ mouse models for a detailed analysis of KCNQ subunit expression in the somatosensory system. I detected and localized both KCNQ 2 and - 3 in DRG cells positive for D-hair marker, and demonstrated KCNQ 3 expression in peripheral lanceolate nerve endings of cutaneous D-hair fibers around hair follicles, where it may modulate mechanotransduction. Indeed, skin-nerve recordings from single D-hair afferents from Kcnq 3 -/- mice revealed increased firing frequencies in response to mechanical ramp-and-hold stimuli of the receptive field, particularly pronounced at slow indentation velocities. Additional reduction of KCNQ 2 protein in Kcnq 2 +/-/Kcnq 3 -/- mice further enhanced D-hair firing. Thus, we conclude that mechanosensitivity of D-hair fibers is directly modulated at their peripheral nerve endings by both KCNQ 3 and KCNQ 2...|$|E
