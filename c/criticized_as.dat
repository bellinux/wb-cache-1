5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} {{have been}} <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> too militaristic. Military-style uniforms, badges of rank, flag ceremonies, and brass bands were commonly {{accepted in the}} early years because they were a part of normal society, but since then have diminished or been abandoned in both Scouting and society.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} novel has been {{acclaimed}} in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner {{was writing about}} a Brazilian theme. The book was also <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> revolutionary and anti-socialist. Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|The {{shooting}} led {{to significant}} changes in the country's political landscape. It remains a subject of numerous conspiracy theories, mostly involving President Kocharyan, whose tenure thereafter was frequently <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> authoritarian.

5000|$|The {{historian}} F. M. Leventhal {{noted that}} as Koss matured there was [...] "an increasingly irreverent and ironic tone in his scholarship, {{a willingness to}} <b>criticize</b> <b>as</b> well as to condone".

5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that this style {{may have been a}} result of Innis' illness late in his career.|$|E
5|$|Both the Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS {{versions}} were {{criticized for}} {{limiting the number}} of players to two. The Windows version was particularly <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> it did not allow for online play, a feature available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 releases, nor would receive the downloadable content for the game. The lack of multiplayer in the pulled iOS version was lamented though the other facets of the game's humor remained.|$|E
5|$|In modern society, merit-making {{has been}} <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> materialist, but merit-making is still {{ubiquitous}} in many societies.

50|$|In 2005, Peruzzi {{was sentenced}} to four years of prison by the Lucca District Court for {{defamation}} and insult. The Court came to this decision after they determined that Peruzzi overstepped his right to <b>criticize,</b> <b>as</b> he threatened the honor of Judge X by claiming that the Judge made such errors intentionally.|$|R
5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> {{contrary}} to {{its status as}} a symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably impedes. Secret discussions also prevent the public from being informed about controversial issues that may have arisen in the course of implementing new laws, especially those which may affect the rights of minorities.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2013, Kennedy was one {{of seven}} members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) {{who voted against the}} Amash-Conyers {{amendment}} to limit Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which tried to restrict NSA surveillance programs. In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as a supporter of the party leadership. His vote has been <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand {{in stark contrast to the}} sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> an elitist forum for wealthy right-wing Haitians {{to promote their}} own agendas for Haiti's future. Funding was provided, in {{material}} part, by controversial Haitian businessman Rodolphe Boulos {{who was involved in}} a pharmaceutical poisoning controversy in 1996. The project was seen as a platform for giving opponents of the Aristede administration a hearing in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E

5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former being seen as lacking in places and the latter being held back by other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E
5|$|Gone {{with the}} Wind has been <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> {{historical}} revisionism glorifying slavery, but nevertheless, {{it has been}} credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest films of all time; it has placed in the top ten of the American Film Institute's list of top 100 American films since the list's inception in 1998, and in 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|His {{social and}} {{political}} activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant {{as the beginning of}} a new trilogy; it was, however, <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> being a lesser version of his original Trilogy, and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.|$|E

5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been <b>criticized</b> <b>as</b> oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{the issues raised by}} the {{industrial}} policy debate are as much political as they are economic.
