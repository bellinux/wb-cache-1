5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a <b>cavity</b> <b>resonator.</b> If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
25|$|All cavity {{magnetrons}} {{consist of}} a heated cathode placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode {{is placed in the}} center of an evacuated, lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut {{along the length of the}} cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of <b>cavity</b> <b>resonator</b> is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.|$|E
500|$|A basic {{component}} of waveguide filters is the <b>cavity</b> <b>resonator.</b> [...] This {{consists of a}} short length of waveguide blocked at both ends. [...] Waves trapped inside the resonator are reflected {{back and forth between}} the two ends. [...] A given geometry of cavity will resonate at a characteristic frequency. [...] The resonance effect can be used to selectively pass certain frequencies. [...] Their use in a filter structure requires that some of the wave is allowed to pass out of one cavity into another through a coupling structure. [...] However, if the opening in the resonator is kept small then a valid design approach is to design the cavity as if it were completely closed and errors will be minimal. [...] A number of different coupling mechanisms are used in different classes of filter.|$|E

500|$|The first {{published}} {{account of a}} cross-coupled filter is due to John R. Pierce at Bell Labs in a 1948 patent. [...] A cross-coupled filter {{is one in which}} resonators that are not immediately adjacent are coupled. [...] The additional degrees of freedom thus provided allow the designer to create filters with improved performance, or, alternatively, with fewer resonators. [...] One version of Pierce's filter, shown in figure 3, uses circular waveguide <b>cavity</b> <b>resonators</b> to link between rectangular guide <b>cavity</b> <b>resonators.</b> [...] This principle was not at first much used by waveguide filter designers, but it was used extensively by mechanical filter designers in the 1960s, particularly R.

[...] Nor was the method first discovered in the field of mechanical filters; the earliest description is in a 1948 patent for filters using microwave <b>cavity</b> <b>resonators.</b> [...] However, mechanical filter designers were the first (1960s) to develop practical filters of this kind and the method became a particular feature of mechanical filters.|$|R
