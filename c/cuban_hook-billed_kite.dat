50|$|Chondrohierax is a genus {{of birds}} of prey in the family Accipitridae. Its two members, the <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> (C. uncinatus) and the Cuban kite (C. wilsonii), are often {{considered}} to be conspecific. The <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> is widespread in the warmer parts of the Americas, while the Cuban kite is a critically endangered Cuban endemic.|$|R

50|$|The {{critically}} endangered Cuban kite, C. wilsonii, {{is considered}} by some authors to be a subspecies of the <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite.</b>|$|R
50|$|Osprey, broad-winged hawk, {{northern}} harrier, and {{peregrine falcon}} {{are among the}} migratory birds of prey found in the refuge. <b>Hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> and grey hawk, seen occasionally in the refuge, attract birders from around the world.|$|R
50|$|The Clements Checklist and the AOU {{consider}} it as subspecies of the <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite.</b> A molecular phylogenetics analysis using mitochondrial DNA suggests that it warrants species status having diverged from the mainland lineage approximately 400,000 to 1.5 million years ago.|$|R
40|$|Taxonomic {{uncertainties}} {{within the}} genus Chondrohierax {{stem from the}} high degree of variation in bill size and plumage coloration throughout the geographic range of the single recognized species, <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> Chondrohierax uncinatus. These uncertainties impede conservation efforts as local populations have declined throughout much of its geographic range from the Neotropics in Central America to northern Argentina and Paraguay, including two island populations on Cuba and Grenada, and it is not known whether barriers to dispersal exist between any of these areas. Here, we present mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; cytochrome B and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2) phylogenetic analyses of Chondrohierax, with particular emphasis on the two island taxa (from Cuba, Chondrohierax uncinatus wilsonii and from Grenada, Chondrohierax uncinatus mirus). The mtDNA phylogenetic results suggest that <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kites</b> on both islands are unique; however, the Cuban kite has much greater divergence estimates (1. 8 – 2. 0 % corrected sequence divergence) when compared with the mainland populations than does the Grenada <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> (0. 1 – 0. 3 %). Our findings support species status for the Cuban form, as Chondrohierax wilsonii, and subspecific status for the Grenada form. For mainland taxa, we do not find support for the currently recognized subspecies Chondrohierax uncinatus aquilonis in western Mexico, but we do find evidence for a genetic subdivision between populations in Central and South America, a difference previously unsuspected. The results of this study help identify conservation priorities associated with these unique Neotropical raptors. This information is of immediate interest because the Cuban kite has not been reliably seen since 1992, and < 50 <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kites</b> currently inhabit Grenada...|$|R
50|$|The <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> (Chondrohierax uncinatus), is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae, which also {{includes}} many other diurnal raptors such as kites, eagles, and harriers. It occurs in the Americas, including the Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical South America.|$|R
50|$|The West Indies Project {{focuses on}} raptors found {{only on the}} Caribbean Islands. Current {{research}} and conservation efforts are directed at the critically endangered Ridgway's hawk in the Dominican Republic, the Puerto Rican Sharp-shinned Hawk, the Grenada <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> confined to the island of Grenada, and the Cuban kite, endemic to Cuba and among the rarest species of raptor in the world.|$|R
5000|$|Birds of Cuba's moist forests {{include the}} Cuban tody (Todus multicolor), bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae), Cuban trogon (Priotelus temnurus), Cuban {{solitaire}} (Myadestes elisabeth), <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> (Chondrohierax uncinatus), red-legged honeycreeper (Cyanerpes cyaneus), Cuban parakeet (Aratinga euops), stygian owl (Asio stygius) and Gundlach's hawk (Accipiter gundlachi). [...] The rare Cuban solenodon (Solenodon cubanus), a small mammal, is endemic to eastern montane forests. Other notable mammals include the hutias, 4-5 species of small to medium-sized, climbing rodents {{related to the}} Guinea Pig.|$|R
50|$|The {{watershed}} of the Toa river extends for 1061 km2, {{and has a}} half {{slope of}} 260 m. It takes up about 70% of the Cuchillas del Toa Biosphere Reserve. The area around the river is home to many species of endemic flora and fauna, including at least 1000 species of flowers and 145 species of ferns. Species in danger of extinction, such as the tocororo (which is also the national bird of Cuba) and the <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite,</b> are also among the fauna of this area.|$|R
50|$|The beaks of accipitrids {{are strong}} and hooked (sometimes very hooked, {{as in the}} <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> or snail kite). In some species, there is a notch or 'tooth' in the upper {{mandible}}. In all accipitrids, {{the base of the}} upper mandible is covered by a fleshy membrane called the cere, which is usually yellow in colour. The tarsi of different species vary by diet; those of bird-hunting species, such as sparrowhawks, are long and thin, whilst species that hunt large mammals have much thicker, stronger tarsi, and the tarsi of the snake-eagles have thick scales to protect from bites.|$|R
50|$|Wedge-capped capuchins {{have been}} {{observed}} to give alarm calls if they observe a potential predator. Such predators include jaguars, ocelots, tayras, boa constrictors, caimans, and collared peccaries. In addition, alarm calls {{have been observed}} when the capuchin sees one of several birds, such as <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kites,</b> black vultures, green ibises, rufous-vented chachalacas, harpy eagles, or ornate hawk-eagles. Due to these predators, the wedge-capped capuchin has taken to living in groups; as group size increases, vigilance per animal decreases, though {{it has not yet}} been demonstrated that capuchins in larger groups are any less vulnerable than those in smaller groups.|$|R
50|$|Tree snails {{are this}} raptor's {{favorite}} prey but frogs, salamanders, small mammals and insects are also taken. When it finds a tree snail it holds it with its talon and uses its beak to pry open the shell. The nest is a flimsy platform of sticks is built by both sexes. The <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kite</b> lays {{two to three}} buff-white eggs marked with red-brown. Incubation is by both sexes. Semialtricial young stay in the nest 35-45 days and are fed by both sexes. This raptor is often considered sluggish and retiring, preferring to perch inside leafy canopy when not flying.|$|R

5000|$|The {{snail kite}} (Rostrhamus sociabilis), {{slender-billed}} kite (Helicolestes hamatus) and <b>hook-billed</b> <b>kites</b> (Chondrohierax uncinatus) are specialists in consuming snails, which usually constitute 50-95% of their diet. Other [...] "kites" [...] {{are divided into}} two groups, a loose assemblance of smallish raptors, {{many of which are}} strong fliers. One, exclusively in the Old World, milvine or [...] "large" [...] kites, are relatively large, often quite common, very generalized and often weakly predaceous feeders whereas the other kites, also known as elanine or [...] "small" [...] kites and mostly found in the New World, are supremely aerial, active hunters that generally alternate their primary food between insects and small mammals. One species allied with the latter kite group, the bat hawk (Macheiramphus alcinus), has come to specialize in hunting bats.|$|R
