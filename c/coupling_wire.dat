40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{the study of the}} effect of heave passive {{compensation}} during subsea factory heavy lift operations. All the analysis are based on the data provided by Peter Sandvik, Marintek. The main objective is to demonstrate the positive effect of passive heave compensation and de- termine the optimized stroke of passive heave compensator by the static and dynamic analysis in SIMA program. The literature study is based on articles related to heave compensation during marine operation and DNV-RP-H 103, which provides guidance for modelling and analysis of marine operations. The different types of heave compensator with different applications are introduced in the the- sis. Then, an introduction of SIMA program will be presented in chapter 4. Meanwhile how the models of environment conditions, different bodies and coupling specifications, as well as the calculation parameters are established in SIMA is illustrated in chapter 5. Moreover, five cases are performed in this thesis to prove that the passive heave compensator will contribute to the reduction of dynamic loads and motions during heavy lift operation. The analysis is performed in SIMA, a workbench used to solve tasks during marine operations. The lifting module is modelled as a combination of four same mudmat and the passive heave com- pensator is modelled by a fixed elongation coupling between the hook and cranemaster. As for the model without passive heave compensator, it just replaces the fixed elongation coupling be- tween the hook and cranemaster with a simple <b>coupling</b> <b>wire.</b> And all he results from SIMA will be plotted in chapter 6. In the last chapter, the conclusion is drawn. It proves that the passive heave compensator has an effect of alleviating vertical forces and motions during heavy lift operation. Meanwhile it also demonstrates that the optimized PHC has the same influence as the initial PHC(passive heave compensator). At last, the recommendation for further work is given...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{simulation}} {{offers the}} possibility of using a controllable quantum-mechanical system to implement the dynamics of another quantum system, performing calculations that are intractable on classical computers for all but the smallest systems. This great possibility carries with it great challenges, two of which motivate the experiments with nuclear spins and trapped ions presented in this thesis. The first challenge is determining the bounds on the precision of quantities that are calculated using a digital quantum simulator. As a specific example, we use a three-qubit nuclear spin system to calculate the low-lying spectrum of a pairing Hamiltonian. We find that the simulation time scales poorly with the precision, and increases further if error correction is employed. In addition, control errors lead to yet more stringent limits on the precision. These results indicate that quantum simulation is more efficient than classical computation only when a limited precision is acceptable and when no efficient classical approximation is known. The second challenge is the scaling-up of small quantum simulators to incorporate tens or hundreds of qubits. With a specific goal of analog quantum simulation of spin models in two dimensions, we present novel ion trap designs, a lattice ion trap and a surface-electrode elliptical ion trap. We experimentally confirm a theoretical model of each trap, and evaluate the suitability of each design for quantum simulation. We find that the relevant interaction rates are much higher in the elliptical trap, at the cost of additional systematic control errors. (cont.) We also explore the interaction of ions over a wire, a potentially more scalable system than the elliptical trap. We calculate the expected coupling rate and decoherence rates, and find that an extremely low capacitance (O(fF)) between the <b>coupling</b> <b>wire</b> and ground is required, as well as ion-wire distances of O(50 [mu]m) to realize a motional coupling of 0 (1 kHz). In pursuit of this situation, we measure the effect on a single ion of a floating wire's static and induced ac voltages {{as a function of the}} ion-wire distance. by Robert J. Clark. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|We {{formulate}} {{a theory of}} non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states by considering an anisotropic system consisting of coupled, interacting one dimensional wires. We show that Abelian bosonization provides a simple framework for characterizing the Moore Read state, {{as well as the}} more general Read Rezayi sequence. This <b>coupled</b> <b>wire</b> construction provides a solvable Hamiltonian formulated in terms of electronic degrees of freedom, and provides a direct route to characterizing the quasiparticles and edge states in terms of conformal field theory. This construction leads to a simple interpretation of the coset construction of conformal field theory, which is a powerful method for describing non Abelian states. In the present context, the coset construction arises when the original chiral modes are fractionalized into coset sectors, and the different sectors acquire energy gaps due to coupling in "different directions". The <b>coupled</b> <b>wire</b> construction can also can be used to describe anisotropic lattice systems, and provides a starting point for models of fractional and non-Abelian Chern insulators.

The {{resonators}} are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance.

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{addresses the}} study of nano-magnetic devices configured to produce logic machines through magnetostatic coupling interactions. The ability for single domain magnets to reliably couple through magnetostatic interactions {{is essential to the}} proper functionality of Magnetic Cellular Automata (MCA) devices (p. 36). It was significant to explore how fabrication defects affected the coupling reliability of MCA architectures. Both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic coupling architectures were found to be robust to common fabrication defects. Experiments also verified the functionality of the previously reported MCA majority gate [1] and a novel implementation of a ferromagnetic MCA majority gate is reported. From these results, {{the study of}} clocking Magnetic Cellular Automata (MCA) interconnect architectures was investigated (p. 54). The wire architectures were saturated under distinct directions of an external magnetic field. The experimental results suggested ferromagnetic <b>coupled</b> <b>wires</b> were able to mitigate magnetic frustrations better than anti-ferromagnetic <b>coupled</b> <b>wires.</b> Simulations were also implemented supporting the experimental results. Ferromagnetic wires were found to operate more reliably and will likely be the primary interconnects for MCA. The first design and implementation of a coplanar cross wire system for MCA was constructed which consisted of orthogonal ferromagnetic <b>coupled</b> <b>wires</b> (p. 68). Simulations were implemented of a simple crossing wire junction to analyze micro-magnetic dynamics, data propagation, and associated energy states. Furthermore, two systems were physically realized; the first system consisted of two coplanar crossing wires and the second was a more complex system consisting of over 120 nano-magnetic cells. By demonstrating the combination of all the possible logic states of the first system and the low ground state achieved by the second system, the data suggested coplanar cross wire systems would indeed be a viable architecture in MCA technology. Finally, ongoing research of an unconventional method for image processing using nano-magnetic field-based computation is presented (p. 79). In magnetic field-based computing (MFC), nano-disks were mapped to low level segments of an image, and the magnetostatic coupling of magnetic dipole moments was directly related to the saliency of a low level segment for grouping. A proof of concept model for two MFC systems was implemented. Details such as the importance of fabricating circular nano-magnetic cells to mitigate shape anisotropy, experimental coupling analysis via Magnetic Force Microscopy, and current results from a complex MFC system is outlined...|$|R
