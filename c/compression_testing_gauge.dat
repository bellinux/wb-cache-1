40|$|Tissue-engineered {{scaffolds}} should mimic, {{as closely}} as possible, {{the one of the}} tissues to be replaced. Hence, mechanical tests are of paramount importance. However, as there are various biomaterials, with distinct mechanical properties, performing a conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> is complicated. The objective of this thesis was to study the reliability and limitations of static conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>testing</b> device. Accuracy and reproducibility of the <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> were considered. The results showed that the compressive properties are dependent on many factors (sample size, microstructure, etc.). Biomaterial’s properties, such as viscoelasticity and brittleness, complicated the <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> and hampered the reliability. Fixed uniaxial compressive platen led to uneven load distribution on sample cross-section area. Careful sample preparation, surface finish or self-aligning platen could improve the reliability. The testing device showed good reproducibility, and accuracy for compressive strength. However, compressive modulus underestimated the results by > 34 %. The strain was measured from the platen displacement that may have caused error in strain measurements. With an optical extensometer, strain could be measured precisely from the center part of the sample. In conclusion, the accuracy and reproducibility of conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> are questionable. The <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> should be performed with caution...|$|R

40|$|Many new {{automotive}} vehicle designs incorporate an Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) {{system on}} the gasoline internal combustion engine to manipulate volumetric efficiency and control engine speed. These engines have the possibility of developing various mechanical problems {{at some point in}} the vehicle’s lifespan. <b>Compression</b> <b>testing</b> is a common procedure used to diagnose certain types of engine mechanical problems. <b>Compression</b> <b>testing</b> procedures have traditionally been performed with a fully open throttle. However, ETC systems may not allow the throttle to open fully, if at all, during conventional engine <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> procedures. Technicians in the repair industry, students in vocational programs, as well as educators and trainers need to be aware of the effects of the ETC system on engine <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> procedures and make accommodations for these effects to reliably diagnose engine mechanical problems in these vehicles. A sample of twenty-two vehicles equipped with an ETC system were gathered for <b>testing.</b> <b>Compression</b> <b>testing</b> procedures were performed on these vehicles to determine the throttle opening and cylinder pressures. The procedure was performed on each vehicle in three variations: (1) a conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test,</b> (2) Electronic Throttle Body (ETB) unplugged, and (3) ETB blocked open. The results of these testing procedures were analyzed to determine to what extent the throttle was opened by the ETC system during a traditional <b>compression</b> <b>test.</b> In addition, the variation in cylinder pressure among the tests was analyzed to determine if a statistically significant result existed. The results of the testing showed a wide variation in throttle openings among tested vehicles as well as a weak correlation between throttle opening and cylinder pressure. The conclusion of the study is that a conventional <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> is a valid testing procedure on ETC equipped vehicles...|$|R

Using commercially available modelling clay, material stress–strain relationships were obtained from <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> of solid cylindrical specimens. A series of ring <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out to obtain friction coefficients for a number of lubricants including vaseline, zinc stearate and talcum powder. FE simulations were used to derive the friction calibration curves and to evaluate material deformation, geometric changes and load–displacement results. Friction coefficient values of the tested lubricants are in agreement with the results obtained by other researchers. Further investigation is necessary {{to determine the effects of}} material properties, test conditions and use of calibration curves on the ring <b>compression</b> <b>test.</b> It is suggested that the combined use of physical modelling experiment and FE simulation provides a simple and effective means in the study of frictional mechanisms for bulk material deformation. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{polymers}} exhibit non-isochoric behaviour during tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>testing</b> {{as well as}} particular deformations like {{local necking}} (tension) or buckling (compression). A method for the determination of Cauchy stresses from tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> is presented, that considers the actual deformations of the test specimens. The exact geometry of the specimens in the respective present configuration is determined in photographs, which are taken continuously throughout the test. The engineering stresses at several time points are converted into Cauchy stresses using newly developed formulas in consideration of the actual specimen geometry. For validation finite element analyses of the tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> are performed using the identified stress-strain curves. The numerical results show good agreement with the experiments for the tested polymers. Thus a method for conversion of engineering to Cauchy stresses in tensile and <b>compression</b> <b>tests</b> could be established considering the non-isochoric deformation in plasticity. With this method “true” stress-strain curves as input for finite element material models can be identified for arbitrary materials...|$|R
