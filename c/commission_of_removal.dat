50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, with an {{interest}} in creating a navigable waterway that would empty into Bellingham Bay and be usable beyond Ferndale, the city <b>of</b> Bellingham <b>commissioned</b> the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the log jam. Once the log jam was removed the river's flow shifted into the southern channel, and the headwaters of the Lummi River were restricted by a dam, which was later damaged, then replaced by a dam and spillway system, which was also later damaged. Today the Lummi River is currently only fed by water from the Nooksack River during times of high water by a culvert that passes through the levee.|$|R
40|$|The Selfs Point Wastewater Treatment Plant in Hobart was {{upgraded}} to biological nutrient removal standard in early 1997. The upgrade incorporated the existing trickling filter and anaerobic digesters. The new nutrient removal capability {{is provided by}} the BioDenipho process, and is supported by prefermentation and alum dosing of the digested sludge sidestream. This study reviews the development of wastewater treatment processes and the history of sewage treatment and collection in Hobart leading to this upgrade. All of the major processes at the Plant are reviewed as to how each impacts and is impacted by nutrient removal processes. Results from the first 18 months of operation of the plant following <b>commissioning</b> <b>of</b> nutrient <b>removal</b> are discussed, along with some of the factors affecting performance. Prefermentation {{has been found to be}} critical in achieving good biological phosphorus removal. A solids residence time of 5 days in a combined activated primary tank and sidestream prefermenter system has provided good performance. Use of existing rock trickling filters in a combined carbonaceous removal and nitrification role has permitted a smaller BNR reactor volume and a plant with greater flexibility for treating high influent loads or flows. The anaerobic digestion of phosphorus rich activated sludge led to a solubilisation of about 30...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{standardization}} was {{a by-product}} of technical innovations during the Industrial Revolution. An unfortunate side effect of standardization was enhanced opportunities for theft and embezzlement. Two significant modern institutions radically evolved during the eighteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries to control these growing problems: criminal law and public police. These institutions strongly interacted with {{the pace of the}} Industrial Revolution. Our argument explains this evolution and is tested through an analysis of several historical facts: the role of early police, the fall of the watch system, the creation <b>of</b> improvement <b>commissions,</b> the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> possession immunity, {{the rise and fall of}} factory colonies, and the fall and rise of court cases during the eighteenth century.

40|$|<b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> {{heavy metal}} ions from soils by {{electrokinetic}} treatment has several advantages. The extent <b>of</b> <b>removal,</b> however, is both soil specific and ion specific. The conditions {{to be maintained}} have to be established based on laboratory studies. With a view to maximize the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> metal ions the trends <b>of</b> <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> heavy metal ions such as iron, nickel and cadmium form a natural Indian kaolinitic red earth during different conditions maintained in the electrokinetic extraction process are studied. A laboratory electrokinetic extraction apparatus was assembled for this purpose. Attempts are also made to elucidate the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the metal ions from soil. The composition of the flushing fluid, voltage and duration of extraction are varied. While dilute acetic acid {{has been used to}} neutralize the alkalinity that develops at the cathode, EDTA solution has been used to desorb heavy metals from clay surface. Generally the extent <b>of</b> <b>removal</b> was proportional to the osmotic flow. Nickel and Cadmium are more effectively removed than iron. The percentage <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> Ni is generally proportional to the osmotic flow but shows sensitivity to the pH of the system. There is an optimum voltage for <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> metal ions from soil. The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> iron was negligible under different conditions studie...|$|R
