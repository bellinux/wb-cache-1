50|$|Anopterus glandulosus is a {{slow growing}} shrub to small tree which occurs in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforests, {{in the south and}} west of Tasmania at {{elevations}} below 1200 m. A. glandulosus prefers cool, moist conditions in partly shaded conditions with well drained soils, from loamy to sandy and highly organic soils. More seedlings of this species germinate and grow on rotting fallen logs than soil. It most commonly occurs as an understorey shrub often under a canopy of Nothofagus cunninghamii (myrtle beech). It is susceptible to the plant disease Phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes ‘root rot’ or ’dieback’, and does not tolerate excess phosphorus. However, this species is highly adaptable and tolerates harsh conditions including to frost and snow. Due to its rainforest habitat it is also adapted for <b>continuous</b> <b>regeneration</b> and regenerates well after disturbance, often undergoing rapid regrowth to form thickets in response to mechanical damage. The attractive and strongly scented flowers produce large amounts of nectar, attracting insects and birds and birds that feed on both nectar and insects such as honeyeaters.|$|E
50|$|Alpha {{collagen}} {{is designed}} {{to be used as a}} supplement for osteoarthritis, based on the theory of the different environments of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM of joint cartilage comprises many classes of macromolecules; collagen (type I, II, VI, X collagen fibrils) and proteoglycans. The ratio and the proportion of collagen play an important role in the tensile and compressive strength, as well as the elasticity of the tissue. The content of collagen in cartilage is different between joints and soft tissue structures. For example, cartilage in the knee has a different structure to the ankle. Cartilage, skin, and spinal discs are subject to <b>continuous</b> <b>regeneration</b> during which anabolic and catabolic processes are in equilibrium. Any imbalance in this equilibrium between matrix degeneration and regeneration results in a decrease in the components of the ECM, and leads to loss of chondral damage. Therefore, it is important to tackle the degenerative process before the inflammatory metalloproteases set in by replenishing the collagen in the ECM. Collagen supplementation has been shown in research studies (in vitro and in vivo) to increase the thickness or volume of the cartilage tissue. Collagen can stimulate chondrocytes, which are responsible for the metabolic maintenance of the ECM.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The space-time {{evolution}} of J/ψ production in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energy is investigated in a transport model. Both gluon dissociation and <b>continuous</b> <b>regeneration</b> of J/ψs inside deconfined state are considered. PACS numbers: 25. 75. -q, 12. 38.

However, the mechanism of J/ψ production in hot and dense medium is still an open question. Different from the J/ψ suppression observed at SPS [2] where almost all the charmonia are produced in the initial stage via hard processes and then suffer from anomalous suppression in the QGP, there is remarkable number of charm quarks in the QGP produced at RHIC energy and the recombination of those uncorrelated charm quarks offers another origin of J/ψ production [3]. Both sudden generation on the hadronization surface in grand canonical ensemble [4] or canonical ensemble [5] and <b>continuous</b> <b>regeneration</b> [6, 7] inside the QGP are discussed to describe the charmonia production.

40|$|In New Caledonia, {{rain forests}} with an upper canopy {{dominated}} by single species of Nothofagus occur next to mixed-canopy forests, without discernible environmental cause. A potential {{explanation is that}} they are different successional stages. To test this hypothesis and predict long-term change in canopy dominance, population size structures of 61 canopy species were analysed in six Nothofagus-dominated forests and three adjacent mixed rain forests. Weibull analysis suggests that these Nothofagus forests are secondary forests, with recruitment insufficient to maintain monodominance, except at a high-altitude site. At low- to mid-altitudes the Nothofagus canopy is predicted to develop into amixed canopy, unlessmoderate to severe disturbance occurs within its reproductive lifespan.
