5|$|After 56 {{games with}} the Avalanche during the 2000–01 season, where he had 13 points, Miller was traded {{for the second time}} in his career. On February 21, 2001 Miller was sent to the Los Angeles Kings by the Colorado Avalanche with Adam Deadmarsh, a player later to be named (Jared Aulin, who would be traded on March 22, 2001) and Colorado's 1st round <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> the 2001 (Dave Steckel) and 2003 (Brian Boyle) Entry Drafts for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht.

5|$|Although the 2012–13 team {{graduated}} five {{seniors and}} had two underclassmen (Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway, Jr.) who were first-round draft <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> the 2013 NBA Draft from the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament national runner-up team, {{three of the five}} national runner-up team starters (Mitch McGary, Glenn Robinson III and Nik Stauskas) were returning. The entering class included a pair of state Boys Basketball Gatorade Players of the Year in Indiana Mr. Basketball Zak Irvin and Derrick Walton, runner-up Mr. Basketball of Michigan, three scholarship players and four walk-ons. The team was a top-10 preseason selection, according to the vast majority of preseason rankings, and many media outlets selected McGary as a preseason All-American. Plagued with back problems during the season, McGary played in eight of the team's first eleven games before opting for season-ending surgery.|$|E
5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own <b>choices.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionAn {{aspect of}} caregiving that has {{received}} little attention {{is the degree to}} which the choice to provide care affects a caregiver's emotional well-being. We compared a population-based sample of informal caregivers who reported having a <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> caring with caregivers who did not have a <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> caring to determine the extent to which choice affects caregivers' self-reported stress. MethodsWe identified 341 informal caregivers who completed a caregiving module appended to the 2005 North Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. We determined participants' self-reported stress by using a 5 -point scale that was dichotomized and used adjusted binomial logistic regression to assess the risk of stress given lack of <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> caregiving. ResultsIn the fully adjusted model, caregivers without a <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> caring were more than 3 times as likely to report stress as caregivers with a <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> caring. High level of burden also increased stress. Caregivers with no <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> caring were most commonly the primary caregiver of a parent. ConclusionCaregivers who do not have a <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> caregiving were at increased risk of stress, which may predispose them to poor health outcomes. Further investigation is needed to determine whether interventions that target caregivers without a <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> caring can reduce their levels of stress...|$|R

5|$|In 1997, the RTA (since re-branded as Sound Transit) began {{exploring}} alignment {{options for}} the Northgate segment, with residents voicing their opposition to at-grade or elevated alignments {{in favor of an}} underground route. Following several rounds of public hearings in 2000, the Sound Transit Board narrowed down the routing options to a tunnel under 12th Avenue and an elevated alignment along Interstate 5 to the west of Roosevelt's commercial district, each with a station at Northeast 65th Street. Further discussion on the two remaining <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> 2004 led to divides in the Sound Transit Board; community and business groups in Roosevelt favored an underground alignment, while Seattle mayor Greg Nickels supported the elevated station, which was less costly and closer to the Green Lake neighborhood. On January 28, 2005, the Sound Transit Board unanimously approved an underground alignment with a station along 12th Avenue NE between NE 65th and 67th streets, citing a smaller-than-expected difference in cost compared to the elevated option.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, the USDA {{received}} {{requests from}} beef processors to allow voluntary labeling of products with the additive, and stated it planned to approve labeling after checks for label accuracy. Both BPI and Cargill {{made plans to}} label products that contain the additive to alleviate these concerns and restore consumer confidence. Following the USDA announcement to allow <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> purchasing decisions for ground beef, many school districts stated that they would opt out of serving ground beef with LFTB. By June 2012, 47 out of 50 U.S. states declined to purchase any of the product for the 2012–2013 school year while South Dakota Department of Education, Nebraska, and Iowa chose to continue buying it.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{was given a}} {{customizable}} ship named the Nemesis, commanded by Sterling and his crew. The player's <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> the game would determine the crew they could hire, which in turn affected the ship's attributes. The vessel {{could be used to}} explore the Caribbean Sea and battle other crafts. During combat, the player could maneuver the ship, fire the cannons, or board the enemy vessel for hand-to-hand combat. If the enemy craft was boarded and the enemy crew was eliminated, the player received more loot than if it was destroyed. Loot salvaged in these battles could be sold in markets.|$|E

5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is {{a departure}} from previous instalments in the series, using a direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's movements with a keyboard or gamepad, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectable objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player has action <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> the bottom right of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key. As in the first two Broken Sword games, in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible.|$|E

5|$|Following this, {{the player}} is offered {{a choice of}} eight minigames to test their {{knowledge}} of the words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or ethical issues. Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances <b>choices</b> <b>in</b> education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Background Providing <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> {{health care}} {{is part of an}} ongoing policy {{initiative}} Aim To explore how people understand <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> health care provision Setting South East England Design of Study A qualitative study using semi structured interviews Method Twenty two people recruited through advertising were interviewed about <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> general and <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> health care in particular. The data were analysed using template analysis. Results Participants grounded their consideration of <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> the NHS within the GP consultation. Four main themes about choice were identified: positive aspects of choice; the appearance of choice; unwanted choice; and the role of information <b>in</b> <b>choice.</b> <b>In</b> particular, there was strong assent to the value of <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> principle and having choice was seen as positive. The provision of choice options, however, was not always associated with the possibility of meaningful choice and participants felt that the appearance rather than the substance of <b>choice</b> was sometimes <b>in</b> evidence. Making – as opposed to having - choice was often unwanted and considered as indicative of erosion in trust in the GP and to occasion regret. Information was seen as a necessary but not sufficient prerequisite of informed choice Conclusion People value having choices rather than making choices but are concerned about choice provision for its own sake rather than choice that is available in a meaningful way. Health care policy that recommends an increase <b>in</b> <b>choice</b> per se may be met with scepticism which could ultimately undermine rather than promote the doctor / patient relationship...|$|R
