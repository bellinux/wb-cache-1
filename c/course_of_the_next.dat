During the subsequent evacuation, two more landing craft ran aground and although one managed to float free, the other remained stuck hard on a reef. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> couple of days, {{the men in the}} landing craft were subjected to heavy Japanese attack and it was not until 11 June that rescue efforts were completed. The battalion lost 23 men killed or missing, presumed dead, while a further 106 were wounded in the operation.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{developed}} {{the entirety of}} the game independently, including writing and composing the score, with only additional art created by other artists. The game was inspired by the Mother and Mario & Luigi role-playing series, the bullet hell shooter series Touhou Project, and the British comedy show Mr. Bean. Undertale was initially meant to be two hours in length and was set to be released in mid-2014, but development was delayed over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three years.|$|E
5|$|From {{the initial}} attack, only the Canadians {{on the extreme}} right and the 3rd Australian Brigade on the extreme left were able to capture and hold their set objectives. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three days, severe {{fighting}} took place and further troops were drawn in to hold and extend the gains of 3 May. On 6 May, the Germans launched a counter-attack which forced the 3rd Brigade to withdraw from their trenches; {{it was during this}} engagement that Howell was to perform the act which was to earn him the Victoria Cross.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmer's threats lay {{in their}} {{relation}} to a circumstance known at present only to herself: her lover was coming back to Weatherbury in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very <b>next</b> day or two. Troy had not returned to his distant barracks as Boldwood and others supposed, but had merely gone to visit some acquaintance in Bath, and had yet {{a week or more}} remaining to his furlough.|$|R
5|$|Garrison {{commander}} James C. Neill {{went home}} on family matters February 11, 1836, leaving James Bowie and William B. Travis as co-commanders over the predominantly volunteer force. When the Mexican Army of Operations {{under the command}} of Santa Anna arrived in Béxar with 1,500 troops on February 23, the remaining Alamo garrison numbered 150. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> several days, new volunteers arrived inside the fortress while others were sent out as couriers, to forage for food, or to buy supplies.|$|E

Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four days an additional 690 or so planes arrived from Japan and China.|$|E
5|$|Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few years, Bloom {{spent some}} £16,000 {{restoring}} the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored to steam once more. Unfortunately, as 1976 progressed {{it was discovered}} that No. 46233 would require a new firebox tubeplate at a projected cost of £12,000. Bloom was not prepared to spend further money at this time and the engine became a static exhibit at Bressingham.|$|E

It elected a Regional Command and appointed Rimawi as the branch's Regional Secretary. Shugyar, Gharbiyah and Na'was agreed {{to serve in the}} Regional Branch's Central Committee. Rimawi and Na'was, his deputy, would prove effective leaders. Shortly after the 2nd Regional Congress, the branch launched a successful recruitment campaign in Jordanian and Palestinian neighbourhoods and cities.

5|$|After Mindaugas' death, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania entered {{times of}} {{relative}} instability, as {{reflected by the}} fact that seven Grand Dukes held the title over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 32 years. Little is known about this period, but the Gediminid dynasty was founded in about 1280. Despite the instability, the Grand Duchy did not disintegrate. Vytenis assumed power in 1295, and during the next 20 years laid solid foundations for the Duchy to expand and grow under the leadership of Gediminas and his son Algirdas. While the Grand Duchy was established between 1219 and 1295, the years after 1295 marked its expansion.|$|E

Iraqi Republican Guard forces were engaged within the Hammar Marshes of the Tigris–Euphrates river system in Iraq while attempting to reach and cross the Lake Hammar causeway and escape northward toward Baghdad on Highway 8. Most of the five-mile-long Iraqi caravan of several hundred vehicles was first boxed into a kill zone and then in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five hours systematically devastated by the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, including its armored forces, by AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and nine artillery battalions.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the last}} of these migrations to arrive in the Valley of Mexico settled on an island in the Lake Texcoco and {{proceeded}} to subjugate the surrounding tribes. This group was the Mexica, who over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three centuries founded an empire named Tenochtitlan. Their political and linguistic influence came to extend into Central America and Nahuatl became a lingua franca among merchants and elites in Mesoamerica, e.g., among the Maya K'iche' people. As Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest urban center in Central America, it attracted speakers of Nahuatl from diverse areas giving birth to an urban form of Nahuatl with traits from many dialects. This urbanized variety of Tenochtitlan is what {{came to be known as}} Classical Nahuatl as documented in colonial times.|$|E

5|$|Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{ten days}} the {{battalion}} {{was involved in}} a series of engagements as they fought to defend the island, with the most notable probably being the bayonet charge that they undertook with the Australian 2/7th Battalion at 42nd Street on 27 May in which 280 Germans were killed, with the Māori accounting for 100. However, {{it soon became clear that}} the garrison on Crete would need to be evacuated and on 28 May the bulk of Creforce began to disengage the Germans and begin the retreat towards Sfakia. The 5th Infantry Brigade took turns with two Australian battalions and the commandos of Layforce to carry out a rearguard action to guard the pass through which the troops had to traverse in order to escape.|$|E
