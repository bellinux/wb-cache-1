The new gas-cooled Calder Hall reactors {{on the site}} had just received a delivery of 25 tonnes of liquid carbon dioxide and this was rigged up to the <b>charge</b> <b>face</b> of Windscale Pile 1, but there were problems getting it to the fire in useful quantities.

The cost of the package increased to $625 - $750 if the customer wanted a game ticket with a face value of $125. The Patriots determined that the service violated its policy prohibiting season ticket holders from reselling their tickets to third parties except through the team's own ticket exchange, where sellers are required to <b>charge</b> <b>face</b> value.

40|$|Although plasma {{membrane}} domains, such as caveolae, provide an organizing principle for signaling pathways and cholesterol homeostasis in the cell, relatively {{little is known}} regarding specific mechanisms, whereby intracellular lipid-binding proteins are targeted to caveolae. Therefore, the interaction between caveolin- 1 and sterol carrier protein- 2 (SCP- 2), a protein that binds and transfers both cholesterol and signaling lipids (e. g., phosphatidylinositides and sphingolipids), was examined by yeast two-hybrid, in vitro binding and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses. Results of the in vivo and in vitro assays identified {{for the first time}} the N-terminal amino acids (aa) 1 − 32 amphipathic α helix of SCP- 2 functionally interacted with caveolin- 1. This interaction was independent of the classic caveolin- 1 scaffolding domain, in which many signaling proteins interact. Instead, SCP- 2 bound caveolin- 1 through a new domain identified in the N-terminal domain of caveolin- 1 between aa 34 − 40. Modeling studies suggested that electrostatic interactions between the SCP- 2 N-terminal aa 1 − 32 amphipathic α-helical domain (cationic, positively <b>charged</b> <b>face)</b> and the caveolin- 1 N-terminal aa 33 − 59 α helix (anionic, negatively <b>charged</b> <b>face)</b> may significantly contribute to this interaction. These findings provide new insights on how SCP- 2 enhances cholesterol retention within the cell as well as regulates the distribution of signaling lipids, such as phosphoinositides and sphingolipids, at {{plasma membrane}} caveolae...|$|R
