25|$|In 1485, Saxony was split. A <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> of the Wettin princes {{received}} what {{later became}} Thuringia and founded several small states there (see Ernestine duchies). The remaining Saxon state became still {{more powerful and}} was known in the 18th century for its cultural achievements, although it was politically weaker than Prussia and Austria, states which oppressed Saxony {{from the north and}} south, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Cyrus's son, Cambyses II, {{conquered the}} last major power of the region, ancient Egypt, causing the {{collapse}} of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. Since he became ill and died before, or while, leaving Egypt, stories developed, as related by Herodotus, that he was struck down for impiety against the ancient Egyptian deities. The winner, Darius I, based his claim on membership in a <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> of the Achaemenid Empire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the absence of children, the next most senior member of the <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> (for example, a younger sibling of the {{previous}} monarch) becomes monarch. In complex cases, this can mean that there are closer blood relatives to the deceased monarch than the next in line according to primogeniture. This has often led, especially in Europe in the Middle Ages, to conflict between the principle of primogeniture and the principle of proximity of blood.|$|E

25|$|Her mother Namahana was the {{daughter}} of Peleuli, daughter of High Chief Kalaʻimamahu, half-brother of Kamehameha I. Her grandmother was the half-sister of Kuhina Nui Kekāuluohi thus making her a second cousin of King Lunalilo. It was alleged that she was betrothed to Lunalilo but eloped instead with Jesse Crowningburg. After Lunalilo's death during his short reign as King, Auhea was considered to have a claim to the throne herself. In fact, her descent from a <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> of the House of Kamehameha made her granddaughters possible claimants to the Crown Lands of Hawaii during the Hawaiian Territorial days.|$|E
25|$|Ishme-Dagan II (c. 1526 BC – c. 1510 BC), son and {{successor}} of Shamshi-Adad II, was {{a rather}} obscure ruler of Assyria {{in the midst of}} a dark age. He is only known from the Assyrian King List. The relationship with his successor is uncertain as the copies describe Shamshi-Adad III’s father as Ishme-Dagan II, the brother of Sharma-Adad II, who was in turn the son of Shu-Ninua. This Ishme-Dagan, however, has his filiation clearly given as son of Shamshi-Adad II. This led Yamada to suggest that Shamshi-Adad III’s father was a different homonymous individual from a <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> of descent from Shu-Ninua.|$|E
500|$|The wish of Shabdrung {{to build}} a temple here, however, was {{fulfilled}} during the 4th Druk Desi Tenzin Rabgye (1638–96), the first, and only successor of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel (Zhabs-drung Ngag-dbang rNam-rgyal), [...] "a distant cousin from a <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> descending from the 15th century ‘crazy saint’ Drukpa Kunley". During {{his visit to the}} sacred cave of Taktsang Pel Phuk during the Tshechu season of 1692 he laid the foundation for building the temple dedicated to Guru Rinpoche called the ‘Temple of the Guru with Eight Names’ (’gu ru mtshan brgyad lha-khang). It was a decision taken by Tenzin Rabgye while standing at the cave overlooking the Paro valley. At this time, he was leading the Tshechu festival of religious dances. At that time the only temples reported to be in existence, at higher elevations, were the Zangdo Pelri (Zongs mdog dPalri) and Ugyen Tsemo (Urgyan rTse-mo).|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{belonging}} to a <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> of the counts of Berg at Altena, the territory emerged {{under the name of}} Berg-Altena in 1160. About 1198 Count Frederick I purchased the Mark Oberhof, a parish land (Feldmark) on the territory of the Edelherren of Rüdenberg, liensmen of the Cologne archbishop Philip von Heinsberg. Here Frederick had the Mark Castle (Burg Mark) erected as the residence of the new [...] "Counts of the Mark". The nearby town of Hamm was founded by his son Adolf I, Count of the Mark in 1226, it soon became most important settlement of the county and was often used as residence.|$|E
2500|$|His son, Elector Frederick Augustus II (1733–63), was {{received}} into the Catholic Church on 28 November 1712, at Bologna, Italy, while heir-apparent. With this conversion, which {{on account of}} the excited state of feeling of the Lutheran population had to be kept secret for five years, the ruling family of Saxony once more became Catholic. Before this, individual members of the Albertine line had returned to the Romanist church, but they had died without issue, as did the last rulers of Saxe-Merseburg (in 1738) and Saxe-Weissenfels (died out in 1746). Another <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> founded in 1657 was that of Saxe-Zeitz, which became extinct in 1759. Those who became Catholics of this line were Christian Augustus (died 1725), cardinal and Archbishop of Gran (Esztergom, Hungary) and Maurice Adolphus, Bishop of Leitmeritz in Bohemia (died 1759).|$|E

50|$|Peerage was {{normally}} hereditary in {{the male}} line, though the king could extend it to the female line and even to the <b>collateral</b> <b>lines.</b> It was extinguished with aristocratic lineage that had benefited from the creation.

60|$|And first, {{as it is}} a very natural, so I can by {{no means}} think it an {{unreasonable}} opinion, that the sons or near relations of Aldermen, and other deserving citizens, should be duly regarded as proper competitors for an employment in the city's disposal, provided they be equally qualified with other candidates; and provided that such employments require no more than common abilities, and common honesty. But in the choice of a Recorder, the case is entirely different. He ought to be a person of good abilities in his calling; of an unspotted character; an able practitioner; one who hath occasionally merited of this city before; he ought to be of some maturity in years; a member of Parliament, and likely to continue so; regular in his life; firm in his loyalty to the Hanover succession; indulgent to tender consciences; but, at the same time, a firm adherer to the established church. If he be such a one who hath already sat in Parliament, it ought to be inquired of what weight he was there; whether he voted on all occasions for the good of his country; and particularly for advancing the trade and freedom of this city; whether he be engaged in any faction, either national or religious; and, lastly, whether he be a man of courage, not to be drawn from his duty by the frown or menaces of power, nor capable to be corrupted by allurements or bribes.--These, and many other particulars, are of infinitely more consequence, than that single circumstance of being descended by a direct or <b>collateral</b> <b>line</b> from any Alderman, or distinguished citizen, dead or alive.|$|E
