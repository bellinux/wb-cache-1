40|$|The likely {{distributive}} effects of imposing annual net worth <b>taxes</b> or <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>taxes</b> in Canada are analyzed. The conceptual basis {{of such an}} exercise is discussed. Calculations of possible short-run impacts of an annual wealth tax on income and wealth distribution are then performed. These show a moderate equalizing effect in the upper tail for income, but a small initial effect for wealth distribution. Careful design is required to avoid a regressive effect in the lower tail. A shift in tax burdens towards the old is found under all variants of wealth tax studied. The paper concludes by discussing long-run effects, not captured in the calculations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{stochastic}} general equilibrium {{models that}} include policy rules for government spending, lump-sum transfers, and distortionary taxation on labor and capital income and on consumption expenditures are fit to U. S. data under {{a variety of}} specifications of fiscal policy rules. We obtain several results. First, the best fitting model allows a rich set of fiscal instruments to respond to stabilize debt. Second, responses of aggregate variables to fiscal policy shocks under rich fiscal rules can vary considerably from responses that allow only non-distortionary fiscal instruments to finance debt. Third, based on estimated policy rules, <b>transfers,</b> <b>capital</b> <b>tax</b> rates, and government spending have historically responded strongly to government debt, while labor taxes have responded more weakly. Fourth, all components of the intertemporal condition linking debt to expected discounted surpluses—transfers, spending, tax revenues, and discount factors—display instances where their expected movements are important in establishing equilibrium. Fifth, debt-financed fiscal shocks trigger long lasting dynamics so that short-run multipliers can differ markedly from long-run multipliers, even in their signs...|$|R

This was the UK model before the Inheritance Tax in 1986 was introduced, when estates were charged to a form of gift tax called <b>Capital</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Tax.</b> Where a jurisdiction has both gift tax and inheritance tax, it is usual to exempt inheritances from gift tax. Also, it is common for inheritance taxes to share some features of gift taxes, by taxing some transfers which happen during the lifetime of the giver rather than on death.

5000|$|With {{increasing}} Death Duty (later {{known as}} estate duty, <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> and inheritance tax) being levied {{on the wealthy}} in the late 19th century many were forced to sell off their large country houses and estates {{to pay for their}} tax liabilities. [...] This often resulted in unique family collections of antiques and works of art being lost and dispersed. [...] The 1896 Finance Act sought to limit the damage by exempting nationally important works of art from taxation and was strengthened by the 1903 establishment of the National Art Collections Fund which sought to acquire important paintings for the nation. [...] Houses and collections continued to be sold however and David Lloyd George's People's Budget of 1909, with its increased land and estate taxes, would have worsened matters.

The agreed taxes subjected to autonomous regulations, whose exaction corresponds to the Foral Treasuries, cover the main direct taxes and some indirect ones: Personal Income Tax (IRPF), the Extraordinary Wealth Tax, Corporation Tax (with autonomous regulations for companies operating exclusively in the Basque Country; State regulations are applied to those also operating outside the Basque Country, without detriment to the payment of taxes in the Basque Country due to the so-called “relative volume of business”), and the Inheritance and Gift Tax. Amongst the indirect taxes agreement was reached on the <b>Capital</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Tax,</b> Stamp Duty, the Tax on Company Traffic (Impuesto de Tráfico de Empresas) and the Luxury Tax, Special taxes (telephones and refreshments) and taxes on gaming.

40|$|M. Comm. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the desirability of implementing of a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> in South Africa. The implementation of a <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> system in South Africa should generate additional income without placing a further administrative or financial burden on the South African Revenue Services. A system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> will replace the current system of donation tax and estate duty in South Africa. Any new system will be based on the principles established by these two forms of taxation, but should simultaneously address many of the loopholes in these two systems. Since the Margo Commission's recommendation in 1986 that South Africa should implement a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax,</b> much has been written about this form of capital tax but the government has never implemented the recommendations. However, it is certain that a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> will be implemented in South Africa in the future. The current system of donation tax and estate duty is not effective in levying the taxes and earning the income for the government for which it was originally designed. Over the years numerous ways have been developed to legally avoid these taxes, which is why they are referred to as voluntary taxes (Anon, 1988 : 17). This dissertation consists of three parts: The first part is a literature study in which capital taxes are discussed. The distinction between income and capital is reviewed. The various forms of capital taxes are identified and the arguments for and against introducing one of them are discussed. This part concludes with arguments for and against a system of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> for South Africa. The second part is an analysis of donation tax and estate duty as currently levied in South Africa. The shortcomings of the current legislation are discussed and legal ways to avoid estate duty are identified. The inheritance tax system in the UK and the donation tax and estate duty system in the USA are also briefly discussed. The anti-avoidance measures implemented in these countries are discussed in some detail in view of recommendations to implement similar measures in South Africa. In the third part a <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> system for South Africa is proposed. Precautions to minimise the avoidance of these taxes through interest-free loans and generation-skipping devises are discussed. Finally a conclusion is reached regarding the matters analysed in this dissertation...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the role of the}} estate, gift and generation-skipping <b>transfer</b> <b>taxes</b> within the federal tax system has become {{increasingly}} controversial. The future of the <b>transfer</b> <b>taxes</b> remains unsettled, despite recently enacted legislation that moves in the direction of repeal with a delayed effective date. This paper looks at <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> repeal in terms of its repercussions {{on the rest of the}} tax system, with special emphasis on the income tax treatment of property transferred by gift or bequest. Repeal of the <b>transfer</b> <b>taxes</b> would reduce the progressivity of the overall tax system, exacerbate existing inequities with respect to transfers of appreciated property, and sharpen the need for income tax reform. In response, Congress could impose a deathtime gains tax, adopt a carryover basis regime, or conceivably tax gifts and bequests as income to the recipient. Each of these alternatives raises significant issues of structure and implementation which deserve closer scrutiny. In all likelihood, Congress will reconsider the issue of <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> repeal during the next ten years. Instead of focusing narrowly on the shortcomings of the existing <b>transfer</b> <b>taxes,</b> the debate should include careful weighing of the potential advantages and disadvantages of the available alternatives...|$|R

40|$|The World Bank ranks Nigeria 125 th out of 183 {{economies in}} the world over {{the cost of doing}} {{business}} in the country. A major parameter for this assessment is using the incidences of regulatory controls and taxation of business activity to determine the ease of doing business in Nigeria (Humphrey, 2010). Taxation is the system of raising money by making corporate organizations and individuals, whether alive or dead, pay taxes and levies. It is interesting to note that even the dead pay taxes on their investments like: dividend on shares or estate, which they leave behind, in form of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer,</b> <b>tax</b> on properties bequeathed by the dead to children, relatives, among others. Taxation is a compulsory extraction of money by a public authority for public purposes such as providing conducive conditions for achievement of vision 2020 goals. It is a system of raising money for the purpose of government by means of contribution from individual persons or corporate bodies (Lekan and Sunday, 2006).

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Tax)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Death {{and taxes}} are unavoidable. In {{terms of the}} current {{legislation}} both estate duty and capital gains tax (hereinafter referred to as 'CGT') are levied upon death. The South African National Treasury is reconsidering taxes on death as estate duty contributes minuscule revenue, and its administration is cumbersome. Worldwide taxation is based on either source or residence. Because of the R 3 500 000 exemption from estate duty, only wealthy individuals are generally subject to estate duty. Wealthy individuals {{make use of the}} annual R 4 000 000 foreign investment capital allowance by owning offshore property. The aim {{of this study is to}} document how death taxes are currently levied on an estate which holds offshore property, given the perception that foreign property is exempt from death duties, and also to consider the impact on taxes payable on offshore property at death if estate duty were to be abolished. These objectives cannot be achieved without a thorough understanding of the development and future of estate duty, the impact of CGT on death, how selected foreign countries levy taxes upon death, and how residents of South Africa are taxed on property situated within foreign countries. When CGT was introduced in 2001 the estate duty rate was reduced and it is likely that, if estate duty is repealed, the rate of CGT will be increased. In South Africa, residents are taxed on worldwide income and capital gains. The international perspective is that the foreign country has the sovereignty to levy taxes on a person who owns property situated within its boundaries. An estate which holds offshore property may also be subject to estate duty in terms of the tax law of that country which results in double taxation in the hands of the deceased estate. South Africa has concluded international agreements with a number of foreign countries through double tax agreements and estate tax treaties to prevent double taxation. In terms of the Estate Duty Act, and in some of the treaties, a rebate is allowed in respect of foreign estate taxes paid. However, if estate duty is abolished, the deceased estate may be liable for estate tax in the foreign country where the assets are situated and the deceased estate may not qualify for any rebate in South Africa in respect of foreign taxes paid. Hence, the abolition may have detrimental consequences on the liquidity requirements, and on the heirs, in cases where offshore property is involved. It is vital that proper estate and tax planning advice is given before a resident acquires offshore property as the tax implications may be enormous. The current impact of estate duty and CGT on a resident who owns offshore assets is that the said taxes will be levied either here in South Africa or in the foreign country. The effect of <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> on a resident with an offshore asset can never be underestimated. Master...|$|E
