40|$|The spin <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomena</b> and the {{possibility}} of their observation in nanomagnetic insulators attract more and more attention in the last several years. Recently {{it has been shown that}} in these systems in large transverse magnetic field there can be a fairly narrow "coherence window" for phonon and nuclear spin-mediated decoherence. What kind of spin dynamics can then be expected in this window in a crystal of magnetic nanomolecules coupled to phonons, to nuclear spin bath and it to each other via dipole-dipole interactions? Studying multispin correlations, we determine the region of parameters where "coherent clusters" of collective spin excitations can appear. Although two particular systems, namely crystals of $Fe_ 8 $-triazacyclonane and $Mn_{ 12 }$-acetate molecules, are used in this work to illustrate the results, here we are not trying to predict an existence of collective coherent dynamics in some particular system. Instead, we discuss the way how any crystalline system of dipole-dipole coupled nanomolecules can be analyzed to decide whether this system is suitable for attempts to observe coherent dynamics. The presented analysis can be useful in the search for magnetic systems showing the spin <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|X-ray diffuse {{scattering}} (XDS) is used {{to detect}} the lateral structure of organic multilayers of Cd-stearte. XDS from the 30 -layer sample reveals a <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomenon</b> dependent on, the half angle between the incident beam and the reflected beam direction: for small, distortions within metallic layers are interpreted as height fluctuations. For increasing, these distortions are seen as mosaicity due to the decrease of the lateral coherence length of x-rays. Usually, the only effect of the finite instrumental resolution {{is considered to be}} line broadening of XDS signals. Additionally, we show that the decreasing lateral coherence length of x-rays leads to incoherent scattering from samples. As a striking consequence in scattering experiments, the interpretation of real structure features of samples can change.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{phenomenon}} of color coherence in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), its implications for hard and soft processes with nuclei, and its experimental manifestations. The relation of factorization theorems in QCD with color <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomena</b> in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and color <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomena</b> in hard exclusive processes is emphasized. Analyzing numerically the QCD evolution equation for conventional and skewed parton densities in nuclei, we study the onset of generalized color transparency and nuclear shadowing of the sea quark and gluon distributions in nuclei as well as related phenomena. Such novel results as the dependence of the effective coherence length on $Q^ 2 $ and general trends of the QCD evolution are discussed. The limits of {{the applicability of the}} QCD evolution equation at small Bjorken $x$ are estimated by comparing the inelastic quark-antiquark- and two gluon-nucleon (nucleus) cross sections, calculated within the DGLAP approximation, with the dynamical boundaries, which follow from the unitarity of the $S$ matrix for purely QCD interactions. We also demonstrate that principles of color coherence {{play an important role in}} the processes of soft diffraction off nuclei. Comment: 58 pages, 19 figures, Revtex.

40|$|The {{ability to}} live in {{coherent}} superpositions is a signature trait of quantum systems and constitutes an irreplaceable resource for quantum-enhanced technologies. However, decoherence effects usually destroy quantum superpositions. It has been recently predicted that, in a composite quantum system exposed to dephasing noise, quantum coherence in a transversal reference basis can stay protected for indefinite time. This can occur for a class of quantum states independently of the measure used to quantify coherence, and requires no control on the system during the dynamics. Here, such an invariant <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is observed experimentally in two different setups based on nuclear magnetic resonance at room temperature, realising an effective quantum simulator of two- and four-qubit spin systems. Our study further reveals a novel interplay between coherence and various forms of correlations, and highlights the natural resilience of quantum effects in complex systems.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comprehensive}} analysis of the <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of two coupled dissipative oscillators. The action of a classical driving field {{on one of the}} oscillators is also analyzed. Master equations are derived for both regimes of weakly and strongly interacting oscillators from which interesting results arise concerning the coherence properties of the joint and the reduced system states. The strong coupling regime is required to achieve a large frequency shift of the oscillator normal modes, making it possible to explore the whole profile of the spectral density of the reservoirs. We show how the decoherence process may be controlled by shifting the normal mode frequencies to regions of small spectral density of the reservoirs. Different spectral densities of the reservoirs are considered and their effects on the decoherence process are analyzed. For oscillators with different damping rates, we show that the worse-quality system is improved and vice-versa, a result which could be useful for quantum state protection. State recurrence and swap dynamics are analyzed as well as their roles in delaying the decoherence process. Comment: 22 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|There {{appears to}} be an as yet unexplained form and level in {{coherence}} in the various domains of nature. This anomalous phenomenon involves a quasi-instant transmission of an active kind of information that correlates entities across space and over time. The first part of this paper presents evidence that this nonlocal form of coherence is widespread in nature, occurring in the microdomain of the quantum, in the macrodomain of the universe, {{as well as in the}} mesodomains of life and mind. The second part argues (i) that the nonlocal <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is logically interpreted as the transmission of “in-formation, ” a non-vectorial yet physically effective form of information, and (ii) that this transmission is realistically viewed as the effect of a universal in-formation field in nature. The Principal Proposition This paper presents evidence that phenomena obtain in the principal domains of observation that cannot be adequately explained in reference to presently recognized fields. The phenomena consist of a form of coherence that presupposes the transmission of information beyond the known physical or physico-chemical channels.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{as a result}} of the interference of the probability amplitude terms is among the principle features of quantum mechanics concepts. Current experiments display the presence of quantum techniques whose coherence is supplied over large interval times. Specifically, photosynthetic mechanisms in light-harvesting complexes furnish oscillatory behaviors owing to quantum coherence. In this manuscript, we study the coherent quantum energy transfer for a single-excitation and nonlocal correlation in a dimer system (donor+acceptor) displayed by two-level systems (TLSs), interacting with a cavity field with a time-dependent coupling effect considering the realistic situation of coupling between each TLS and the cavity field. We analyze and explore the specific conditions which are viable with real experimental realization for the ultimate transfer of quantum energy and nonlocal quantum correlation. We show that the enhancement of the probability for a single-excitation energy transfer greatly benefits from the energy detuning, photon-number transition, classicality of the field, and the time-dependent coupling effect. We also find that the entanglement between the donor and acceptor is very sensitive to the physical parameters and it can be generated during the coherent energy transfer...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{observed}} fast developments in neutral atomic vapor based quantum information storage technology. The technique utilizes light {{fields in the}} optical wavelength region as signal carrier and retriever and neutral atomic systems (e. g. single atoms, ensembles of atoms, atom-like defects in solids) as storage media. Photons are robust carriers of information due to their high velocity (c = 2. 998 x 108 m/s) and ease of transportation (they propagate rectilinearly with low loss). Their high mobility, however, makes it a challenging task to spatially localize and therefore store them. Atoms (or atom-like systems), on the other hand, can be easily localized in space while providing quantum states accessible to photons and therefore are ideal candidates for storage media. Electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) is a light-induced atomic <b>coherence</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that dramatically modifies the optical properties of an atomic medium to a weak probe field by {{the application of a}} strong coupling field.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive {{imaging technique}} {{based on the}} use of light sources exhibiting a low degree of coherence. Low coherence interferometric microscopes have been successful in producing internal images of thin pieces of biological tissue; typically samples of the order of 1 milimeter in depth have been imaged, with a resolution of the order of 10 to 20 microns in some portions of the sample. In this thesis, I deal with the imaging problem of determining the internal structure of a body from backscattered laser light and low-coherence interferometry. In detail, I formulate and solve an inverse problem which, using the interference fringes that result as the back-scattering of low-coherence light is made to interfere with a reference beam, produces maps detailing the values of the refractive index within the imaged sample. Unlike previous approaches to this imaging problem, the solver I introduce does not require processing at data collection time, and it can therefore produce solutions for inverse problems of multi-layered structures containing thousands of layers from back-scattering interference fringes only.
