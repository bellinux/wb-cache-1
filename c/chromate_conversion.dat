50|$|The {{corrosion}} protection is {{primarily due to}} the anodic potential dissolution of zinc versus iron. Zinc acts as a sacrificial anode for protecting iron (steel). While steel is close to -400 mV, depending on alloy composition, electroplated zinc is much more anodic with -980 mV. Steel is preserved from corrosion by cathodic protection. Alloying zinc with cobalt or nickel at levels less than 1% has minimal effect on the potential; but both alloys improve {{the capacity of the}} zinc layer to develop a <b>chromate</b> film by <b>conversion</b> coating.

The reason for combining the processes can vary, however, the significant difference between anodizing and <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coating is the electrical conductivity of the films produced.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} {{study of}} the adsorption of an epoxy acrylate resin used for UV-cured coatings on two different anticorrosion pretreatments on aluminium alloys relevant to aerospace industry has been undertaken. Aluminium alloy Al 2219 specimens, treated with an inorganic <b>chromate</b> based <b>conversion</b> coating (Alodine 1200 S) and an organic titanium based conversion coating (Nabutan STI/ 310), were immersed in solutions of different concentrations of the resin and adsorption isotherms were determined by assessing the uptake of the adsorbate, {{as a function of}} solution concentration, by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The results show different behaviour for the two substrates, which {{can be attributed to the}} organic component of the titanium based coating. In the case of the inorganic conversion coating a clear plateau is achieved at relatively low concentrations and at a lower level of adsorption than for the hybrid coating. The data for both the coatings conform well to the Langmuir model, the organic coating, as well as showing a higher level of adsorption of the resin, also presents oscillatory behaviour at low concentration, which is shown to be complementary to the behaviour of the reactive diluent included with the epoxy acrylate to aid processing. A discussion of this competitive adsorption of the epoxy resin and the diluent on the different substrates is presented, based on considerations of the chemistry of the systems under investigation...|$|R

Among these new coating materials, sol-gel methods are shown to be environmentally and economically advantageous in producing coatings that can provide effective corrosion protection. This work describes the studies performed for applying a sol-gel method to the production of organic-inorganic hybrid (OIH) coatings over HDGS reinforcement.

40|$|Aluminum alloys, such as Al 6061 -T 6 and Al 7075 -T 6, {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} due to their high strength to weight ratio and good mechanical properties. The corrosion of these alloys, however, is an expensive and critical problem since the alloys are susceptible to pitting and crevice corrosion in marine environments. The most significant environmental factor, which contributes to the corrosion of these alloys, is the chloride ion found in marine environments or water condensed from humid air contaminated with soluble chloride salts. ^ Traditionally, <b>chromate</b> based <b>conversion</b> coatings {{have been used for}} many years for the protection of aluminum alloys. Chromates are efficient corrosion inhibitors for aluminum and its alloys in near neutral marine environments containing aggressive anions such as chlorides. Although the hexavalent chromium ion, Cr 6 +, may be a superior corrosion inhibitor and used in numerous industrial systems, it is environmentally unsafe. Over the past several years, federal agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Defense (DoD), have increasingly limited the use of chromium containing compounds due to their toxic and carcinogenic effects. In addition, there is a direct economic challenge associated with costs for environmental compliance along with increased liability for claims of exposure in the workplace with the continued use of chromates. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify new corrosion inhibitors for aluminum alloys. ^ As an alternate conversion coating, a new titanate conversion coating was researched and developed for the Al 2024 -T 3 alloy and was shown to be effective. The objective of this research was to determine if the coating process could be applied to Al 6061 -T 6 and Al 7075 -T 6. The coating process involves immersion of the alloy in a titante solution bath, which produces a passive film. The corrosion resistance of coated samples has been evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic electrochemical techniques. Electrochemical testing and energy dispersive X-ray analysis indicated that the titanate ion would retard corrosion in a similar manner to the chromate ion if fluoride ions (F-) were not present on the surface. ^ A study was also conducted to determine if Al 6061 -T 6 and Al 7075 -T 6 were easily susceptible to crevice corrosion in a marine environment. The study yielded important results regarding protection of the alloy against crevice corrosion by the titanate ion. Corrosion was only seen on samples not exposed to the titanate ion. A conclusion may be made that titanate coatings appear to be viable alternatives to chromate coatings but further investigation will be required in order to determine an optimum conversion coating bath, which will produce impedance magnitudes comparable to those measured for the Al 2024 -T 3 alloy. ...|$|R

50|$|Pure {{aluminium}} naturally forms a thin {{surface layer}} of aluminium oxide on contact with {{oxygen in the}} atmosphere through a process called oxidation, which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in most environments. Aluminium alloys, however, offer little protection against corrosion. There are three main ways to passivate these alloys: alclading, <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coating and anodizing. Alclading {{is the process of}} metallurgically bonding a thin layer of pure aluminium to the aluminium alloy. <b>Chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coating is a common way of passivating not only aluminum, but also zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys. Anodizing forms a thick oxide coating. This finish is more robust than the other processes and also provides good electrical insulation, which the other two processes do not.|$|E

5000|$|Conversion {{coatings}} are coatings for metals {{where the}} part surface is converted into the coating with a chemical or electro-chemical process.

50|$|<b>Chromate</b> <b>{{conversion}}</b> coating {{is a type}} {{of conversion}} coating used to passivate steel, aluminum, zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys. It is primarily used as a corrosion inhibitor, primer, decorative finish, or to retain electrical conductivity. The process is named after the chromate found in chromic acid, also known as hexavalent chromium, the chemical most widely used in the immersion bath process whereby the coating is applied. However, hexavalent chromium is toxic, thus, highly regulated, so new, non-hexavalent chromium-based processes are becoming more readily available at a commercial level. One alternative contains trivalent chromium. In Europe the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive is commonly referred to regarding elimination of hexavalent chromium in electrical and electronic equipment, and the REACH ("Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals") Directive to wider applications including <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coating processes, paint primers and other preparations.|$|E
50|$|The Cronak {{process is}} a {{conventional}} <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coating process developed in 1933 by The New Jersey Zinc Company.

50|$|The process steps can {{typically}} involve <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coating {{the entire}} component, {{followed by a}} masking of the surface {{in areas where the}} chromate coating must remain intact.

Virtually all chromium ore is processed via hexavalent chromium, specifically the salt sodium dichromate. Approximately 136000 tonne lb of hexavalent chromium were produced in 1985. Additional hexavalent chromium compounds are chromium trioxide and various salts of chromate and dichromate, among others. Hexavalent chromium {{is used in}} textile dyes, wood preservation, anti-corrosion products, <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coatings, {{and a variety of}} niche uses. Industrial uses of hexavalent chromium compounds include chromate pigments in dyes, paints, inks, and plastics; chromates added as anticorrosive agents to paints, primers, and other surface coatings; and chromic acid electroplated onto metal parts to provide a decorative or protective coating. Hexavalent chromium can be formed when performing [...] "hot work" [...] such as welding on stainless steel or melting chromium metal. In these situations the chromium is not originally hexavalent, but the high temperatures involved in the process result in oxidation that converts the chromium to a hexavalent state. Hexavalent chromium can also be found in drinking water and public water systems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{military}} specification {{referred to}} as MIL-DTL-5541, [...] "Military Specification, Chemical Conversion Coatings on Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys" [...] covers chemical conversion coatings formed by the reaction of chemical conversion materials with the surfaces of aluminum and aluminum alloys.

The specification is approved for use by all departments and agencies of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Although prepared specifically for DoD applications, the standard is used for many commercial applications as well. It has gained world wide use across many fields versus the more verbose ISO equivalent (i.e., ISO 8081:1985, Aerospace process, Chemical conversion coating for aluminum alloys, General purpose). Note that <b>chromate</b> <b>conversion</b> coatings {{have been used for}} over 50 years as treatment to coated or as-fabricated surfaces to boost corrosion resistance and provide a good basis for the subsequent application of paint. However, these treatments use hexavalent chromium chemicals that are extremely toxic.
