5000|$|A <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> is a <b>box</b> {{container}} for <b>cigar</b> packaging. Traditionally <b>cigar</b> <b>boxes</b> {{have been made}} of wood, cardboard or paper.

50|$|It {{would seem}} that the {{earliest}} <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> instruments would be crude and primitive, but this is not always the case. According to William Jehle, curator of The <b>Cigar</b> <b>Box</b> Guitar Museum and the author of One Man's Trash: A History of the <b>Cigar</b> <b>Box</b> Guitar, the museum acquired two <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> fiddles built in 1886 and 1889 that seem very playable and well built. The 1886 fiddle was made for an 8-year-old boy and is certainly playable, but the 1889 fiddle has a well-carved neck and slotted violin headstock. The latter instrument was made for serious playing.|$|R
5000|$|Trace {{evidence}} of <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> instruments exists from 1840 to the 1860s.

The etching was created by illustrator and artist Edwin Forbes, who, under the banner of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, worked for the Union Army. The etching was included in Forbes's work Life Stories of the Great Army. In the etching, the fiddle clearly shows the brand [...] "Figaro" [...] on the <b>cigar</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Speal {{built his}} first <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> guitar on July 3, 1993 using a {{cardboard}} Swisher Sweets <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> and a plank of oak from his farm after reading {{an article about}} Carl Perkins' <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> guitar in a 1976 issue of Guitar Player magazine. His inspiration was to find an instrument that would give him music [...] "deeper than the Delta blues." [...] In the next six years, Speal went on to build over 200 more <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> guitars under the brand Catfish Music Works, perfecting a crude poplar stick-thru-wood box design and even achieving endorsements from Warren Haynes and the late Alan Woody from Gov't Mule/Allman Brothers. Speal would sell his instruments in consignment stores and cigar shops along with having the first known website for <b>cigar</b> <b>box</b> guitars in 1998, www.catfishmusicworks.com.|$|R
