5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{proceeded}} {{to clear the}} bunkers. They utilized flamethrower teams, which had a visible psychological impact on the fort's garrison. At one point, the Egyptians, {{with the help of}} a wounded Israeli prisoner, managed to secure a bunker by convincing the panicked Israelis inside to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> surrender. Soon after losing contact with the fort, the Israelis attempted to reach it once more. By this time, Malhov was dead. A group of tanks from Baluza advanced to Lahtzanit, but the Sa'iqa company occupying the firing ramp managed to destroy two tanks, forcing the remainder to retreat. Another group of tanks and half-tracks tried to break through the southern isolation force, but were ambushed and withdrew after losing a tank.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go to the}} Shipley {{house and}} find the {{bathroom}} door barricaded shut, no sign of any people. The two have a brief run-in with Deputy Greer who believes they are burglars until Mulder disarms the man and Scully shows him her FBI ID. They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Rey Mysterio versus Eddie Guerrero in a singles match. Two {{months prior to}} Judgment Day, at WrestleMania 21, Rey Mysterio defeated Eddie Guerrero. In the weeks that followed, Guerrero and Mysterio were challenged by MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina) to defend the WWE Tag Team Championship, which Guerrero and Mysterio accepted. MNM defeated Guerrero and Mysterio to win the WWE Tag Team title after Guerrero walked {{out in the middle}} of the match. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Mysterio were given a rematch for the Tag Team championship. During the match, however, Mysterio accidentally performed a flying body press on Guerrero which led to Guerrero abandoning Mysterio, but returned as the fans urged Guerrero to come back. MNM retained the belt after pinning Mysterio for the win. The following week, Teddy Long booked a Street Fight match, a match without disqualifications and where scoring conditions can occur anywhere, between Mysterio and Guerrero's nephew, Chavo Guerrero. Mysterio came out as the winner of the match. After the match, Mercury and Nitro attacked Mysterio, which prompted Guerrero to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> clear the ring. Guerrero, however, attacked Mysterio. The assault led to Guerrero lifting Mysterio off the ground and driving Mysterio's back on the ring steps. This angle saw Guerrero turn into a villain. As a result, the following week, Long promoted a match between Guerrero and Mysterio at Judgment Day.|$|E

Michaels returned during Orton's appreciation ceremony and hit him with Sweet Chin Music, when Orton {{was going to hit}} Michaels with the WWE Championship belt. Afterwards, a match was made for Cyber Sunday where Orton would defend the WWE Championship against the fans' choice of either Michaels, Jeff Hardy, or Mr. Kennedy. The next week on Raw, Orton faced his three possible opponents in individual matches. Kennedy interfered and attacked Hardy in his match with Orton. Hardy attacked Kennedy in his match, and Kennedy assaulted Michaels in his match, leading to Hardy making the save. Despite this, Michaels hit Orton with Sweet Chin Music to end the show. On October 22, on Raw, Orton teamed with Kennedy against Michaels and Hardy. Hardy scored the pinfall on Kennedy after a Swanton Bomb. After the match, Michaels hit Orton with Sweet Chin Music for the third week in a row, when Hardy pushed Orton into Michaels when Orton went to deliver Hardy an RKO.|$|E

25|$|The Caviteños {{suffered}} terrible defeat {{because of}} lack of arms and ammunition. As the Spaniards approached the Poblacion, the revolutionaries retreated the stone building of the town. On February 25, 1897, the Spaniards decided to encircle the Poblacion rather go directly to the interior. They started burning all houses except the church. Seeing they were surrounded by fire, some of the rebels went out of hiding but were immediately met by open fire. Those who took refuge at the casa tribunal refused to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> were all burned alive. Even those who took refuge in the church did eventually yield to the advancing Spanish forces. By March, Perez-Dasmariñas had fallen back into the Spanish hand.|$|E

Seth Rollins would then come out to aid Foley, only to be attacked by Triple H. On the March 20 episode of Raw, Stephanie McMahon would fire Foley for his actions the previous week. A few weeks later Foley made an appearance at the 2017 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony.|$|E

25|$|With a German {{offensive}} against Vimy {{or on the}} Lys sector apparently imminent, Tavish Davidson visited Foch at Beauvais (6 April). He asked for a French offensive, or that they take over front {{as far north as}} the Somme, or send French reserves to behind the British front. Haig also wrote to Foch that day. Haig met Foch at Aumale on 7 April; Foch said he wanted an offensive by Rawlinson’s Fourth Army (the former Fifth Army) in cooperation with Debeney’s French First Army. Haig regarded this as a time-wasting tactic as Fourth Army was still in no shape to attack. Foch was willing to deploy 4 French infantry and 3 cavalry divisions near Amiens but not further north. Haig asked Henry Wilson to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> lobby Foch. Foch may have been influenced by a German attack (by General von Boehm’s Seventh Army) against the French (“Archangel”), towards the Oise-Aisne Canal on the morning of 7 April, which took more prisoners than the Germans suffered casualties.|$|E
25|$|The Orissa Gazette of 1956 {{mentions}} some occasions {{where the}} devadasis danced. They had two daily rituals. The Bahar Gaaunis would {{dance at the}} Sakaala Dhupa. Lord Jagannath, after breakfast, would give Darshan to the bhaktas (the devotees). In the Main hall, a devadasi accompanied by musicians and the Rajguru, the court guru, would dance, standing near the Garuda sthambha (pillar). This dance could be watched by the audience. They would perform only pure dance here. The Bhitar Gaunis would sing at the Badashringhar, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. Lord Jagannath, at bedtime, would be first served by male Sebaets- they would fan Him and decorate Him with flowers. After they would leave, a Bhitar Gaauni would then enter the room, stand near the door (Jaya Vijay) and sing Gita Govinda songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. After a while, she would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> announce that the Lord has gone to sleep and then the guard would close the main gate.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} an Intercontinental Championship match between Faarooq and the champion, The Rock. After Faarooq made his entrance, Howard Finkel {{announced}} The Rock's entrance; however, {{he did not}} <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> after a second announcement, Commissioner Slaughter came out and gave The Rock ten seconds to come out. If The Rock failed to come out, he would be stripped of the championship. After Slaughter counted to two, The Rock came out wearing a neck brace, from the earlier attack, and before {{he was able to}} get into the ring, Faarooq attacked The Rock in the aisle. After they entered the ring, the two wrestlers fought back and forth until Faarooq Spinebustered The Rock, and attempted to pin him, but The Rock broke the pin at a two count after he placed his foot on the bottom ring rope. As Faarooq argued with the referee, The Rock retaliated by rolling up Faarooq into a pinfall to retain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
