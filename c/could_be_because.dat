5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply because the wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|In 793 the {{vulnerability}} of the English east coast was exposed when the monastery at Lindisfarne was looted by Vikings and a year later Jarrow was also attacked, events which Steven Plunkett reasons would ensure that the East Anglians were governed firmly. Æthelberht's claim to be a king descended from the Wuffingas dynasty (suggested by the use of a Roman she-wolf and the title REX on his coins) <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of a need for strong kingship {{as a result of the}} Viking attacks.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because,</b> at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E

25|$|Discrepancy in vowel {{category}} {{significantly reduced}} {{the magnitude of}} the McGurk effect for fusion responses. Auditory /a/ tokens dubbed onto visual /i/ articulations were more compatible than the reverse. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> /a/ has a wide range of articulatory configurations whereas /i/ is more limited, which makes it much easier for subjects to detect discrepancies in the stimuli. /i/ vowel contexts produce the strongest effect, while /a/ produces a moderate effect, and /u/ has almost no effect.|$|E
25|$|The Book of Revelation (7:4–8), {{mentions}} that {{people from the}} twelve tribes of Israel will be sealed. The selection of the twelve tribes {{does not include the}} names of Ephraim and Dan, although their names were used for the twelve tribes that settled in the Promised Land. It has been suggested that this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of their pagan practices. This made Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome and a few Millennialists propose that the Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan.|$|E

25|$|Faroese retains many {{similarities}} but {{is influenced}} by Danish, Norwegian, and Gaelic (Scottish and/or Irish). Although Swedish, Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most, they still retain asymmetric mutual intelligibility. Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by Middle Low German.|$|E
25|$|When a dipole with an {{unbalanced}} feedline such as {{coaxial cable}} {{is used for}} transmitting, the shield side of the cable, {{in addition to the}} antenna, radiates. This can induce radio frequency (RF) currents into other electronic equipment near the radiating feedline, causing RF interference. Furthermore, the antenna is not as efficient as it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> it is radiating closer to the ground and its radiation pattern may be asymmetrically distorted. To prevent this, dipoles fed by coaxial cables have a balun between the cable and the antenna, to convert the unbalanced signal provided by the coax to a balanced symmetrical signal for the antenna.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{eminence}} and influence, one criticism {{leveled against}} Yashovijaya {{is that he}} {{is best known for his}} Navya-Nyaya commentaries of earlier existing works rather than his own original works. Furthermore, his works on Yoga, dhyana, grammar and poetry did not gain much fame, as the works of Haribhadra and Hemacandra on these topics were already established and famous by the time Yashovijaya came on the scene. His fame largely rests on his mastery of navyanyaya, for which he had no contemporary rival. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because,</b> for almost six centuries between Hemacandra and Yashovijaya, Jainism did not produce any able scholar on philosophy of nyaya.|$|E

25|$|Adolescence {{shows an}} {{increase}} in self-esteem that continues to increase in young adulthood and middle age. A decrease is seen from middle age to old age with varying findings on {{whether it is a}} small or large decrease. Reasons for the variability <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of differences in health, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status in old age. No differences have been found between males and females in their development of self-esteem.

25|$|Sexual abuse, {{is defined}} by World Health Organization as any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, {{unwanted}} sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person’s sexuality using coercion. It also includes obligatory inspections for virginity and female genital mutilation. Aside from initiation of the sexual act through physical force, sexual abuse occurs {{if a person is}} unable to understand the nature or condition of the act, unable to decline participation, or unable to communicate unwillingness to engage in the sexual act. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of underage immaturity, illness, disability, or the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or due to intimidation or pressure.|$|E
25|$|The major {{competitor}} for the Panorama Elite III was the Duple Dominant launched at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show in London. The Duple was of all steel {{design and}} built at Duple's Blackpool factory. The Dominant had {{many of the}} design cues of the Panorama Elite and that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the managing director {{at that time was}} an ex Plaxton employee. The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The mere fact that at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn't have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple's most important launch for years.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of nests {{had one or}} more females that were unrelated, especially in the winter before nests are formed and workers born. The nests tend to form from foundresses of different nests from previous years. The foundresses are also found overwintering with other wasp species, showing why unrelated wasps are found during winter. However, after winter when the nests are starting to be formed, an increase in relatedness in the nests is seen, which could result from foundresses searching for more related sisters, instead of unrelated wasps. After winter, as wasps leave their winter areas and return to their nests, an increase in relatedness occurs in the early nest phase. In later stages of the nest, more unrelated wasps are found, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> new wasps join established nests.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{example of}} emergence in web-based systems is social bookmarking (also called collaborative tagging). In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which {{gives rise to}} a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, {{even in the absence of}} a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.|$|E
25|$|As of June 2014, 50 giant planets {{have been}} {{discovered}} around giant stars. However, these giant planets are more massive than the giant planets found around solar-type stars. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> giant stars are more massive than the Sun (less massive stars will still be on the main sequence and will not have become giants yet) and more massive stars {{are expected to have}} more massive planets. However, the masses of the planets that have been found around giant stars do not correlate with the masses of the stars; therefore, the planets could be growing in mass during the stars' red giant phase. The growth in planet mass could be partly due to accretion from stellar wind, although a much larger effect would be Roche lobe overflow causing mass-transfer from the star to the planet when the giant expands out to the orbital distance of the planet.|$|E

25|$|Internet {{connectivity}} also varies {{a lot by}} State. In 2011, the US Census Bureau {{conducted a}} survey to determine internet access in each State. New Hampshire reported {{the highest rate of}} Internet access, with only 20.3% reporting no internet access at home or elsewhere. Mississippi reported the lowest rate of access, with 41.0% of people reporting no internet access at home or elsewhere. As a general trend {{it is easy to see}} that Appalachian and Southern States in general have a much lower rate of Internet usage when compared to other regions. This correlates greatly with the average income of those states. Lower income states reporting lower rates of usage, and higher income states reporting higher rates of connectivity. Also it may be a matter of population density. There are a lot more disconnected individuals in states with many counties of low population density. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Internet Service Providers are less likely to make a profit in these areas.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two methods}} of encoding/remembering music. The first process {{is known as}} {{relative}} pitch, which refers to a person's ability to identify the intervals between given tones. Therefore, the song is learned as a continuous succession of intervals. Some people can also use absolute pitch in the process; this is ability to name or replicate a tone without reference to an external standard. Relative pitch has also been credited by some with being the more sophisticated of the two processes as it allows for quick recognition regardless of pitch, timbre or quality, as well as having the ability to produce physiological responses, for example, if the melody violates the learned relative pitch. Relative pitch {{has been shown to}} develop at varying rates dependent on culture. Trehub and Schellenberg (2008) found that 5- and 6-year-old Japanese children performed significantly better at a task requiring the utilization of relative pitch than same-aged Canadian children. They hypothesized that this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the Japanese children have more exposure to pitch accent via Japanese language and culture than the predominantly stressed environment Canadian children experience.|$|E
