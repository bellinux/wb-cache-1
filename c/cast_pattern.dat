The <b>casting</b> <b>pattern</b> was machined after generating the NC code on FC 3800 MACH milling machine.

Construction of the <b>casting</b> <b>patterns</b> was undertaken by Liberty Pattern in Youngstown, Ohio using a complex CAD model made of PRR 5550's proposed number four wheelset. Casting of the drivers was awarded to Beaver Valley Alloy in Monaca, Pennsylvania On February 26, 2016, Beaver Valley Alloy cast the first of eight driving wheels at its foundry successfully. This historic event marked the first time a steam locomotive driving wheel had been cast in the United States since the 1940's. A second driver was ordered on December 9, 2016 and was cast by Beaver Valley Alloy on March 6, 2017. The second Boxpok was delivered to the T1 Trust on March 15, 2017 and placed next to the first completed driver. Both drivers represent the number four wheelset.|$|R

40|$|In this research, a rapid {{tool for}} low volume {{production}} {{plastic injection moulding}} is designed, developed, and tested on an injection moulding machine. The tool is designed as a cavity insert of injection mould for plastic parts by an indirect rapid tooling approach. The plastic part is modelled in a CAD system and then built using a Perfactory rapid prototyping (RP) technique. Then a layer of nickel-phosphorous alloy is deposited on the prototype by electroless plating. This nickel plated RP model is then used as a <b>casting</b> <b>pattern.</b> A cavity insert, which is produced by using aluminium filled epoxy resin with the nickel plated <b>casting</b> <b>pattern,</b> is fabricated in a mould	base for injection moulding. Experimental testing on the cavity insert using an injection moulding machine show that the tool is producing quality parts without any noticeable deterioration of the surface. The number of shots completed using the cavity insert is more than 600. Applying electroless nickel plating on the <b>casting</b> <b>pattern</b> made of rapid prototyping material was successful. It was found that pre-treatment processes are crucial. In addition, the rapid prototyping material cannot be plated with nickel without palladium activation and stannous sensitising. Results show that the deposited layer is uniform and composed of both nickel and phosphorous. The surface properties of the nickel and phosphorous deposit enhance the plated layer performance due to their low surface roughness and high lubrication characteristics. Moreover, the nickel-phosphorous layer also improves the surface hardness of the cavity insert since it is left on the cavity after {{the removal of the}} <b>casting</b> <b>pattern.</b> The cavity insert was installed on an industrial injection moulding machine for trials. Results show that the cavity insert performs well with Polyethylene at 170 ˚C at an injection pressure in the range of 80 ~ 100 bar. There are no signs of wear and tear on the cavity insert up to 620 shots. However, when the injection pressure is over 120 bar, cracks start developing in the cavity insert followed by catastrophic fracture. This research has shown that manufacturing an indirect rapid tooling using electroless nickel plating for low volume production of plastic injection mouldings is feasible for Perfactory produced RP models. The cavity insert can be fabricated using commonly available low cost materials within 48 hours...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work reported in this thesis was to tailor a colloidal processing technique called electrophoretic deposition (EPD) for use within the investment casting shell formation process, where the EPD coating procedure {{would be used to}} form the primary ceramic coating on the melt-out substrate. EPD takes place due to the presence of an electric field within the suspension medium, which attracts charged particles in the suspension towards an electrode of opposite charge, onto which they are deposited. For the complex structures created using investment casting, the die <b>cast</b> <b>patterns</b> used as the substrate for the ceramic have to be easily removed, and so substrates materials that can either be melted or dissolved out the material to leave the hollow ceramic shell used. To implement EPD into the investment casting process, this substrate needed to be conducting, and so conducting particle-filled investment casting waxes were created and analysed. Carbon black and graphite filler were incorporated into waxes, and the conductivity and rheology of the resultant composites were studied, to gauge their suitability as an investment <b>casting</b> <b>pattern</b> material. On the basis of both cost and for environmental reasons, the use of aqueous suspension media for EPD was preferred over the more commonly used organic systems. EPD was carried out using zircon in aqueous suspension, and the low particle concentration suspensions were stabilised through pH modification and anionic dispersant addition. The effect of suspension parameters and EPD set-up parameters on the coatings formed on compressed graphite electrodes and conductive wax electrodes were studied, through yield measurements and cross sectional analysis using scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Several {{problems}} {{not seen}} in conventional casting processes are encountered with the evaporative <b>pattern</b> <b>casting</b> process. A major one occurs when the foam pattern is evaporated by pouring molten metal.

The modeling process presented here is based on an algorithm that makes use of local model fuzzy-neural networks. The algorithm falls back on the advantages of fuzzy systems with Takagi-Sugeno-Kanga (TSK) consequences and neural networks with auxiliary modules that help optimize and shorten the time needed to identify the best possible network structure. The modeling of self-induced vibrations allows analyzing how the vibrations come into being. This in turn makes it possible to develop effective ways of eliminating these vibrations and, ultimately, designing a practical control system that would dispose of the vibrations altogether...|$|R
