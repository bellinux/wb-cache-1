50|$|Internal {{lubrication}} of {{the pump}} {{is achieved by}} use of the operating fluid - normally called hydraulic fluid. Most hydraulic systems have a maximum operating temperature, limited by the fluid, of about 120 °C (250 °F) so that using that fluid as a lubricant brings its own problems. In this type of pump the leakage from the face between the <b>cylinder</b> <b>housing</b> and the body block is used to cool and lubricate {{the exterior of the}} rotating parts. The leakage is then carried off to the reservoir or to the inlet side of the pump again. Hydraulic fluid that has been used is always cooled and passed through micrometre-sized filters before recirculating through the pump.|$|E
50|$|At {{the lower}} end of a typical {{compound}} optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a <b>cylinder</b> <b>housing</b> containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a circular nose piece which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5× to 100× while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high performance objective lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis builds on ideas of a seismo-acoustic sonar as a mine detection tool and {{is part of}} an ongoing Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) research project. Building on this foundation of research, a source was developed to enable mobility. The previous NPS array [Sheetz] design employed an array of sources, buried in the sediment in a line. This arrangement is somewhat cumbersome for direct application. A practical device should be mobile and create a high source signal similar to the previous NPS array. A rolling cylinder provided the solution. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>houses</b> two shakers, identical to the previous NPS array elements, mounted directly to the cylinder wall. The source for a single buried array element, from the previous NPS array, and a single rolling cylinder, placed on the surface, were shown to provide similar seismic velocity at ten meters range. Using this rolling source, we measured wave speed at 83 m/s by signal correlation methods. Employing two rolling cylinder sources against a buried 1000 lb bomb at five meters range resulted in echo detection with only internal signal analyzer algorithms. The ability to send and receive signals on the go was proven to be attainable with a rolling line source. Lieutenant, United States Naval Reserv...|$|R
40|$|In the future, two {{important}} technological dreams will have become reality: fusion {{will be a}} viable power source, and human settlement on Mars will be feasible, desirable, and even necessary. Merging these two concepts is especially attractive for the aerospace engineer {{because of the high}} specific power that will be possible with fusion (on the order 10 kW/kg). The UWFR 94, a large, fusion-powered, human-transport ship, is designed to transport 100 passengers between earth and Mars in approximately thirty days. This relatively short transit time, which mitigates the need for artificial gravity, is made possible by a Polywell inertial electrostatic fusion reactor capable of 20 kW/kg. The mass of each reactor is 37 metric tons and the fuel used is (3) He-(3) He. The electricity generated drives the propulsion system, composed of nine ion thrusters and 780 tons of xenon propellant. The payload consists of three independent, identical <b>cylinders</b> <b>housing</b> the crew, and has a mass of approximately 400 tons. The aluminum cylinders' radius and length are 3 and 12 meters, respectively, with a thickness of 6 cm (15 cm in the solar flare safe rooms).

The maximum permissible limits set by the World Health Organization (2006) and Regulatory of Water Quality Drinking Peru (2010), indicated for cadmium was: 0, 003 mg/L and arsenic was: 0, 01 mg/L. In water samples from storage water reservoirs of SEDAPAL, it was determined the average concentration of cadmium that was: 0, 00417 mg/L and arsenic that was: 0, 00127 mg/L.; in water samples from tanker trucks was determined the average concentration of cadmium that was: 0, 00439 mg/L and arsenic that was: 0, 00121 mg/L; in water samples from plastic <b>cylinders</b> of <b>houses</b> were determined the average concentration of cadmium that was: 0, 00108 mg/L and arsenic that was: 0, 00167 mg/L.

Uma Tidors of each ethnic group are quite similar with rectangular volume and hip roof, however, one of the fourteen ethnic groups can build <b>cylinder</b> <b>houses</b> for Uma Tidor. Uma Luliks of different ethnic groups are diversified and special. One group of the Uma Luliks shows a rectangular or square volume sheltered by a hip roof. The other group of Uma Luliks presents a non-specific volume under a conical roof, that we called the “conical hut”. Seven ethnic groups, Atoni, Weimua, Makassae, Mambai, Bunaq, Kemak and Bekais, have built “conical huts” for the use of Uma Lulik. People of the seven ethnic groups can construct a reasonable structural system to support the conical roof, and take good advantage of the space under the conical roof to meet their sacred needs and everyday life. “Conical Hut” may be regarded as the basic form of the house types adopted by the seven ethnic groups.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{shows the}} {{development}} of the design and manufacturing of a very small engine, namely its head. The engine works under the 4 -stroke cycle, therefore having a very complex <b>cylinder</b> head, <b>housing</b> the camshaft, valves and its auxiliaries (seats, guides, springs), spark plug, inlet and exhaust passages and a coolant chamber. The geometries, both inner and outer are highly intricate which makes the production of such a part a very difficult job. In addition, when the engine is very small, as it is the case of this engine, all dimensions are miniaturized therefore making it extremely difficult to design, cast and finish. The cooling chamber, in particular, has a critical inner core removal problem due to reduced accessibility, imposing casting limitations. The cores place also a problem of air and gas removal during metal filling and solidification. Rapid prototyping may be the only solution to build the cores, and may help in the design and manufacturing phases of the casting tools. 3 D printing with a plaster based material as a rapid prototyping technique presents itself as a tool to drastically reduce the design-development-casting process effort and time cycle. This technique enables the designer to obtain new moulds for castings on the shortest time possible, following redesign and new casting simulations.
