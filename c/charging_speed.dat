30|$|The {{diffusion}} of electric propulsion {{technology can be}} expected to transform the automotive sector fundamentally, enabling eco-friendly transportation and new business opportunities for companies. Electric vehicles (EVs) consume electric current that is stored in and provided by electric vehicle batteries (EVBs). Unfortunately, lithium-ion chemistry-based EVBs degrade over use and time due to cycle aging and calendar aging, both of which negatively impact the batteries’ performance (Ebner et al. 2013). Automotive manufacturers expect an EVB’s end of first life to occur after about 6 – 8  years of operation, or at least 100, 000 miles, respectively, 160, 000  km of distance traveled (e.g., BMW AG 2016; Nissan North America Inc. 2016). Then, replacing an EVB allows recovering the EV’s original driving range, acceleration, and <b>charging</b> <b>speed.</b> However, as most removed EVBs still have a usable capacity of approximately 70 % to 80 %, their repurposing and further use in second life applications might turn out as a reasonable strategy for generating additional revenues (Neubauer et al. 2015; Ahmadi et al. 2017). These revenues can help to offset the high initial costs of EVs (Elkind 2014), for up to 25 % of which the EVB is currently responsible (Nykvist and Nilsson 2015).|$|E

However, the design of highly efficient CMOS PAs for watt-level applications is a challenging task. This dissertation focuses on the development of the design method for highly efficient CMOS PAs to overcome the fundamental difficulties presented by CMOS technology. In this dissertation, the design method and analysis for a high-power and highefficiency class-E CMOS PA with a fully integrated transformer have been presented. This work is the first effort to set up a comprehensive design methodology for a fully integrated class-E CMOS PA including effects of an integrated transformer, which is very crucial for watt-level power applications. In addition, to improve efficiency of cascode class-E CMOS PAs, a charging acceleration technique is developed. The method accelerates a <b>charging</b> <b>speed</b> to turn off the common-gate device in the off-state, thus reducing the power loss. To demonstrate the proposed cascode class-E PA, a prototype CMOS PA was implemented in a 0. 18 -μm CMOS process. Measurements show an improvement of approximately 6 % in the power added efficiency. The proposed cascode class-E PA structure is suitable for the design of high-efficiency class-E PAs while it reduces the voltage stress across the device. Ph. D.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{have begun}} to hit the main stream market, with sales raising form under 20, 000 in 2001 to over 110, 000 per year since 2014 [1]. With new models hitting the market every year, and more people becoming conscious about their fossil fuel usage, this trend will only continue until there are more electric vehicles than combustion vehicles on the road. A major drawback of electric vehicles is their limited range, and relatively long recharge times. Even with advancements in battery <b>charging</b> <b>speed,</b> such as the Tesla super charger, able to provide up to 90 miles of range in just 30 minutes, electric vehicles are still not practical for people who make regular, long distance trips [2]. These quick charging technologies not only take much longer than refueling a combustion vehicle, they providing less range, and they are also bad for the vehicles batteries. Regularly using them will greatly reduce the capacity and lifespan of the vehicles battery pack. The equivalent to refueling a combustion vehicle, is switching out the traction battery pack for a fully charged one. This gives the vehicle {{the full range of}} the battery pack, {{in the time it takes}} for the exchange to take place.

40|$|The mean axial {{velocity}} of lithium irons across {{the entrance of}} carbon nanotube VLi {{is an important factor}} for the charge-discharge performances of rechargeable Lithium battery. The molecular dynamics simulation method is adopted to evaluate the factors and their effects on VLi which include the diameter of carbon nanotube, functional group type on the port and the number of a given type of functional group. The statistical analysis of the calculation results shows that: In the selected carbon nanotubes of four different diameters, VLi will gradually rise with the increase of CNT diameter due to lithium irons migration resistance decreasing; as the port of CNT is successively modified to hydrogen (-H), hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH 2) and carboxyl (-COOH), the corresponding migration resistance of lithium ions is enhanced resulting in the dropping of VLi; in comparison to the effect strength of four types of functional groups on VLi, -COOH shows strongest, -NH 2 and -OH perform relatively weaker, and the effect difference between -NH 2 and -OH is very small, -H displays weakest; When the number of a given non-hydrogen functional group on the port sequentially increases, it also shows a trend that lithium ion migration resistance gradually increases which makes VLi decreases in turn. The more influential the functional group, the greater the impact of functional group number changes on VLi. The results of this paper have some significance on the precise production of lithium-ion battery electrode materials, enhancing the overall battery cycle efficiency and <b>charging</b> <b>speed.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
30|$|About {{a quarter}} of an EV’s costs is {{determined}} by the vehicle’s EVB, which requires expensive raw materials and an elaborate construction process (Nykvist and Nilsson 2015). Although most EVBs build on lithium-ion chemistries that are superior to consumer batteries regarding energy and power density (Han et al. 2014), they also degrade over use (cycle aging) and time (calendar aging) (Barré et al. 2013). The degradation is highly individual and known to be influenced by factors such as the ambient temperature, the charging and discharging current rate (driving profile), and the depth of discharge (driving range between charges) (Barré et al. 2013; Han et al. 2014; Rezvanizaniani et al. 2014). The two main effects of degradation are a reduced capacity (limiting the vehicle’s range) and an increased internal resistance (limiting acceleration and <b>charging</b> <b>speed)</b> (Vetter et al. 2005). Most researchers assume that a degradation of the EVB’s residual capacity to about 70 – 80 % marks the end of the battery’s automotive life (e.g., Viswanathan and Kintner-Meyer 2011; Neubauer et al. 2015). However, the EVB’s remaining performance still allows using the battery in less demanding second life application scenarios. Due to legal obligations in the EU, automotive manufacturers are required to take back their degraded batteries (e.g., Directive 2000 / 53 /EC 2000; Directive 2006 / 66 /EC 2006). Considering the increasing EV sales (International Energy Agency 2018), estimated numbers of some hundred thousand EVBs that leave the automotive use each year {{from the middle of the}} 2020 s onward (Foster et al. 2014) emphasize the importance of finding a second life for these goods.|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} {{the impact of}} increasing share of photovoltaics (PV) and electric vehicles (EV) growth on the existing low voltage (LV) grid in Amsterdam is assessed. A model has been created that simulates {{the impact of the}} changing electricity supply and demand in a typical neighbourhood in the centre of Amsterdam based on governmental target until 2040. In order to make statements on impact in different kind of areas, an uncertainty analysis has been performed as well. Besides grid performance with existing technology, two new charging technologies are assessed to determine their impact. These are controlled charging (CC), where the <b>charging</b> <b>speed</b> of EVs can be altered, and vehicle to grid (V 2 G), which has the potential to return electricity from an EV back to the grid. Furthermore, also battery degradation due to CC and V 2 G services is looked into. The simulations have shown that overdemand will firstly occur in January 2018. From 2021, overdemand also occurs during evening demand peak on weekdays in July. From then overdemand grows every year until EV growth stagnates. Oversupply due to exceeding PV power generation only occurs in periods with high solar intensity, starting in 2031 when installed PV capacity equals 57, 5 % of fixed electricity demand in the neighbourhood. From then the amount of overcapacity grows with increasing PV capacity. Controlled charging avoids overdemand by slowing down charge speed during peak electricity demand and by charging EVs with PV surplus during midday. Although charge speed is reduced during peak demand, all EVs were able to perform their required trip. CC reduces PV oversupply with two years and increases PV self-consumption in one neighbourhood in 2040 from 42, 1 % to 50, 9 %. Vehicle to grid has shown the same results as CC. The main reason is that CC already avoids overdemand, so {{from the point of view}} of the electricity grid V 2 G is not required with CC technology in place. CC reduces the average state of charge of an EV battery, which improves battery performance. Since V 2 G services are not simulated, the impact on battery degradation could not be found. A short literature study on battery degradation due to V 2 G services however indicated that despite the lack of consistency on this topic, intensive V 2 G use could have a notable impact on battery degradation. However, flexible pricing mechanisms and new business cases for EV batteries could turn this into profit for EV owners...|$|E
