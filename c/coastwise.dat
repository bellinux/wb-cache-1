5|$|From the 1830s onward, Mobile {{expanded}} into {{a city of}} commerce with a primary focus on the cotton and slave trades. Many slaves were transported by ship in the <b>coastwise</b> slave trade from the Upper South. There were many businesses in the city related to the slave trade – people to make clothes, food, and supplies for the slave traders and their wards. The city's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from New York City, which was {{deeply involved in the}} cotton industry. Mobile was the slave-trading center of the state until the 1850s, when it was surpassed by Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|Helen Whittier had {{returned}} to intercoastal service by early 1934 when The New York Times reported that she had sailed from San Francisco on 23 March and arrived at New York on 25 April. In June that same year, Helen Whittier {{was one of the}} Matson ships added to carry food cargo to Hawaii. Shipments of food from the mainland—which accounted for up to 90% of Hawaii's needs—had been curtailed as a <b>coastwise</b> strike had affected all ports except Los Angeles. Helen Whittier sailed on her first food delivery on 23 June with 2,500 tons of food from Los Angeles to Honolulu.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, Quistconck {{was sold}} to Lykes Brothers - Ripley Steamship Co Inc. Her port of {{registry}} was changed to New Orleans, Louisiana, and the vessel engaged in freight service between the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean. Following the changes to Code Letters in 1934, Quistconck was allocated the Code Letters WREI. In 1937, she was transferred to Lykes <b>Coastwise</b> Lines Inc.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of these <b>coastwise</b> shipping laws and their imposition on Puerto Rico consist in a serious restriction of free trade and have been under scrutiny and controversy due to the apparent contradictory rhetoric involving the United States Government's sponsorship of free trade policies around the world, while its own national shipping policy (cabotage law) is essentially mercantilist and based on notions foreign to free-trade principles.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, John W. Brown {{received}} U.S. Coast Guard certification for <b>coastwise</b> ocean voyages. In April 1994, {{she made}} her first offshore voyage since 1946, steaming to New York Harbor, and in August 1994 {{she made her}} first foreign voyage as a museum ship, steaming to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, then stopping at Boston, Massachusetts, and Greenport, New York, {{on her way back}} to Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|In 1807, the British Empire had {{banned the}} {{international}} slave trade in its colonies through the Slave Trade Act. At times United States ships in its domestic <b>coastwise</b> slave trade were wrecked on Bahama islands or reefs. Even before 1834, when Britain abolished slavery in its colonies, the colonial {{governments in the}} Caribbean freed the slaves from such American ships as the Comet and Encomium, and later the Hermosa.|$|E
25|$|With {{changing}} {{agriculture in}} the Upper South as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture, planters had excess laborers. Many sold slaves to traders {{to take to the}} Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the <b>coastwise</b> slave trade. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, Hermosa, a US {{schooner}} in the <b>coastwise</b> slave trade, carrying 38 slaves from Richmond to New Orleans for sale, went aground {{on one of}} the Abacos {{islands in}} the Bahamas. After salvors took the ship to port, the captain refused to let the slaves off. With the US consul, he tried to arrange for another ship to take his slave cargo for delivery. British magistrates backed with armed force boarded Hermosa, taking the slaves off and freeing them when they reached shore. The Americans protested.|$|E
25|$|By 1840, the Market Hall and Sheds, where {{fresh meat}} and produce were brought daily, became a hub of {{commercial}} activity. The slave trade also {{depended on the}} port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded and the slaves bought and sold. The legal importation of African slaves had ended in 1808, although smuggling was significant. However, the domestic trade was booming. More than one million slaves were transported from the Upper South to the Deep South in the antebellum years, as cotton plantations were widely developed through {{what became known as}} the Black Belt. Many slaves were transported in the <b>coastwise</b> slave trade, with slave ships stopping at ports such as Charleston.|$|E
25|$|Decommissioned on 1 July 1946, Mayflower {{was sold}} at Baltimore to Frank M. Shaw on 8 January 1947 {{for use in}} the Arctic as a sealer. However, while sailing for sealing waters between Greenland and Labrador, early in March, Mayflower was damaged by fire off Point Lookout and forced to return to Baltimore. Collins Distributors Inc., {{purchased}} the ship early in 1948, installed new boilers in her at New York, and documented her as Malla under the Panamanian flag. She was subsequently fitted out at Genoa, Italy, ostensibly for <b>coastwise</b> trade in the Mediterranean. After sailing secretly from Marseilles, she arrived at Haifa in Israel on 3 September. On board were Jewish refugees. Most were former passengers of the ill-fated Exodus which had been turned back from Palestine the previous summer.|$|E
25|$|The Creole Case gained notoriety as it {{resulted}} from a November 1841 slave revolt on an American brig. After 19 slaves {{took control of the}} crew of the Creole, they ordered the ship sailed to Nassau, Bahamas; one of the leaders had heard of the Hermosa case the year before and knew the British had abolished slavery. Ultimately, 128 of 135 slaves from the Creole were freed by the British colonists. It was the most successful slave revolt in US history. The US was concerned not only about compensation for slaveholders' losses. It feared that the success of the Creole slaves would encourage others to attempt such ship revolts to reach freedom in the British West Indies, and threaten the <b>coastwise</b> slave trade and slavery in the South.|$|E
500|$|In 1842, Benjamin had a {{group of}} cases with {{international}} implications. [...] He represented insurance companies being sued {{for the value of}} slaves who had revolted aboard the ship Creole in 1841, as they were being transported in the <b>coastwise</b> slave trade from Virginia to New Orleans. The rebels had sailed the ship to Nassau in the Bahamas, British territory, where most were freed, as Britain had abolished slavery. The owners of the slaves brought suit for $150,000 against their insurers, who declined to pay. Benjamin made several arguments, the most prominent of which was that the slaveowners had brought the revolt on themselves by packing the slaves in overcrowded conditions.|$|E
500|$|After the United States {{joined the}} Allies, Yorktown {{operated}} {{off the coast}} of Mexico until August 1917, when she paused briefly at San Diego. On 18 July 1917, Yorktown rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned guano mining settlement on Clipperton Island. [...] From a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915, only four women and seven children survived. [...] After her time off the Mexican coast, Yorktown then cruised off the west coasts of Central and South America into 1918. After a refit at Mare Island, Yorktown, sailed for the east coast on 28 April 1918, transiting the Panama Canal en route, and arrived at New York on 20 August. The gunboat escorted a coastal convoy to Halifax, soon there after before returning to New York. She performed local <b>coastwise</b> escort duties through the end of World War I. After a period of upkeep at the New York Navy Yard in December, she departed the east coast on 2 January 1919 on her last voyage to California.|$|E
500|$|Wales was by now {{producing}} {{more than half}} the United Kingdom's output of slate, 26,000tons out of a total UK production of 45,000tons in 1793. In July 1794, the government imposed a 20% tax on all slate carried <b>coastwise,</b> which put the Welsh producers at a disadvantage compared to inland producers who could use the canal network to distribute their product. There was no tax on slates sent overseas, and exports to the United States gradually increased. The Penrhyn Quarry continued to grow, and in 1799 Greenfield introduced the system of [...] "galleries", huge terraces from 9metres to 21metres in depth. In 1798, Lord Penrhyn constructed the horse-drawn Llandegai Tramway to transport slates from Penrhyn Quarry, and in 1801 this was replaced by the narrow gauge Penrhyn Quarry Railway, one of the earliest railway lines. The slates were transported to the sea at Port Penrhyn which had been constructed in the 1790s. The Padarn Railway was opened in 1824 as a tramway for the Dinorwig Quarry, and converted to a railway in 1843. It ran from Gilfach Ddu near Llanberis to Port Dinorwic at Y Felinheli. The Nantlle Railway was built in 1828 and was operated using horse-power to carry slate from several slate quarries in the Nantlle Valley to the harbour at Caernarfon.|$|E

2500|$|According to one report, Bayocean {{was said}} by mariners to be “an {{excellent}} sea boat.” [...] Another source {{states that the}} yacht was [...] "somewhat cranky for <b>coastwise</b> service." [...] The yacht was expensive to operate. [...] By 1913, Bayocean {{had been used to}} carry passengers from Portland to the Bayocean resort for just one season, that of 1911, and the cost was too great to continue.|$|E
2500|$|The 1914 {{absorption}} of LUPA into the ILA prompted {{the creation of}} the ILA's New York District Council and ignited an intense period of growth for the union both in terms of size and power. The organization of <b>coastwise</b> longshoremen in 1916 was a significant victory that greatly improved the ILA's position at bargaining tables: [...] shippers no longer had the option of diverting freight from striking ports along the Atlantic.|$|E
2500|$|Zephaniah Kingsley became {{involved}} in the shipping industry, including the <b>coastwise</b> trade, related to his large-scale slave trading. [...] While at Laurel Grove, Kingsley was attempting to smuggle in 350 slaves (the international slave trade was abolished in 1807) when the ship was captured by the U.S. Coast Guard. Not knowing what to do with so many indigent people, the Coast Guard turned them over to Kingsley, who was {{the only person in the}} area who could care for such a number.|$|E
2500|$|Garrison {{introduced}} [...] "The Black List," [...] {{a column}} devoted to printing short reports of [...] "the barbarities of slavery—kidnappings, whippings, murders." [...] For instance, Garrison reported that Francis Todd, a shipper from Garrison's {{home town of}} Newburyport, Massachusetts, {{was involved in the}} domestic slave trade, and that he had recently had slaves shipped from Baltimore to New Orleans in the <b>coastwise</b> trade on his ship the Francis. (This was thoroughly legal, although the US had in 1807 prohibited the international slave trade from Africa.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1846, Le Roy {{reported}} {{aboard the}} paddle frigate [...] in the Home Squadron. Aboard her, he {{took part in}} the opening stages of the Mexican War. Before the end of 1846, Mississippi participated in expeditions against Alvarado, Tampico, Pánuco, and Laguna de los Términos, Mexico, all successful in tightening American control of the Mexican coastline and interrupting Mexico's <b>coastwise</b> commerce and military supply operations. In 1847 he served aboard the Home Squadron steamer [...] off Mexico, and took part in an engagement with Mexican troops at Rio Aribiqua while ashore to collect drinking water for Princeton.|$|E
2500|$|In 2017, Sadie O. Horton, {{who spent}} World War II working aboard a <b>coastwise</b> U.S. Merchant Marine barge, posthumously {{received}} official veteran’s status for her wartime service, {{becoming the first}} recorded female Merchant Marine veteran of World War II. [...] Sadie Horton was one of six from a single family serving on outdated barges to assist in moving bulk war materials to defense plants and coal to our power plants along our eastern coast. This was necessary due to our nation losing many ships to enemy U-boat action along the coast faster than they could be replaced.|$|E
2500|$|The Enterprise was a United States {{merchant}} vessel {{active in the}} <b>coastwise</b> slave trade in the early 19th century along the Atlantic Coast. Bad weather forced it into Hamilton, Bermuda waters on February 11, 1835 while it carried 78 slaves {{in addition to other}} cargo. It became the centre of a minor international incident when the British authorities freed nearly all the slaves. Britain had abolished slavery in its Caribbean colonies effective 1834. At that time it advised [...] "foreign nations that any slavers found in Bermuda [...] waters would be subject to arrest and seizure. Their cargoes were liable to forfeiture" [...] without compensation.|$|E
2500|$|Dorchester, one {{of three}} {{identical}} ships, the first being [...] (torpedoed and sunk August 27, 1943) and the last being , was built for the Merchants and Miners Transportation Company by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. Keel laying was September 10, 1925 with launching on March 20, 1926 and delivery on July 17, 1926. The ship was designed for the <b>coastwise</b> trade with a capacity for 302 first class and 12 steerage passengers {{for a total of}} 314 with a crew of 90 along the East coast between Miami and Boston. Propulsion was by a 3,000 horsepower, triple expansion steam engine supplied by four oil fired Scotch boilers with steam at 220 pounds pressure driving a single propeller for a speed of [...]|$|E
2500|$|During World War I Sierra Cordoba {{supplied}} German raiders, particularly [...] while {{hiding in}} the Straits of Magellan. After that ship and Sierra Cordoba moved northward in the Pacific, where the cruiser met British forces, the German liner interned herself in Callao, Peru, named Callao and later transferred to the United States Shipping Board, refurbished by Panama Canal personnel and briefly placed in commission with the United States Navy as USS Callao (ID-4036) to bring service people home from Europe. The ship was sold, renamed Ruth Alexander in 1923 and put into <b>coastwise</b> passenger and cargo service between Puget Sound and Mexico, typically calling at Seattle, Victoria, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and (by 1931) Ensenada, Mexico, until finally converted to a cargo ship in 1939.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small {{producer}} of sugar with {{a relatively small number of}} slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. William C. C. Claiborne, Louisiana's first United States governor, said that African slave labor was needed because white laborers [...] "cannot be had in this unhealthy climate." [...] Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the US and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the <b>coastwise</b> trade – the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.|$|E
2500|$|Both the United States and Great Britain had {{banned the}} {{international}} slave trade since 1807, and both operated sailing patrols off Africa (Britain's West Africa Squadron) {{and in the}} Caribbean to intercept illegal vessels and suppress the trade. The United States in its legislation preserved the right to operate ships for its domestic <b>coastwise</b> slave trade among various markets along the East and Gulf coasts, which became increasingly important as the Deep South rapidly developed cotton cultivation. With labor demand at a height, in the antebellum years, nearly a million enslaved African Americans were moved to the Deep South in a forced migration, two-thirds through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans had the largest slave market and its port was important for the slave trade and related businesses.|$|E
2500|$|Several North Carolina {{cities were}} sited on the sounds, among them New Bern (usually written New Berne {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century), Beaufort, Edenton, and Elizabeth City. [...] Others, not lying {{directly}} on the sounds, were accessible to the rivers that emptied into them. As much as {{a third of the}} state is in their watershed. Through most of {{the first year of the}} Civil War, the Confederate forces retained control of the sounds, so that <b>coastwise</b> water-borne commerce of the eastern part of the state was unimpeded. The sounds were linked to Norfolk, Virginia by the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal and the Dismal Swamp Canal. The blockade of Norfolk could not be complete so long as cargoes could reach the city through its back door. Communications were not affected appreciably when Federal forces captured the forts on the Outer Banks at Hatteras Inlet in August 1861, as the Union Navy could not bring its deep-water vessels into the sounds through the shallow inlets.|$|E
2500|$|Owning estates such as Henry's meant owning slaves; Henry was a slaveholder {{from the}} time of his {{marriage}} at the age of 18. Despite this, Henry believed that slavery was wrong, and hoped for its abolition, but had no plan for doing so, nor for the multiracial society that would result, for he did not believe schemes to settle freed slaves in Africa were realistic, [...] "to re-export them is now impracticable, and sorry I am for it." [...] He wrote in 1773, [...] "I am the master of slaves of my own purchase. I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living here without them. I will not, I cannot justify it." [...] But the number of slaves he owned increased over time, {{and as a result of}} his second marriage in 1777, so that at his death in 1799, he owned 67 slaves. Henry and others sought to end their importation to Virginia, and succeeded in 1778. They assumed that in so doing, they were fighting slavery, but in the generation after [...] independence, slave births greatly exceeded deaths, and Virginia became a source of slaves sold south in the <b>coastwise</b> slave trade.|$|E
