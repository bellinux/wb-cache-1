25|$|The OW {{originated}} in Brazil with de Morais' 1954 Recife workshop. In {{the wake of}} the coup d'état of March 1964, de Morais went into a 23-year exile in Chile, and the OW spread from there in the late sixties. After specializing in Cultural Anthropology (Santiago University) and in Land Reform at the ICIRA (<b>Capacitation</b> and Research Institute for Agrarian Reform Institute), de Morais became consultant for international and national development institutions and NGOs. Since then, the organization workshop has become a constant in a number of agrarian reform efforts in Latin America and (community) development projects elsewhere. From Chile, the OW spread to Costa Rica, Mexico, Panamá, Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, Ecuador, Honduras, Peru, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Brazil, the Caribbean, a number of African countries as well as Europe. In 2015, {{for the first time in}} the UK, a pilot OW took place at 'Marsh Farm' urban housing Estate, Luton (near London) as part of a government supported Enterprise and Job creation project.|$|E
2500|$|Chang's {{body of work}} in {{mammalian}} fertilisation is {{vast and}} appears in nearly 350 publications. [...] One of his major discoveries was the effect of lowering temperature on sperm. [...] Chang found that at a temperature of 13°C or lower, the membrane structure and function of sperm would disintegrate, thus destroying the fertilising capacity of the sperm. [...] This phenomenon is now commonly known as cold shock. [...] Yet another of Chang's major discoveries was his observation {{on the relationship between}} the number of available sperm and the effective fertilisation of ova by the sperm. [...] It was believed that the fertilisation of the egg was dependent on there being {{a very large number of}} available sperm in the fertilisation process. [...] Chang found that it was actually the physiological structure of the individual sperm that affected the actual fertilisation of the egg, and that having a large number of sperm was not necessary. [...] He then posited that the purpose of having a large number of sperm in the fertilisation process was to allow for greater genetic recombination, in that only the strongest sperm would reach the site of fertilisation through the female reproductive tract. [...] The process of <b>capacitation,</b> the maturation period of sperm that is required in order for them to be able to fertilise ova, was also amongst one of Chang's major discoveries. [...] This observation would lead him further to find that capacitated sperm would lose <b>capacitation</b> if exposed to seminal plasma or blood serum, and that recapacitation could be achieved if the sperm was placed back in the uterus or the fallopian tubes.|$|E
50|$|Semenogelin is {{a protein}} that is {{involved}} in the formation of a gel matrix that encases ejaculated spermatozoa, preventing <b>capacitation.</b> It blocks <b>capacitation</b> mainly via inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.|$|E
50|$|Non-mammalian {{spermatozoa}} do {{not require}} this <b>capacitation</b> step and are ready to fertilize an oocyte immediately after release from the male. After this <b>capacitation,</b> the sperm must undergo the final maturation step, activation, involving the acrosome reaction.|$|E

5000|$|The English term <b>capacitation</b> is a {{translation}} of the latino terms capacitação (Portuguese)/capacitación (Spanish).Capacitation marks the generic difference between transitive and [...] modes of learning and communicating implicit in de Morais' aphorism se aprende, porém não se capacita (Portuguese) : [...] "trainee learns, but is not capacitated". [...] <b>Capacitation,</b> - from capacitação (Portuguese) -, here, {{is reminiscent of the}} adult education concept of conscientization - from conscientização (Portuguese) -, popularized by Brazilian theorist, activist and a lifelong friend of Clodomir's, Paulo Freire. While Freire's work was translated into English as early as 1970,de Morais' Organization Workshop (OW) - and, hence, moraisean large-group <b>capacitation</b> (LGC) - did not come {{to the attention of the}} English-speaking public until the mid-80s, when the Chilean Social Psychologists I. & I. Labra moved to Zimbabwe and transferred the method to the (southern) African context. Latino texts were initially translated on an 'ad hoc' basis, including the 'dictionary' translation of capacitación (Spanish) as training (English). Cherrett's 1992 first ever translation into English of de Morais' Apuntes de Teoría de la Organización, also, was still referred to as a [...] "Training" [...] Manual. It was not until the ALFA International Conference in Manchester, UK, in 1998, attended by de Morais and academics from four European and four Latin American Universities, that a consensus was reached on the dedicated terms <b>Capacitation</b> and Large Group <b>Capacitation</b> (LGC).|$|E

50|$|<b>Capacitation</b> is the {{penultimate}} {{step in the}} maturation of mammalian spermatozoa and {{is required}} to render them competent to fertilize an oocyte.This step is a biochemical event; the sperm move normally and look mature prior to capacitation.In vivo this step typically occurs after ejaculation, in the female reproductive tract.In vitro, <b>capacitation</b> can occur by incubating sperm that have either undergone ejaculation or have been extracted from the epididymis in a defined medium for several hours.|$|E

50|$|The tripeptide, Fertilization Promoting Peptide (FPP), is {{essential}} for controlling <b>capacitation.</b> FPP is produced in prostate gland of the man, {{as a component of}} the seminal fluid. FPP comes into contact with the spermatozoa during ejaculation, as the sperm and seminal fluid mix. High levels of active FPP prevent <b>capacitation.</b> After ejaculation, the concentration of FPP drops in the female reproductive tract. The vaginal secretions dilute it, and make it less active due to the pH of the vagina, which differs from that of semen.|$|E
5000|$|Large-group <b>capacitation</b> is {{an adult}} {{education}} and social psychology concept associated with the Brazilian sociologist Clodomir Santos de Morais, and grounded in the [...] "activity" [...] {{of the individual and}} the social psychology of the large group.

5000|$|During <b>capacitation,</b> the {{penultimate}} {{stage of}} spermatozoa maturation, the acrosomal sperm head membrane is destabilised to allow greater binding between oocyte and sperm. CRISP1 binds to {{surface of the}} sperm leading to a quiescent state of storage prior to <b>capacitation.</b> The mechanism is believed to involve inhibition of ion channel activity, similar to the mechanism of action of the other major function of CRISPs in snake venom. [...] Research also suggests that CRISPs {{are involved in the}} oocyte-sperm binding needed for fertilisation. [...] Given the involvement of CRISPs in several stages of human reproduction, it is unsurprising that applications in treatment of infertility and as contraceptives are being actively investigated.|$|E

50|$|Decapacitation factor (DF) is {{composed}} of factors in seminal plasma which modulates the fertilizing ability of spermatozoa. The activity is achieved by interaction between cholesterol, phospholipids and fibronectin-like substances and delivered via small vesicles in seminal plasma. DF prevents onset of <b>capacitation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Supporting {{the sperm}} by: a.) {{enabling}} sperm to undergo biochemical transitions, called <b>capacitation</b> and motility hyperactivation, {{in which they}} become physiologically capable of fertilizing an oocyte (e.g. mammals) and b.) maintaining sperm viability until an oocyte is ovulated (e.g. insects and mammals).|$|E
50|$|An {{influx of}} Ca2+ {{produces}} increased intracellular cAMP levels and thus, {{an increase in}} motility. Hyperactivation coincides {{with the onset of}} <b>capacitation</b> and {{is the result of the}} increased Ca2+ levels. It has a synergistic stimulatory effect with adenosine that increases adenylyl cyclase activity in the sperm.|$|E
5000|$|Through {{the use of}} Western Blot analyses, it {{has been}} shown that Izumo is only {{expressed}} in the testis and is found on mature spermatozoa. [...] Izumo-1 located on mature spermatozoa that have undergone <b>capacitation</b> binds to its receptor Juno, which is located on the oolemma of eggs.|$|E
50|$|Bithionol {{has been}} shown to be a potent {{inhibitor}} of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), an intracellular enzyme important in the catalysis of ATP to cAMP. Soluble adenylyl cyclase is uniquely activated by bicarbonate. The cAMP formed by this enzyme is associated with <b>capacitation</b> of sperm, eye pressure regulation, acid-base regulation, and astrocyte/neuron communication.|$|E
5000|$|Physiologically it is {{achieved}} through spermatozoal membrane stabilization by maintaining physiological cholesterol/phospholipid ratio. The study of DF {{is essential to}} understand unexplained male infertility and has possible role in reversible male contraception. Ejaculates from animals when purified have obtained DF. Such ejaculates when injected into the uterus with sperms decrease the fertilization by decreasing efficiency of <b>capacitation</b> of spermatozoas.|$|E
50|$|The {{functions}} of ADAM7 directly relate to sperm maturation and fertilization. Sperm are immobile until traversing the epididymis, {{in which the}} sperm interact with many proteins secreted by epihtelial cells of the epididymis. Lacking protease activity, ADAM7 may play roles in protein-protein interactions and cell adhesion processes including sperm-egg fusion. ADAM7 is secreted by epididymis cells and transferred to the maturing sperm's surface. As determined through mouse gene knock-out studies, the amount of ADAM7 secreted is directly linked to ADAM2 and ADAM3 protein levels. Complex formation between ADAM7, Calnexin, Hspa5, and Itm2b {{have been shown to}} act as a molecular chaperone after ADAM7 is incorporated into the membrane of sperm cells. Furthermore, complex formation with Itm2b is increased during sperm <b>capacitation</b> leading to a conformation change in ADAM7. As such, the ADAM7 protein plays an important function involved in sperm <b>capacitation,</b> although this function is not entirely understood.|$|E

50|$|Spermatozoon is {{the male}} gamete. After {{ejaculation}} this cell is not mature, so it can't fertilize the oocyte. To {{have the ability}} to fertilize the female gamete, this cell suffers <b>capacitation</b> and acrosome reaction in female reproductive tract. The signaling pathways best described for spermatozoon involve these processes. The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway leads to sperm cells capacitation; however, adenilyl cyclase in sperm cells is different from the somatic cells. Adenilyl cyclase in spermatozoon doesn't recognize G proteins, so it is stimulated by bicarbonate and Ca2+ ions. Then, it converts ATP into cAMP, which activates PKA. PKA leads to protein tyrosine phosphorylation.Phospholipase C (PLC) is involved in acrosome reaction. ZP3 is a glycoprotein present in zona pelucida and it interacts with receptors in spermatozoon. So, ZP3 can activate G protein coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors, that leads to production of PLC. PLC cleaves the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 is released as a soluble structure into the cytosol and DAG remains bound to the membrane. IP3 binds to IP3 receptors, present in acrosome membrane. In addition, calcium and DAG together work to activate protein kinase C, which goes on to phosphorylate other molecules, leading to altered cellular activity. These actions cause an increase in cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ that leads to dispersion of actin and consequently promotes plasmatic membrane and outer acrosome membrane fusion.Progesterone is a steroid hormone produced in cumulus oophorus. In somatic cells it binds to receptors in nucleus; however, in spermatozoon its receptors are present in plasmatic membrane. This hormone activates AKT that leads to activation of other protein kinases, involved in <b>capacitation</b> and acrosome reaction.When ROS (reactive oxygen species) are present in high concentration, they can affect the physiology of cells, but when they are present in moderated concentration they are important for acrosome reaction and <b>capacitation.</b> ROS can interact with cAMP/PKA and progesterone pathway, stimulating them. ROS also interacts with ERK pathway that leads to activation of Ras, MEK and MEK-like proteins. These proteins activate protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) that phosphorylates various proteins important for <b>capacitation</b> and acrosome reaction.|$|E
