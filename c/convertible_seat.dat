5000|$|Most {{convertible}} {{seats in}} the U.S. {{have at least a}} 35 lb rear-facing weight limit, most now to go to 40 lb, some 45 lb and a few 50 lb. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children remain rear-facing until they outgrow their <b>convertible</b> <b>seat,</b> regardless of how old they are. Children can remain in a rear-facing seat until they have either outgrown the weight limit for their seat, or the top of their head is within [...] of the top of the shell of the car seat.|$|E
5000|$|Convertible seats - Similar to {{the infant}} seat, the <b>convertible</b> <b>seat</b> {{can be used}} in a rear- or {{forward-facing}} position and is used for children typically beginning at 5 lb up to 50 lb. The rear-facing position is used for children until they weigh more than 20 lb and are at least two years old. Research studies and crash test results show that children are safer in a rear-facing child safety seat. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends keeping children in a rear-facing seat until “they are 2 years of age or until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car safety seat’s manufacturer” (www.healthychildren.org).|$|E

Children who are too large for child safety seats (a child restraint system for children from birth to 4 years old) are often restrained improperly or not at all. These children should be restrained in a booster seat which is a type of child safety seat designed for children who have out grown their <b>convertible</b> <b>seat</b> and are not large enough to fit properly in an adult seat belt. For this reason, the use and correct use of occupant protection for 4 - 9 year old children in particular needs to be addressed. For proper restraint, children who have outgrown child safety seats require booster seats used with vehicle lap/shoulder belts. This present study attempted to determine if raising risk perception and/or lowering cost of compliance would influence more parents to purchase booster seats for their children who should be restrained in them.

40|$|Airline revenue {{management}} is {{the practice of}} controlling the booking requests such that the planes are filled with the most profitable passengers. In {{revenue management}} the capacities of the business and economy class sections of the plane are traditionally considered to be fixed and distinct capacities. In this paper, we give up this notion and instead consider the use of <b>convertible</b> <b>seats.</b> A row of these seats can be converted from business class seats to economy class seats and vice versa. This offers an airline company the possibility to adjust the capacity configuration of the plane to the demand pattern at hand. We show how to incorporate the shifting capacity opportunity into a dynamic, network-based revenue management model. We also extend the model to include cancellations and overbooking. With a small test case we show that incorporating the shifting capacity opportunity into the revenue management decision indeed provides a means to improve revenues. convertible seats;dynamic capacity management;revenue management;seat inventory control;shifting capacity...|$|R

5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each <b>convertible</b> <b>seats</b> four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|R

50|$|In 1927-28 two new dining cars, Avoca and Hopkings, {{and three}} new {{sleeping}} cars, Werribee, Indi and Ovens, were constructed. While technically E-type carriages, at first external glance they'd {{be difficult to}} pick as such. The cars were painted in standard VR red, but the roofs were of the then-new curved style, as had recently been used on the W cars. Additionally, the sides were plated over with steel sheeting. Avoca and Hopkins were used on the Melbourne-Adelaide train {{in lieu of the}} earlier models, while the three sleepers were built explicitly for the Mildura train. Internally the design for Avoca and Hopkins was similar to that of Goulburn, Wimmera and Campaspe except that the seating was all {{at one end of the}} carriage and the kitchen was at the other end, rather than a central kitchen with dining areas at both ends. Werribee, Indi and Ovens was much the same as the other sixteen Sleeper cars, except that the saloon section was removed entirely and replaced with a tenth compartment with the same sleeping/sitting <b>convertible</b> <b>seats.</b> However, this tenth compartment was slightly longer than the rest.|$|R
50|$|The {{second section}} is a fully {{enclosed}} stateroom {{for the use}} of the primary passenger.

5000|$|Static holiday caravans {{generally}} have sleeping accommodation for 6 to 8 people in 2 to 3 bedrooms and on <b>convertible</b> <b>seating</b> in the lounge. They tend towards a fairly [...] "open-plan" [...] layout, {{and while some}} units are insulated and centrally heated for year-round use, cheaper models without double glazing or central heating are available for mainly summer use. Holiday homes are intended for leisure use and are available in 10 ft and 12 ft widths, a small number in 13 ft and 14 ft widths, and a few 16 ft wide, consisting of two 8 ft wide units joined together. Generally, holiday homes are clad in painted steel panels, but can be clad in PVC panels. Static caravans are sited on caravan parks where {{the owner of the}} site leases a plot to the caravan owner. Many of these parks are sited in areas that are prone to flooding and anyone considering buying a sited static caravan needs to take particular care in checking that their site is not liable to flooding. Some park owners used to have unfair conditions in their lease contracts but the Office of Fair Trading has produced a guidance document available for download called Unfair Terms in Holiday Caravan Agreements which aims to stop unfair practices.|$|R

50|$|The {{only time}} a V8 option was {{available}} in a first-generation Falcon was the 1963½ model, and these cars were produced in very limited numbers (Sprint two-door hardtop (bucket seats) 10,479 produced and Sprint <b>convertible</b> (bucket <b>seats)</b> 4,602 produced). These first-generation Falcon Sprint cars were {{the basis for the}} 1964½ Mustangs released by Ford one year later. Many (if not most) of the interior, chassis, suspension, and drivetrain components were derived from those used on the 1963½ Ford Falcon Sprint and/or Fairlane models. In simplest terms, the 1963½ Falcon Sprint is nearly mechanically identical to the 1964½ Mustang while being aesthetically different.|$|R

50|$|In 1969 DeVille was restyled in the Eldorado image. An Eldorado-like {{front fender}} {{treatment}} evolved {{and helped to}} emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. There was an all new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of 2.5 inches to add the impression of extra length. The roofline was squarer and the rear deck and bumper more sculptured. A new ventilation system eliminated the need for vent windows, which provided a longer sleeker look and improved visibility. New standard features included front and rear (except on <b>convertibles)</b> center <b>seat</b> armrests.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1990s, a trend {{developed}} {{in which many}} airlines eliminated first class sections in favour of an upgraded business class. Newer business class seating is increasing adding features previously exclusive to first class such as <b>convertible</b> lie-flat <b>seats,</b> narrowing the amenities gap to an extent that first class is redundant. Furthermore, with the late 2000s recession, airlines have removed or not installed first class seating in their aircraft, as first class seats are usually double the price of business class but can take up {{more than twice the}} room, leaving business class the most expensive seats on such planes. However some, such as Garuda Indonesia, have opted to reintroduce first class seating sections with new aircraft.|$|R

50|$|The largest {{drawback}} of mid-engine cars {{is restricted}} rear passenger space; consequently most mid-engine vehicles are two-seat vehicles. The engine in effect pushes the passenger compartment forward {{towards the front}} axle (if engine is behind driver). Exceptions typically involve larger vehicles of unusual length or height in which the passengers can share space between the axles with the engine, which can be between them or below them, as in some Toyota vans, large trucks and buses. The mid-engine layout (with a horizontal engine) was common in single-decker buses in the 1950s and 1960s, e.g. the AEC Reliance. The Ferrari Mondial is to date the only successful example of a true mid-engined <b>convertible</b> with <b>seating</b> for 4 and sports car / supercar performance. A version of the Lotus Evora with a removable roof panel is anticipated but no definite date is known.|$|R

50|$|In Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the {{national}} rail services operate {{a large number}} of night trains with private compartments containing <b>seats</b> <b>convertible</b> into sleeping berths. These night trains are a prime method of travel, with ticket prices quite reasonable by Western standards, and with the distances between the capitals of Moscow and Kiev and many outlying cities being ideal for overnight trips that depart in late evening and arrive at their destinations in the morning. Sleeping cars are the only reasonable solution for railway trips lasting several days (e.g., direct trains from Moscow to Siberian cities).|$|R

[...] It added to the standard CJ chrome plated bumpers, hood latches, gas cap, mirror, and tail lamp trim. Two wheelbases, 81 in and 101 in, were available, with a variety of <b>convertible</b> top and <b>seat</b> colors, and front bucket seats upholstered in [...] "pleated British calf grain vinyl". Sales of this model, introduced in 1965, were low.|$|R
5000|$|IH {{is often}} {{remembered as a}} maker of {{relatively}} successful and innovative [...] "light" [...] lines of vehicles, competing directly against the Big Three. The most common were Pickup trucks. IH made light trucks from 1907 to 1975, beginning with the Model A Auto Wagon (sometimes called the [...] "Auto Buggy"). Production commenced in February 1907 at IH's McCormick Works in Chicago, although production was moved to Akron, Ohio, in October that year. Powered by a horizontally opposed, air-cooled twin around , it was a right-hand-drive model popular in rural areas for high ground clearance on the poor roads typical of the era. It featured a rear <b>seat</b> <b>convertible</b> to a carrier bed. The Auto Wagon was renamed the Motor Truck in 1910, and was a forerunner to the successful modern pickup truck. They were called IHC until 1914, when the 'International' name was first applied. The final light line truck was made on May 5, 1975.|$|R
5000|$|The Fokker F.XVIII was an {{airliner}} {{produced in the}} Netherlands in the early 1930s, essentially a scaled-up version of the Fokker F.XII intended for long-distance flights. Like its predecessor, it was a conventional high-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Its cabin could seat 12 passengers, or four-to-six on <b>seats</b> <b>convertible</b> to sleeping berths. Only five were built, all for KLM, and registered as PH-AIO, 'AIP, 'AIQ, 'AIR and 'AIS, {{all of which were}} named after birds. Used by KLM on its Amsterdam-Batavia route, the F.XVIII became celebrated in the Netherlands due to two especially noteworthy flights. In December 1933, one aircraft (registration PH-AIP, Pelikaan - [...] "Pelican") was used to make a special Christmas mail flight to Batavia, completing the round trip in a flight time of 73 hours 34 minutes. The following Christmas, another F.XVIII (registration PH-AIS, Snip - [...] "Snipe") made a similar flight to Curaçao in 55 hours 58 minutes after having been specially re-engined for the journey.|$|R
50|$|All the 180 {{first-class}} and 111 second-class cabins {{were placed}} on higher decks, offering their occupants remarkable views. Some of the first-class cabins were also <b>convertible</b> into large <b>seating</b> areas. In addition to the 420 crew, the ship could accommodate 1,350 passengers out of which 400 in first class, 250 in second and 700 passengers in third-class. Like the most sumptuous transatlantic ships of her time, the Kaiser Friedrichs main dining and living rooms were lit by extravagant Chandeliers and the surrounding walls dominated by the hanging Caryatids representing the art and sciences and decorated with painted panels portraying Kaiser Friedrich III's family and their respective coat of arms. The walls were painted in a shade of ivory, adorned by gold ornaments, while the carpets were all red. The most prominent feature though was the ship's promenade deck, especially in the first class areas where the deck was open {{so as not to}} obstruct the view and extended along the highest point of the ship's admit for 100 meters. The ship was also equipped with smoking lounges, bars, music room and a library.|$|R
50|$|The first-generation Camaro {{debuted in}} September 1966, for the 1967 model year, up to 1969 {{on a new}} rear-wheel drive GM F-body {{platform}} and was available as a two-door coupé or <b>convertible</b> with 2+2 <b>seating,</b> and a choice of 230 CID L, 250 CID L inline-6 or 302 CID L, 307 CID L, 327 CID L, 350 CID L, and 396 CID L V8 powerplants. Concerned with the runaway success of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet executives realized that their compact sporty car, the Corvair, {{would not be able}} to generate the sales volume of the Mustang due to its rear-engine design, as well as declining sales, partly due to the negative publicity from Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe at Any Speed. Therefore, the Camaro was touted as having the same conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration as the Mustang and Chevy II Nova. In addition, the Camaro was designed to fit a variety of power plants in the engine bay. The first-generation Camaro lasted until the 1969 model year and eventually inspired the design of the new retro fifth-generation Camaro.|$|R
