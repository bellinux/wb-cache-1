The Court wrote {{that they found}} no merit to his claim {{that he had not}} received an impartial trial under Perry, and that his opinion to the deliberating jurors as to what the evidence showed could not be equated with personal bias. Regarding Spagnoli's testimony at Bolden's trial, the Court said his testimony was [...] "merely cumulative" [...] and rejected Bolden's [...] "central contention" [...] that Spagnoli was an essential witness for the prosecution whose testimony could only be corroborated by the testimony of Jones. Addressing the issue of perjury that was at the core of Bolden's appeal, the Seventh Circuit Court noted what Spagnoli had testified at both trials and said he had not actually perjured himself about his source of income. The Court noted that Spagnoli's [...] "livelihood was clearly a <b>collateral</b> <b>matter</b> bearing upon his credibility" [...] and that they did not believe [...] "the jury's overall appraisal of this witness would have been substantially affected by the knowledge that he was being less than forthright concerning his source of income." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Dred Scott {{decision}} expressly gives {{every citizen}} of the United States a right to carry his slaves into the United States Territories. And now there was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right, and saying, too, {{that the people of}} the Territory could lawfully drive slavery out again. When all the trash, the words, the <b>collateral</b> <b>matter,</b> was cleared away from it, all the chaff was fanned out of it, it was a bare absurdity,--no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from where it has a lawful right to be. Clear it of all the verbiage, and that is the naked truth of his proposition,--that a thing may be lawfully driven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay. Well, it was because the judge could n't help seeing this that he has had so much trouble with it; and what I want to ask your especial attention to, just now, is to remind you, if you have not noticed the fact, that the judge does not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery. He does not say so in the copyright essay; he did not say so in the speech that he made here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to the Senate he has never said, as he did at Freeport, that the people of the Territories can exclude slavery. He desires that you, who wish the Territories to remain free, should believe that he stands by that position; but he does not say it himself. He escapes to some extent the absurd position I have stated, by changing his language entirely. What he says now is something different in language, and we will consider whether it is not different in sense too. It is now that the Dred Scott decision, or rather the Constitution under that decision, does not carry slavery into the Territories beyond the power {{of the people of the}} Territories to control it as other property. He does not say the people can drive it out, but they can control it as other property. The language is different; we should consider whether the sense is different. Driving a horse out of this lot is too plain a proposition to be mistaken about; it is putting him on the other side of the fence. Or it might be a sort of exclusion of him from the lot if you were to kill him and let the worms devour him; but neither of these things is the same as [...] "controlling him as other property." [...] That would be to feed him, to pamper him, to ride him, to use and abuse him, to make the most money out of him, [...] "as other property"; but, please you, what do the men who are in favor of slavery want more than this? What do they really want, other than that slavery, being in the Territories, shall be controlled as other property? If they want anything else, I do not comprehend it. I ask your attention to this, first, for the purpose of pointing out the change of ground the judge has made; and, in the second place, the importance of the change,--that that change is not such as to give you gentlemen who want his popular sovereignty the power to exclude the institution or drive it out at all. I know the judge sometimes squints at the argument that in controlling it as other property by unfriendly legislation they may control it to death; as you might, in the case of a horse, perhaps, feed him so lightly and ride him so much that he would die. But when you come to legislative control, there is something more to be attended to. I have no doubt, myself, that if the Territories should undertake to control slave property as other property that is, control it in such a way that it would be the most valuable as property, and make it bear its just proportion in the way of burdens as property, really deal with it as property,--the Supreme Court of the United States will say, [...] "God speed you, and amen." [...] But I undertake to give the opinion, at least, that if the Territories attempt by any direct legislation to drive the man with his slave out of the Territory, or to decide that his slave is free because of his being taken in there, or to tax him to such an extent that he cannot keep him there, the Supreme Court will unhesitatingly decide all such legislation unconstitutional, as long as that Supreme Court is constructed as the Dred Scott Supreme Court is. The first two things they have already decided, except that there is a little quibble among lawyers between the words [...] "dicta" [...] and [...] "decision." [...] They have already decided a negro cannot be made free by Territorial legislation.|$|E

In this setting, we study the partial and general equilibrium effects of legal reforms which enhance the use of formal collateral. We lay bare the mechanism by which these reforms expand the scope of arms-length trade and market development.

6000|$|But his intellect {{was active}} and rapid, rather than powerful, {{and in all}} his {{writings}} we feel the want of a stronger electric current to give that vigor of conception and felicity of expression, by which we distinguish the undefinable something called genius; while his moral nature, though refined and elevated, {{seems to have been}} subordinate to his intellectual tendencies and social qualities, and to have had itself little determining influence on his life. His career was less exceptional than his character: a youth marked by delicate health and studious tastes, a short-lived and not very successful share in the management of the Athenæum, a fever of sympathy with Spanish patriots, arrested before it reached a dangerous crisis by an early love affair ending in marriage, a fifteen months’ residence in the West Indies, eight months of curate’s duty at Herstmonceux, relinquished on the ground of failing health, and through his remaining years a succession of migrations to the South in search of a friendly climate, with the occasional publication of an “article,” a tale, or a poem in Blackwood or elsewhere—this, on the prosaic background of an easy competence, was what made up the outer tissue of Sterling’s existence. The impression of his intellectual power on his personal friends seems to have been produced chiefly by the eloquence and brilliancy of his conversation; but the mere reader of his works and letters would augur from them neither the wit nor the curiosa felicitas of epithet and imagery, which would rank him with the men whose sayings are thought worthy of perpetuation in books of table-talk and “ana.” The public, then, since it is content to do without biographies of much more remarkable men, cannot be supposed to have felt any pressing demand even for a single life of Sterling; still less, it might be thought, when so distinguished a writer as Archdeacon Hare had furnished this, could there be any need for another. But, in opposition to the majority of Mr. Carlyle’s critics, we agree with him that the first life is properly the justification of the second. Even among the readers personally unacquainted with Sterling, those who sympathized with his ultimate alienation from the Church, rather than with his transient conformity, were likely to be dissatisfied with the entirely apologetic tone of Hare’s life, which, indeed, is confessedly an incomplete presentation of Sterling’s mental course after his opinions diverged from those of his clerical biographer; while those attached friends (and Sterling possessed the happy magic that secures many such) who knew him best during this latter part of his career, would naturally be pained to have it represented, though only by implication, as a sort of deepening declension ending in a virtual retraction. Of such friends Carlyle was the most eminent, and perhaps the most highly valued, and, as co-trustee with Archdeacon Hare of Sterling’s literary character and writings, he felt a kind of responsibility that no mistaken idea of his departed friend should remain before the world without correction. Evidently, however, his “Life of Sterling” was not so much the conscientious discharge of a trust as a labor of love, and to this is owing its strong charm. Carlyle here shows us his “sunny side.” We no longer see him breathing out threatenings and slaughter as in the Latter-Day Pamphlets, but moving among the charities and amenities of life, loving and beloved—a Teufelsdröckh still, but humanized by a Blumine worthy of him. We have often wished that genius would incline itself more frequently to the task of the biographer—that when some great or good personage dies, instead of the dreary three or five volumed compilations of letter, and diary, and detail, little to the purpose, which two thirds of the reading public have not the chance, nor the other third the inclination, to read, we could have a real “Life,” setting forth briefly and vividly the man’s inward and outward struggles, aims, and achievements, so as to make clear the meaning which his experience has for his fellows. A few such lives (chiefly, indeed, autobiographies) the world possesses, and they have, perhaps, been more influential on the formation of character than any other kind of reading. But the conditions required for the perfection of life writing—personal intimacy, a loving and poetic nature which sees the beauty and the depth of familiar things, and the artistic power which seizes characteristic points and renders them with lifelike effect—are seldom found in combination. “The Life of Sterling” is an instance of this rare conjunction. Its comparatively tame scenes and incidents gather picturesqueness and interest under the rich lights of Carlyle’s mind. We are told neither too little nor too much; the facts noted, the letters selected, are all such as serve to give the liveliest conception of what Sterling was and what he did; and though the book speaks much of other persons, this <b>collateral</b> <b>matter</b> is all a kind of scene-painting, and is accessory to the main purpose. The portrait of Coleridge, for example, is precisely adapted to bring before us the intellectual region in which Sterling lived for some time before entering the Church. Almost every review has extracted this admirable description, in which genial veneration and compassion struggle with irresistible satire; but the emphasis of quotation cannot be too often given to the following pregnant paragraph: ...|$|E

Firstly, it will be legally admissible if it is probative of a relevant matter. Secondly, judges will have to weigh the argument in favour of admitting the evidence against any arguments against admitting it, such as, the evidence relates to a <b>collateral</b> <b>matter,</b> is potentially prejudicial or unduly burdensome.|$|E

50|$|A writ of {{prohibition}} is issued primarily to prevent an inferior court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction in cases pending before it or acting contrary {{to the rules of}} natural justice. It is issued by a superior court to inferior courts from usurping a jurisdiction with which it was not legally vested, or in other words to compel inferior courts to keep within the limits of their jurisdiction. Thus the writ is issued in both cases where there is excess of jurisdiction and where there is absence of jurisdiction. Prohibition is not a continuation of the proceedings to be prohibited. Its object is on the contrary to arrest the inferior tribunal's proceedings. It is a <b>collateral</b> <b>matter</b> progress essentially between the two tribunals, an inferior one and other superior one by which the latter, by virtue its power of superintendence over the former, restrains it within its rightful competence.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{temporal}} lobe white matter changes accompanying hippocampal sclerosis on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using single-voxel H- 1 MR spectroscopy and to strengthen the hypothesis that these white matter changes are caused by myelin alterations. In 11 patients with histologically proven hippocampal sclerosis, preoperative coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were visually assessed by two experienced neuroradiologists for hippocampal signal increase and size decrease, atrophy of <b>collateral</b> white <b>matter,</b> and temporal lobe gray/white matter demarcation loss. Single-voxel H- 1 MR spectroscopy of the white matter of each anterior temporal lobe was also performed, excluding the amygdala and hippocampus. The N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) /choline and NAA/creatine ratios were calculated. In 12 healthy volunteers both temporal lobes were spectroscopically examined. In all patients the excised hippocampi were histologically assessed for the presence of sclerosis, and the excised neocortical temporal lobes were examined for gray and white matter abnormalities. MRI abnormalities were found on the right in six patients, on the left in four, and one scan was normal. Hippocampal signal increase was seen in nine patients, hippocampal size decrease in ten, atrophy of <b>collateral</b> white <b>matter</b> in nine, and gray/white matter demarcation loss in six. A significant decrease in the NAA/choline ratio was found in temporal lobe white matter ipsilateral to the pathologic hippocampus (symptomatic side), compared with the contralateral, asymptomatic side (P < 0. 01), and also compared with controls (P < 0. 001). The ipsilateral NAA/creatine ratio was also significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) compared with the contralateral side and the control subjects (P < 0. 001).

40|$|I {{start in}} Section I of this Article with an {{examination}} of the first major theme of the criminal procedure decisions of the Warren Court, the selective incorporation of Bill of Rights 2 ̆ 7 guarantees into the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. My conclusion is that the selective incorporation principle, which provided the doctrinal basis for many of the 2 ̆ 2 liberal 2 ̆ 2 decisions of the Warren Court, remains firmly established today under the Burger Court. Section II of the Article then analyzes the theme of equality and the role it played in Warren Court decisions in the criminal procedure area. It is my conclusion that the Burger Court has not undermined, and in some cases has actually expanded upon, the equality theme. Section III compares the records of the Warren and Burger Courts in adopting expansive interpretations of constitutional rights that protect the accused. It begins by noting that the Warren Court record in this area must be placed in proper perspective; while the Court did display a strong preference for expansive interpretations, it also refused to adopt expansive interpretations in numerous key cases. Section III then analyzes the Burger Court decisions and finds a rather mixed record. It concludes that in most areas outside of police practices the Burger Court has tended either to expand upon the Warren Court interpretations or to leave the governing guidelines largely as they stood under Warren Court decisions. The one or two exceptions involve departures from Warren Court precedent that had little substantive impact in protecting civil liberties. Section III does conclude that the Burger Court decisions on police practices have restricted the scope of various Warren Court rulings. Some of these restrictions, however, might well have been accepted by the Warren Court if the appropriate factual situations had been at issue before it. Also, the restrictions imposed so far have related primarily to <b>collateral</b> <b>matters</b> that do not substantially affect the practical impact of the major Warren Court decisions on police practices. Section III further concludes that the restrictions most likely to be imposed by the Burger Court in the future also would not undermine the basic functions of those Warren Court rulings. Finally, Section IV of the Article examines the image of the Burger Court and suggests that, if proper attention is paid to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s actual holdings, as opposed to the style of its decisions, civil libertarians would discover that they could better serve their cause by avoiding wholesale attacks on the Burger Court and lending their public support to the various Burger Court rulings that stress the continuing need to safeguard the basic rights of the accused...|$|R
60|$|The instances, {{according}} to my personal experience, are very rare, and even those are not very satisfactory, in which some event recalls a memory that had lain absolutely dormant for many years. In this very series of experiments a recollection which I thought had entirely lapsed appeared under no less than three different aspects on different occasions. It was this: when I was a boy, my father, who was anxious that I should learn something of physical science, which was then never taught at school, arranged with {{the owner of a}} large chemist's shop to let me dabble at chemistry for a few days in his laboratory. I had not thought of this fact, so far as I was aware, for many years; but in scrutinising the fleeting associations called up by the various words, I traced two mental visual images (an alembic and a particular arrangement of tables and light), and one mental sense of smell (chlorine gas) to that very laboratory. I recognised that these images appeared familiar to me, but I had not thought of their origin. No doubt if some strange conjunction of circumstances had suddenly recalled those three associations at the same time, with perhaps two or three other <b>collateral</b> <b>matters</b> which may be still living in my memory, but which I no not as yet identify, a mental perception of startling vividness would be the result, and I should have falsely imagined that it had supernaturally, as it were, started into life from an entire oblivion extending over many years. Probably many persons would have registered such a case as evidence that things once perceived can never wholly vanish from the recollection, but that in the hour of death, or under some excitement, every event of a past life may reappear. To this view I entirely dissent. Forgetfulness appears absolute {{in the vast majority of}} cases, and our supposed recollections of a past life are, I believe, no more than that of a large number of episodes in it, to be reckoned perhaps in hundreds of thousands, but certainly not in tens of hundreds of thousands, that have escaped oblivion. Every one of the fleeting, half-conscious thoughts that were the subject of my experiments, admitted of being vivified by keen attention, or by some appropriate association, but I strongly suspect that ideas which have long since ceased to fleet through the brain, owing to the absence of current associations to call them up, disappear wholly. A comparison of old memories with a newly-met friend of one's boyhood, about the events we then witnessed together, show how much we had each of us forgotten. Our recollections do not tally. Actors and incidents that seem to have been of primary importance in those events to the one have been utterly forgotten by the other. The recollection of our earlier years are, in truth, very scanty, as any one will find who tries to enumerate them.|$|R

Nevertheless, actually there is one more IPRs form which is recognized by other countries, which can be used as collateral also, that is trade secrets. This work will examine three matters, why trade secrets were excluded from the plan; how should the Government of Indonesia change the laws to classify trade secrets to be used collateral and what the contents of regulations which should be amended and established to qualify trade secrets can be used as collateral for MSMEs. This study applied the framework of documentary research in the style of comparative legal research. Regulations which are used to make comparison with the Indonesian’s regulations are regulations related to collateralization on trade secrets in Australia, the USA, Thailand and the PRC. In order to get insightful from the Indonesian authorities’ perspective, the writer conducted consultations with officers of the Ministry of Cooperation and SMEs and Directorate General of IP Office of Indonesia. The finding of this study shows that, trade secrets were excluded from the plan to use IPRs certificates as collateral because the officer did not mention trade secrets explicitly like the other forms of IPRs. In order to qualify trade secrets as collateral, the procedures to change the law should be conducted based on the Law Number 12 Year 2011 regarding the Establishment of Regulations. There are some regulations which should be amended, The Law Number 30 Year 2000 regarding Trade Secrets, The Law Number 42 Year 1999 regarding Fiduciary matters, The Law Number 37 Year 2004 regarding Bankruptcy and Suspension of Payment and a Ministry Regulation. In addition there are some technical regulations need to be established. The finding of this study is significant for knowledge and hopefully can give contribution to the Government of Indonesia to not be reluctant to establish policies or regulation to include trade secrets in the plan to use certificates of IPRs as collateral. Furthermore, this study proposes recommendations on what regulations which should be amended and established to qualify trade secrets as <b>collateral</b> and <b>matters</b> which should be stated in those regulations...|$|R
60|$|Here be it said, {{that this}} pertinacious pursuit of one {{particular}} whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, {{is a thing}} by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both {{the direction in which}} he will continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's coast is to him. So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or wind-bound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many <b>collateral</b> subtile <b>matters</b> touching the chase of whales.|$|R
40|$|Neurons {{may serve}} {{different}} functions {{over the course}} of an organism’s life. Recent evidence suggests that cortical subplate neurons including those that reside in the white matter may perform longitudinal multi-tasking at different stages of development. These cells {{play a key role in}} early cortical development in coordinating thalamocortical reciprocal innervation. At later stages of development, they become integrated within the cortical microcircuitry. This type of longitudinal multi-tasking can enhance the capacity for information processing by populations of cells serving different functions over the lifespan. Subplate cells are initially derived when cells from the ventricular zone underlying the cortex migrate to the cortical preplate that is subsequently split by the differentiating neurons of the cortical plate with some neurons locating in the marginal zone and others settling below in the subplate (SP). While the cortical plate neurons form most of the cortical layers (layers 2 - 6), the marginal zone neurons form layer 1 and the SP neurons become interstitial cells of the white matter as well as forming a compact sublayer along the bottom of layer 6. After serving as transient innervation targets for thalamocortical axons, most of these cells die and layer 4 neurons become innervated by thalamic axons. However, 10 - 20 % survives, remaining into adulthood along the bottom of layer 6 and as a scattered population of interstitial neurons in the white matter. Surviving subplate cells’ axons project throughout the overlying laminae, reaching layer 1 and issuing axon <b>collaterals</b> within white <b>matter</b> and in lower layer 6. This suggests that they participate in local synaptic networks, as well. Moreover, they receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, potentially monitoring outputs from axon collaterals of cortical efferents, from cortical afferents and/or from each other. We explore our understanding of the functional connectivity of these cells at different stages of development...|$|R

40|$|Criminal {{defendants}} have {{a constitutional}} right to effective assistance of counsel. In Nebraska, defendants can enforce this right either on direct appeal or through a postconviction proceeding. In either forum, a defendant must show that his counsel’s performance was deficient. This Note argues that the Nebraska Supreme Court extended the scope of its review of ineffectiveness claims in State v. Rocha, and the test the court applied in Rocha needs reform. Part II explains the standard for ineffective assistance claims under Strickland v. Washington and examines the Nebraska Supreme Court’s analysis in Faust. Part III looks closely at the Rocha decision, and Part IV compares the analyses employed by the Nebraska Supreme Court in Faust and Rocha. It argues that although the court claimed its decision in Rocha was in line with Faust, the court’s reasoning in Rocha actually expanded the scope of the court’s review of ineffective assistance claims significantly. It asserts that, consistent with the court’s concern for conservation of judicial resources, the Nebraska Supreme Court should reform the test it applied in Rocha. Subsection IV. B argues that reforming the Rocha test is not enough to correct Nebraska’s approach; the Nebraska Supreme Court should also stop applying the postconviction procedural default rule to the claims. Nebraska’s use of the procedural default rule pressures defendants into raising ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal that could never be resolved there, a result inconsistent with the policies behind the rule. Nebraska’s appellate courts must then address the claims prematurely, potentially wasting judicial resources and harming defendants. Additionally, in a postconviction proceeding, more resources are wasted when the court must analyze whether the claim is defaulted before it can turn to the merits. The sounder policy, endorsed by the Supreme Court of the United States and the great majority of states, is to allow defendants to bring ineffectiveness claims in the first instance in a <b>collateral</b> proceeding, no <b>matter</b> the state of the record. This dual reform is necessary to conserve Nebraska’s judicial resources and protect Nebraska defendants...|$|R
40|$|Equity {{runs through}} the law of habeas corpus. Throughout {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries, prisoners in England sought the Great Writ {{primarily}} from a common law court — the Court of King’s Bench — but that court’s exercise of power to issue the writ was built around equitable principles. Against this backdrop, {{it is hardly surprising that}} modern-day habeas law draws deeply on traditional equitable considerations. Criticism of current habeas doctrine centers on the risk that its rules — and particularly the five gatekeeping doctrines that preclude consideration of claims — produce unfair results. But in fact four of these five bars exhibit significant equitable characteristics. The only outlier is the Court’s retroactivity bar, which prohibits relief whenever an applicant relies on a new rule of constitutional procedure. Taking no account of the blamelessness of the applicant’s conduct or the nature of the claim, the law of retroactivity applies in a wooden fashion that is at odds with principles of equity. The nonequitable nature of the retroactivity bar causes both individual and institutional harms. Of particular importance, because it operates irrespective of how compelling the individual claim of error may be, it blocks the opportunity to secure relief on claims in approximately one quarter of all capital cases. The nonretroactivity rule also thwarts the efforts of courts to recognize new rights applicable to <b>collateral</b> proceedings, no <b>matter</b> how sound such new rights might be. This Article argues that the Court should modify its nonretroactivity doctrine to reflect equity’s traditions. In particular, the Court should adopt three individualized equitable exceptions to the now-absolute retroactivity bar that take account of applicants’ conduct in pursuing claims, the merits of the claim and the stakes involved, and the unavailability of alternative remedies. These exceptions might not alleviate all of the inequities created by the nonretroactivity rule. They would, however, bring it more in line with its four companion habeas bars, providing a measure of coherence to these gatekeeping doctrines and reconnecting the nonretroactivity rule with the writ’s deep equitable roots...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} factors that explain when groups are most or least likely to target civilians. While civilians are a particularly appealing target because {{they are easy to}} attack, many groups {{go to great lengths to}} avoid them. Thus, the question motivating my research is: given the potential windfalls implicit in civilian attacks, why do some organizations target them while others do not?. In this project, I take a two-step approach to answering this question. I begin by looking at what targets groups are likely to attack given the government from which they wish to gain political concessions. Based on a coercive model of violence, I argue groups attack those segments of society that apply the most pressure on a government. In general terms, the most influential segments of society for any government are its minimum winning coalition and selectorate. After surveying the literature on a large number of different regime types, I conclude that civilians face the highest risk of being attacked in democracies because, unlike forms of non- democracy, the minimum winning coalition and selectorate in democracies are composed of civilians. The second step, and the bulk of this project, examines civilian targeting within democratic contexts. To address variation within democracies, I argue that violent groups are most likely to attack civilians when doing so does not hurt their supporters or undermine the support they receive from the larger population. Although attacks on civilians are easy to execute and democratic political institutions encourage such attacks, these attacks impose high costs (often in the form of government repression) on the segment of the civilian population that supports the violent group. In addition, attacks on civilian supporters may alienate some of the group's supporters who will not back a group that targets innocent civilians. Losing civilian supporters is problematic for violent organizations that draw heavily from community-level alliances for operational success and political leverage. My theory identifies and explores three unique conditions that make groups more or less likely to attack civilians within democracies. First, when a violent group runs for political office, a community can punish the group. Consequently, groups with political wings temper their violence by attacking civilians less often. Secondly, when a terrorist group provides goods and services throughout neighborhoods for its supporters, it offsets the costs associated with violence on civilian targets. Compared to groups that don't distribute resources, provider groups are more likely to target civilians because the consequences are not as dire. Finally, when a terrorist group draws support from a highly segmented part of the population, it is easier for the group's enemies (usually government authorities, but a group's enemies may also include other violent groups) to repress and intimidate the group's supporters. When this occurs, groups are less likely to attack civilians because their support base suffers more costs from reprisals. Each condition emphasizes the same innovative contribution: civilians matter, and not just as <b>collateral</b> damage. They <b>matter</b> because violent groups rely on them and, as a result, they affect the type of violence groups pursue. I test my theory using large-N statistical analyses and detailed case research. My empirical work presents new data on terrorist groups, including their political (non- violent) and redistributive activities. Using this data, I test my claims using a cross-national dataset of attacks over the last forty years. My case research focuses on the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Northern Ireland. The case of the IRA demonstrates how involvement in politics decreases the odds a group will attack civilian...|$|R
6000|$|... § 27. And in {{reasoning}} {{about the}} effect of mountains we are therefore under a difficulty like that which would occur to us if we had to determine the good or bad effect of light on the human constitution, in some place where all corporal exercise was necessarily in partial darkness, and only idle people lived in the light. The exercise might give an advantage to the occupants of the gloom, but we should neither be justified in therefore denying the preciousness of light in general, nor the necessity to the workers of the few rays they possessed; and thus I suppose the hills around Stratford, and such glimpses as Shakespere had of sandstone and pines in Warwickshire, or of chalk cliffs in Kent, to have been essential to the development of his genius. This supposition can only be proved false by the rising of a Shakespere at Rotterdam or Bergen-op-Zoom, which I think not probable; whereas, on the other hand, it is confirmed by myriads of <b>collateral</b> evidences. The <b>matter</b> could only be tested by placing for half a century the British universities at Keswick, and Beddgelert, and making Grenoble the capital of France; but if, throughout the history of Britain and France, we contrast the general invention and pathetic power, in ballads or legends, of the inhabitants of the Scottish Border with those manifested in Suffolk or Essex; and similarly the inventive power of Normandy, Provence, and the Bearnois with that of Champagne or Picardy, we shall obtain some convincing evidence respecting the operation of hills on the masses of mankind, and be disposed to admit, with less hesitation, that the apparent inconsistencies in the effect of scenery on greater minds proceed in each case from specialities of education, accident, and original temper, which {{it would be impossible to}} follow out in detail. Sometimes only, when the original resemblance in character of intellect is very marked in two individuals, and they are submitted to definitely contrary circumstances of education, an approximation to evidence may be obtained. Thus Bacon and Pascal appear to be men naturally very similar in their temper and powers of mind. One, born in York House, Strand, of courtly parents, educated in court atmosphere, and replying, almost as soon as he could speak, to the queen asking how old he was--"Two years younger than Your Majesty's happy reign!"--has the world's meanness and cunning engrafted into his intellect, and remains smooth, serene, unenthusiastic, and in some degree base, even with all his sincere devotion and universal wisdom; bearing, to the end of life, the likeness of a marble palace in the street of a great city, fairly furnished within, and bright in wall and battlement, yet noisome in places about the foundations. The other, born at Clermont, in Auvergne, under the shadow of the Puy de Dôme, though taken to Paris at eight years old, retains for ever the impress of his birthplace; pursuing natural philosophy with the same zeal as Bacon, he returns to his own mountains to put himself under their tutelage, and by their help first discovers the great relations of the earth and the air: struck at last with mortal disease; gloomy, enthusiastic, and superstitious, with a conscience burning like lava, and inflexible like iron, the clouds gather about the majesty of him, fold after fold; and, with his spirit buried in ashes, and rent by earthquake, yet fruitful of true thought and faithful affection, he stands like that mound of desolate scoria that crowns the hill ranges of his native land, with its sable summit far in heaven, and its foundations green with the ordered garden and the trellised vine.|$|R
