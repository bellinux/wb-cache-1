The current frameworks are: the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) for general and vocational qualifications regulated by Ofqual in England and the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) in Northern Ireland; the <b>Credit</b> and Qualifications <b>Framework</b> for Wales (CQFW) for all qualifications in Wales; the Scottish <b>Credit</b> and Qualifications <b>Framework</b> (SCQF) for all qualifications in Scotland; and the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies (FHEQ) for qualifications awarded by bodies across the United Kingdom with degree-awarding powers. <b>Credit</b> <b>frameworks</b> use the UK credit pioneered by the Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme, where 1 credit = 10 hours of nominal learning.|$|R
40|$|Global {{trends are}} {{transforming}} nearly every sector, {{and the higher}} education sector is not an exception. Universities are synchronizing their curricula so that credits are transferrable and cumulative across countries. Governments are increasingly controlling {{the quality of education}} through new regulations. Universities are now competing globally and managerial methods derived from business are being introduced. In South America, an increasing student population is demanding access to universities, {{while at the same time}} universities are facing a reduction in funding and more competition. The profile of students is shifting and demanding more flexible curricula along with double degree and continuing education programs. All of these trends, together with government regulations passed in 1992, have caused major transformations in the Colombian higher education sector. Universities have been straining to remain competitive in this new environment and many have attempted to implement <b>credit</b> <b>frameworks</b> as a solution. However, such transformations are complex and require uncommon managerial competencies. Furthermore, very little research has been done to understand the real impact of these changes in Colombian Universities, and any studies done have not provided a full picture of what was really happening within the management of Colombian Universities. Did universities fully understand the concept and complexity of implementing <b>credit</b> <b>frameworks?</b> What were the main drivers affecting the higher education sector in Colombia which catalysed the implementation of <b>credit</b> <b>frameworks?</b> Finally, what impact did this implementation have on university management? This research study attempted to answer these questions through an in-depth study of three representative universities. The results showed clear differences and also common understandings among universities and revealed key insights into university management. It is the hope of this research study that it may assist universities and policy makers in the on-going transformation of the Colombian higher education sector...|$|R
