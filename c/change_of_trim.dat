50|$|The squat {{effect is}} the {{hydrodynamic}} phenomenon {{by which a}} vessel moving quickly through shallow water creates an area of lowered pressure that causes the ship {{to be closer to}} the seabed than would otherwise be expected. This phenomenon is caused when water that should normally flow under the hull encounters resistance due to the close proximity of the hull to the seabed. Leonardo's law causes the water to move faster in water level (where section is smaller); according Bernoullì's theorem, a velocity increasing determinates a low-pressure area so that ship is pulled down. This squat effect results from a combination of vertical sinkage and a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>trim</b> that may cause the vessel to dip towards the stern or towards the bow.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a polarized morphology with a single axon and multiple dendrites is an essential step during neuronal differentiation. This cellular polarization is largely depending on changes in {{the dynamics of the}} neuronal cytoskeleton. Here, we show that the tripartite motif (TRIM) -NHL protein TRIM 2 is regulating axon specification in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, where one of several initially indistinguishable neurites is selected to become the axon. Suppression <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 2 by RNA interference results in the loss of neuronal polarity while over-expression <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 2 induces the specification <b>of</b> multiple axons. <b>TRIM</b> 2 conducts its function during neuronal polarization by ubiquitination of the neurofilament light chain. Together, our results imply an important function <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 2 for axon outgrowth during development...|$|R
