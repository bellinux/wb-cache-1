40|$|Dormancy is {{commonly}} separated into a rest period, when the buds remain dormant due to growth-arresting physiological conditions, and a quiescent period, when the buds remain dormant due to unfavourable environmental conditions. A sequential model predicting {{the number of}} days during dormancy based on accumulation of chill days during rest and anti-chill days during quiescence is described. Chill days and anti-chill days are calculated using the single triangle method to estimate degree days relative to a threshold temperature. The temperature threshold for calculating the chill and anti-chill days and the chilling requirement to determine when rest is broken are found by trial and error to minimize the root mean square error of predicted and observed bud-burst dates. Using several years of weather and phenological data for cherry, pear, kiwifruit and olive orchards and nine forest species from locations in Sardinia, Italy, the Chill days model performed better than four classical <b>chill</b> <b>unit</b> models and two chilling hour models. The classical <b>chill</b> <b>unit</b> and <b>chilling</b> hour models failed to predict bud-burst in some years depending on the species and climate, whereas the Chill days model always gave good results.

Apart from the effect of climate change on water supply, the <b>chill</b> <b>unit</b> requirement of deciduous fruit crops is also expected to be affected. Although research on crop water use has been undertaken, researchers have not taken the future climate into consideration. They also have focused on increasing temperatures but failed to relate temperature to <b>chill</b> <b>unit</b> accumulation, especially in South Africa. With a view of helping farmers to adapt to climate change, in this study we provide information that will assist farmers in their decision-making process for adaptation and in the selection of appropriate cultivars of deciduous fruits. Crop water use and <b>chill</b> <b>unit</b> requirements are modelled for the present and future climate. Results show that, irrespective of the irrigation system employed, climate change has led to increases in crop water use. Water use with the drip irrigation system was lower than with sprinkler irrigation as a result of efficiency differences in the irrigation technologies. It was also confirmed that the accumulated <b>chill</b> <b>units</b> will decrease in the future as a consequence of climate change. In order to remain in production, farmers need to adapt to climate change stress by putting in place water resources and crop management plans. Thus, producers must be furnished with a variety of adaptation or management strategies to overcome the impact of climate change. Significance: Producers must closely monitor the usage of efficient irrigation technology. Climate adaptation needs to be anticipated years in advance and will require a transition to different crop species or cultivars or the development of management practices. The results of this study will guide producers in the selection of cultivars when re-establishing their orchards...|$|R
40|$|Two {{areas of}} {{research}} are reported: an experiment {{on the effects of}} warm temperature prestratification treatments on seed dormancy and a new <b>chill</b> <b>unit</b> model. Crabapple seeds (Malus sargentii Rehd.) were allowed to imbibe water and were given warm pretreatments at temperatures of 16, 20, 24 and 28 C for periods of 3, 10, 20 or 30 days before cold stratification at 4 C for 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 days. Pretreatments resulted in increased chilling requirements for seedling emergence. A short chilling period (20 days) also altered the leaf area, shoot length, internodal length and root/shoot ratio of the resulting seedlings. The new <b>chill</b> <b>unit</b> model was developed from data from seed experiments and tested with records of 11 years. A three-dimensional model for the transition through apple tree dormancy is proposed. The new model evaluates the effectiveness of different temperatures for the transition between dormancy induction and dormancy release according to physiological time. The standard of measurement for this model is the <b>chill</b> <b>unit</b> (CU), which is defined as the equivalent of one-hour exposure to the optimal temperature during the optimal physiological time for dormancy development. The general pattern of temperature activity for dormancy development is sigmoidal; and temperature effectiveness through the process varies according to length of exposure, temperature cycling and time. The new model permits a more accurate prediction of dormancy development under subtropical conditions than previous models and will predict the amount of leafing that will occur in spring. The prediction efficiency of leafing under subtropical conditions was improved from an r 2 of 0. 66 for the Utah <b>Chill</b> <b>Unit</b> Model to an r 2 of 0. 74 for the new model when compared under Mexican conditions...|$|R
