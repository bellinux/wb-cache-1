40|$|This thesis {{presents}} six optimization models {{which are}} developed and solved in two stages {{in order to}} integrate tolerancing and machining parameters decisions. One model is developed in the first stage. The first-stage model is related to a design problem and provides better part tolerance {{to be used in}} the second stage to incorporate tool adjustment decisions into the optimization of machining parameters. Five models are developed in the second stage and are divided into single-machine and multi-machine turning operation problems. For single-machine turning operations, three models are formulated. The first is a single-product multi-pass model considering pass selection for determining optimum <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>feed</b> rate, depth of cut, dimension deviation and number of passes. The second is a single-product multi-pass model considering inventory and setup costs to find optimum <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>feed</b> rate, depth of cut, dimension deviation and batch size. The third is a multi-product multi-pass model considering inventory and setup costs for selection of optimum <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>feed</b> rate, depth of cut, dimension deviations and production cycle time. For multi-machine turning operations, two models are formulated. One is a multi-feature multi-pass model with the objective of minimizing total cost for determining optimum workload assignment, <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>feed</b> rate, depth of cut, and feature dimension deviations of machine-pass-feature combinations. The second is a multi-feature multi-pass model with the objective of minimizing cycle time which, once solved, will give optimum workload assignment, <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>feed</b> rate, depth of cut, and feature dimension deviations of machine-pass-feature combinations. A solution method and illustrative examples are given to test the feasibility of the developed optimization models. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|Tool wear {{condition}} monitoring {{has the potential}} to {{play a critical role in}} ensuring the dimensional accuracy of the workpiece and prevention of damage to cutting equipment. It could also help in automating cutting processes. In this paper, the <b>feed</b> <b>cutting</b> force estimated with the aid of an inexpensive current sensor installed on the ac servomotor of a computerized numerical control turning center is used to monitor tool {{wear condition}}. To achieve this, the feed drive system is modeled, using neuro-fuzzy techniques, to provide the framework for estimating the <b>feed</b> <b>cutting</b> force based on the feed motor current measured. Functional dependence of the <b>feed</b> <b>cutting</b> force on tool wear and cutting parameters are then expressed in the form of a difference equation relating variation in the <b>feed</b> <b>cutting</b> force to tool wear rate.

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} the {{unconfined compressive strength}} (UCS) of rocks from drilling data is a promising in-situ method and has been studied by many researchers. In most studies, experimental methods {{have been used to}} determine the relationship between UCS and drilling data. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to describe rock drilling processes using drag bits and rotary drills, and to deduce the relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke). In this model, a drilling process is divided into cycles, each of which includes two motions: <b>feeding</b> and <b>cutting.</b> <b>Feeding</b> is treated as an indentation motion. There is a linear relation between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). The cutting forces and friction forces of both the rake surface and the flank surface are examined. Also, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank surface of the bit and the rock. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts respectively generated from <b>cutting,</b> friction, <b>feeding,</b> and idle running. Torque caused by friction and idle running is ineffective for drilling, whereas that caused by cutting and indentation is effective. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts respectively from <b>cutting,</b> friction, <b>feeding,</b> and idle running. For the purposes of this study, effective specific energy is defined as the sum of specific energy consumed by <b>cutting</b> and <b>feeding.</b> Effective specific energy is independent of the penetration rate. Since it is proportional to the UCS of the rocks, it is not influenced by the penetration rate, and is more useful in the evaluation of UCS than other parameters. Some laboratory and field tests were conducted, and the results verified the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|R

40|$|The {{productivity}} of machining centers is influenced strongly {{by the quality}} of NC programs. To investigate the productivity, an NC program simulator has been developed to analyze and evaluate an NC program by decoding its NC codes. With the simulator, even before the actual machining, the tool paths can be displayed and the operational times occupied in the positioning feed motion and <b>cutting</b> <b>feed</b> motion, etc. can be calculated. The effects of the maximum speed and the acceleration of positioning feed on the productivity have been analyzed. Additionally, the influence of feedrate override function to shorten the operational time has been investigated in the conventional and the high speed cutting, respectively. From the results obtained from analyzing three NC programs, it is found that the effectiveness of the override function depends on the relation among the average moving distance, the commanded feedrate and the acceleration of <b>cutting</b> <b>feed.</b> Especially, {{in the case of the}} NC program for machining dies or molds, the productivity will be hardly improved using faster feedrate, because the actual feedrate hardly increases as expected due to the tiny moving distances of NC blocks.

40|$|The {{surface finish}} was {{extensively}} studied in usual machining processes (turning, milling, and drilling). For these processes, {{the surface finish}} is strongly influenced by the <b>cutting</b> <b>feed</b> and the tool nose radius. However, {{a basic understanding of}} tool/surface finish interaction and residual stress generation has been lacking. This paper aims to investigate the surface finish and residual stresses under the orthogonal cutting since it can provide this information by avoiding the effect of the tool nose radius. The orthogonal machining of AA 7075 -T 651 alloy through a series of cutting experiments was performed under dry conditions. Surface finish was studied using height and amplitude distribution roughness parameters. SEM and EDS were used to analyze surface damage and built-up edge (BUE) formation. An analysis of the surface topography showed that the surface roughness was sensitive to changes in cutting parameters. It was found that the formation of BUE and the interaction between the tool edge and the iron-rich intermetallic particles play a determinant role in controlling the surface finish during dry orthogonal machining of the AA 7075 -T 651 alloy. Hoop stress was predominantly compressive on the surface and tended to be tensile with increased cutting speed. The reverse occurred for the surface axial stress.

The monitoring system uses the effects of turning variables on acoustic emission signal responses and factorial experimental design approach. In cutting op-erations, acoustic emission provides useful information concerning the tool wear condition because of the fundamental differences between its source mechanisms in the rubbing friction on the wear land of the single point tool. In this study, effects of <b>cutting</b> speed, <b>feed</b> and tool condition on the acoustic emission signal are investigated using acoustic emission’s energy, amplitude, and fre-quency response and 23 factorial design for turning operation. Cutting tests were performed using high-speed steel under dry conditions.
