In this paper, we argue that migra-tion occurs at, or near, the percolation threshold of the carrier system and show that he oil-rock contact volumes are {{a function of the}} heterogeneity of he threshold pressure field of the medium, as well as theorientation ofthe sedimentary fabric relative to the orientation ofthe net migration vector. The flow properties are intimately tied to the flow mechanism, which for secondary oil migration islikely to occur via <b>capillary</b> <b>creep.</b> An understanding of the distri-bution of threshold pressures within a sample volume will enable us to estimate the oil-rock contact volume during secondary oil migration, whether the volume considered is a core plug in size or an entire carrier sequence. Much work has been done on trying to derive gross estimates of petroleum loss during second-ary migration. The majority of these methods are {{based on the premise that}} the volume of petro...|$|E

These are growths of algae and mosses, mainly Bryum <b>capillary,</b> Eucladium verticillatum, <b>creeping</b> feather moss (Amblystegium serpens), Brachythecium rutabulum, Brachythecium velutinum, Fissidens taxifolius, and Leptobryum pyriforme. Bioluminescence is an undesirable phenomenon due to secondary damage to karst formations. Its occurrence is limited by specific management such as spraying of sodium hypochlorite and changing lighting techniques.|$|R
40|$|Granular {{materials}} are collections of discrete macroscopic particles. They exhibit rich and complex phenomena that cannot suitably be described by classical continuum models. Granular mechanics is {{the science of}} understanding, describing and predicting the mechanical behavior of granular materials. Granular dynamics deals with phenomena related to quick particle motions (mixing, segregation, flows etc.), while the quasi-static analysis of granular materials focuses on that range of behavior where the motions are slow and the particles can be assumed to be in equilibrium. Discrete element method (DEM) is an appropriate tool for granular mechanics problems. It is an approach that models the material {{as a collection of}} individual particles that interact only at inter-particle contact points. The fundamental behavior of granular soil can be reproduced by DEM analysis including <b>creep,</b> <b>capillary</b> phenomenon in unsaturated soil, collapse and shear strength of unsaturated soil, etc. This project will focus on the contact constitutive model, the preprocessing of the sample and the post-processing of and the simulation results. Computations of engineering problems are to be performed with DEM program. The student on this project is required to know the fundamentals of soil behavior. The knowledge on the discrete element method is preferred. Tasks 1. Study literatures on the discrete element method. 2. Study the use of the software (e. g. ANSYS, ABACUS) for contact finite element analysis under different loading. 3. Calculate several test problems related to the topics with the DEM. 4. Construct a practical problem and solve it with DEM. 5. Prepare a research report with computational results...|$|R

Additives serve a variety of purposes in polymer production from increasing stability during processing to improving the appearance of the final product. It is often necessary to include more than one additive to meet the processing and performance requirements of an application. The interactions of additives can be observed by measuring the properties of a material containing different combinations of additives. The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of certain lubricating additives, namely calcium stearate (CaSt?), zinc stearate (ZnSt?), and Viton, a fluoropolymer processing aid, on the melt rheological properties of high density polyethylene (HDPE) film resins. The rheological tests include dynamic mechanical analysis, <b>capillary</b> rheology, and <b>creep</b> recovery. Most of the experiments were run at 210 ?C to approximate processing conditions in the film-blowing die. The experiments were carried out on a series of samples made from the same base resin which contain calcium stearate, zinc stearate, and Viton in various combinations and concentrations. The dynamic oscillatory, creep recovery, and compounding data indicate that there are significant differences in the bulk rheological properties of samples that contain zinc stearate and samples that do not contain zinc stearate. Samples that contain zinc stearate have a lower zero shear viscosity, shorter relaxation time and narrower transition region than sample that do not contain zinc stearate. The reason for these differences has not yet been determined. Viton has a distinct effect on the shear behavior of the resin. Samples containing Viton had higher slip velocities than samples that did not contain Viton. The results suggest that the effectiveness of Viton was hindered only slightly by the presence of either stearate...|$|R
