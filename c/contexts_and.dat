5|$|However, in non-technical <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> in {{software}} for the World Wide Web, the term URL remains widely used. Additionally, the term web address (which has no formal definition) often occurs in non-technical publications as a synonym for a URI that uses the scheme http or https. Such assumptions can lead to confusion, for example {{in the case of}} XML namespaces, which have a visual similarity to resolvable URIs.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. While several {{techniques}} {{have been introduced}} for specifying <b>and</b> acquiring <b>context</b> <b>and</b> quality information associated with Web services, they consider such information representing the whole Web services. However, accessing to <b>context</b> <b>and</b> quality of data resources provided by Web services is crucial. This is particularly relevant for data-intensive Web services of which the <b>context</b> <b>and</b> quality of data resources will strongly impact on the service development and composition. In this paper we contribute an analysis of relationships among <b>context,</b> quality, <b>and</b> relevance, {{as well as their}} impact on the design and composition of Web services, in particular at the data resource level. Then, we propose several techniques to incorporate <b>context</b> <b>and</b> quality descriptions into REST APIs and RESTful services publishing. By implementing these features, RESTful Web services could allow the consumer to specify <b>and</b> query <b>context</b> <b>and</b> quality information associated with services and data resources, thus fostering the provision of high relevant data resources. ...|$|R

Third, relating meaningful <b>context</b> <b>and</b> accurate meaning which found four patterns of integrating <b>context</b> <b>and</b> accuracy of meaning, namely (a) full <b>context</b> <b>and</b> accurate meaning (F-A), (b) full context but innacurate meaning (F-NA), (c) incomplete context but accurate meaning (NF-A), <b>and</b> (d) incomplete <b>context</b> <b>and</b> inacurate meaning  (NF-NA). The ability to identify full context tends to help students to identify the meaning of words accurately. DOI: 10. 24865 /ajas. v 1 i 2. ...|$|R
5|$|The term {{is mostly}} used in {{historical}} <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> not in daily speech. In Danish, Skånelandene is used more often. The terms have no political implications as {{the region is}} not a geopolitical entity but a cultural region, without officially established political borders. In some circumstances, the term Skåneland, {{as opposed to the}} terms Skånelandskapen and Skånelandene, can also be used as a figure of speech for the province Scania.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of its}} history, astrology was {{considered}} a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic <b>contexts,</b> <b>and</b> was connected with other studies, such as astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. At {{the end of the}} 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as heliocentrism and Newtonian mechanics) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E

5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLexical {{learning}} {{is an essential}} component of college English learning. The traditional grammar-based learning model of vocabulary focuses on developing the linguistic competence rather than the pragmatic competence, which can not meet the need of college English learning in the new educational situation. The meaning of a word is generated in specific language environment and a single word is meaningless, so context plays {{a crucial role in the}} word meaning determination. Context roughly falls into linguistic <b>context</b> <b>and</b> non-linguistic <b>context,</b> with the former consisting of lexical <b>context,</b> verbal <b>context</b> <b>and</b> grammatical <b>context</b> <b>and</b> the latter of situational <b>context</b> <b>and</b> cultural <b>context.</b> In the process of college English learning, these five contexts are expected to be applied to differentiate polysemy, to eliminate ambiguities and to indicate referents...|$|R
