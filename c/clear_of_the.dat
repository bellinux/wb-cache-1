5|$|Most of them {{unscrewed}} at {{once and}} 530kilograms (1170lb) of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump 210kilograms of sand overboard to get the basket <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, {{at the mercy of the}} wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast for stability. Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E
5|$|The Auburn Tigers upset {{expectations}} and tied the Commodores 7–7. Ammie Sikes scored first for Vanderbilt. Auburn scored after a Sikes fumble. The ball was kicked some fifteen yards down field <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melee, {{picked up by}} Kirk Newell, and run 55 yards to the end zone.|$|E

5|$|The club's {{return to}} the First Division was not {{immediately}} successful. Under Leslie Knighton, the club never finished better than ninth, and in 1923–24 came close to returning to the Second Division, finishing 19th and only a point <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relegation zone. Arsenal did no better the following season, finishing 20th (although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time, being seven points <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relegation places), which {{was the last straw}} for Norris; he fired Knighton in May 1925, and appointed the Huddersfield Town manager, Herbert Chapman in his place.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was raised for Bermuda as Colin approached but was later discontinued as it weakened. Average winds of 31mph (50km/h) were observed across the island, although peak winds fell {{just shy of}} {{tropical storm}} intensity at 37mph (60km/h). L.F. Wade International Airport received 0.16in (4.06mm) of rainfall. Although Colin steered well <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carolinas, swells from the storm prompted at least 205 water rescues, and a rip current off Ocracoke led to the drowning of one man.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Häkkinen moved up to second place in the Drivers' Championship, {{reducing}} Michael Schumacher's lead to fourteen points. Coulthard fell to third, two points behind Häkkinen. Barrichello moved up into fourth place on 13 points, and Ralf Schumacher fell to fifth overall. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari maintained their lead but McLaren's one-two finish moved to within seven points <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian team. Williams maintained third position with nine points. Frentzen's sixth-place finish allowed Jordan to move point clear of Benetton in the battle for fourth, with twelve races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|Development was {{initially}} slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air, and the depression became Tropical Storm Patricia later that day. Once <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unfavorable region, Patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification. Dramatic strengthening began late on October21 and continued through October23. Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia {{to have reached}} Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the championship win, the 1937–38 season was one of disappointment. Manchester City achieved several high scoring wins, including two 7–1 scorelines, but frequently stuttered to defeat. On {{the final day of}} the season the club faced Huddersfield Town, and went into the match four places <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relegation zone. A 1–0 defeat, coupled with wins for all four of the teams immediately below meant reigning champions City were relegated to the Second Division despite scoring more goals than any other team.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the fleet's approach to Quebec, James Cook surveyed {{a large portion of}} the river, including a dangerous channel known as The Traverse. Cook's ship was one of the first ships up the river, sounding the channel and guiding the fleet as it moved up, eventually landing Wolfe and his men on the Île d'Orléans on 28 June. The French attempted to attack the fleet by sending seven fire ships downriver to disrupt the landing, but the ships fired too early and British sailors in longboats were able to pull the flaming craft <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League games left {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, {{and the arrival of}} wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower to steer <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.|$|E
