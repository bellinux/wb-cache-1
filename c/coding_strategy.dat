50|$|Arenaviruses have a {{segmented}} RNA genome {{that consists}} of two single-stranded ambisense RNAs. As with all negative-sense RNA viruses, the genomic RNA alone is not infectious and the viral replication machinery is required to initiate infection within a host cell. Genomic sense RNA packaged into the arenavirus virion is designated negative-sense RNA, and must first be copied into a positive-sense mRNA {{in order to produce}} viral protein. The two RNA segments are denoted Small (S) and Large (L), and code for four viral proteins in a unique ambisense <b>coding</b> <b>strategy.</b> Each RNA segment codes for two viral proteins in opposite orientation such that the negative-sense RNA genome serves as the template for transcription of a single mRNA and the positive-sense copy of the RNA genome templates a second mRNA. The separate coding sequences of the two viral proteins are divided by an intergenic region RNA sequence that is predicted to fold into a stable hairpin structure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the theory}} of quantum communication, the entanglement-assisted {{classical}} capacity of a quantum channel is the highest rate at which classical information can be transmitted from a sender to receiver when they share an unlimited amount of noiseless entanglement. It is given by the quantum mutual information of the channel, which is the input-output quantum mutual information maximized over all pure bipartite quantum states with one system transmitted through the channel. This formula is the natural generalization of Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem, {{in the sense that}} this formula is equal to the capacity, and {{there is no need to}} regularize it. An additional feature that it shares with Shannon's formula is that a noiseless classical or quantum feedback channel cannot increase the entanglement-assisted classical capacity. The entanglement-assisted classical capacity theorem is proved in two parts: the direct coding theorem and the converse theorem. The direct coding theorem demonstrates that the quantum mutual information of the channel is an achievable rate, by a random <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> that is effectively a noisy version of the super-dense coding protocol. The converse theorem demonstrates that this rate is optimal by making use of the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy.|$|E
40|$|Providing video {{services}} to heterogeneous clients in wireless ad hoc networks is particularly challenging as (i) the heterogeneous client processing and display capabilities typically prevent clients from processing and displaying the same encoded video information, and (ii) wireless connections typically suffer from bandwidth variability and transmission errors. We jointly address these two challenges by introducing a novel video <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> which combines multiple description coding, in particular temporal descriptors, with layered spatial coding. Our spatial scalable descriptor <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> enables heterogeneous clients in wireless multi-hop networks with path diversity to receive preencoded video streams over independent paths and to process only {{that amount of}} encoded video information that suits their processing and display capabilities. We evaluate our <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> through simulation experiments with a highly dynamic video sequence.

However, these models neither account for various biophysical phenomena, such as neural stochasticity and refractoriness, nor for effects of electrical stimulation, such as spectral smearing as a function of stimulus intensity. In this paper, a neural model that accounts for stochastic firing, parasitic spread of excitation across neuron populations, and neuronal refractoriness, was developed and augmented as a preprocessing stage for a standard 22 -channel noise-band vocoder. This model was used to subjectively and objectively assess consonant discrimination in commercial and experimental <b>coding</b> <b>strategies.</b> Stimuli consisting of consonant-vowel (CV) and vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) tokens were processed by either the Advanced Combination Encoder (ACE) or the Excitability Controlled <b>Coding</b> (ECC) <b>strategies,</b> and later resynthesized to audio using the aforementioned vocoder model. Baseline performance was measured using unprocessed versions of the speech tokens.

40|$|Abstract—Whereas {{the theory}} and {{application}} of optimal network coding are well studied for the single-session multicast scenario, there is no known optimal network <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> for a more general connection problem where {{there are more than}} one session and receivers may demand different sets of information. Though {{there have been a number}} of recent studies that demonstrate various utilities of network coding in the multisession scenario, they rely on very restricted classes of codes in terms of the coding operations allowed and/or the location of decoding. In this paper, we propose a novel inter-session network <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> for a general connection problem. Our <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> allows fairly general random linear coding over a large finite field, in which decoding is done at receivers and the mixture of information at interior nodes is controlled by evolutionary mechanisms.

We present four achievable rate regions and a capacity outer bound for the MACFCS. For the first achievable region, we construct a decode-forward based <b>coding</b> <b>strategy.</b> The sources first exchange their data, and then cooperate to send full information to the destination. We term this strategy full decoding at sources with decode-forward (FDS-DF). For two of the other achievable regions, we first perform Slepian-Wolf coding to remove the correlation among the source data. This is followed by either (i) a compress-forward based <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> for the multiple-access channel with feedback, or (ii) an existing <b>coding</b> <b>strategy</b> for the multiple-access channel. We also find another achievable region using a multihop <b>coding</b> <b>strategy,</b> which only uses point-to-point coding (no cooperation). From numerical computations, we see that different strategies perform better under certain source correlation structures and network topologies. More specifically, FDS-DF approaches the capacity when (i) the inter-source distance decreases, or (ii) the correlation among the sources gets higher. Furthermore, the cooperative coding strategies considered support larger achievable rate regions than the noncooperative multihop strategy...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} <b>coding</b> <b>strategies</b> of computational imaging {{to overcome the}} limitation of conventional sensing techniques. The information capacity of conventional sensing {{is limited by the}} physical properties of optics, such as aperture size, detector pixels, quantum efficiency, and sampling rate. These parameters determine the spatial, depth, spectral, temporal, and polarization sensitivity of each imager. To increase sensitivity in any dimension can significantly compromise the others. This research implements various <b>coding</b> <b>strategies</b> subject to optical multidimensional imaging and acoustic sensing in order to extend their sensing abilities. The proposed <b>coding</b> <b>strategies</b> combine hardware modification and signal processing to exploiting bandwidth and sensitivity from conventional sensors. We discuss the hardware architecture, compression strategies, sensing process modeling, and reconstruction algorithm of each sensing system. Optical multidimensional imaging measures three or more dimensional information of the optical signal. Traditional multidimensional imagers acquire extra dimensional information at the cost of degrading temporal or spatial resolution. Compressive multidimensional imaging multiplexes the transverse spatial, spectral, temporal, and polarization information on a two-dimensional (2 D) detector. The corresponding spectral, temporal and polarization <b>coding</b> <b>strategies</b> adapt optics, electronic devices, and designed modulation techniques for multiplex measurement. This computational imaging technique provides multispectral, temporal super-resolution, and polarization imaging abilities with minimal loss in spatial resolution and noise level while maintaining or gaining higher temporal resolution. The experimental results prove that the appropriate <b>coding</b> <b>strategies</b> may improve hundreds times more sensing capacity. Human auditory system has the astonishing ability in localizing, tracking, and filtering the selected sound sources or information from a noisy environment. Using engineering efforts to accomplish the same task usually requires multiple detectors, advanced computational algorithms, or artificial intelligence systems. Compressive acoustic sensing incorporates acoustic metamaterials in compressive sensing theory to emulate the abilities of sound localization and selective attention. This research investigates and optimizes the sensing capacity and the spatial sensitivity of the acoustic sensor. The well-modeled acoustic sensor allows localizing multiple speakers in both stationary and dynamic auditory scene; and distinguishing mixed conversations from independent sources with high audio recognition rate.
