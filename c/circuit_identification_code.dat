50|$|The <b>Circuit</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Code</b> is used {{to specify}} which trunk between two {{switches}} {{is used to}} carry a particular call. Note that some versions of ANSI ISUP permit a CIC with 14 significant bits instead of the 12 that are shown.|$|E
50|$|When sent {{using the}} {{services}} of the Signalling Connection Control Part, ISUP messages passed to SCCP in the User Data parameter (NSDU) consist of only the last 4 components (Message Type, Mandatory fixed part, Mandatory variable part, Optional part). The routing label and <b>circuit</b> <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> {{are not included in}} the user data passed to SCCP.|$|E
40|$|A {{dedicated}} low-power CMOS transponder microchip {{is presented}} {{as part of a}} novel telemetry implant for biomedical applications. This mixed analog-digital <b>circuit</b> contains an <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> and collects information on physiological parameters, i. e., body temperature and physical activity, and on the status of the battery. To minimize the amount of data to be transmitted, a dedicated signal processing algorithm is embedded within its circuitry. All telemetry functions (encoding, modulation, generation of the carrier) are implemented on the integrated circuit. Emphasis is on a high degree of flexibility towards sensor inputs and internal data management, extreme miniaturization, and low-power consumption to allow a long implantation lifetime. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|An ISUP message {{contains}} a fixed header containing the <b>circuit</b> <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> and the ISUP message type, {{followed by a}} mandatory fixed-length parameter part, a mandatory variable-length parameter part, and an optional parameter part that are dependent {{on the type of}} message being sent. ISUP messages can be sent using the services of the Message Transfer Part, or, less often, the Signalling Connection Control Part. These messages are transmitted in various stages of call setup and release. The most common messages are: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{telephone}} exchanges may be connected via E1 or T1 trunks which transport the speech from the calls. These trunks {{are divided into}} 64 kbit/s timeslots, and one timeslot can carry exactly one call. Regardless of what facilities are used to interconnect switches, each circuit between two switches is uniquely identified by a <b>circuit</b> <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> (CIC) that {{is included in the}} ISUP messages. The exchange uses this information along with the received signaling information (especially the called party number) to determine which inbound and outbound circuits should be connected together to provide an end to end speech path.|$|E
5000|$|BICC {{signaling}} {{messages are}} {{nearly identical to}} those in ISDN User Part (ISUP); the main difference being that the narrowband <b>circuit</b> <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> (CIC) has been modified. The BICC architecture consists of interconnected serving nodes that provide the call service function and the bearer control function. The call service function uses BICC signaling for call setup and may also interwork with ISUP. The bearer control function receives directives from the call service function via BICC Bearer Control Protocol (ITU-T recommendation Q.1950) and is responsible for setup and teardown of bearer paths {{on a set of}} physical transport links. Transport links are most commonly Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Internet Protocol (IP).|$|E

[...] These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions {{in the process of}} shipping containers throughout the distribution channel. [...] Each has an essential function: <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of <b>identification</b> <b>codes</b> and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{ordinary}} <b>identification</b> <b>coding,</b> a code is devised to identify a single object among $N$ objects. But, in this paper, we consider an <b>identification</b> <b>coding</b> problem to identify $K$ objects at once among $N$ objects in the both cases that $K$ objects are ranked or not ranked. By combining Kurosawa-Yoshida scheme with Moulin-Koetter scheme, an efficient <b>identification</b> <b>coding</b> scheme is proposed, which can attain high coding rate and error exponents compared with the case that an ordinary <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> is used $K$ times. Furthermore, the achievable triplet of rate and error exponents of type I and type II decoding error probabilities are derived for the proposed coding scheme.
