5|$|Boyars <b>could</b> <b>no</b> {{longer be}} {{executed}} without {{the knowledge and}} approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said {{in a conversation with}} the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
5|$|By 1801, Priestley {{had become}} so ill that he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer write or experiment. He died {{on the morning of}} 6 February 1804, aged seventy and was buried at Riverview Cemetery in Northumberland, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|In 662, Maximus {{was placed}} on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the {{fortress}} of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri. He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius Bibliothecarius.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} stage, Trousselier won, and because Aucouturier {{finished}} in twelfth place, Trousselier {{had a big}} lead in the general classification. After the fifth stage, Aucouturier <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer challenge Trousselier for the lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tumultuous}} 2008 Democratic Party presidential {{nomination}} campaign, he first endorsed U.S.Senator Hillary Clinton {{and then later}} switched to Senator Barack Obama after concluding Clinton <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer win.|$|E

60|$|But when he {{says that}} Christ ascended far above all heavens, we are to believe this--that he ascended to God himself. So high that he <b>could</b> go <b>no</b> higher; so far that he <b>could</b> go <b>no</b> farther.|$|R

5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} war <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer be won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|After {{the change}} in organisation, Chetham's <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer afford to provide {{education}} based on scholarships and other allowances, and began charging fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, opening in 1955. By 1960 the numbers of boys admitted had increased significantly, particularly among day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.|$|E
5|$|But {{after his}} father enlisted during the Second World War, his mother <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer run the farm and raise the {{children}} by herself, so the family returned to Katanning and stayed there for seven years.

60|$|It was {{a natural}} {{question}} to put. It {{was not an easy}} question to answer.

50|$|Patients obtain permits {{through the}} Oregon Department of Human Services and in 1998 <b>could</b> {{cultivate}} <b>no</b> {{more than seven}} marijuana plants, of which {{no more than three}} could be mature.

5|$|By 1893, the NYLE {{had gone}} {{bankrupt}} and was {{merged with the}} Erie Railroad, which became {{the owner of the}} bridge. By the start of the 20thcentury, locomotives were almost 85percent heavier, and the iron bridge <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer safely carry trains. The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14, 1900, and removal of the old iron began on May 24.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt's rabbi made {{an appeal}} in The Oregonian for forgiveness. Although Goldschmidt <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer {{be prosecuted for}} the offense, the Oregon State Bar began an {{investigation}} into the matter. Goldschmidt submitted a Form B resignation, which was received by the bar on May 13, where he says that he is aware {{that he would not be}} eligible for readmission.|$|E
5|$|Himmler began {{developing}} {{the notion of}} a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer be a member, but came to consider the church's political power and influence a danger to the state.|$|E

60|$|Donald <b>could</b> say <b>no</b> more. The best of men or boys <b>could</b> do <b>no</b> {{more than}} try. We {{may as well}} say here at once, however, that his efforts at {{self-control}} were crowned with success. He proved {{himself to be a}} great man in embryo by ruling his own spirit that day.|$|R
5|$|In 1768 {{the family}} finally took up {{residence}} in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time Cassandra <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as they <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, at {{the request}} of the New Zealand Parliament, King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion within the British Empire, {{reflecting}} its self-governing status.

5|$|In June 1874, Clayton {{announced}} that he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer control matters in Arkansas and {{that he and his}} friends would be willing to enter into any arrangement whereby they could at least be safe from persecution and prosecution. However, the Democrats retaliated by impeaching many Minstrels, including Supreme Court Justice John McClure. Clayton finished his Senate term but was not re-elected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} 1776, a number of events led to a drastic change in the diet of the American colonists.
