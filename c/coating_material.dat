25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{the mirror}} coating can be measured using a reflectometer and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some optical work to make cold mirrors and hot mirrors. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a <b>coating</b> <b>material</b> that is more reflective to visible light and more transmissive to infrared light.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{possible}} drawbacks of SIR technology, such as leaching of the extractant or clogging of a fixed bed by attrition of the particles. These might be remedied by choosing the proper particle-extractant-system. This implies selecting a suitable extractant with low water solubility, which is sufficiently retained inside the pores, and selecting mechanically stable particles as a solid {{support for the}} extractant. Additionally, SIRs can be stabilized by coating them, as shown by D. Muraviev et al. As <b>coating</b> <b>material,</b> A. W. Trochimczuk et al. used polyvinyl alcohol.|$|E
25|$|There is {{potential}} of nanocellulose {{applications in the}} area of paper and paperboard manufacture. Nanocelluloses are expected to enhance the fiber-fiber bond strength and, hence, have a strong reinforcement effect on paper materials. Nanocellulose may be useful as a barrier in grease-proof type of papers and as a wet-end additive to enhance retention, dry and wet strength in commodity type of paper and board products. It has been shown that applying CNF as a <b>coating</b> <b>material</b> on the surface of paper and paperboard improves the barrier properties, especially air resistance. It also enhances the structure properties of paperboards (smoother surface).|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, the Tennessee Valley Authority National Fertilizer Development Center began {{developing}} sulfur-coated urea; sulfur {{was used}} as the principal <b>coating</b> <b>material</b> because of its low cost and its value as a secondary nutrient. Usually there is another wax or polymer which seals the sulfur; the slow-release properties depend on the degradation of the secondary sealant by soil microbes as well as mechanical imperfections (cracks, etc.) in the sulfur. They typically provide 6 to 16 weeks of delayed release in turf applications. When a hard polymer is used as the secondary coating, the properties are a cross between diffusion-controlled particles and traditional sulfur-coated.|$|E
25|$|Biocompatibility, i.e., {{the ability}} to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is {{definitely}} a critical issue for biomaterials. The biocompatibility of silk arose during its increasing clinical use. Indeed, wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid fraying and potential immune responses when silk fibers serve as suture materials. Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as {{the extent of the}} removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of <b>coating</b> <b>material,</b> and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based biomaterials. In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro when assessed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo. Thus, appropriate degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs. There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the biocompatibility of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of immune responses and diseases have been triggered by the degraded products of silk fibroin.|$|E

30|$|The slow-release or controlled-release {{fertilizers}} {{have been}} developed over the past decades, which focused on exploring polymer-coated fertilizers. For example, Zhang et al. reported that coating fertilizers nutrients with polyethylene or epoxy resin tended to reduce the nutrient release rate (Lu et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2012). Tomaszewska et al. found that polysulfone coated fertilizers had excellent controlled release property (Tomaszewska and Jarosiewicz 2006; Tomaszewska et al. 2002). However, polymer-coated fertilizers have a disadvantage that large amounts of non-degradable <b>coating</b> <b>materials</b> are left in soil when the nutrients are exhausted. So, degradable polymers <b>coating</b> <b>materials,</b> including grapheme oxide (Zhang et al. 2014), starch (Zhong et al. 2013), polyhydroxybutyrate (Costa et al. 2013), chitosan (Hussain et al. 2012) were widely studied. Although these degradable polymers coated fertilizers may reduce environmental pollution, these nutrient release longevity of natural polymer <b>coating</b> <b>materials</b> as CRFs is short, which will not meet nitrogen supply requirement for field crops. Moreover, these natural polymer <b>coating</b> <b>materials</b> were very expensive, which increased the costs of production.

We {{compared}} physical properties and release-controlling efficiency of polymeric <b>coating</b> <b>materials</b> using matrix-type casted film and diffusion-controlled coated tablet. Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) with low or high viscosity grade, ethylcellulose (EC) and Eudragit® RS 100 as pH-independent polymers and Eudragit S 100 for enteric coatings were chosen to prepare the casted film and coated tablet. Tensile strength and contact angle of matrix-type casted film were invariably in the decreasing order: EC> Eudragit S 100 > HPMC 100000 > Eudragit RS 100 >HPMC 4000. There was a strong linear correlation between tensile strength and contact angle of the casted films. In contrast, weight loss (film solubility) of the matrix-type casted films in three release media (gastric, intestinal fluid and water) was invariably in the increasing order: EC[*] [*]HPMC 100000 [*]>[*]Eudragit RS 100 [*]>[*]HPMC 4000 [*]>[*]Eudragit S 100. Interestingly, diffusion-controlled coated tablet also followed this rank order except Eudragit S 100 although release profiles and lag time were highly dependent on the coating levels and type of polymeric <b>coating</b> <b>materials.</b> EC and Eudragit RS 100 produced sustained release while HPMC and Eudragit S 100 produced pulsed release.
