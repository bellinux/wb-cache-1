50|$|Galacto-oligosaccharides are {{selectively}} fermented by <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> All such bacteria produce gas at fermentation. The fermentation of galacto-oligosaccharides and isomaltooligosaccharides {{produces the}} least volume of gas {{when compared to}} other prebiotic oligosaccharides. They do not contribute to flatulence and gastrointestinal discomfort, when taken at the recommended dose. Even so, they are classed as FODMAPs and may be restricted on the low-FODMAP diet, along with fructose, fructans and alpha-linked galactose-containing oligosaccharides such as those found in various legumes and beans. Excessive intake can contribute to loss of specificity leading to fermentation by a number of other <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> that do produce more gas.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Orally {{ingested}} ginsenoside {{passes through}} the stomach and small intestine without decomposition by either gastric juice or liver enzymes into the large intestine, where ginsenoside is deglycosylated by <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> followed by transit to the circulation. <b>Colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> cleave the oligosaccharide connected to the aglycone stepwise from the terminal sugar to afford the major metabolites, 20 S-protopanaxadiol 20 -O [...] D-glucopyranoside (M 1) and 20 S-proto-panaxatriol (M 4). These metabolites are further esterified with fatty acids. The resultant fatty-acid conjugates are still active molecules that are sustained longer in the body than parental metabolites. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that ginsenoside is a prodrug that is activated in the body by intestinal bacterial deglycosylation and fatty acid esterification...|$|R

The successful delivery to the colon requires the exploration of a unique feature of the colonic environment: consideration of tran- sit times in the digestive tract (e. g. formulation of timed release systems, drug with a carrier, bioadhesive system and osmotic con- trolled drug delivery systems), pH (e. g. coating with pH sensitive polymers) and enzymes produced by <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> (covalent linkage, i. e., exploitation of carriers that are degraded speci?cally by <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria)</b> (Ashford and Fell, 1994; Basit, 2005; Asghar and Chandran, 2006).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these studies was to gain insight into the {{pathophysiology}} of pure osmotic diarrhea and the osmotic diarrhea caused by carbohydrate malabsorption. Diarrhea was induced in normal volunteers by ingestion of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is nonabsorbable, not metabolized by <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and carries no electrical charge. In PEG-induced diarrhea, (a) stool weight was directly correlated with the total mass of PEG ingested; (b) PEG contributed 40 - 60 % of the osmolality of the fecal fluid, the remainder being contributed by other solutes either of dietary, endogenous, or bacterial origin; and (c) fecal sodium, potassium, and chloride were avidly conserved by the intestine, in spite of stool water losses exceeding 1, 200 g/d. Diarrhea was also induced in normal subjects by ingestion of lactulose, a disaccharide that is not absorbed by the small intestine but is metabolized by <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In lactulose-induced diarrhea, (a) a maximum of approximate 80 g/d of lactulose was metabolized by <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> to noncarbohydrate moieties such as organic acids; (b) the organic acids were partially absorbed in the colon; (c) unabsorbed organic acids obligated the accumulation of inorganic cations (Na greater than Ca greater than K greater than Mg) in the diarrheal fluid; (d) diarrhea associated with low doses of lactulose was mainly due to unabsorbed organic acids and associated cations, whereas with larger doses of lactulose unmetabolized carbohydrates also played a major role; and (e) {{the net effect of}} bacterial metabolism of lactulose and partial absorption of organic acids on stool water output was done dependent. With low or moderate doses of lactulose, stool water losses were reduced by as much as 600 g/d (compared with equimolar osmotic loads of PEG); with large dose, the increment in osmotically active solutes within the lumen exceeded the increment of the ingested osmotic load, and the severity of diarrhea was augmented...|$|R

The stability of prednisolone, budesonide, beclometasone (17, 21) dipropionate (BDP) and its active metabolite, beclometasone- 17 -monopropionate (17 -BMP), were investigated at three different concentrations following incubation in a mixed faecal inoculum (simulated human colonic fluid) under anaerobic conditions. Prednisolone, at all three concentrations, was completely degraded within 3 h. The degradation of budesonide progressed at a slower rate, with complete degradation occurring within 7 h; the degradation of the S epimer of budesonide was faster than the R epimer. BDP degraded completely within 2 h while its active metabolite 17 -BMP was comparatively stable. In contrast to the results in the faecal inoculum, all molecules were stable in the simulated colonic fluid in the absence of human faeces (control).

Libraries of <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> were generated using aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic culture conditions, and bacterial pools and clonal isolates were evaluated for cross-reactive antigens by immunoblot analysis using the pANCA monoclonal antibody Fab 5 - 3.

40|$|Aims : To {{study the}} effects of amylomaize starch and {{modified}} (carboxymethylated and acetylated) amylomaize starches on the composition of <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and the production of volatile fatty acids, in mice. Methods and Results : Balb/c mice were fed with experimental diets containing various amount of amylomaize and modified amylomaize starches. Colonic bacterial populations and short-chain fatty acids were monitored. Results showed that the increases in indigenous bifidobacteria were detected in mice fed all starches tested; however, the highest numbers were observed in the group fed with 40 % unmodified amylomaize starch. The starch type influenced the populations of indigenous Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and coliforms. High Lactobacillus numbers were achieved in the colon of mice fed with high concentration of amylomaize starch. Acetylated amylomaize starch significantly reduced the population of coliforms. In addition, orally dosed amylomaize utilizing bifidobacteria reached their highest levels when fed together with amylomaize or carboxymethylated amylomaize starch and in both cases butyrate levels were markedly increased. Conclusions: These results indicate that different amylomaize starches could generate desirable variation in gut microflora and that particular starches may be used to selectively modify gut function. Significance and Impact of Study: Amylomaize starch appeared to enhance the desirable composition of <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> in mice, and suggested it possessed the potential prebiotic properties.

40|$|The {{definitive}} version may {{be found}} at www. wiley. comBACKGROUND: Factors initiating human ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown. Dysbiosis of bacteria has been hypothesized to initiate UC but, to date, neither {{the nature of the}} dysbiosis nor mucosal breakdown has been explained. AIM: To assess whether a dysbiosis of anaerobic nitrate respiration could explain the microscopic, biochemical and functional changes observed in colonocytes of UC. METHODS: Published results in the gastroenterological, biochemical and microbiological literature were reviewed concerning colonocytes, nitrate respiration and nitric oxide in the colon in health and UC. A best-fit explanation of results was made regarding the pathogenesis and new treatments of UC. RESULTS: Anaerobic nitrate respiration yields nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide. <b>Colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> produce NO and UC in remission has a higher lumenal NO level than control cases. NO with sulphide, but not NO alone, impairs beta-oxidation, lipid and protein synthesis explaining the membrane, tight junctional and ion channel changes observed in colonocytes of UC. The observations complement therapeutic mechanisms of those probiotics, prebiotics and antibiotics useful in treating UC. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged production of bacterial NO with sulphide can explain the initiation and barrier breakdown, which is central to the pathogenesis of UC. Therapies to alter bacterial nitrate respiration and NO production need to evolve. The production of NO by <b>colonic</b> <b>bacteria</b> and that of the mucosa need to be separated to pinpoint the sequential nature of NO damage in UC. W. E. W. Roedige...|$|R
