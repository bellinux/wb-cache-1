25|$|Alpine Renault {{continued}} {{to develop their}} range of models all through the 1980s. The A310 was the next modern interpretation of the A110. The Alpine A310 was a sports car with a rear-mounted engine and was initially powered by a four-cylinder 1.6 L sourced Renault 17 TS/Gordini engine. In 1976 the A310 was restyled by Robert Opron and fitted with the more powerful and newly developed V6 PRV engine. The 2.6 L motor was modified by Alpine with a four-speed manual gearbox. Later they would use a Five-speed manual gearbox and with the group 4 model get a higher tune with more <b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> and 3 twin barrel Weber carburetors.|$|E
2500|$|Of more {{interest}} was {{the introduction of}} the High Capacity Pick Up to the [...] chassis.

The HCPU came with heavy-duty suspension and was popular with public utility companies and building contractors.|$|E
40|$|The reports {{regarding}} {{the global warming}} warn on the urgent need to reduce pollutant emissions and in particular greenhouse emissions. The performed analysis shows that cars equipped with engines operating on petrol, lead to {{a lower level of}} pollution, {{from the point of view}} of CO (carbon monoxide) and VOCs (volatile organic compounds) emissions at speeds above 50 km/ h. Since driving in urban traffic mode involves driving with a speed up to 50 km/h, it was comparatively analyzed the automobile engines operation with different <b>cubic</b> <b>capacities.</b> In conclusion, in terms of the analyzed emissions in accordance with the emission standards requirements for urban driving situations, it results that the accepted values of these emissions are recorded for automobile engines of low <b>cubic</b> <b>capacities</b> (under 1. 4 l) ...|$|R
50|$|The Family II is a straight-4 {{piston engine}} that was {{originally}} developed by Opel in the 1970s, debuting in 1979. Available {{in a wide}} range of <b>cubic</b> <b>capacities</b> ranging from 1598 to 2405cc, it simultaneously replaced the Opel OHV, Opel CIH and Vauxhall Slant-4 engines, and was GM Europe's core powerplant design for much of the 1980s.|$|R

2500|$|While Scott's {{production}} {{machines were}} marketed {{as a kind}} of luxury [...] "wheeled horse" [...] for the Edwardian Gentleman, there was valuable publicity to be had in competition success and the early Scott motorcycles were so powerful that they often easily beat four-stroke motorcycles of the same capacity. After Scott's victory at the 1908 Wass Bank hillclimb, the Auto-Cycle Union handicapped their motorcycles by multiplying their <b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> by 1.32 for competitive purposes, which resulted in good, free advertising for Scott. The handicap was lifted three years later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regulations}} {{required a}} vessel of 10,000 tons {{or more to}} carry 16 lifeboats with a total capacity of , sufficient for 960 people. Titanic actually carried four more lifeboats than she needed under the regulations. Her total lifeboat capacity was , which was theoretically capable of taking 1,178 people. The regulations required that lifeboats should measure between [...] with a minimum capacity of [...] each. The <b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> divided by ten indicated the approximate {{number of people that}} could be carried safely in each boat and also dictated the size of the airtight buoyancy tanks incorporated into the boats' hulls, with each person corresponding to [...] of tank capacity.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{the close}} {{tolerances}} between parts, the engine's lack of gaskets {{was made possible by}} a unique crankcase ventilation system. On any 2-cylinder boxer engine such as the 2CV's, the volume of the crankcase reduces by the <b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> of the engine when the pistons move together. This, combined with the inevitable small amount of [...] "leakage" [...] of combustion gases past the pistons leads to a positive pressure in the crankcase which must be removed in the interests of engine efficiency and to prevent oil and gas leaks. The 2CV's engine has a combined engine [...] "breather" [...] and oil filler assembly which contains a series of rubber reed valves. These allow positive pressure to escape the crankcase (to the engine air intake to be recirculated) but close when the pressure in the crankcase drops as the pistons move apart. Because gases are expelled but not admitted this creates a slight vacuum in the crankcase so that any weak joint or failed seal causes air to be sucked in rather than allowing oil to leak out.|$|E

All {{versions}} of this engine fitted to the 105 series coupés featured twin carburettors, except for US market 1750 GTV and 2000 GTV cars which were fitted with fuel injection. Competition models featured cylinder heads with twin spark plugs. Common to all models was also a 5-speed manual transmission and disc brakes on all four wheels. The rear suspension uses a beam axle with coil springs. Air conditioning and a limited slip rear differential were optional on the later models.|$|R
