In order to minimize the emissions, {{it is necessary to}} design the diesel engine with better in-cylinder flow (air-fuel mixing) and combustion process. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation helps to understand the Diesel engine temperature distribution and NOx species concentrations with respect to time. A small direct injection (DI) engine was chosen for the study. CFD simulation results were compared with that of engine emission tests. Results were found to be in agreement with NOx emissions.

The characterization of charcoal was done according to the following parameters, moisture, apparent density, grain density, volatile materials content, ash content, fixed carbon content and calorific value. The proofed charcoal presented standard indicators for use in barbecue and was noticed the relationship between granulometric analysis and the ICOMcv. The 16 mm grain size charcoal sample showed the best results for combustion. By contrast, the largest grain size sample presented lower results compared to the other samples.

Spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> and intrinsic properties of coals and coal-shales varies between (above and below) coal seams. The spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> (obtained from the Wits-Ehac Index) and intrinsic properties (obtained from proximate, ultimate, and petrographic analysis) of fourteen samples representative of in situ coal (bituminous) and fourteen coal-shales obtained in Witbank coalfield, South Africa were experimentally studied. Comparative {{analysis of the}} relationships between the spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> and intrinsic properties of coals and coal-shales were established to evaluate their effects on self-heating potential. The intrinsic properties show linear relationship with spontaneous combustion liability and therefore, identifies the factors affecting spontaneous combustion of these materials. The influence of coal-shales intrinsic properties towards spontaneous combustion liability shows higher correlation coefficients than the coals. Both coals and coal-shales show inertinite maceral as major constituents than the vitrinite and liptinite macerals, hence the reactivity of inertinite macerals may show greater influence on spontaneous combustion liability.

30|$|There is a {{positive}} relationship between the hydrogen content and spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> for both the coals and coal-shales. This means that as the hydrogen content increases, the oxidation capacity of coals and coal-shales is more likely to increase in general.

The R-squared value for the hydrogen content is 0.5703 for coals and 0.7742 for coal-shales (Figs.  5 p and 6 p).

30|$|This {{study has}} evaluated, {{compared}} and identified {{the relationships between}} intrinsic properties and spontaneous combustion liability of coals and coal-shales. The influence of selected intrinsic properties towards spontaneous combustion liability indicated a better linear relationship for the coal-shales than the coals, thus {{they may have a}} greater effect to cause spontaneous combustion of coal-shales. The linear regression analysis shows that among the macerals, the inertinite macerals indicated a stronger linear relationship to spontaneous combustion liability. Thus, the spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> of coals and coal-shales may be influenced by the proportion of each maceral composition. A definite positive or negative correlation coefficient exists between the intrinsic factors and spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index.</b> This paper has established a comparative analysis between the dependence of spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> on intrinsic properties of selected coal-shales and associated coals. The results obtained from the petrographic and chemical analyses may be used as a tool to predict spontaneous combustion liability and may serve as of reference when comparing characteristics of coals and coal-shales from different coalfields.|$|R

The present model {{is based on}} the standard k-epsilon (two equations) with standard wall functions which is P 1 radiation model. In this process, a PDF (Probability Density Function) approach is created and this method needs solution to a high dimensional PDF transport equation. As the combustion of hydrogen fuel is injected from the wedge-shaped strut injector, it is successfully used to model the turbulent reacting flow field. It is observed from the present work that, the maximum temperature occurred in the recirculation areas which is produced due to shock wave-expansion and the fuel jet losses concentration and after passing successively through such areas, temperature decreased slightly along the axis. From the maximum mass fraction of OH, it is observed that there is very little amount of OH around 0. 0027 were found out after combustion.

40|$|In recent years, {{studies have}} {{examined}} the use of lignocellulosic wastes for energy generation. However, {{there is a lack of}} information on the combustibility of the residual biomass, especially the bark and charcoal of babassu nut. In this study, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to achieve the following objectives: to evaluate the combustion of the residual biomass from the babassu nut; to evaluate the combustion of charcoal produced from this biomass, considering different final carbonization temperatures; and to determine the effect of the final carbonization temperature on the thermal stability of charcoal and on its performance in combustion. Thermal analyses were performed in synthetic air. In order to evaluate the characteristics of charcoal combustion and fresh biomass, the ignition temperature (Ti), the burnout temperature (Tf), characteristic <b>combustion</b> <b>index</b> (S), ignition index (Di), time corresponding to the maximum combustion rate (tp), and ignition time (tig) were considered. The combustion of the babassu nutshell occurred in three phases and it was observed that this lignocellulosic material is suitable for the direct generation of heat. The increase in the final carbonization temperature caused an increase in the ignition temperature, as well as in the burnout temperature, the ignition time and the time corresponding to the maximum combustion rate. The results indicate that the increase in the carbonization temperature causes a decrease in combustion reactivity and, consequently, the charcoals produced at lower temperatures are easier to ignite and exhibit better performance in ignition.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} predictive {{models to}} determine spontaneous combustion liability of carbonaceous materials (coals and coal-shales) using statistical analysis. The intrinsic properties and spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> {{were determined by}} testing 14 coals and 14 coal-shales from Witbank coalfields, South Africa. The relationship between these intrinsic properties (obtained from proximate, ultimate and petrographic analysis) and spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>indices</b> (the Wits-Ehac Index and Wits-CT Index) were established. The influence of the intrinsic properties of coal-shales in relation to coal properties affecting spontaneous combustion has been established using a statistical method. The linear regression analysis indicates better linear relationships between some of the selected intrinsic properties and spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> and thus, identifies the major intrinsic factors affecting their liability toward spontaneous combustion. It was found that a definite positive or negative correlation coefficient exists between the intrinsic factors and spontaneous combustion liability. A set of models to predict the spontaneous combustion liability was derived. The best significant correlation along with the most appropriate model as indicated by R-squared values, the coefficient of correlations and standard error was used to predict the incident of spontaneous combustion.|$|R

Quite limited study has been so far reported on the comprehensive chemical properties like; proximate analysis (PA), ultimate analysis (UA), GCV variation and finally changes in combustion behavior of weathered coal and its probable effect on working utilities. Since combustion performance of coal depends on PA, UA, GCV parameters, {{it is essential to}} know such important characteristics parameters of weathered coal stored in stockpile before burning in boiler. Therefore, the objective of the investigation was to study the effect of weathering on various coal properties like; ash, volatile matter (VM), fixed carbon (FC), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), sulfur (S), GCV of coal. Further various combustion related parameters like; ignition temperature, peak temperature, burnout temperature, maximum <b>combustion</b> rate, ignition <b>index,</b> burnout <b>index,</b> <b>combustion</b> performance <b>index</b> and <b>combustion</b> rate intensity <b>index</b> have been analyzed to identify the changes in combustion behavior of coal in stockpile.

30|$|The {{criterion}} {{is established}} {{based on the}} strength and directions of a linear relationship between the intrinsic properties and spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> on a scatter plot. Statistically correlations of + 1 or − 1 are expected, however, this is not possible due {{to the use of}} real dataset from experimental tests, and real data are never perfect to get a perfect correlation coefficient (Deborah 2016). Since the results of the real data is expected to determine how close is close enough to indicate a strong, moderate or weak linear relationship, this necessitated the need to interpret the correlation coefficient values, classify and find how close they are using the set criterion (Table  1). Given that the correlation coefficient measures the degree to which how two variables vary together, establishing a criterion means whether each intrinsic property and spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>index</b> vary strongly, moderately or weakly and if it is a positive or negative relationship.

30|$|The {{statistical}} {{analysis showed that}} the spontaneous combustion liability of coals and coal-shales can be determined by a model consisting of various intrinsic factors. The predicted spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>indices</b> (Wits-Ehac and Wits-CT Index) have been validated with the actual Wits-Ehac Index and the Wits-CT Index {{and the results are}} in-line. The developed models enable one to identify the most important factors affecting spontaneous combustion and establishes relationships between them. The intrinsic properties of the samples have been identified to be the main factors contributing towards spontaneous combustion in coal mines. However, the study shows that no single factor is sufficient to influence the coal and coal-shale spontaneous combustion liability but a cumulative effect of favourable parameters may decide whether a coal or coal-shale will be liable to spontaneous combustion or not. The influence of the intrinsic properties of coal-shales in relation to coals could be a tool to predict spontaneous combustion risk in coal mines. The results provide quantitative descriptions and showed the relationships between the dependence of spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>indices</b> and intrinsic properties. The linear regression analysis shows that both liability indices indicate better linear relationships with some of the intrinsic factors and thus, identifies the major intrinsic factors affecting their liability towards spontaneous combustion. It was found each intrinsic property has an influence on spontaneous combustion liability and their strength varies from one another. Also, a definite positive or negative correlation coefficient exists between the intrinsic factors and the spontaneous combustion test results. The multiple regression of spontaneous <b>combustion</b> liability <b>indices</b> on 12 independent variables has developed acceptable and accurate predictive models as indicated by R-squared values, the coefficient of correlations and standard error of estimates. The models derived from the different samples produced high correlation coefficients and low standard error of estimates. The use of the formulas derived may provide reliable predictions for the spontaneous combustion liability of coals and coal-shales. The influence of the intrinsic properties affecting the spontaneous combustion of coals and coal-shales may be evaluated more effectively by these models than by the linear regression. The results obtained from this study may be used as a reliable tool to support previous works on the role of intrinsic properties on the spontaneous combustion of coals and coal-shales. It has been found that an accurate characterisation of the degree of oxidation could be a useful tool to measure the relative liability of carbonaceous materials toward spontaneous combustion.|$|R

Experimental studies shows that carbon and hydrogen content of coal decreases from 46.6 % to 28.6 % and from 3.3 % to 2.9 %, respectively during the 330  days of storage period of coal. Decrease in carbon and hydrogen percentage results in decrease in {{gross calorific value}} of coal from 4578 to 2751  kcal/kg, fixed carbon content from 35.6 % to 19.9 %, {{with an increase in}} ash percentage from 29.2 % to 46.6 %. Due to removal of hydrogen % and increase in ash %, ignition temperature of coal increased from 293 to 331  °C and activation energy from 22 to 54  kJ/mol. Increase in activation energy indicates deterioration in coal burning behavior with long duration of storage. Further, Tp and Tf also increased from 391 to 409  °C and 465 to 478  °C. This increase in burning temperatures are due to loss of carbonaceous material from stockpile coal during weathering. Detailed analysis of various <b>combustion</b> <b>indices</b> (Di, Df, Sf and Hf) shows that due to weathering, combustion of coal becomes difficult. Further, ultimate analysis results shows that sulfur content increased from 0.33 % to 1.08 % during storage. Rise in sulfur content contributes to spontaneous heating of stockpiled coal decreasing the combustion performance of the weathered coal, which results in operational difficulty in the boilers. Overall proximate, ultimate and gross calorific value results suggest that stockpiling of coal should be restricted to not more than a month whereas, sulfur content variation suggests that stockpiling can be done for a period of not more than six calendar months.|$|R

Textile sewage sludge was modeled on the basis of loadings of effluents, daily usage of dyeing material, heavy chemical for wastewater treatment and daily production of activated sludge. Combustion temperature was set in the range of 500 °C to 1100 °C. In this research the influence of coagulant species used in wastewater treatment on flue gas especially on sulfur oxide (SOx) generation was investigated. The replacement of conventional coagulant FeSO 4 and Al 2 (SO 4) 3 to FeCl 3 gave the result of more than 18 % reduction of SOx at the combustion temperature of 850 °C and 19 % at the temperature not less than 950 °C. The distribution ratio of sulfur element indicated that SOx especially in the form of SO 2 was generated at the combustion temperature of 700 °C and the concentration increased with a rise in <b>combustion</b> temperature. <b>Index</b> Terms—Textile sewage sludge, coagulant, sulfur oxid...|$|R
