40|$|A recent {{analysis}} of,on-site college evaluation {{reports from}} state evaluation teams shows that colleges {{have become more}} sophisticated in developing their own self-study reports and that the teams <b>conducting</b> <b>the</b> <b>reviews</b> have become more professional. Many positive qualitative and quantitative changes in the teacher training programs have been rendered {{as a result of}} the state program approval process. The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) offers an additional accreditation source. This accreditation differs from the state approval process in that it uses one set of standards for all secondary teacher preparation programs, and these programs are either approved or disapproved in aggregate. NCATE teams are quite small and do not contain a specialist for each program being evaluated. Recently NCATE has been reexamining its program approval process, and a proposal has been made to concentrat...|$|E
40|$|The Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) is {{a little-known}} but {{important}} {{activity of the}} World Trade Organization (WTO). Its purpose is to strengthen observance of WTO commitments and promote trade liberalization by providing all member countries with current and objective information about the trade policies and practices of each member individually and by establishing a forum within which members can question one another's policies and practices in a nonconfrontational manner. Since the TPRM was established in 1989 {{as one of the}} first fruits of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, some 80 trade policy reviews (TPRs) have been completed, covering nearly 60 countries. A review of the TPRM itself is therefore timely. In light of eight years of experience with the process, it is fair to ask whether the TPRM is meeting the goals set for it at its inception. Are the reviews sufficiently probing and analytical to provide information of real value? Do they cover all relevant aspects of members' trade? Are they unbiased and objective? Does the WTO devote sufficient resources to the task of <b>conducting</b> <b>the</b> <b>reviews</b> [...] and to disseminating the information that they generate? Is the potential value of this information to those outside the trade negotiations process being realized? This monograph seeks to answer these questions and others. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} a {{systematic}} review depends on the availability, accessibility and quality of literature related to the review question. This paper presents the literature found in four systematic reviews conducted for a selection of zoonotic hazards in four livestock value chains in Africa, as well as setting out the challenges in <b>conducting</b> <b>the</b> <b>reviews.</b> The protocol was designed following international standards, and addressed four questions around prevalence, risk factors, control options and impact of various hazards and populations. Searches were conducted in four online databases. Articles were screened for relevance, and quality was assessed before data extraction. Literature on zoonotic hazards was in general scarce and access to full articles was limited. Overall, 25 – 40 % of papers were considered poor quality. The diversity of approaches and designs in the studies compromised the ability to generate summarized estimates. We found that the emphasis of veterinary research has been on livestock problems rather than public health issues, although {{this seems to be}} shifting in the last decade; we also found there are limited studies on impact and control. While increasing literature is being published around zoonoses in Africa, this is still inadequate to appropriately inform policy and guide research efforts.

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{an exploration}} of quality reviews, focusing on the tension between central organisation and ownership at the periphery. At Monash, area reviews form {{a major component of}} the evaluation moment in the quality management system of planning, acting, evaluating and improving at the organizational level and throughout all levels of the university. All areas, including support services, faculties and research centres are subject to review. Similarly, at the University of Natal in South Africa, cyclical reviews are required for all areas of university activity. The models of implementation, are, however, very different. The Centre for Higher Education Quality (CHEQ) is responsible for leading and supporting driving quality within Monash University, but devolves the responsibility for organising and <b>conducting</b> <b>the</b> <b>reviews</b> resides with to the area concerned. On the other hand, the Quality Promotion Unit at the University of Natal has a comparatively greater role in running the reviews concerned. In both instances the Units are busy reflecting on their processes {{on the basis of their}} experiences and feedback from the areas concerned. In this paper we examine and compare the approaches so that the resulting lessons from these experiences will be of use to other universities undertaking reviews in support services and faculties. We focus particularly on the issue of how much involvement is optimal and what sort of support is needed for areas conducting reviews...|$|E

The primary focus of attention should be on the provisions that will be used to implement the licensee's responsibility relat-ing to proposed changes, tests, and experiments, and on the procedures for after-the-fact review, evaluation of unplanned events, such as Licensee Event Reports, and on the provisions for the evaluation of plant operations. No information is required in the PSAR. The FSAR should describe provisions for the plant operations review of operational. activities, for the independent review of plant operations and for the independent assessment of activities for safety enhancement. Specific information to be reviewed is as follows: 1. How the onsite organization functions with respect to review of proposed changes to systems or procedures, tests, and experiments, and of unplanned events that have operational safety significance.

40|$|Background The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) uses {{estimates}} {{of the effects of}} interventions on cause-specific child mortality as a basis for generating projections of child lives that could be saved by increasing coverage of effective interventions. Estimates of intervention effects are an essential element of LiST, and need to reflect the best available scientific evidence. This article describes the guidelines developed by the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) that are applied by scientists conducting reviews of intervention effects for use in LiST. Methods The guidelines build on and extend those developed by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Working Group for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). They reflect the experience gained by the CHERG intervention review groups in <b>conducting</b> <b>the</b> <b>reviews</b> published in this volume, {{and will continue to be}} refined through future reviews. Presentation of the guidelines Expected products and guidelines are described for six steps in the CHERG intervention review process: (i) defining the scope of the review; (ii) conducting the literature search; (iii) extracting information from individual studies; (iv) assessing and summarizing the evidence; (v) translating the evidence into {{estimates of}} intervention effects and (vi) presenting the results. Conclusions The CHERG intervention reviews represent an ambitious effort to summarize existing evidence and use it as the basis for supporting sound public health decision making through LiST. These efforts will continue, and a similar process is now under way to assess intervention effects for reducing maternal mortalit...|$|E
