40|$|This paper {{examines}} the objectification strategies used {{by members of}} the hospitality network CouchSurfing to perform complaints in peer references. Complaints on CouchSurfing pose a threat to the face of <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> as well as the complainee, since unfounded complaints may deduct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>complainant’s</b> trust capital on the network. In order to balance the need for honest references and the desire to protect their positive face, reference writers heavily invest in objectivity. This sets CouchSurfing apart from offline complaining contexts, which involve redress to the addressee’s face, and other CMC environments which exhibit little modification of complaint. In addition to traditional objectification strategies such as empiricist discourse, witness corroboration, graphic description and script formulations, our subjects draw on mitigation as a supportive move...|$|R

Following this, Mislia asked for two more loans from Chiang, which Shankar helped to arrange. In total, she signed three agreements to borrow a sum of $88,500, consisting of $45,000, $30,000 and $13,500 on three separate occasions. However, Mislia claimed she only received $40,000, consisting of $25,000, $10,000 and $5,000 {{on each of the}} occasions. Four years later, <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> lodged a complaint against Shankar with the Law Society of Singapore. Following an investigation, Shankar was tried by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society and convicted of three counts of grossly improper conduct contrary to section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act. The charges were based on allegations that Shankar had acted for both <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> and Chiang without advising <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> of <b>the</b> consequences of this conflict of interest, that he had not taken full instructions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>complainants,</b> that he had asked <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> to sign documents without properly explaining their effect, and that he had not ascertained whether the sums of money that Chiang paid to Mislia were in line with the loan agreements.|$|R
