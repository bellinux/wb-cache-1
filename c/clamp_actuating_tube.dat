40|$|Unimorph design {{consisting}} of a piezoceramic bonded to an elastic surface {{is the most common}} structure used to induce deformations. The analytic models developed by Park and Agrawal are extensively used to determine the induced strain on piezo-actuated surfaces. These models are based on different strain distribution hypothesis that, however, do not consider the relative thickness size between piezo and surface. Results using Park and Agrawal models are first compared with a finite element simulation, revealing how the piezo strain distribution considered by each model affects its prediction. Following, a simplified model suitable to be used in a preliminary design approach is proposed. This model allows an initial device dimensioning, also estimating the stresses involved.

The device is composed of two near identical doubly <b>clamped</b> and electrostatically <b>actuated</b> microbeams made of silicon. One of the resonators is buckled via thermal loading to produce a softening frequency response. It is then further tuned to create the desired overlap with the second resonator response of hardening behavior. This overlapping improves the pass band flatness. Also, the sudden jumps due to the softening and hardening behaviors create sharp roll-off characteristics. This approach can be promising for the future generation of filters with superior characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” Piezoelectric tubes with {{quartered}} external elec-trodes {{have been}} widely used as scanners in modern scanning probe microscopes. Various feedback control techniques have been developed to improve bandwidth and accuracy of these scanners. Non-contact displacement sensors, e. g. capacitive and inductive sensors, have been used for position feedback. How-ever, their measurements contain a significant noise component if operated over large bandwidths. As an alternative measure of displacement, the piezoelectric voltage induced in a tube nanopositioner has been proposed recently. This technique provides a much improved noise figure, up to three orders of magnitude better than capacitive sensors. In this arrangement, an electrode is used to <b>actuate</b> the <b>tube,</b> while the opposite electrode is used as a sensor. Operating the tube in this mode has two drawbacks: i) the operating range of the tube is reduced to half, and ii) the tube is driven asymmetrically, thus the opposite sides of the tube are no longer stressed antisymmetrically, i. e. the tube cannot be considered as a perfectly collocated system. In this paper, a new electrode pattern for piezoelectric tube scanners is presented.

40|$|Fixtures {{are used}} to fixate, {{position}} and support workpieces, and are critical elements in manufacturing processes. Machining {{is one of these}} manufacturing processes, and this is often done by computer numerical control (CNC) machines. A major trend observed in production industry is that manufacturing is increasingly done in small batches in combination with a quick changeover from one product to another, in combination with a surge in automation. Several novel fixture concepts have been developed that allow for a reconfiguration of the fixture layout, such that different types of workpieces can be fixtured using the same fixture components. However, the initial novel fixturing concepts lacked accuracy, and, in addition, required long set-up times. Recently, a new fixturing concept has been developed, the so-called intelligent fixturing system. Sensors and actuators are integrated in an intelligent fixturing system, which allows for an automatic and precise reconfiguration of the fixturing elements. Additionally, the actuated fixture elements can be used to exert optimal clamping forces to minimise the workpiece deflection during the machining process, this is called active fixturing. A literature survey has been carried out, in which it has been established that the main process variables to control in active fixturing, are the reaction forces at the contacts where the workpiece is fixated and supported by the fixture (the locating points), and/or the part or fixture displacements. Furthermore, four knowledge gaps were identified: (1) a lack of computationally efficient models of workpiece response during machining; (2) a lack of methodic structural analysis approach of part-fixture interaction; (3) a lack of model-based control design, which can potentially speed up the fixture design process; and (4) a lack of control design methodology for active fixturing systems. An active fixturing system can be divided into the following subsystems: the part, the part-fixture contact interface, passive fixture elements, the <b>actuated</b> <b>clamp,</b> sensors and the controller(s). In the thesis, a methodical research approach has been applied to address the knowledge gaps by analysing the active fixturing subsystems. In addition, a model-based control design methodology has been proposed. The research has aimed to establish mathematical models, or the necessary tools and methodology to build the subsystem models, and methods to connect the subsystem models into an overall model of the active fixturing system. On basis of the subsystem analyses, two simple, yet complete, active fixturing systems have been modelled. Parameter studies have been held to assess the performance of the control design. In addition, an industrial case study has been analysed, using the developed control design methodology. The study of the subsystems resulted in the comprehensive structural dynamic analysis of workpieces: a finite element model of the workpiece is built. Typically, finite element models contain too many degrees of freedom for real-time control applications. It was found that model reduction techniques can be used to reduce significantly the number of degrees of freedom. Methodologies for the selection of the degrees of freedom and for ensuring that the model reduction is accurate enough for practical use have been established. Mathematical models for hydraulically and electromechanically <b>actuated</b> <b>clamps</b> have been established. Compensators for closed-loop servo-control of the clamps have been investigated and control strategies to maintain workholding stability are found. Finally, a methodology to establish the overall model of an active fixturing system has been implemented. The control design methodology, and the mathematical tools established in the thesis have been verified against case studies of simple active fixturing systems. Furthermore, from the industrial case study it is concluded that the control design methodology can be successfully applied on complex fixturing systems. Additionally, a mathematical model for a piezoelectrically <b>actuated</b> <b>clamp</b> was derived, which also demonstrates the general applicability of the control design methodology derived here, as a new established actuator model is integrated in the control design. The overall conclusion, is hence that a good methodology for the model-based control design of active part-fixturing systems has been developed, which enables the engineer to speed up the design process of active fixturing systems.

MethodsThe LifeSite System (2 valves) was implanted in 23 patients with immediate dual-needle HD use. The cannulas were placed in either the jugular or the subclavian veins and were connected to the subcutaneous valves located in the upper chest area. ResultsThe mean duration of device survival for the LifeSite System was 6. 8 Â± 0. 97 months. During this period, the device achieved prescription HD blood flow rates averaging 384. 7 Â± 78. 5 mL/min with a venous pressure of 223. 2 Â± 60. 3 mm Hg.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a coupled numerical model built {{to simulate the}} operation of Coriolis flowmeters, which exploit the alteration of the vibration mode shape of the measuring tube for the mass flow rate measurement. The explained measuring effect {{is a consequence of}} the interaction between the motion of thetube, vibrating at its natural frequency, and the fluid flow in it. The numerical model is realized by coupling of a finite volume (FV) code for fluid flow analysis with a finite element (FE) code for structural analysis using the conventional staggered solution procedure, with added inner iterations to achieve strong coupling. The simulation algorithm is divided into two steps. A free vibration of the measuring tube considered in the firststep is complemented in the second step, after the numerical free vibration response is properly stabilized, with the harmonic excitation force <b>actuating</b> the measuring <b>tube</b> at its resonant frequency of several hundreds of Hertz to resemble the operation of actual Coriolis flowmeters. Different scenarios using zero-order or three-point fluid load predictor and soft application of the fluid load in the initial stages of the simulation are compared to yield a simulation strategy, which will minimize the time needed to obtain the stabilized steady-state response of the vibrating measuring tube. The proposed simulation procedure was applied on a straight-tube Coriolis flowmeter and used for the estimation of the velocity profile effect.

40|$|Ultra {{clean and}} freely {{suspended}} carbon nanotubes provide an ideal model system for electronical transport measurements, {{and for the}} investigation of the interplay with their mechanical vibration in the quantum limit. Within the scope of this thesis both the excelling electronical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes clamped between metal contacts have been investigated. At cryogenic temperatures a quantum dot is formed on the suspended part of the nanotube, where ground and excited state spectroscopy could be performed. Here one has access even to the very first excess electron on the quantum dot, where the magnetic field dependence of the excited states directly provides the single particle energy spectrum, including curvature induced spin-orbit coupling and KKâ€™ valley mixing. These coupling mechanisms lift the carbon nanotube specific fourfold degeneracy and induce a level splitting which gives rise to an unconventional Kondo effect in the intermediate coupling regime. Tracing these Kondo resonances in dependence on a parallel and perpendicular magnetic field reveal a hitherto unobserved many-body selection rule based on the discrete symmetries of the electronic carbon nanotube system. In addition, the transversal vibration mode of this doubly <b>clamped</b> nano-resonator is <b>actuated</b> and detected, and used to probe the dependence of the mechanical vibration on the quantum dot charging state and on an external magnetic field. Due to the high mechanical quality the electro-mechanic coupling in different transport regimes â€“ranging from the Fabry-PÃ©rot via the intermediate coupling to the Coulomb blockade dominated few electron regime- could be analyzed in high precision. Finally first superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators have been fabricated and characterized, which form the harmonic component for future circuit-quantum-electro-dynamics experiments with carbon nanotube structures.
