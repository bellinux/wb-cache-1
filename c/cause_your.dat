500|$|Kings {{and priests}} in the Old Testament were {{forbidden}} to partake of wine at various times. John the Baptist was a Nazarite from birth. Nazarite vows excluded not only wine, but also vinegar, grapes, and raisins. (Jesus evidently did not take such a vow during the three years of ministry depicted in the gospels, but in fact was even accused by the Pharisees of eating and drinking with sinners. St. Paul further instructs Christians regarding their duty toward immature Christians: [...] "It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or {{to do anything else}} that will <b>cause</b> <b>your</b> brother to fall." [...] Jewish priests cannot bless a congregation after consuming alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is {{about a woman who}} teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, {{throughout}} which she uses sexual references. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has [...] "sassy" [...] lyrics, but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that [...] "the track is actually kind of dirty". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only <b>cause</b> <b>your</b> lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is [...] "not-so-subtly" [...] instructing her lover within the lines [...] "It’s your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I'll stay".|$|E
500|$|... "Lift Off" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Before {{the song was}} released, MTV News' Alvin Blanco heard {{a preview of the}} song and described it as [...] "resounding... sounds like it was tailor-made to be performed in large stadiums." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "is rescued by Beyoncé, who whips the chorus with a belt so powerful you'd think it insulted her mother." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole also praised the song writing, [...] "'Lift Off' is a study in stylized blockbuster excess, with West's best fanfare since Encore eventually being drowned out by a simulated rocket launch that will sound awesome in your car stereo provided it doesn't <b>cause</b> <b>your</b> subwoofers to bust your windows." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin found a [...] "hook so ridiculous ('We gon take it to the moon / Take it to the stars!') that only Beyoncé could sell it." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of The Guardian praised the song calling it [...] "bombastic". Digital Spys Robert Copsey put [...] "Lift Off" [...] on his list of [...] "Tracks to download" [...] from the album. Evening Standards John Aizlewood called the song [...] "rocket-propelled". Rolling Stones Matthew Perpetua commented: [...] "Beyoncé joins the boys for a synth-heavy banger that takes off like a rocket and eventually arrives at a spacey, blissful resolution. It all but demands a sci-fi music video featuring Beyoncé as a sexy astronaut." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The emperor {{asked me}} what France would get in return for her {{military}} backing, and whether Your Majesty would hand over Savoy and Nice to France. [...] I replied that Your Majesty supported the principal of nationalism, which included recognition that Savoy, {{by virtue of being}} French speaking, should be united with France .... even though it would <b>cause</b> <b>your</b> majesty untold unhappiness to renounce a territory that was the cradle of his own family. [...] Regarding Nizza (Nice) the situation was different, since the inhabitants of Nice had far more in common with the Piedmontese than with the French, and their incorporation into France would accordingly be entirely contrary to those very principals of nationalism underpinning the military triumph anticipated against Austria." ...|$|E
