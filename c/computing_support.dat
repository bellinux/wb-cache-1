40|$|Abstract. Task-Oriented <b>Computing</b> <b>supports</b> the {{realization}} of user needs through the automatic composition of services from service descriptions and user tasks, i. e., high-level descriptions of the user needs. Service-Oriented <b>Computing</b> <b>supports</b> the description, publication, discovery and composition of services. Yet, automatic service composition processes commonly assume that service descriptions and user tasks share the same abstraction level, and that services have been pre-designed to integrate. To release these strong assumptions and to augment the possibilities of composition, we add adaptation features into the service composition process using semantic descriptions and adaptive extensions to graph planning. Our adaptive composition technique is fully automatic and has been implemented in a prototype tool...|$|R

3000|$|Sleuth [26] {{extends the}} ordered {{embedded}} pattern mining algorithm TreeMiner [27]. Unlike TreeFinder, Sleuth uses the equivalence class pattern expansion method to generate candidates. To avoid repeated invocation of tree inclusion checking, Sleuth maintains {{a list of}} embedded occurrences with each pattern. It defines also a quadratic join operation over pattern occurrence lists to <b>compute</b> <b>support</b> for candidates. The join operation becomes inefficient when the size of pattern occurrence lists is large.

50|$|With {{aircraft}} speeds increasing dramatically {{during the}} war, even {{the speed of}} the Kerrison Predictor proved lacking by the end. Nevertheless, the Predictor demonstrated that effective gunnery required some sort of reasonably powerful <b>computing</b> <b>support,</b> and in 1944 Bell Labs started delivery of a new system based around an analog computer. The timing proved excellent. Late in the summer the Germans started attacking London with the V-1 flying bomb, which flew at high speeds at low altitudes. After a month of limited success against them, every available anti-aircraft gun was moved to the strip of land on the approach to London, and the new sights proved to be more than capable against them. Daytime attacks were soon abandoned.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{observe that}} any finite-dimensional indecomposable module for a {{restricted}} Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field is a module for a finite-dimensional quotient {{of the universal}} enveloping algebra. These algebras form a two-parameter family which generalizes {{the notion of a}} reduced enveloping algebra. We identify each such algebra as a reduced enveloping algebra for an associated Lie algebra and use this to <b>compute</b> <b>support</b> varieties and obtain some representation-theoretic consequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. While CSCW {{research}} has mostly been focusing on desktop applications {{there is a}} growing interest on ubiquitous and tangible computing. We present ethnographic fieldwork and prototypes to address how tangible <b>computing</b> can <b>support</b> collaboration and learning. The student projects at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna is a relevant case to study, for the variety and distributed character of the cooperative arrangements, and for the richness of interactions with heterogeneous physical artefacts. After describing current practices, we propose qualities of the environment that support collaboration and learning: creative density, multiple travels in materials and representations, re-programming (seeing things differently), and configurability. We then describe several prototypes that address in various ways these qualities. Finally we discuss how tangible and ubiquitous <b>computing</b> <b>supports</b> collaboration in our case by providing intermediary spaces, and dynamic objectifications...|$|R
