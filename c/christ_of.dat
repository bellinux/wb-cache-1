5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was the Church of Christ, which was later named the Church of the Latter Day Saints. It was renamed the Church of Jesus <b>Christ</b> <b>of</b> Latter Day Saints in 1838 (stylized as the Church of Jesus <b>Christ</b> <b>of</b> Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom), which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844.

Membership in Young's denomination surpassed 14 million members in 2010. Smaller groups followed Sidney Rigdon and James J. Strang, who had based his claim on an allegedly-forged letter of appointment. Others followed Lyman Wight and Alpheus Cutler. Many members of these smaller groups, including most of Smith's family, eventually coalesced in 1860 under the leadership of Joseph Smith III and formed what was known {{for more than a century}} as the Reorganized Church of Jesus <b>Christ</b> <b>of</b> Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ), which now has about 250,000 members. , members of the denominations originating from Smith's teachings number approximately 15 million.|$|E
