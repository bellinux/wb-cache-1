40|$|In {{all areas}} of our life, consent plays {{a central role in}} {{determining}} the moral status of our actions. In the areas of healthcare and medical research, obtaining <b>valid</b> <b>consent</b> <b>from</b> the patient is of utmost importance. Traditionally, it is believed that the consent of the patient is valid if and only if the following three conditions are met: disclosure, capacity, and voluntariness. This dissertation focuses on the last requirement, voluntariness. Under what conditions is consent given voluntarily? At the very least, voluntariness requires freedom from certain kinds of manipulation or interference. I will explore two methods of manipulation that are purported to undermine voluntariness: coercion and undue inducement. Regarding coercion, I will argue that it never invalidates consent, and that this shows that voluntariness is not necessary for <b>valid</b> <b>consent.</b> Regarding undue inducement, I will argue that it does not, or is very unlikely to, invalidate consent, and that we should reject the standard solution proposed to prevent it...|$|R

Instead of making the question “When is the patient dead?” the central question to trigger organ retrieval, the proposal is to shift the focus to obtaining <b>valid</b> <b>consent</b> <b>from</b> patients or surrogates and the principle of nonmaleficence. As Truog explains the proposal: “On this view, policies could be changed such that organ procurement would be permitted only with the consent of the donor or appropriate surrogate and only when doing so would not harm the donor. Individuals who could not be harmed by the procedure would include those who are permanently and irreversibly unconscious (patients in a persistent vegetative state or newborns with anencephaly) and those who are imminently and irreversibly dying. Qualified individuals who had given their consent could simply have their organs removed under general anesthesia without first undergoing an orchestrated withdrawal of life support. Anencephalic newborns whose parents requested organ donation could likewise have the organs removed under general anesthesia without the need to wait for the diagnosis of brain death.” ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Informed, voluntary, and <b>valid</b> <b>consent</b> <b>from</b> {{biomaterial}} donors is a precondi-tion for biobank research. <b>Valid</b> <b>consent</b> protects donors’ {{rights and}} helps maintain public trust in biobank research. Harmonisation of consent procedures in biobank research is needed, {{because of the}} widely shared vision on national and international networking of biobanks in-cluding data and sample sharing. So far, no study has assessed and compared the content of current consent forms for biobank research. The objective {{of this study was}} to perform a con-tent analysis of consent forms in German biobanks. Methods: Based on 10 guidelines for biomedical research, we developed an assessment ma-trix with 41 content issues that are potentially relevant for consent forms in biobank research. This assessment matrix was applied in a thematic text analysis to 30 consent documents of German biobanks identified via the German Biobank Registry in July 2012. Results: Coverage of the 41 items in the assessed consent forms varied widely. For example, the items Right to withdraw consent (without disadvantage), Policy for genetic infor-mation / consent to genetic analyses and International cooperation / transborder use were addressed in 97 %, 40 % and 23 % of all 30 consent forms respectively. The number of items covered by a single consent form ranged from 9 to 36 (22 % to 88 % out of 41 items). Discussion: Our findings serve as a starting point to reflect upon the spectrum of consent is-sues that must be addressed in biobank research. The findings show that the majority of con-sent forms for German biobanks, if not all, should be improved and harmonised to better sup-port an informed and balanced choice of potential donors and to facilitate networking of bi-obanks. Best practice models for consent forms in biobank research should be developed and biobank operators need to be more aware of relevant consent issues...|$|R

40|$|Most {{regulations}} and guidelines require that potential research participants be told {{a great deal}} of information during the consent process. Many of these documents, and most of the scholars who consider the consent process, assume that all this information must be disclosed because it must all be understood. However, a wide range of studies surveying apparently competent participants in clinical trials around the world show that many do not understand key aspects of what they have been told. The standard view of the conditions for <b>valid</b> <b>consent</b> therefore implies that these people have failed to give <b>valid</b> <b>consent</b> to research participation. In this paper we argue that the standard view is false. The primary function of the requirement that researchers disclose information about a study is the avoidance of illegitimate control over someone’s consent decision, which is a form of fraud. We derive the content and manner of appropriate disclosure by analysing the ways in which the manipulation of information can invalidate consent. Our analysis shows that the informational requirements for <b>valid</b> <b>consent</b> are conceptually distinct and thus unlikely to have identical contents. This implies that <b>consent</b> can be <b>valid</b> when not everything that ought to be disclosed by the person asking for consent is understood by the person who proffers i...|$|R
