40|$|The Treaty of Waitangi {{settlement}} process {{occupies a}} significant role in New Zealand. Though it aims to start the healing of historical grievances, the process has often created and deepened grievances because of its inability to respond to the dynamic relationships that exist between Māori. Over the course of several settlements, the Crown has demonstrated poor understandings of tikanga, the relationships between iwi and its own role in creating disputes and grievances, deepening the very wounds it wishes to heal. This paper reconceptualises the Crown’s obligations in order to respond to these concerns, focusing on the challenges presented where multiple iwi have interests in the same area of land (<b>cross-claims).</b> It argues that the Crown must act as an honest broker and facilitate the resolution of <b>cross-claims.</b> This requires the Crown to actively and meaningfully engage with iwi in order to understand their perspectives and grievances, and reflexively adapt settlement processes in order to better reflect those perspectives and grievances...|$|R

Finally, a <b>cross-claim</b> {{is the same as}} a counter-claim or contribution claim, except that it is asserted by a defendant against other defendants.

50|$|A {{defendant}} {{may also}} file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a <b>cross-claim</b> against a co-defendant, {{at any point}} before the trial begins, {{so long as the}} amount is within the jurisdictional limits of the GDC. Failure to file a counterclaim, however, does not effect a waiver of that counterclaim. A defendant may implead a third party anytime within ten days after service of process has been effected, up until the trial date, so long as the third party receives effective service of process. However, Virginia law prohibits a defendant from impleading a joint tortfeasor against whom the plaintiff is prohibited from recovering (such as plaintiff's employer in a negligent injury case, which would be covered by the state's workman's compensation). Virginia law does not recognize the doctrine of necessary and indispensable parties, so the inability to implead a party will not affect the court's jurisdiction over the case.|$|E
