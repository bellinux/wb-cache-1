5|$|Food {{production}} at Gedi likely involved a mixed economy based on livestock, {{as well as}} agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade.

40|$|<b>Citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> {{creasing}} or cracking is {{a complex}} pre-harvest physiological disorder that causes significant economic losses. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> creasing or cracking is caused not only by genetic factors but also by environmental factors. By reviewing the relationship between <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> creasing or cracking and peel mechanical properties, the cellular wall ultrastructure, cellular wall metabolism and modification, this paper summarized the mechanism of citrus creasing or cracking and further explained the effects of genetic factors and environmental factors (light, temperature, humidity, mineral nutrition and plant growth regulators) on <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> creasing or cracking rate. Further studies were proposed to provide a sound theoretical basis on <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> creasing or cracking...|$|R

Possible allergens include certain foods (e.g., chocolate, coffee, strawberries, eggs, nuts, tomatoes, cheese, <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits,</b> benzoates, cinnamaldehyde, and highly acidic foods), toothpastes, and mouthwashes. Where dietary allergens are responsible, mouth ulcers usually develop within about 12–24 hours of exposure.|$|E

5|$|Such {{behavior}} has been witnessed, {{as well as}} documented from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> directly from the trees.

Additionally, American alligators engage in what seems to be cooperative hunting.|$|E

5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} {{different from those of}} the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits,</b> creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E

5|$|Purr by Katy Perry is a {{fragrance}} {{created by}} American singer Katy Perry and Gigantic Parfums.

Purr features a variety of scents, including <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits.</b> Released in November 2010, it is available in a purple cat-shaped bottle. Purr is available in 1.7 and 3.4 fluid ounce bottles, with a retail price in the US of $35.00 to $45.00 for the smaller size and $65.00 for the larger.|$|E

5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} the trans-Atlantic slave trade {{increased}} maritime trade at Malagasy ports, including food products. In 1696, a trading vessel {{en route to the}} American colonies reportedly took a stock of local Malagasy rice to Charleston, South Carolina, where the grain formed the basis of the plantation industry. Trading ships brought crops from the Americas—such as sweet potato, tomato, maize, peanuts, tobacco and lima beans—to Madagascar in the 16th and 17thcenturies; cassava arrived after 1735 from a French colony at nearby Réunion Island. These products were first cultivated in coastal areas nearest to their ports of arrival, but soon spread throughout the island; within 100years of their introduction they were widespread throughout the central highlands. Similarly, pineapple and <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> such as lemons, limes, oranges, consumed by sailors to ward off scurvy on long cross-Atlantic trips, were introduced at coastal Malagasy ports. Local cultivation began soon afterward.|$|E
5|$|Watson {{argued that}} the economy {{established}} by Arab and other Muslim traders across the Old World enabled the diffusion of many crops and farming techniques across the Islamic world, {{as well as the}} adaptation of crops and techniques from and to regions outside it. Crops from Africa, such as sorghum, from China, such as <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits,</b> and from India, such as mango, rice, cotton and sugar cane, were distributed throughout Islamic lands, which, in his opinion, had not previously grown these plants. He listed eighteen such crops. He further {{argued that the}}se introductions, along with an increased mechanization of agriculture and irrigation, led to major changes in economy, population distribution, vegetation cover, agricultural production and income, population, urban growth, distribution of the labour force, industries linked to agriculture, cooking, diet and clothing in the Islamic world.|$|E

5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. <b>Citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.|$|E
