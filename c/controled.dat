In the New England Journal of Medicine, David Hemenway argued that Lott failed to account for several key variables, including drug consumption, and that therefore the model was flawed; however, Lott's econometrics did account for other variables such as street prices of illegal cocaine. Other researchers agreed, but some, including Ian Ayres and John J. Donohue, said that the model contained significant coding errors and systemic bias. Daniel Webster et al. also raised concerns about other flaws in the study, such as misclassification of laws and endogeneity of predictor variables, which they said rendered the study's conclusions [...] "insupportable". Gary Kleck considered it unlikely that such a large decrease in violent crime could be explained by a relatively modest increase in concealed carry, and others said that removing portions of the data set caused the results to still show statistically significant drops only in aggravated assaults and robbery when all counties with fewer than 100,000 people and Florida's counties were both simultaneously dropped from the sample.

5000|$|According to József Bánlaky Görgei {{failed to}} follow up his successes by taking the {{offensive}} against the Austrian frontier, contenting himself with besieging Buda, the Hungarian capital, taking the castle of Buda at 21 May 1849, instead of attacking Vienna, and winning the war. [...] The new generation of the Hungarian historians, like Róbert Hermann, consider that the siege of Buda was not a mistake of Görgei, because at that point he had not enough troops to attack towards Vienna, because the Austrians concentrated around Pozsony a fresh army which was two times bigger than Görgei's troops, and also far more better equipped. To achieve a victory with his tired troops which had almost completely run out of ammunition, was virtually impossible at that moment. Görgei hoped that meanwhile the siege of Buda, new Hungarian troops will be conscripted, the Hungarian generals who were operating in Southern Hungary will send him reinforcements, and {{and the lack of}} ammunition will be also resolved, and with this he will have the chance to defeat the Austrian troops concentrated around Pozsony and Vienna. He knew also that until in the castle of Buda has an 5000 strong Austrian garrison, which <b>controled</b> the only stone bridge across the Danube, the Chain Bridge, disturbing the Hungarian supply lines, [...] and menacing to attack the Hungarian troops and supply carriages (so because of that the Hungarians had to make a huge roundabout, which caused days and weeks of delay), and also making impossible the using of the Danube as a transport rute, besides of that, he must deploy a considerable armed force in order to watch the Austrian troops in Buda, thus weakening his troops which could attack westwards. Also the presence in Southern Hungary of the 15 000 strong Austrian troops led by Josip Jelačić, which could came by surprize towards north to help the garrison of Buda, represented a big threat, menacing to cut Hungary in two, by having that stronghold under imperial control, and only the liberation of Buda could diminguish this danger. Kossuth also urged Görgei to take the capital, because he hoped that, this success will convince the European powers to recognize Hungary's independence, and prevent the Russian invasion. So all the reasons and military and political advices were in favour of taking Buda first, than to attack towards Vienna. Hungarian Historian Róbert Hermann consideres that the capture of Buda after three weeks of siege (the only siege of the Hungarian Freedom War, which ended in the conquering of a fortress with an assault, the rest of the fortresses and castles being taken, by one or the other side, only after the surrender of the defenders after negociations), one of the greatest Hungarian military successes of the war.|$|E

5000|$|Görgei {{conducted}} the Spring Campaign in April and May 1849 brilliantly, defeating Windisch-Grätz, {{and when the}} latter, because of these defeats, was replaced with Ludwig von Welden, the new commander was also vanquished in a several battles. Görgei won at Hatvan (2 April), Tápióbicske (4 April), Isaszeg (6 April), Vác (10 April), Nagysalló (19 April), and relieved Komárom (26 April). The brilliant pincer maneuvers of Görgei's troops and the incertitude created in the enemy {{about the direction of}} the attack of his troops, corroborated with the successes of the Hungarian armies in the other fronts, forced the much superior armies of the Austrian Empire and its allies, which at the beginning of March, <b>controled</b> around 3/4 of Hungary, to evacuate the country, excepting a narrow landstrip in its western part, Croatia and a few land pockets and forts. In the battle of Isaszeg, Görgei was close to encircle and completely destroy the main Austrian army led by Windisch-Grätz (which could bring with it Hungary's decisive victory in the war), but the refusal of one of his army corps commanders, András Gáspár, to attack from the north, made possible the escape of the enemy. For the failure of making the best of this opportunity, Görgei also had a responsibility, because he did not urged Gáspár to attack, thinking that the latter already started it. Although in the liberation of the country took an important part also the troops of Józef Bem who liberated Transylvania, and Mór Perczel, who liberated much of Southern Hungary, excepting Croatia, Görgei was the commander who achieved the greatest success by defeating the main Austrian armies representing the most operational, and best equipped forces and its main commanders, regarded as among the best commanders which Austria had at that time, forcing them to retreat from the most developped central and western parts of the country, including the capitals. [...] We have to notice that Görgei achieved his successes with a numerically, technologically inferior army (47 500 Hungarian soldiers, having 198 cannons vs 55 000 Austrian soldiers with 214 cannons and rockets), which lacked heavy cavalry (relying almost completely on the light Hussar cavalry), and having very few soldiers fighting in the other types of units common in the armies of that period (chasseurs, grenadiers, lancer cavalry, dragoons, cuirassiers) in comparison with the Austrian army, which had plenty of these, and being every time in shortage of weapons and ammunition, which situation caused that during the battles, the Hungarian infantry to not to engage in long shooting duels with the imperials (which were usually well equipped with bullets and ammunition) but to start bayonet charges, which were repeated if the initially attempt to break through was unsuccessful, which caused of course heavy casualties for them, so the Hungarian infantry had to move forwards and backwards under continuous enemy fire.|$|E
