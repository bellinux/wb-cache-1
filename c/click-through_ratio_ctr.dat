The threshold current of LDs shifted to higher values with increasing dose (60 Co) and neutron fluence. Irradiations of PDs with 60 Co gammas up to a total dose of 10 E 6 Gy as well as irradiations with neutrons up to fluences of 4 x 10 E 14 cmE- 2 (1 MeV) lead to a strong increase of dark current. OCs show a significant reduction of the current transfer <b>ratio</b> (<b>CTR)</b> at dose values between 10 E 3 and 10 E 4 Gy. Except two types, the optocouplers did not survive neutron fluences < about 8 x 10 E 11 cmE- 2 (1 MeV) ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen Induced Cracking (HIC) and Stress Oriented Hydrogen Induced Cracking (SOHIC) {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on a conventional ASTM A 516 - 70 pressure vessel steel exposed to H 2 Scontaining diglycolamine (DGA) gas-sweetening environments. Baseline HIC and SOHIC {{tests were conducted}} in NACE TM 0284 - 96 solution A. For the SOHIC tests, four-point double beam specimens were stressed to 60 %, 80 % or 100 % of the yield strength of the steel in order to study the effect of applied stress. Test conditions included solutions containing 70 wt. % DGA and 500 ppm H 2 S to 0. 45 or higher mole-H 2 S/mole-DGA and temperatures of 25, 45 and 80 C. Corrosion rates of the steel were calculated from weight loss of the HIC specimens in order to compare {{the severity of the}} test environment with the actual service environment. Cracks were characterized in terms of crack length ratio (CLR), crack thickness <b>ratio</b> (<b>CTR)</b> and crack sensitivity ratio (CSR). Results indicate that conventional ASTM A 516 - 70 pressure vessel steel is not susceptible to HIC or SOHIC in various H 2 S-containing DGA solutions at the temperatures studied.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{ultrasound}} contrast agent imaging (USCAI) based on plane waves has recently attracted increasing attention. A series of USCAI techniques {{have been developed}} to improve the imaging quality. Most of the existing methods enhance the contrast-to-tissue <b>ratio</b> (<b>CTR)</b> using the time-frequency spectrum differences between the tissue and ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) region. In this paper, a new USCAI method based on bubble region detection was proposed, in which the frequency difference as well as the dissimilarity of tissue and UCA in the spatial domain was taken into account. A bubble wavelet based on the Doinikov model was firstly constructed. Bubble wavelet transformation (BWT) was then applied to strengthen the UCA region and weaken the tissue region. The bubble region was thereafter detected by using the combination of eigenvalue and eigenspace-based coherence factor (ESBCF). The phantom and rabbit in vivo experiment results suggested that our method was capable of suppressing the background interference and strengthening the information of UCA. For the phantom experiment, the imaging CTR was improved by 10. 1 dB compared with plane wave imaging based on delay-and-sum (DAS) and by 4. 2 dB over imaging based on BWT on average. Furthermore, for the rabbit kidney experiment, the corresponding improvements were 18. 0 dB and 3. 4 dB, respectively...|$|R
