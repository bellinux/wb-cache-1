5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work of the modernista architect.|$|E

That is why listening is very important skill to be mastered by students. In fact, it’s very difficult to them to understand what they heard. The difficulty is caused by many factors varying from difference <b>of</b> sounds between <b>the</b> second language learners’ first language and the second language he or she is learning, his or her lack of vocabulary, and his or her grammatical unawareness. In this research, the researcher tries to help students to increase their ability in listening comprehension. On way to increase, their ability is by using mime stories. Mime stories is a technique to teach listening to the students. In mime stories the teacher tell the story and the students and the teacher do the actions. It again provides physical movement and gives the teacher a chance to play along with them. <b>The</b> formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research problem are as follow: 1) How is <b>the</b> listening <b>comprehension</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B class at Perwanida Kindergarten before being taught by using mime stories? 2) How is <b>the</b> listening <b>comprehension</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B class at Perwanida Kindergarten after being taught by using mime stories? 3) Is there any significant difference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> listening <b>comprehension</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B class at Perwanida Kindergarten before and after being taught by using mime stories? <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> this research are: 1) To find out <b>the</b> listening <b>comprehension</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B class at Perwanida Kindergarten before being taught by using mime stories. 2) To find out <b>the</b> listening <b>comprehension</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B class at Perwanida Kindergarten after being taught by using mime stories. 3) To find out whether there is any significant difference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> listening <b>comprehension</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B class at Perwanida Kindergarten before and after being taught by using mime stories.
