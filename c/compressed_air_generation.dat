30|$|In general, steam {{generation}} cost is comparatively lower than <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>generation</b> cost. If the identical jets are used, steam consumption {{is less than}} air consumption in terms of Kg/hour. Therefore, when the steam-jet and air-jet textured yarns are compared, {{it can be concluded}} that steam-jet textured yarn is more economical to produce than air-jet textured yarn. Furthermore, environmental friendly alternative fluids such as biomass could be used to produce steam.|$|E

30|$|CHP unit {{is a kind}} of EH {{capable of}} {{supplying}} heat and electricity simultaneously, i.e., co-generation. In this respect, CHP is utilized to co-optimize heating network and electrical network to increase the flexibility and reduce curtailed wind and solar power [5, 6, 7]. Unfortunately, CHP needs natural gas backup to generate electricity, which breaks the original intention to release environment issue due to carbon emission caused by burning fossil fuel. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> energy storage (CAES), a promising energy storage technique, also uses natural gas combustion to produce electricity and leads to environment issues similar to CHP. By incorporating thermal energy storage system (TES) into CAES, advanced adiabatic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> energy storage system (AA-CAES) and non-supplementary fired <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> energy storage system (NSF-CAES) are capable of storing the thermal generated during air compression process in an air storage tank, and releasing it to heat the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> during electricity <b>generation</b> process [9, 10]. Thus, no gas combustion is needed in such advanced CAES systems. Similar with CHP, NSF-CAES is a class of EH capable of combined cooling, heating, and power generation. Owing to the zero-carbon-emission character, NSF-CAES hub can be adopted to construct a zero-carbon IES. On that basis, a zero-carbon-emission micro Energy Internet (ZCE-MEI) architecture is proposed by developing NSF-CAES as a clean EH to encompass the power distribution network (PDN) and district heating network (DHN) in this paper. The feasibility of using NSF-CAES as a clean energy hub in Energy Internet has been analyzed in [11], while more emphasis has been put on the scheduling of ZCE-MEI in this paper.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{is of great}} interest to manufacturing companies. Beyond considering individual processes and machines, the perspective on process chains and factories as a whole holds major potentials for energy efficiency improvements. To exploit these potentials, dynamic interactions of different processes as well as auxiliary equipment (e. g. <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>generation)</b> need to be taken into account. In addition, planning and controlling manufacturing systems require  balancing technical, economic and environmental objectives. Therefore, an innovative and comprehensive methodology – with a generic energy flow-oriented manufacturing simulation environment as a core element – is developed and embedded into a step-by-step application cycle.

40|$|Electric motor systems {{account for}} about 60 percent of global {{industrial}} electricity consumption and close to 70 percent of industrial electricity demand. Electric motors drive both, core industrial processes, like presses or rolls, and auxiliary systems like <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>generation,</b> ventilation or water pumping. They are utilized throughout all industrial branches, though their main applications vary. Studies show a high potential for energy efficiency improvement in motor systems, in developing {{as well as in}} developed countries. Specifically, system optimisation approaches which address the entire motor system demonstrate high potential. For most countries the saving potentials for energy efficiency improvements in motor systems with best available technology lie between 9 and 13 percent of the national industrial electricity demand. Many of the energy efficiency investments show payback times of a few years only. Still, market failures and barriers like the lack of capital, higher initial costs, lack of attention by plant managers and principal agent dilemmas hamper investment in energy efficient motor systems. To overcome these barriers, policies were established in several countries. Examples include minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) which introduced a minimum efficiency level for electric motors to allow them to enter the national market. These have been implemented in many countries worldwide. Although MEPS can be a very effective means to improve the market share of energy efficient motors, they are not designed to address system optimization aspects of, for example, entire compressed air or pump systems. Policies based on a system optimization approach combined with capacity development were, for example, implemented in many developed countries, but also in newly industrialized countries like China or Brazil. These can be auditing schemes or energy management standards. Often, both are combined with broad capacity building programmes as their success crucially depends on the skills of the energy manager or auditor...|$|E

40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling than those with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry machining. The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and a thicker chip with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling compared to dry machining alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> compared with dry machining is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> than that with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and dry machining only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge.
