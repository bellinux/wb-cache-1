40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana and the {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) {{have been widely}} studied for their role in biocontrol against many arthropods and extensively exploited for insect pest control. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of four B. bassiana and two Bti formulations and their respective combinations, for the biological control of the common house fly, Musca domestica L., a major pest in poultry facilities. In vitro screening was undertaken to select the best B. bassiana isolates from 34 B. bassiana isolates and two Paecilomyces isolates. All the isolates of B. bassiana were found to be effective against adult house flies, but were marginally effective in controlling fly larvae. The Paecilomyces isolates were non-pathogenic towards both adult house flies and larvae. The best four isolates R 444, 7320, 7569 and 7771 caused > 90 % mortality within 2 d and were subjected to dose-mortality bioassays. Microscopic studies using light and scanning electron microscopy indicated the different durations of the lifecycle of B. bassiana development on the house fly. High temperature was found to delay conidial germination. Spore germination and mycelial growth were also inhibited by high adjuvant concentrations. Laboratory baseline bioassay data established, a dose-time response relationship using a waterdispersible granules (WDG) Bti formulation that demonstrated that the susceptibility of M. domestica larvae to a given concentration of Bti increased as the duration of exposure increased. In the laboratory studies, the LC 50 and LC 90 values of Bti for the larvae ranged between 65 - 77. 4 and 185. 1 - 225. 9 ?g ml- 1, respectively. LT 50 and LT 90 values were 5. 5 and 10. 3 d respectively. In the field, a concentration of 10 g Bti kg- 1 (bran formulation) of feed resulted in 90 % reduction of larvae for 4 wk post-treatment. A higher concentration (2 g L- 1) of Bti in spray (WDG) applications was not significantly more effective than the lower concentration of 1 g L- 1. Thus, adding Bti to chicken feed has potential for the management and control of house flies in cagedpoultry facilities. The impact of oral feed applications of a bran formulation of Bti and a commercial <b>chemical</b> <b>larvicide,</b> Larvadex®, were compared with respect to their efficacy on the control of house fly 3 larval populations in poultry manure. The sublethal effects were manifested in terms of decreasing emergence of adult house flies. Although Larvadex® reduced larval density and caused significant reductions in emergence of adult house flies, it generally exhibited weaker lethal effects than Bti. The reduction levels achieved as a result of feeding 250 mg Bti kg- 1 at 5 wk were similar to those achieved as a result of feeding twice the amount of Larvadex® at 4 wk to the layers. From both an efficiency and economic perspective, comparisons to assess the impact of combining different concentrations of the two Bti formulations were carried out to evaluate their success in controlling house fly larvae and adults in poultry houses. The percentage mortality of larvae accomplished as a result of using a combination of 250 mg kg- 1 Bti in feed and 2 g L- 1 spray applications was equivalent to that obtained as a result of combining 500 mg kg- 1 Bti in feed and 1 g L- 1 spray application. The cost-benefit analysis (expressed in terms of mortality of larvae) indicated that the most effective combination for control of house fly larvae and fly emergence was the 500 mg kg- 1 in feed and 2 g L- 1 spray application combination that resulted in 67 % larval mortality and 74 % inhibition of adult house fly emergence. This study presents commercial users with possible combinations of applications of the two Bti formulations. Comparisons of larval mortalities and house fly emergence resulting from the Bti - B. bassiana treatments with those from Larvadex® - B. bassiana treatments, showed better control levels compared to any of the individual agents alone. The Bti treatments were more effective at controlling larval populations and inhibiting the emergence of house flies than Larvadex®, even when Larvadex® was applied together with B. bassiana. The effects of the Bti - B. bassiana and the Larvadex® - B. bassiana interactions were additive. These trials suggest that the efficacy of Bti in the control of house fly larvae may be improved with frequent applications of B. bassiana...|$|E

40|$|Background. Mosquitoes {{transmitted}} diseases {{are associated with}} high Mortality and Morbidity rates. Most of these diseases Lack effective medicine since the causative agent have developed resistance to these medicines. The approach of controlling these diseases through Larviciding and killing the mosquitoes at adult state using synthetic agents {{is associated with a}} number of problems including toxicity, cost also mosquitoes have developed resistance to these agents. All these necessities search for Larviciding agent from natural sources. Methods. In this study various extracts prepared from leaves, stem barks and Roots of Zanthoxylum lindense and Zanthoxylum holtizianum collected from Bagamoyo were screened for larvicidal activity using modified WHO protocol 2005. The plant materials were extracted using Petroleum ether, Dichloromethane and Methanol reagents and the extraction was carried out by maceration method in the laboratory and the larvicidal screening activity was done using WHO guidelines for larvicidal test method (WHO, 2005) under laboratory conditions using third instar Galax Culex quinquefasciatusmosquito larvae. Results. The highest percentage mortality rate (100 %) against Culex quinquefasciatusmosquito larvae was observed at a concentration of 500 ug/ml, after 24 h exposure. Of all the extracts, the Dichloromethane and Pet ether extracts exhibited highest mortality while Methanol extracts exhibited lowest mortality after 24 h exposure.

40|$|Abstract Background: Malaria {{remains a}} {{significant}} threat {{to public health}} in many countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To address this preventable health problem, there is need to evaluate the existing and identify new prevention methods. Integrated vector management approaches including microbial larviciding are effective {{in the fight against}} malaria. The need to explore the applicability of microbial larviciding in malaria endemic areas is critical. This study assessed community knowledge, perceptions, attitudes and acceptability of microbial larviciding as a malaria control strategy in Lower Moshi, Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted in Chekereni and Mabogini villages in Lower Moshi Tanzania. The two villages were purposively selected because most of the community members in these villages cultivate rice and researchers had good rapport with the community members. 100 interviewer-administered questionnaires were conducted in households. In addition, 4 in-depth interviews with key informers including health workers and agricultural experts, and 2 focus group discussions were conducted in the two villages. Results: 60 % reported they had knowledge or experience with larviciding. Most of them (96 %) mentioned they had knowledge of <b>chemical</b> <b>larviciding,</b> while only 4 % had knowledge of microbial larviciding. Nearly every respondent (97 %) was willing to use fertilizer with larvicides in their rice fields after being informed about larviciding. Almost all (97 %) reported willingness to inform and encourage other community members to use microbial larviciding in their rice fields. Similarly, many of the respondents (56 %) were positive that microbial larviciding would significantly help in reducing malaria cases. Concerns about applicability of microbial larviciding were reported by survey respondents, focus group discussion participants and in-depth interview respondents. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the community in Lower Moshi, despite having little knowledge, is positive about and willing to be engaged in microbial larviciding to reduce the mosquito population in the area and consequently to reduce malaria cases in the community. The future applicability of microbial larviciding with rice farmers in Lower Moshi Tanzania as a component of an integrated vector management strategy lies in the efforts put towards educating and sensitizing the community and creating incentives so that farmers can afford the fertilizers with larvicides.

40|$|From a {{study of}} strongyloides infections in man and animals in this region, it has been determined, in {{confirmation}} of the view of Grassi, Calmette, and others, {{that they are not}} causative factors in the production of diarrhea. The mother worm, however, burrows into the mucosa and deposits her ova there. Certain tissue reactions take place and are evidenced by the cellular proliferation in those portions of the intestines occupied by the nematodes. In animals, there is an associated anemia, not positively attributable to the strongyloides, but, on the other hand, not attributable to any other cause. It is possible that S. stercoralis may cause some degree of anemia in man. The amount is indeterminable in this region among hospital cases on account of the associated hookworm disease or malaria. Portals of entry for various microörganisms are made by the female mother worm and her larvæ in the small intestine, and, while no case of general bacterial infection has been proved to have arisen in this way, its occurrence is possible and highly probable. In the cultures of strongyloides of man, there is among natives, who presumably are infected with purely tropical strains, a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiated mode, in some cases, an absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larvæ being obtained. There are, however, natives, cultures from whose stools contain from a single filariform larva of the direct phase up to a very definite predominance of this mode. Cultures from natives of the temperate zones contain a marked predominance of the direct phase larvæ. The presence of the filariform (direct mode), larva is perhaps best accounted for by its being an attempt at more perfect parasitism (Stiles). From a correlation of culture study with the results of a histological examination of the invaded mucosa, this explanation of the derivation of the two phases is suggested. The mother worm in the intestinal tract has two kinds of progeny: (a) those expelled into the crypts or lumen, and (b) those imbedded in the intestinal wall. One lot becomes larvæ of either the direct or indirect phase; the other lot of the opposite phase. It appears to me that the intraepithelial cell-developed larvæ furnish the direct phase, while the embryos expelled directly from the mother become the indirect phase larvæ. This will require for its confirmation {{a study of}} cultures in connection with a histological examination of the infected intestinal wall. Cold merely inhibits the development of the larvγaelig; into either the filariform (direct) or into the sexually differentiated adults, and does not alter the anlage. The resistant as well as the infecting form is the filariform larva, and all <b>chemical</b> <b>larvicides</b> must be directed against this form.
