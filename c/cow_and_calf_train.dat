Ultrasound measures of longissimus muscle depth (LMD) and intramuscular fat (IMF) of Angus × heifers were used to predict lifetime <b>cow</b> productivity. IMF <b>and</b> LMD were categorized into high, medium, and low groups (IMFG <b>and</b> LMDG, respectively). <b>Cows</b> in the high and medium LMDG had greater (P 0. 05) effects on pregnancy rates and performance of beef <b>cows</b> <b>and</b> calves. Lactating crossbred <b>cows</b> with calves <b>and</b> non-pregnant, non-lactating Boer-cross nannies were {{used to evaluate the}} effects of co-grazing on herbivory patterns and animal performance while grazing native tallgrass rangeland infested heavily by sericea lespedeza (SL). The proportion of individual SL plants that had been grazed {{at the end of the}} trial was greater (P < 0. 01) in co-grazed pastures than in single-species pastures. Grazing <b>cows</b> <b>and</b> goats in combination increased (P < 0. 01) grazing pressure on SL without negatively affecting beef cow performance, beef calf performance, or residual forage biomass. Angus × <b>cows</b> <b>and</b> heifers grazing native range were used to evaluate the effects of pre-partum corn steep liquor supplementation on postpartum beef <b>cow</b> <b>and</b> <b>calf</b> performance. Under the conditions of our study, CSL supplementation did not generally promote beef <b>cow</b> <b>and</b> <b>calf</b> performance that was equivalent to supplementation with an isonitrogenous, dry, corn-soy alternative. Cow calf pairs were used to evaluate the effects of grazing system (GS) and stocking rate (SR) on <b>cow</b> <b>and</b> <b>calf</b> performance. Late season rest-rotation (LSRR) was compared with continuous (CONT) grazing at low, moderate, and high SR. Under the conditions of our study, CONT produced consistently better (P < 0. 01) late-season <b>cow</b> <b>and</b> <b>calf</b> performance than LSRR. Season-long effects of SR on animal performance were minimal; moreover, GS and SR treatments produced equivalent pregnancy rates...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the dairy}} {{industry}} {{it is common}} practice to separate <b>cow</b> <b>and</b> <b>calf</b> shortly after birth but this practice is disputed because of animal welfare concerns. Some producers, in many countries, milk cows that also nurse dairy calves. These cow–calf systems allow nursing as well as affiliative and other natural behaviours. In this review paper we describe cow–calf systems used in practice and/or in research, discuss the benefits and challenges documented by research, and identify areas where more research is needed. Four cow–calf systems are described: (1) free contact systems where <b>cow</b> <b>and</b> <b>calf</b> have unrestricted access to each other; (2) restricted suckling systems allowing short daily contact only to nurse; (3) half day contact where <b>cow</b> <b>and</b> <b>calf</b> are housed together during the day or night; <b>and</b> (4) foster <b>cow</b> systems where one cow nurses 2 – 4 calves usually without milking. In free and half day cow–calf contact systems the calf drinks large amounts of milk and has high daily weight gains. High pre-weaning calf weight gains {{have been shown to}} lead to higher milk yield during that animal's first lactation. One issue with cow–calf systems is the depressed weight gain of calves at weaning. The premature separation of <b>cow</b> <b>and</b> <b>calf,</b> compared to the natural situation, may cause stress especially in free contact systems. Weaning and separation should therefore occur in two steps. Half day contact seems particularly promising because animals get used to being separated, they experience positive human handling, and calves can learn to use a milk feeder which will prevent the growth check following weaning. Nursing cows yield less saleable milk during the suckling period, can have problems with milk ejection during machine milking and have a lower fat content of the milk, compared to non-nursing cows. Udder health of the cow may be positively affected by nursing. A rich social rearing environment has recently been shown to improve cognitive skills of calves. Still, studies on long term effects of dam rearing on behaviour, health, production and farm economics are few. There is also a need to address ways to control transmissible diseases when dairy cattle are kept in mixed age groups. Increased knowledge will help us design functional high tech dairy management systems that respect the natural behaviour of <b>cows</b> <b>and</b> calves during the calf rearing period...|$|R
