Although this ruled in favour of the objectors its decision was not binding on the Department of Transport, which decided to proceed with its original route. While the planning appeals process had been exhausted, landowners of plots along the proposed route still had grounds to appeal through the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>procedure.</b> Joe Weston, one of the campaigners, had {{the idea of taking}} advantage of this by identifying and purchasing a plot of land on the route, as close to Otmoor as possible.|$|E
40|$|Until {{the ending}} of Communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the {{objective}} of <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> was the achievement of a socialist society in which the ownership {{of the means of}} production, including land, was to be collective rather than private. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> legislation and laws on ownership were used to expropriate private property. After 1990 the newly elected democratic governments changed the constitutions to permit and protect private ownership of land. However, <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> is essential in a market economy to deal with certain aspects of market failure. These include the need to facilitate the provision of collective goods, such as infrastructure and utility networks, and regeneration where the state may need to disrupt a prisoners’ dilemma situation. In spite of their commitment to the inviolability of private property, the transitional economies have had to develop <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>procedures</b> and means of assessing compensation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> as {{an administrative}} procedure. In many countries {{the procedure is}} handled in courts {{and it is very}} complicated and time consuming. The present system in Finland based on legislation from 1977 is an administrative procedure lead by cadastral surveyors. There are already a lot of experiences in Finland, so we are able to present the system and analyse its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, there are similar types of procedures for almost the same purposes, which make the analysis even broader. The main objective of the paper is to examine the possibility to make the <b>procedure</b> of <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> more efficient. It is based on studies done in the Institute of Real Estate Studies and the Institute of Law, Department of Surveying at the Helsinki University of Technology during the past few years. It is hoped that the paper may {{contribute to the development of}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>procedures</b> in the future also in other countries...|$|R

50|$|Although land may be {{acquired}} by consent, and conduct which raises another party's reasonable expectations, these private methods of acquiring land are often insufficient for adequate public regulation. Building national infrastructure, such as railways, housing, and sewerage, {{as well as}} democratically determined planning rules, either by national or local government, typically requires <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase,</b> because private owners might not give up land required for public works except at an extortionate price. Historically, <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> were carried out under the Inclosure Acts and their predecessors, where enclosure was frequently a method of expropriating people from common land {{for the benefit of}} barons and landlords. In the industrial revolution, most railways were built by private companies procuring <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> rights from private Acts of Parliament, though by the late 19th century, powers of <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> slowly became more transparent and used for general social welfare, as with the Public Health Act 1875, or the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> legislation was significantly extended during World War One for military use, and after the war for housing, as certain principles became standardised.|$|R

40|$|Policy {{instruments}} are {{the building blocks}} of land use policies. Instrumentation of policies relates to values. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> is a direct government instrument that may be an effective way to implement policies of biodiversity conservation and the allocation of land for recreational use. It is, however, in many contexts, politically controversial. The Netherlands' Government has endorsed policies that involve <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> in up to 10 % of land purchases. This paper reviews if this 10 %-ceiling can structure relationships between landowners and government agencies {{in such a way that}} it relieves constraints imposed by land availability for biodiversity conservation and the provision of recreational areas. The analysis consists of (1) the background of this 10 %-ceiling, (2) the actual <b>procedures</b> of <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase,</b> by analysis of Royal Decrees, (3) the actual <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases,</b> and (4) the indirect instrumental effects of the use of this instrument. The paper concludes that the 10 %-ceiling does not lift the constraints of land availability, but does influence the relationship between stakeholders, the implementation of biodiversity objectives, and land policy strategies. Nevertheless, <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> may provide possibilities to acquire land necessary for a consolidated natural area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{ownership}} of land {{can act as}} a significant barrier to brownfield redevelopment. Despite renewed interest in <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase,</b> it is unlikely to become the normal remedy for multiple ownership, owing to its cost and complexity. Drawing on international experience and recent research, this article proposes the concept of an Urban Partnership Zone, in which existing landowners would be entitled to participate alongside the local authority and a chosen development partner in a joint-venture redevelopment company. Combined with greater planning certainty and other benefits, this innovation would enable the development process to operate more rapidly without immediate <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase.</b> Brownfield Land, <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase,</b> Development Process, Urban Redevelopment, Multiple Land Ownership, Owner Participation,...|$|R

Today, the Land Compensation Act 1961 section 5 generally requires that the owner of an interest in land (e.g. a freehold, leasehold or easement as in Re Ellenborough Park) receives payment for the [...] "value of the land... if sold on an open market by a willing seller". Compensation is often also available for losses to a home, or if one's business has to move. In turn the <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase</b> Act 1965 set conditions for a purchase to be made, and the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 regulates the conditions for granting a [...] "Compulsory Purchase Order". Typically, either central government represented by a Secretary of State, or a local council will be interested in making a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase.</b> The authority of local councils for make purchases for specific reasons can be set out in specific legislation, such as the Highways Act 1980 to build roads when strictly necessary. However the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 section 226, which allows <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> to [...] "facilitate the carrying out of development, re-development or improvement" [...] for the area's economic, social, or environmental well being, must be confirmed by the Secretary of State, and similarly the Local Government Act 1972 section 121 requires the council seek approval from the government Minister, a time-consuming process which prevents <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> being carried out without co-ordination in central government.|$|R
