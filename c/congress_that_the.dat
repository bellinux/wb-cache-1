5|$|On October 28, 2016, Comey {{notified}} <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FBI {{started looking}} into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton's private server on {{a laptop computer}} belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July. The notification was later cited by Clinton {{as a factor in}} her loss in the 2016 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began {{negotiating}} with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option {{would be unlikely to}} succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on a bill that would grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The reform was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic reform was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This reform was also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reform was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The reform is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E

25|$|The FBI probe was {{concluded}} on July 5, 2016, with a recommendation of no charges, a recommendation {{that was followed}} by the Justice Department. On October 28, eleven days before the election, FBI Director James Comey informed <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FBI was analyzing additional emails obtained during its investigation of an unrelated case. On November 6, he notified <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new emails did not change the FBI's earlier conclusion.|$|E
25|$|On July 7, the State Department reopened its {{probe into}} the email controversy. On October 28, 2016, Comey {{notified}} <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails {{that may be}} pertinent to the case. Law enforcement officials stated the emails were found on a laptop belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin's husband, Anthony Weiner, during an investigation of his sexting scandals. On November 6, Comey notified <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FBI had not changed its conclusion, reached in July, regarding Clinton's emails.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, {{officials}} with the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the District of Columbia convinced the United States <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Anacostia River should be dredged {{to create a more}} commercially viable channel that would enhance the local economy as well as provide land where factories or warehouses might be built.

25|$|Congress {{revisited}} the Act in 1975, {{the year}} that the Act's special provisions were again set to expire. The debate was less acrimonious than previous debates concerning the Act, reflecting an expanded consensus in <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> law remained necessary to remedy continued racial discrimination in voting. Unlike Nixon, President Gerald Ford's administration, which worked to improve relations with African Americans after Nixon's presidency, supported extending the Act without weakening it. After conducting several hearings, Congress passed legislation amending the Act; the Senate approved the amendments by a 77-12 vote, and the House of Representatives by a 346-56 vote. President Ford signed the amendments into law on August 6, 1975.|$|E
25|$|In April 1993, a {{group of}} Peruvian {{military}} officers anonymously released a document detailing the events at La Cantuta. Their document claimed the death squad had abducted the victims, tortured and murdered them, and then hurriedly buried them; later, they claimed, after questions had been raised in <b>Congress,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> armed forces had exhumed, incinerated, and reburied the bodies in another location. The military whistleblowers named the members of Grupo Colina involved, identified the operations chief as Major Santiago Martín Rivas, and suggested that the group operated on the orders of Vladimiro Montesinos, head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) and a close advisor to President Fujimori.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a {{complaint}} with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stating that Google's admitted downloading of private wi-fi data constituted a violation of The US Wiretap Act and The Federal Communications Act. The FTC decided not to take up the complaint. Documents subsequently obtained by EPIC under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) indicated, despite a request from <b>Congress,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FTC did not examine Google's data from private wireless networks before dropping the case. EPIC filed an administrative appeal with the FTC, challenging its decision, and in May 2011 EPIC filed a suit against the FTC for access to the documents on which the FTC's decision was based.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the war, the Second Continental Congress promised {{officers}} {{they would}} receive a life pension of half-pay beginning on 21 October 1780. The army was well aware that Congress had {{made no effort to}} back up this promise. In January 1783, a committee of officers drew up a petition listing their grievances and Alexander McDougall presented it to Congress in company with Matthias Ogden and John Brooks. Differing from earlier petitions, this one spoke for the entire army, not just the officer corps. Behind the scenes, Washington wrote to members of <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> officers' claims were legitimate. Unfortunately, the Congress defeated a measure that would have given the officers full pay for five years as compensation for the promised pension.|$|E
25|$|This time, the DVLMF {{commemorative}} coin act {{originated in the}} House of Representatives. Representative Dennis Moore (D-Kansas) introduced H.R. 634 in January 2007, and it passed the House 416-to-0 in May. Senator Tim Johnson then introduced companion legislation (S. 2119) in the Senate in October 2007. The DVLMF told members of <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> foundation had raised roughly $43 million of the $65 million needed to build the memorial, and that {{commemorative coin}} sales would allow it to complete fundraising in 2008. The Senate Banking Committee favorably reported the legislation on May 20, 2008, with clarifying legislation from Senator Johnson. The Senate adopted the amended bill by a unanimous vote on June 10, and the House adopted the Senate bill on June 18.|$|E
25|$|In 1896 the Ottoman {{government}} {{lifted the}} ban on the emigration of its subjects, prompting a surge of immigration to the United States from the Levant. The Ottomans saw benefit in the remittances sent by the Ottoman diaspora, which boosted the economy. In 1898, the Ford Committee lobbied for more stringent immigrant admission criteria to the United States and proposed to the US <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> undesirable be turned back. These measures aimed to dampen {{the flow of the}} non-European immigrants and prompted Mokarzel to call on all the community's newspapers to stop promoting immigration because the immigrants were likely to be turned back upon arrival. Despite the restrictive measures, {{only a small fraction of}} Levantine Ottoman immigrants were debarred.|$|E

25|$|In late 1923, Nungesser {{headed up}} an ill-starred voyage to Havana. Having been invited by the {{secretary}} to the President, José Manuel Cortina, when the latter was vacationing in Paris, Nungesser seemed to have assumed he had received an official tender from the Cuban government. At any rate, Nungesser brought four World War I SPADs with him, {{as well as two}} fellow veterans. Nungesser based the SPADs with the Cuban Air Corps at Campo Colombia. He then proposed that the Cubans buy forty or more airplanes from him. When the Cuban Army pleaded lack of budget, Nungesser so aggressively importuned the Cuban <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cuban army Chief of Staff, General Alberto Herrera y Franchi, threatened to throw Nungesser's party out of the country. On 10 February 1924, the French ace ended his Cuban sojourn with a fundraising flying exhibition, proceeds going to charity.|$|E
25|$|Under President Carter, the CIA was {{conducting}} covertly funded pro-American opposition against the Sandinista. In March 1981, Reagan told <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CIA would protect El Salvador by preventing the shipment of Nicaraguan arms {{into the country}} to arm Communist rebels. This was a ruse. The CIA was actually arming and training Nicaraguans Contras in Honduras in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Through William J. Casey's tenure as DCI little {{of what he said}} in the National Security Planning Group, or to President Reagan was supported by the intelligence branch of the CIA, so Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action. On December 21, 1982, Congress passed a law restricting the CIA to its stated mission, restricting the flow of arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador, prohibiting the use of funds to oust the Sandinistas. Reagan testified before Congress, assuring them that the CIA was not trying to topple the Nicaraguan government.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for first test flights in 2011, the independent {{analysis by the}} Augustine Commission found in late 2009 that due to technical and financial problems Ares I was not likely to have had its first crewed launch until 2017–2019 under the current budget, or late 2016 with an unconstrained budget. The Augustine Commission also stated that Ares I and Orion would have an estimated recurring cost of almost $1 billion per flight. However, later financial analysis in March 2010 showed that the Ares I would have cost $1 billion or more to operate per flight had the Ares I flown just once a year. If the Ares I system were flown multiple times a year the marginal costs could have fallen to as low as $138 million per launch. In December 2011, NASA administrator Charlie Bolden testified to <b>congress</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ares I would cost $4–4.5 billion a year, and $1.6 billion per flight. The Ares I marginal cost was predicted {{to have been a}} fraction of the Shuttle's marginal costs even had it flown multiple times per year. By comparison, the cost of launching three astronauts on a manned Russian Soyuz is $153 million.|$|E
