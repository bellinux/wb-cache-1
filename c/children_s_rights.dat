This paper examines both internal and external child trafficking and some of the causes of this menace. The thesis argues that the international and regional conventions, regardless of their efforts {{to protect the rights of}} the children, have failed to achieve their purpose especially in the sub­region. In summary, this paper concludes that unless the issue of poverty, which is the underlying factor in the exploitation of children, is tackled head on, {{the implementation of}} these conventions would be ineffective in the sub­regio...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{examine the}} impact of poverty {{on the rights of the}} child in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where, in spite of the country s wealth and {{resource}} capacity, the most fundamental rights guaranteed to children remain violated on a daily basis due to extreme levels of poverty. While the DRC is potentially a rich country, it has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. Basic health care and education are nothing but distant dreams to most children, thereby making realisation of the rights enshrined in legally binding international, regional and national instruments elusive. This poses a huge developmental problem not only to children but importantly to the future of the country as a whole. This necessitates looking at the factors that cause and sustain poverty in the country. Without underestimating the external causes, I figure out a range of internal causes that contribute to draining the country s resources, which incidentally impacts negatively on the realisation of the rights and welfare of the child. I illustrate with evidence from the challenges that poverty poses to the implementation of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> that politics in the DRC is not one that is designed with the intention to promote human rights, let alone the rights of the child. Based on these findings, I make a number of recommendations that necessitate more proactive concrete action both from the government of the DRC and other active forces in eliminating poverty and thus consequently ensure effective realisation of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights.</b> Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2016 Centre for Human RightsLLMUnrestricte...|$|E

Esta relación puede estar mediatizada por la experiencia de traumas evolutivos, algo que se haya presente en las situaciones de pobreza que afectan a la infancia. This article aims {{to enrich}} the {{traditional}} approaches concerning child poverty exploring the relation between poverty, trauma, and shame. In order to do so, it will try to answer two main questions: first, given the already proven relation between poverty and child, whether child poverty fulfills the criteria to be considered an experience with {{a high risk of}} becoming a traumatic one. Second, this article aims to explore the link between trauma and shame, as a possible mechanism that may account for the phenomenon of poverty-related shame. Accepting the first hypothesis, it will try to shed light on how this connection could benefit the measures against child poverty and the design of policies. If child poverty is associated to feelings of shame, and these feelings have their roots in trauma, then the policies to bring social justice for children into reality should surpass the economic area and implement also the damage concerning self-esteem and self-concept. As a result, we will advocate for re-dignifying the child through the improvement of mental health services as a necessary measure to bring to reality <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/draf...|$|E
40|$|The surging {{investments}} in the extractive industries (EI) {{that began in the}} 1980 s, as well as the commodity boom between 2002 and 2011, have increased the significance of the sector in national economic development. This paper takes the Philippines as a case study and provides a detailed analysis of two key aspects of mining governance: first, the political challenges in realizing a more positive role for EI in social development, particularly in promoting <b>children</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> and <b>children</b> 4 <b>s</b> welfare, and second, the political economy dynamics that might underpin the creation of a welfare regime able to sustain social investments for children. The findings of this paper suggest that in the Philippine context, where the expansion of the EI sector is contested in the public domain, the link between mining governance and the promotion and protection of <b>children</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> is not necessarily straightforward. Yet equally, the resurgence of high prices and the continuing interest of foreign investment in EI means that there is now a political opportunity for relevant stakeholders to make a compelling argument for the need to ring-fence mineral rents for social {{investments in}} children and young people. To do so would require a strong pro-welfare policy coalition committed to channelling mineral wealth towards social investment and willing to craft a political consensus through negotiations between local and national elites, donor agencies, civil society organizations and affected local communities. Importantly, the state must also wrestle with multinational capital, large Filipino-owned companies and small-scale miners in the process of negotiating reforms. Ultimately, the state must seize this opportunity to take {{a more active role in}} laying the foundations of a mining governance framework, bargain with key stakeholders to reach agreement on EI-funded welfare and set out rights-based approaches to development. This paper builds on a selective qualitative data collection from a variety of printed sources, including donor agency reports, government documents, NGO reports, newspaper archives, and interviews available online. It further builds on a short fieldwork period in Manila, in late August 2013, where key sources from civil society, academia, the extractive industry, the donor community and stakeholders were interviewed...|$|R
40|$|A {{milestone}} provision introduced for {{the first}} time under the Convention on the Rights of Child, and subsequently under the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the <b>Child,</b> is <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>right</b> to maximum survival. Meaningful realization of this right, inter alia, imposes an obligation on states parties to these instruments and other actors to prevent avoidable child mortality and morbidity during and after childbirth. Since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals in 1990, child mortality and morbidity rates have decreased globally from nearly 13 million a year to just over 6 million. This means that the number of children worldwide who die before the age of five has more than halved {{in the last quarter of}} a century. Despite the significant reductions made, children are still dying, particularly in vulnerable communities. Concerned with the unfinished agenda of child mortality in many parts of the world and faced with the fact that a significant portion of under?five mortality is from preventable causes (an indication that avoidable child fatalities is potentially a violation of human right constituting social injustice) the international community has recently reached a broader consensus that under?five mortality is no longer just an issue of public health, but also a human rights concern. Under?five mortality as a human rights concern is now gaining momentum. A human rights?based approach to reducing child mortality and morbidity draws attention to barriers to successfully addressing this problem, and highlights the range of actors responsible for reducing child mortality. It also provides a legal framework to strengthen public health efforts, facilitates identification of child populations at risk, and enables analysis of gaps in protection, participation and accountability. In this way, applying human rights to child survival not only helps governments comply with their obligations, but also contributes to improving survival of children. In this thesis, I interrogate the currency attained by human rights?based approaches to reducing child mortality and morbidity, within the context of Ethiopia. I examine Ethiopia s normative and institutional child health?related framework critically, measure achievements and identify challenges for meaningful implementation of child survival and its complimentary rights. I conclude that there are positive signs to demonstrate that Ethiopia has started to comply with its obligation to realize <b>children</b> <b>s</b> survival <b>rights.</b> Despite these achievements, I find that current laws, policies and strategies lack a coherent conceptual framework and do not employ an intelligible human rights lens' that would allow government to respond to child health issues. In practice, preventable newborn deaths remain the main challenge. Furthermore, the country is a place of stark contrasts in terms of child survival rates. Relying on the requirements of human rights law, I conclude by arguing the potential for the operationalization of the human rights?based model to further reduce or eliminate child mortality in Ethiopia, post? 2015.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In England around 68, 000 children are currently looked after by the state. Sixty two per cent of this population are admitted to care or accommodation in response to abuse and neglect. As the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child acknowledges, {{the state has a}} unique responsibility for these children and is expected to ensure their safety, wellbeing and development. Underpinned by a rights-based framework the publications in the thesis make an original contribution to social work research, policy and practice, in respect of looked after children nationally and internationally. Three cohering theoretical strands - the new sociology of childhood, attachment theory and focal theory, and different methodological lenses, (from participatory research with young people to cross-national analysis of administrative data), are employed to advance understanding of the balance of protective, provisional and participatory rights (3 Ps) for these children and young people. The work focuses upon their life pathways at two key stages in the lifespan: early infancy and adolescence into adulthood. Consistent with the theoretical underpinnings of the research, the methodological approach employed in two of the four core studies sought to promote <b>children</b> <b>s</b> active participation in the research process, and to give them a voice. The participatory peer methodology adopted moved beyond involving care experienced young people in interviewing their peers, to training and engaging them in several major aspects of the research cycle, including analysis of the data and the design and write up of the findings, to produce accessible peer research reports for young people. At the national level the work undertaken demonstrates how a needs-based discourse, and orientation towards considering looked after children as objects of concern, can mean that young <b>children</b> <b>s</b> protective <b>rights</b> may be prioritised in policy and practice, {{at the expense of the}}ir provisional and participatory <b>rights.</b> <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> participation <b>rights</b> are also constrained due to assumptions about the (in) capacities of younger children to express their wishes and feelings. In this context parents rights tend to be prioritised at the expense of the rights of the child. Whereas parents rights may take precedence when children are young, in adolescence the rights of parents are more peripheral. Cross-national comparisons reveal variations in how young people s provisional, participatory and protective rights are balanced as young people negotiate the transition from care to adulthood in western societies, as well as different drivers for reform. Empirical research on recent policy developments in England also illuminates the tensions and dilemmas professionals can face as they attempt to protect and provide for young people, whilst recognising their evolving capabilities and their right to autonomy and active participation in decision making processes. Finally, the studies highlight that young people with the most complex care histories may be denied the right to decide for themselves if they want to remain in foster or residential care into early adulthood...|$|R
40|$|At {{the time}} of writing this thesis, there are ongoing armed {{conflicts}} in 8 African countries where thousands of children are being killed, maimed, displaced, and abducted into armed groups {{and in some cases}} into armed forces to serve as child soldiers, sex slaves, and porters among other roles that violate their rights. Thousands of other children face vulnerabilities in post-conflict situations including lack of basic services and separation from their families. Grave violations of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> in armed conflicts are taking place despite many African countries being signatories to international and regional instruments that provide for children s protection in such situations most notably the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. At {{the time of}} writing, the latter has been adopted by 47 out of 54 member states of the African Union (AU) a regional organization that is a major actor in the area of peace and security in Africa and one that has established institutional and legal mechanisms to protect human rights. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether the AU has the capacity to protect children in armed conflicts. Given the gravity of the situation in Africa and the fact that children make up about half of the continent s population it seems that addressing this issue is a test of the AU s commitment to ensuring peace and security and protecting human rights. This study attempts to contribute to the dearth of literature on this subject. Using grounded theory methodology, a theory was developed to address the question of whether the AU has the capacity to protect children in armed conflicts. This was based on coding and analysis of in-depth interviews with key informants who are knowledgeable on the subject - as well as a review of literature particularly on the role played by the African Union (AU) in addressing the problem. The theory developed by this study is that the AU s lack of capacity to protect children in armed conflict is both a manifestation and a product of the issue not being high on its agenda. This study found that the AU lacks the institutional and structural capacity to protect children in armed conflicts and a determining factor is a lack of political will among many of its member states to deal with the issue. Institutional and structural challenges in the AU that militate against protection of children in armed conflicts being high on its agenda lie in the areas of: setting priorities, structure, resources and capacity, and coordination with other actors...|$|E

Methods: the review of the literature was done using Medline, Psyclit, and Lilacs as resources for assessing international and national research articles on child nutrition, with an emphasis on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior. These articles were revised and grouped together according to the topic. Results: family is responsible for the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior through social learning. Parents are <b>children</b> <b>s</b> first nutritional educators. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> eating experiences are influenced by cultural and psychosocial factors. Social context plays a relevant role in this process, especially through the strategies used by parents to encourage children to have a balanced diet and to eat specific foods. These strategies may contain adequate and inadequate stimuli as to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food preference and food intake self-control. Conclusion: the learning process is a determining factor for <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior, and is associated with three factors: food flavor conditioning, food postingestional consequences, and social context.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services offer children a means of developing their reading skills through the provision of books and other resources. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services might be operated by public libraries, school library services or schools. A small proportion of public library authorities in the UK choose to operate specialist mobile libraries which cater for children alone. Such vehicles deliver a library service to children {{across a range of}} geographic and socioeconomic areas with the stated aims of promoting reading and a love of books, and accessing children who would not otherwise use library services. This study evaluated whether <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries (CMLs) across the UK reach those aims and examined the methods by which the aims were targeted. It was decided that the most appropriate research method was to take an inductive perspective and qualitative approach forming a constructivist methodology. The evaluation was achieved by the use of grounded theory as a general method together with ethnographic techniques, in order to observe and understand the interactions of social actors, and identify the processes used to encourage reading. Interviews with key individuals were primarily held to gain access into the field and inform the scope of the research. Participant observations were conducted on 12 of the 26 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> libraries operating in the UK and further interviews with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library (CML) operators and CML service managers were also carried out. Extensive field notes were taken, then coded and analysed by the grounded theory method in order to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> and adults perceptions of the value of a CML to their lives. A model of the influences on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reading was developed to understand the place of a CML in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> literacy. Existing published research was used initially to set the context of the study, and then as data throughout the project. Published and recognised theories about literacy development, learning, and well-being were consulted at relevant points during the research. Analytical reports of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> library services, practitioner handbooks and professional magazines were searched along with unpublished documents provided by library authorities. Issues that were raised from these sources included: the role of untrained library staff; supplying library services to the socially excluded; working with other agencies and the use of reading intervention schemes. The history, function, purpose and definition of CMLs were outlined.

40|$|Introduction: The {{right to}} {{adequate}} food is protected in {{international human rights}} law, yet {{millions of people are}} suffering from malnutrition worldwide. Children and adolescents living in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes are considered a vulnerable group. Malnutrition in the girl child is of particular concern since it has intergenerational consequences. Little is known about the nutritional status of adolescent girls living in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City, Uganda. A cross-sectional study is an important first step to identify the main nutritional challenges in order to intervene appropriately. Aim: The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess the nutritional status of adolescent girls in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City, by evaluating anthropometric indicators, assessing body composition and investigating dietary patterns. Subjects and methods: A total of 44 girls aged 10 – 19 years living at five <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes participated in the study. A reference group consisted of 27 adolescent girls from three boarding schools in Kampala City. Height and weight were measured to assess the proportion of girls who were stunted, thin, overweight or obese. Body composition data was obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Dietary intake was evaluated with a Food Frequency Questionnaire, calculation of dietary diversity score (DDS) and a 24 -hour dietary recall. Results: Adolescent girls in selected <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City suffered from stunting, overweight or obesity, and were at risk of insufficient intakes of multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids. Dietary diversity was low with a median score of 3 out of 9 food groups. Animal products were rarely consumed. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> home participants appeared especially at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins A, B 12, C, D, E and calcium. Median estimated intake of vitamins B 12 and D were zero. The adequacy of the diet in terms of energy, macronutrients and micronutrients varied among the different <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes, and within the various homes. At two of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes the girls consumed a more adequate diet compared to the reference group, whereas three homes consumed a less adequate diet compared to the reference group. Conclusion: Malnutrition was apparent among <b>children</b> <b>s</b> home participants, manifested as stunting, overweight or obesity. The girls are likely to suffer from inadequate intake of essential fatty acids and multiple micronutrient deficiencies, especially vitamin B 12...|$|R
40|$|Five {{spontaneous}} narratives from 10 12 -year-olds conversations are analysed to {{show how}} they contribute to the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> ongoing construction of knowledge and identity. A Labovian analysis of the evaluative function of narrative is supplemented with ethnographic research and Bakhtin and Volosinov s work, to demonstrate more dynamic and complex processes in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> talk. It is argued that the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> use of reported speech drives both the referential and the evaluative functions of their narratives. The <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reproduction and framing of other people s and their own voices enables them to explore the different perspectives of characters within the story, and also to comment on and evaluate these perspectives. The stories are orientated towards listeners and previous conversational turns, and they also set up intertextual connections with other stories and other conversations, to create additional connotations and layers of meaning. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> narratives revisit particular themes and preoccupations, for example toughness and gentleness, their emerging new gendered identities and relationships, and their changing relations with parents and other authority figures. In this sense, a narrrative {{may be seen as}} a turn in a more meta-level long conversation, carried on among children across different interactions and settings...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to extend the knowledge and deepen the understanding of care-givers management of child allergy, especially of suspected food allergy. This is done by describing and exploring how parents with children who have exclusion diets at school discover and responds to their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> allergy-related problems. The first study focuses on the whole group of children (n 230) with special diets at school {{from the viewpoint of}} parents knowledge and management of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems. It addresses questions regarding (1) whether or not the children have had contact with health care, (2) {{whether or not they were}} diagnosed with food allergy, (3) to what extent they had other allergies, (4) what characterized their food-related symptoms, (5) if these symptoms were consistent with the clinical experience of food allergy (6) and any differences in parents reports of the extent of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food-related problems in regard to whether they had sought health care or not. The results showed that the majority of parents had consulted doctors for their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems, and most children had been diagnosed by a doctor. Most children also had other allergies or asthma in addition to their food-related problems. The <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food-related problems were consistent with the clinical experience of food allergy. Parents who had sought medical aid for their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems described more extensive and potentially life-threatening (e. g. anaphylactic) symptoms than did the parents who had not sought professional help. Overall, the characteristics of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> symptoms were similar in both groups and were considerable enough to explain why they avoided certain foods and had exclusion diets at school. The second study addresses the question of how parents discovered developing bodily symptoms when the children were young, how they interpreted and responded to the problems before they decided to seek professional medical help and how they came to the decision to seek help. Nineteen parents were interviewed about the problem-solving process consisting of two temporal phases: (1) the pre-problem phase, or the period before the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> problems had emerged, (2) and the emerging phase where bodily problems were discovered and managed differently depending on the emerging nature of the problem that were either (2. a) acute (airway problems) or (2. b) more gradually appearing (stomach problems and eczema) in the families everyday lives. To understand and manage the time period before the child was born, before he/she had developed any symptoms and the phase when the symptoms emerged, parents used different self-diagnostic techniques and methods. They experimented with different temporal and situational clues that eventually led them to explain their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> symptoms as indicating something wrong, and not as normal <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems, as they had first thought. Only when parents could not fully explain the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> symptoms or make the problems disappear or improve, did they often seek medical advice or care at the child health care centre. The wide-ranging knowledge and experience parents have of their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> allergies are a result of their active strategies and by reinforcing themselves as active and in control they also demonstrated their moral responsibility as parents. The fact that the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> whole lifetime and different temporal contexts are used by the parents in their decisions about seeking professional help, eating habits and exclusion diet at school is an important factor that has to be considered in clinical practice. Health care professionals have to listen to what parents have done before seeking medical help, who they are and how they want to be seen by others because this would improve the communication between parents and health professionals as well as the parents satisfaction with health care...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} {{that one of the most}} {{contentious}} terrains of contestation in the supposed clash of values between Islamism and western values is the role of women in society. Thus, the issue of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> has become the litmus test for Arab societies with respect to the current zeitgeist of human rights in the age of democracy and liberalism. There is today a stereotypical view of debates surrounding women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> in the Arab world where two distinct camps are in conflict with each other. On the one hand there are 2 ̆ 7 globalised 2 ̆ 7 liberal and secular actors that strive for women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> and therefore democracy, while on the other are obscurantist movements that are anchored in religious tradition, resist globalisation and are therefore autocratic by assumption. This article challenges this view and through an empirical study of the changes to the Code of Personal Status in Tunisia and Morocco it demonstrates that the issue of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> is far more complex and, in particular, it finds that there is a very significant decoupling between women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> and democracy in the region, despite a progressive liberal shift in the gender equality agenda...|$|R
