5|$|Washington State Route 221 (SR221) {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with SR14 in the unincorporated community of Paterson. After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two-lane highway. A few minor roads are intersected before the roadway {{turns to the}} west after about , before {{turning back to the}} north. After the highway resumes its northerly course it <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Horse Heaven Hills, gaining a passing lane through the uphill segments, before finally terminating at SR22 in south Prosser.|$|E
5|$|In Andy's room, Woody <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{box with}} Andy's college supplies, {{while the other}} toys ready {{themselves}} for the attic. Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, takes the toys to Bonnie's house, and introduces her to them. Bonnie recognizes Woody, who, to Andy's surprise, {{is at the bottom}} of the box. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and then plays with her before leaving. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie. Meanwhile, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside, and maintain contact with Woody and his friends through letters.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 {{begins at}} the Uhlerstown-Frenchtown Bridge over the Delaware River in Frenchtown at the Pennsylvania/ New Jersey border, where it connects to Pennsylvania Route 32. The bridge and short portion of its eastern {{approach}} is maintained by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. The route continues through the downtown area of Frenchtown as county-maintained (designated and signed by Hunterdon County as County Route 610) two-lane undivided Bridge Street. Here, it intersects Trenton Avenue {{which is also the}} northern terminus of Route 29 before turning north onto Race Street and intersecting the southern terminus of CR 513. Route 12 heads east on Kingwood Avenue and passes through residential areas. The route crosses into Kingwood Township, where it becomes maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. As Route 12 <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Hunterdon Plateau, it heads through a mix of woods and farms with intermittent residences, narrowing to one lane in each direction {{at the top of the}} plateau before crossing CR 519 in Baptistown.|$|E

5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E
25|$|Tim then {{fills the}} motel bathtub with ice water to {{preserve}} his vital organs, calls 9-1-1 emergency and reports his own suicide, <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tub, and releases his box jellyfish into the water with him. The jellyfish wraps its tentacles around his arm, causing a quick but excruciatingly painful death.|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{the doctor}} goes blind as well. Around the city, more {{citizens}} are struck blind, causing widespread panic, {{and the government}} organizes a quarantine for the blind in a derelict asylum. When a hazmat crew arrives {{to pick up the}} doctor, his wife <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> van, lying that she has gone blind in order to accompany him.|$|E

25|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of {{fatalities}} caused by the pogrom have varied. Early reports estimated that 91 Jewish people were murdered during the attacks. Modern analysis of German scholarly sources by historians such as Richard J. Evans puts the number much higher. When deaths from post-arrest maltreatment and subsequent suicides are included, the death toll <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hundreds. Additionally, 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and incarcerated in concentration camps.|$|E
25|$|East of Cazenovia, US20 resumes its southward drift as it <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{high ground}} again and expands to four lanes, passing the small village of Morrisville in the process. It descends {{from there to}} its next state highway, NY46, where it reverts to two lanes for a brief concurrency, after which NY46 leaves for {{isolated}} Hamilton. The southern trend reverses itself after this junction, with first NY26 and later NY12B joining US20 to create another three-route overlap. This persists for three very straight miles until both leave to the north {{in the town of}} Madison. After another , the highway crosses into Oneida County.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Range is {{the range}} of tall, biodiverse hills across the {{northern}} portion of Trinidad and is considered {{an extension of the}} Andes mountains of South America, although that is geologically incorrect. Over 465 species of birds, and 100 species of mammals can be found in these mountains, {{making it one of the}} most biodiverse mountain ranges in the Caribbean. The Northern Range runs from the Chaguaramas Peninsula in the west to Toco in the east and consists mainly of steeply dipping metasedimentary rocks and lush rainforest containing a wide variety of plants and animal species. Port of Spain lies at the western end and the city <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hills and valleys which are settled and largely deforested. The two tallest peaks are El Cerro del Aripo and El Tucuche which top 900 m (3,000ft).|$|E

500|$|Victorin Hulot {{is later}} visited by the Prince of Wissembourg, who {{delivers}} news of economic good fortune. The Marshal, {{prior to his}} death, had made arrangements for repayment of the Baron's debts, as well as employment for Adeline in a Catholic charity. Baron Hulot has disappeared, and Adeline spends her free time searching for him in houses of ill repute. She eventually finds him living with a fifteen-year-old courtesan, and begs {{him to return to}} the family. He agrees, but as he <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> carriage, Hulot asks: [...] "mais pourrai-je emmener la petite?" [...] ("But can I take the girl?") The Hulot home is reunited for a time, and Bette's fury at their apparent happiness hastens her death. One evening after the funeral, Adeline overhears Hulot seducing a kitchen maid named Agathe. On her deathbed, Adeline delivers her first rebuke to her husband: [...] "ans un moment, tu seras libre, et tu pourras faire une baronne Hulot." [...] ("In a moment, you will be free, and you can make another Baroness Hulot.") Soon after burying his wife, Hulot marries Agathe.|$|E
500|$|Hours later, Shona re-enters {{the room}} with English [...] Hugo (Whitehall). The pair sit on 9C and share a can of Carling while {{swapping}} travel stories. Hugo says he would rather stay in this carriage than in first class, and the pair begin foreplay. A face appears from 9B, and a man (Glaves) falls to the floor. The carriage's inhabitants wake; Maxwell confirms that the man is dead, then leaves {{to look for a}} guard. Jorg finds a family photo in the man's pocket. Maxwell returns alone, and Jorg suggests they use the emergency stop button; Les prepares to smash the glass. Hugo stops him, confessing he is ticketless, Maxwell says he has an interview with the WHO in the morning, and Les, to Kath's annoyance, confesses that {{he does not want to}} risk missing the wedding. Maxwell explains the situation to Jorg, Les and Kath argue, and Shona refuses to let Hugo back into her bunk. Maxwell gives Jorg some tablets for his constipation, after which Shona offers a eulogy. The body is placed into 9B, and Hugo <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> same bunk. The passengers settle, but Kath lies sleepless.|$|E

2500|$|Another aspect was {{the fluid}} writing and {{directing}} with Annakin and Davies feeding off each other. They had {{worked together on}} Very Important Person (1961), The Fast Lady (1962) and Crooks Anonymous (1962). Annakin and Davies continued to develop the script with zany interpretations. When the German character, Gert Fröbe, contemplates piloting his country's entry, he <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cockpit and retrieves a manual. Annakin and Davies devised a quip on the spot, having him read out: [...] "No. 1. Sit down." [...] Although a comedy, elements of Annakin's documentary background were evident with authentic sets, props and costumes. More than 2,000 extras out in authentic costumes were in the climactic race launch which was combined with entrants in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run being invited on set {{as part of their}} 1964 annual run, an unexpected coup in gaining numerous period vehicles to dress the set.|$|E
2500|$|The {{breeding}} {{of the southern}} hairy-nosed wombat occurs when their favoured food is at its peak growth rates. Their reproduction relies on the winter rainfall, which germinates the grasses. Between August and October, when rainfall is sufficient, females enter ovulation and the males' testosterone levels and prostate gland sizes increase. In years of low rainfall, neither occurs. When breeding, dominance hierarchies among males are established through aggression. Copulation {{takes place in the}} warren, with males remaining in one burrow and females moving among them. Mating takes place underground and involves the male mounting the female from behind while she is on her side. The gestation period of the wombat lasts 22days and most births occur in October. When a young is born, it <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pouch and clings to a teat. It stays in the pouch for six months growing to around 0.45kg, with a light pelage and open eyes. [...] It soon leaves the pouch and starts grazing at the surface. The young is fully weaned when it is a year old and reaches full size at the age of three years, which is also when it becomes sexually mature.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Our Ideal Citizen--I {{picture him}} first and {{foremost}} as being busier than a bird-dog, not wasting {{a lot of good}} time in day-dreaming or going to sassiety teas or kicking about things that are none of his business, but putting the zip into some store or profession or art. At night he lights up a good cigar, and <b>climbs</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little old 'bus, and maybe cusses the carburetor, and shoots out home. He mows the lawn, or sneaks in some practice putting, and then he's ready for dinner. After dinner he tells the kiddies a story, or takes the family to the movies, or plays a few fists of bridge, or reads the evening paper, and a chapter or two of some good lively Western novel if he has a taste for literature, and maybe the folks next-door drop in and they sit and visit about their friends and the topics of the day. Then he goes happily to bed, his conscience clear, having contributed his mite to the prosperity of the city and to his own bank-account.|$|E
