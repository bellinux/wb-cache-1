25|$|In analog {{frequency}} modulation, such as FM {{radio broadcasting}} of an audio signal representing voice or music, the instantaneous frequency deviation, {{the difference between}} the frequency of the carrier and its <b>center</b> <b>frequency,</b> is proportional to the modulating signal.|$|E
25|$|White {{noise is}} a random signal (or process) {{with a flat}} power {{spectral}} density. In other words, the signal contains equal power within a fixed bandwidth at any <b>center</b> <b>frequency.</b> White noise is considered analogous to white light which contains all frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Typically, the IF <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> fIF {{is chosen}} {{to be less than}} the desired {{reception}} frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it is easier and less expensive to get high selectivity at a lower frequency. For the same bandwidth, a tuned circuit at a lower frequency needs a lower Q. Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth. Second, it is easier and less expensive to get high gain at a lower frequency. When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gain–bandwidth product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gain–bandwidth product of 100MHz, then it would have a voltage gain of 100 at 1MHz but only 10 at 10MHz. If the IF amplifier needed a voltage gain of 10,000, then it would need only two stages with an IF at 1MHz but four stages at 10MHz.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Crown {{patented}} the synergistic equalizer, {{releasing the}} stereo EQ-2 graphic equalizer which used {{a combination of}} shelving filters and eleven active frequency adjustment faders per channel. The faders were connected to constant bandwidth, variable Q, 1/2-octave filters placed on octave centers but with adjustable frequency knobs to shift the <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> for greater flexibility. A limited number of units were sold to audiophiles and audio researchers.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{began in}} mid-1960, with the {{official}} opening on November 1, 1963. As the primary dish is spherical, its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as {{would be the case}} for a parabolic reflector. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line feed covered a narrow frequency band: 2–5% of the <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.|$|E

Open signals L1OC and L2OC use time-division multiplexing to transmit pilot and data signals, with BPSK(1) modulation for data and BOC(1,1) modulation for pilot; wide-band restricted signals L1SC and L2SC use BOC (5, 2.5) modulation for both data and pilot, transmitted in quadrature phase {{to the open}} signals; this places peak signal strength away from the <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> of narrow-band open signals.|$|E
25|$|In North America, UHF {{can be used}} {{unlicensed}} for 902–928MHz (±13MHz {{from the}} 915MHz <b>center</b> <b>frequency),</b> but restrictions exist for transmission power. In Europe, RFID and other low-power radio applications are regulated by ETSI recommendations EN 300 220 and EN 302 208, and ERO recommendation 70 03, allowing RFID operation with somewhat complex band restrictions from 865–868MHz. Readers are required to monitor a channel before transmitting ("Listen Before Talk"); this requirement has led to some restrictions on performance, the resolution {{of which is a}} subject of current research. The North American UHF standard is not accepted in France as it interferes with its military bands. On July 25, 2012, Japan changed its UHF band to 920MHz, more closely matching the United States’ 915MHz band.|$|E
25|$|When {{either side}} of the {{transformer}} is a tuned circuit, the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the Q factor of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an RLC circuit with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as double-tuned. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of k. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands. This is known as overcoupling.|$|E

According to our findings, an 802.15. 4 radio does not interfere with an 802.11 b receiver if their <b>center</b> <b>frequencies</b> are separated by at least 17 MHz. If the <b>center</b> <b>frequencies</b> are separated by 12 MHz, the interference from the 802.15. 4 radio on the 802.11 receiver is still negligible.

2500|$|The {{stages of}} an {{intermediate}} frequency amplifier ("IF amplifier" [...] or [...] "IF strip") are tuned to a fixed frequency {{that does not}} change as the receiving frequency changes. The fixed frequency simplifies optimization of the IF amplifier. The IF amplifier is selective around its <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> fIF. The fixed <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> allows the stages of the IF amplifier to be carefully tuned for best performance (this tuning is called [...] "aligning" [...] the IF amplifier). If the <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> changed with the receiving frequency, then the IF stages {{would have had to}} track their tuning. That is not the case with the superheterodyne.|$|E

2500|$|In Weaver's method, {{the band}} of {{interest}} is first translated to be centered at zero, conceptually by modulating a complex exponential [...] with frequency {{in the middle of}} the voiceband, but implemented by a quadrature pair of sine and cosine modulators at that frequency (e.g. 2kHz). [...] This complex signal or pair of real signals is then lowpass filtered to remove the undesired sideband that is not centered at zero.

2500|$|The signals use similar DSSS {{encoding}} and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation as in GPS signals. All GLONASS satellites {{transmit the}} same code as their standard-precision signal; however each transmits {{on a different}} frequency using a 15-channel frequency division multiple access (FDMA) technique spanning either side from 1602.0 MHz, known as the L1 band. The <b>center</b> <b>frequency</b> is 1602MHz + n × 0.5625MHz, where n is a satellite's frequency channel number (n=−7,−6,−5,...0,...,6, previously n=0,...,13).

[...] Note that the 24-satellite constellation is accommodated with only 15 channels by using identical frequency channels to support antipodal (opposite side of planet in orbit) satellite pairs, as these satellites are never both in view of an earth-based user at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|To {{suppress}} the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF {{stage and the}} LO may need to [...] "track" [...] each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF <b>center</b> <b>frequency.</b> For example, a typical AM broadcast band receiver covers 510kHz to 1655kHz (a roughly 1160kHz input band) with a 455kHz IF frequency; an FM broadcast band receiver covers 88MHz to 108MHz band with a 10.7MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band receiver LO were set at 1200kHz, it would see stations at both 745kHz (1200455kHz) and 1655kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking {{can be done with}} a multi-section variable capacitor or some varactors driven by a common control voltage. An RF amplifier may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.|$|E
