5|$|Unlike {{conventional}} <b>classroom</b> <b>learning,</b> {{in which}} a teacher lectures to the student and the student memorizes and repeats the information back in tests, and unlike an academic seminary, where students do independent research, chavrusa learning challenges the student to analyze and verbally explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely {{new insights into the}} meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for <b>classroom</b> <b>learning.</b> Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E

Field studies are student-funded, teacher-led activities lasting between 6 and 12 days in locations around the world. Some studies, such as the Winter Expedition, The American Outback, and the Spring BWCAW, focus on personal growth and wilderness settings. Others examine environments in distant parts of the world such as Alaska, Iceland, Glacier National Park, Scotland, Costa Rica, Belize, France, Spain, Southern California and others. Another type partners with Wilderness Inquiry to provide a more blended experience: New Zealand, Australia, South Africa.|$|E

Students in early childhood and junior kindergarten have shared tablets available, and each kindergarten through the fourth group class has at least four. Students study in classrooms equipped with wireless overhead projectors, manipulate programs and presentations on touchscreen-equipped SMART board systems, and engage in self-paced <b>classroom</b> <b>learning</b> using ActiveExpression wireless response systems. Students, teachers, and parents communicate and interact online via a school-wide intranet and an extranet for parents. Sixteen dual platform iMacs were added in 2009 for computer lab work.|$|E

2500|$|The overt or {{explicit}} {{curriculum in}} education {{is designed to}} meet the inferred needs of students, as they are those identified by teachers or individuals to improve the <b>classroom</b> <b>learning</b> environment. [...] In the ethics of care philosophy, inferred needs are referred to as those that come from those not directly expressing the need. [...] Most needs identified by educators for learners are inferred needs because they are not being identified by the learners themselves. Studentsâ€™ inferred needs can often be identified interactively, through working with them one on one or observing their behaviour in a classroom environment.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} several more recent cases {{involving}} protests for the banning of the novel. In 2003, high school student Calista Phair and her grandmother, Beatrice Clark, in Renton, Washington, proposed banning the book from <b>classroom</b> <b>learning</b> in the Renton School District, though not from any public libraries, because of the word [...] "nigger". Clark filed a request with the school district {{in response to the}} required reading of the book, asking for the novel to be removed from the English curriculum. The two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the 11th grade curriculum, though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novel's controversial topics.|$|E
2500|$|According to Chesterton and Green and others, the {{original}} purpose of [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] was to satirise both pretentious verse and ignorant literary critics. It {{was designed as}} verse showing how not to write verse, but eventually {{became the subject of}} pedestrian translation or explanation and incorporated into <b>classroom</b> <b>learning.</b> It has also been interpreted as a parody of contemporary Oxford scholarship and specifically the story of how Benjamin Jowett, the notoriously agnostic Professor of Greek at Oxford, and Master of Balliol, came to sign the Thirty-Nine Articles, as an Anglican statement of faith, to save his job. The transformation of audience perception from satire to seriousness was in a large part predicted by G. K. Chesterton, who wrote in 1932, [...] "Poor, poor, little Alice! She has not only been caught and made to do lessons; she has been forced to inflict lessons on others." ...|$|E
