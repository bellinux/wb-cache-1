25|$|Holmium oxide {{is one of}} the {{colorants}} {{used for}} cubic zirconia and glass, providing yellow or red coloring. Glass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions (usually in perchloric acid) have sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range 200-900nm. They are therefore used as a <b>calibration</b> <b>standard</b> for optical spectrophotometers and are available commercially. As most other oxides of rare-earth elements, holmium oxide is used as a specialty catalyst, phosphor and a laser material. Holmium laser operates at wavelength of about 2.08 micrometres, either in pulsed or continuous regime. This laser is eye safe and is used in medicine, LIDARs, wind velocity measurements and atmosphere monitoring.|$|E

25|$|Holmium(III) oxide, or holmium oxide is a {{chemical}} compound of a rare-earth element holmium and oxygen with the formula Ho2O3. Together with dysprosium(III) oxide (Dy2O3) holmium oxide {{is one of}} the most powerfully paramagnetic substances known. The oxide, also called holmia, occurs as a component of the related erbium oxide mineral called erbia. Typically the oxides of the trivalent lanthanides coexist in nature and separation of these components requires specialized methods. Holmium oxide is used in making specialty colored glasses. Glass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions have a series of sharp optical absorption peaks in the visible spectral range. They are therefore traditionally used as a convenient <b>calibration</b> <b>standard</b> for optical spectrophotometers.|$|E

40|$|Currently, no formal, written, {{consensus}} <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> {{exist for}} radon/radon decay product measurement instrumentation. Furthermore, {{the majority of}} radon measurement firms or laboratories depend heavily on the EPA's Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program for establishing the "accuracy " of their radon measurements. Traceability of radon measurements to National Standard radiation sources and/or instruments, in many cases, exists only through the RMP program. Establishing a de facto National Standard for radon was not the intended purpose of the RMP Program. There are both 1.) no written, consensus, <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> for radon/radon decay product instrumentation, and 2.) few radiation standard sources and/or instruments in use by the radon industry. This is an unacceptable situation from a technical and legal point of view. This paper examines the shortcomings of the current system and outlines a proposed, organized system of instrument <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> and laboratory intercomparisons. This proposed system utilizes written, consensus, <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> and radiation standard sources and/or instruments traceable to standards maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

2500|$|Crystal field {{splitting}} {{is rather}} {{small for the}} lanthanide ions and {{is less important than}} spin-orbit coupling in regard to energy levels. Transitions of electrons between f orbitals are forbidden by the Laporte rule. Furthermore, because of the [...] "buried" [...] nature of the f orbitals, coupling with molecular vibrations is weak. Consequently, the spectra of lanthanide ions are rather weak and the absorption bands are similarly narrow.

2500|$|One {{effect of}} {{defining}} the Celsius scale at the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW, 273.16K and 0.01°C), and at absolute zero (0K and −273.15°C), {{is that neither}} the melting nor boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere (101.325kPa) remains a defining point for the Celsius scale. In 1948 when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in Resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point {{was so close to}} being 0.01°C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as precisely 0.01°C. However, current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of VSMOW is actually very slightly (<0.001nbsp&°C) greater than 0.01nbsp&°C. Thus, the actual melting point of ice is very slightly (less than a thousandth of a degree) below 0nbsp&°C. Also, defining water's triple point at 273.16nbsp&K precisely defined the magnitude of each 1nbsp&°C increment in terms of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale (referencing absolute zero). Now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water, the value [...] "100nbsp&°C" [...] is hotter than 0nbsp&°C – in absolute terms – by a factor of precisely [...] (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering strictly to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339nbsp&K (99.9839nbsp&°C). When calibrated to ITS-90 (a <b>calibration</b> <b>standard</b> comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW is slightly less, about 99.974nbsp&°C.|$|E

40|$|Calibration and {{correction}} {{methods for}} the Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) {{are based on}} the fundamental assumption of the constant error model, which is independent of connected <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> and/or devices under test (DUT). Unfortunately, this assumption is not satisfied well for planar <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> fabricated by etching technology on soft substrates. An evaluation of the error model is affected especially by variations in the manufacturing process and also by the reproducibility of an assembly. In this paper, we propose error minimization by selecting the best combination of available <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> based on time domain reflection (TDR) measurement, which can also be obtained by the fourier transformation from the measured S-parameters. The proposed method was verified experimentally using short, open, load and thru (SOLT) standards fabricated on an FR 4 laminate substrate which achieves the essential reduction of the measurement error in the frequency range up to 15 GHz. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of quantitative X-ray fluorescence analysis {{is dependent on}} a set of <b>calibration</b> <b>standards.</b> There are two approaches for producing borate glass calibration standards: (1) use certified Standard Reference Materials, (SRMs) or (2) make <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> from highpurity reagent grade chemicals. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method of standard fabrication. SRMs are easier to use but you must rely on the certification data and evaluate the standard deviations of the measurements. Making standards from high-purity reagent grade chemicals allows you to customize your concentration ranges to fit your specific needs, but having to weigh multiple reagents increases the chance for errors. To compare the two approaches, a set of NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Portland cement standards were made and a set of <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> mirroring the NIST SRMs were made using high-purity reagent grade materials.
