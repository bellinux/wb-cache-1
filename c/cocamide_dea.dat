40|$|Context. During {{the late}} 1990 s, {{insecticide}} resistance had rendered {{a number of}} treatment products ineffective; some companies saw {{this as an opportunity}} to develop alternative types of treatment. We investigated the possibility that a surfactant-based lotion containing 10 % cocamide diethanolamine (<b>cocamide</b> <b>DEA)</b> was effective to eliminate head louse infestation. Settings and Design. Initial in vitro testing of the lotion formulation versus laboratory reared body/clothing lice, followed by two randomised, controlled, community-based, assessor blinded, clinical studies. Materials and Methods. Preliminary laboratory tests were performed by exposing lice or louse eggs to the product using a method that mimicked the intended use. Clinical Study 1 : Children and adults with confirmed head louse infestation were treated by investigators using a single application of aqueous 10 % <b>cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> lotion applied for 60 min followed by shampooing or a single 1 % permethrin creme rinse treatment applied to pre-washed hair for 10 min. Clinical Study 2 : Compared two treatment regimens using 10 % <b>cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> lotion that was concentrated by hair drying. A single application left on for 8 h/overnight was compared with two applications 7 days apart of 2 h duration, followed by a shampoo wash. Results. The initial laboratory tests showed a pediculicidal effect for a 60 min application but limited ovicidal effect. A longer application time of 8 h or overnight was found capable of killing all eggs but this differed between batches of test material. Clinical Study 1 : Both treatments performed badly with only 3 / 23 (13 %) successful treatments using <b>cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> and 5 / 25 (23. 8 %) using permethrin. Clinical Study 2 : The single overnight application of <b>cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> concentrated by hair drying gave 10 / 56 (17. 9 %) successes compared with 19 / 56 (33. 9 %) for the 2 h application regimen repeated after 1 week. Intention to treat analysis showed no significant difference (p = 0. 0523) between the treatments. Over the two studies, there were 18 adverse events possibly or probably associated with treatment, most of which were increased pruritus after treatment.

The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel considered new data and information from previous CIR reports to assess the concerns about the potential for amidases in human skin to convert these diethanolamides into DEA and the corresponding fatty acids. The Expert Panel concluded that these diethanolamides are safe as used when formulated to be nonirritating and when the levels of free DEA in the diethanolamides do not exceed those considered safe by the Panel.

The traditional ways of breaking emulsion using heat and chemicals are disadvantageous from both economic and environmental prospective. In this thesis, a new natural demulsifier knowing as “Cocamine MEA” {{in addition to an}} alternative energy potentials of microwave-assisted chemical approach were utilized and investigated in the demulsification of water-in-crude oil emulsion. Two types of crude oils were used, namely; crude oils A, and B. The study begun with some characterization studies to provide understanding of fundamental issues such as formation and characterization of the emulsion upon which further development on demulsification process could be achieved. The aim was to evaluate the performance of the new natural demulsifier compare with the existing demulsfiers as well as to obtain an optimized operating conditions of the demulsification process. For the stability performance test, three non-ionic emulsifiers were used, namely; Triton X- 100, Span 80, and <b>Cocamide</b> <b>DEA.</b> Among these emulsifiers, Span 80 and <b>Cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> permit the highest stability for the prepared emulsion. For the chemical demulsification performance test, six emulsifiers having different properties were utilized, namely: Octylamine, Hexylamine, Dioctylamine, Cocamine MEA, Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 600), and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 1000). Among these demulsifiers, Octylamine was found to be the best in separating water and oil phases (90 - 100 %) followed by Hexylamine (80 - 90 %) for emulsion based on Span 80 at different phase ratios, respectively. Meanwhile, Cocamine MEA at the dose of 1 vol. % was found to be the best in separating water and oil phases (90 - 100 %) followed by Octylamine and Hexylamine (90 - 100 %) at the dose of 1. 5 vol. % for emulsion based on <b>Cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> at different phase ratios. However, Dioctylamine, PEG 1000, and PEG 600 promote the monophase separation in separating the emulsion. Optimization of the microwave-assisted chemical demulsification using Face Centered Central Composite Design (FCCCD) under Response Surface Methodology found that Octylamine (1. 5 vol. %) promotes a superior effect on demulsification rate of different types of emulsion, the exposure time (0. 5 - 8) minutes and the MW power (270 - 360) watt were the most significant factors at different types of emulsion that consist with lower demulsifier utility, crude oil A emulsions needed higher MW power to separate the two phases. Based on the optimum conditions, the demulsification rate was accelerated by achieving a complete water separation for most types of emulsions. Characterizing the microwave generation and absorption at the optimum conditions showed that the w/o emulsion heated uniformly and deeply by long microwaves with less energy consumption. Results obtained in this thesis have exposed the potential application of Cocamine MEA as a natural composite for demulsification the water-in-crude oil emulsion. Moreover, results proved the capability of microwave-assisted chemical technology in developing the demulsification of w/o emulsions.

An environmentally friendly, nonionic emulsifying agent for crude oil emulsions Cocamide diethanolamine (<b>Cocamide</b> <b>DEA)</b> is introduced in the present work. The emulsion formation, rheology, stability and water separation performance of the DEA emulsifier was tested and compared with the commercially known Span 83 non-ionic emulsifier. Water content (30, 40 and 50 vol. %), emulsifier molecular weight, emulsifier concentration (0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 vol. %) were the major variables investigated. The formulated emulsions viscosities and shear stress were measured at different operating temperatures (28 to 90 °C) and different spindle rotation speeds (50 to 200). The experimental results showed that, for all the emulsion formed, the viscosity of the emulsion increases by increasing the water content and emulsifier concentration and decreases by increasing the rotation speed. The viscosity measurements were not constant with the spindle speed which confirms the non-Newtonian nature of the formulated emulsions. Finally, the experimental results showed that the emulsions formulated using the DEA emulsifier were more stable than the Span 83 emulsions where the water separation time was longer and the water separation percentage was lower...|$|E

40|$|Formation of {{emulsions}} during {{oil production}} and processing is a costly problem, {{both in terms}} of chemicals used and production losses. It is necessary to separate the water completely from the crude oils before transporting to refinery. Traditional ways of breaking emulsions using heat and chemicals are disadvantageous from both economic and environmental perspectives. In this thesis, an alternative and multiple frequency energy potential of ultrasonic-assisted chemicals (environmental friendly) in demulsification of water-in-crude oil emulsions were utilized and investigated. Two types of crude oils were used namely; (Tapis and Miri crude oils). The study begun with some characterization studies to provide understanding of fundamental issues such as formation, formulation and breaking of emulsions by both chemicals and ultrasonic approaches. The aim was to obtain optimized operating conditions as well as fundamental understanding of water-in-oil stability, upon which further development of the demulsification process could be developed. The stability studies were carried out by analyzing operating conditions such as surfactant concentration, surfactant type, oil type, temperature and water-oil ratio (30 - 50 %). For stability performance test, four emulsifiers were used namely; Triton X- 100, Span 83, <b>Cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> and SDDS. It was found that there exist a correlation between these factors and emulsion stability. Among these, emulsion stabilized by <b>cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> was the best and followed by Span 83, SDDS and Triton X- 100 respectively. For chemical emulsification performance test, five types of demulsifies with different functional groups were utilized; these are Hexylamine, Dioctylamine, Cocamine, Polyethylene Glycol, PEG 1000 and PEG 600. Among these; Hexylamine was found to be the best in separating water and oil from emulsions (88 %) and followed by cocamine (81 %), Dioctylamine (79 %), PEG 1000 (76 %) and PEG 600 (70 %). For ultrasonic forces (3, 5, 7 and 9) applied for emulsion breaking, results were significantly enhanced the separation time and amount of water separated. Results showed that, ultrasonic power, 9 and Hexylamine (1. 0 %) in demulsifying the crude oil A stabilized by Span 83 with maximum water separation of 96 % after 150 min. Also, and within the same operating conditions mentioned above, a maximum water separation up to 99 % was achieved with crude oil B. The other investigated demulsifiers with ultrasonic force showed also high water separation percentages such as cocamine (1. 0 %) emulsifier with 91 % and 93 % for crude oils A and B emulsions respectively. The results obtained in this thesis have exposed the capability of ultrasonic-assisted chemicals technology in demulsification of W/O emulsions.

In this study, the dynamic viscosity and rheological properties of water-oil two phase flow were investigated using emulsion and blending with lighter crude oil approaches at different water volume fractions. Water-in-oil emulsion stabilized by (1. 5 vol. %) of <b>Cocamide</b> <b>DEA</b> was considered in the study. Two samples of crude oil were used: Heavy crude oil, and heavylight blended crude oil at (60 - 40) vol. %. The dynamic viscosity was determined by Brokfeild Rotational Digital Viscometer Model LV/DV-III. Factors that affect the emulsion rheologyical properties: temperature, rotational speed, shear rate, shear stress, and water volume fractionwas inspected. Results showed that the water-in-heavy oil emulsion approach resulted in reducing the viscosity of original crude oil about (14 %) and characterized the Non-Newtonian shear thinning “pseudo-plastic” behavior. On the other hand, the second approach of blending with (40 vol. %) of lighter crude oil showed that the viscosity and the density were significantlyreduced to (93. 6 %), and (5. 7 %) at 30 ͦ C, respectively. However, water-in- blended crude oil emulsion followed the same behavior of the original crude oil emulsion under the same factors and conditions.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the risks posed by {{cosmetic}} products {{can also be}} larger compared with other consumer products due to the following reasons: (1) Repeated exposure increases the hazard ([1] Annex VI Part 1 1.2. 1.), which is clearly the case for cosmetic products since {{many of them are}} used daily, such as tooth paste, soap or shower gel. (2) Cosmetic products are applied intentionally directly on the body surface and lead therefore to a higher exposure compared with most other consumer products. Leave-on products such as lotions or decorative cosmetics should be differentiated from rinse-off products such as shower gels or shampoos. (3) Most consumers use several cosmetic products, not only one single product everyday, which increases the exposure. (4) Solvents in cosmetic products increase fat solubility and therefore skin penetration. (5) Combined exposure of an allergen with a detergent e.g. in washing liquids can increase the allergic reaction [19]. (5) There are further interactions of substances, e.g. musk compounds are known to inhibit cellular xenobiotic export systems [17]. (6) Cross-reaction is known e.g. for some fragrances which are contact allergens [18, 19]. (7) Many ingredients are not stable, especially in light and at warm temperatures. The metabolites can be more toxic than the original compounds. An example for this case is D-Limonene with a low allergenic potency that can be oxidized by air to strong allergens [20 – 22]. Further examples are carcinogenic nitrosamines which can be contaminants or reaction products of triethanolamin and <b>Cocamide</b> <b>DEA,</b> frequently used components in decorative eye cosmetics [23]. Cosmetics have been demonstrated to be the cause of contact allergies and many of them contain acids, bases, inorganic salts, aldehydes, and surfactants, substances which can be corrosive or irritant at concentrations < 1 % and would need to be considered with special care according to the CLP Regulation ([1] 3.2. 3.3. 4.1). (9) Cosmetic products are mainly discharged via waste water. Therefore, their toxicity to aquatic organisms is of greater relevance than for many other consumer products. (10) The products under scrutiny here correspond to the Cosmetic Regulation [6]. However, not all products in the retail shops comply with the requirements laid down there. Many products have to be withdrawn from the market because the levels of hydroquinone, methyl metacrylate, carbamide peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, di-n-butyl-phthalate, di(2 -ethylhexyl)phthalate or heavy metals were too high [24]. It {{is interesting to note that}} microbiological contamination is another frequent reason why cosmetic products need to be withdrawn [24].|$|E
