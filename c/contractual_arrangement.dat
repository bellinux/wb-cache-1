In the case of fisheries, {{what is needed is}} an in-depth knowledge of real world contract provisions and categorization of <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements</b> to guide analysis of <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements.</b> This paper is a modest contribution toward this particular end. The present study also draws upon modern contract theory to explain the existence of a variety of <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements</b> in aquaculture and marine fishing. Certain regularities to be found within the fishing economies of the Philippines include share contracts between aquaculture owner-operators and tenant/laborers and between boat owners and crew members as well as interlinkage of credit, labor, and marketing relations. Future work would entail understanding the fundamental incentives underlying <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements</b> in fisheries that will allow one to evaluate the efficiency and equity implications of contract use and will aid in predicting their influence in the distribution of returns as their usage in the fishery sector increases. agricultural contracts, <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements,</b> fishing contracts, fishery sector, informal credit...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} literature on China's economic development has focused so far more on economic reform, decentralization, and the clarification {{and protection of}} property rights. There is, however, inadequate attention being paid to the adaptive efficiency of economic actors, in general and to experimenting with informal and formal <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements,</b> in particular. In this article, the authors document and analyze the informal contracts developed in Wenzhou, and three types of formal <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements</b> increasingly used in China. The authors argue that both informal and formal contractual mechanisms play important roles in China's economic development. The general pattern appears to be that economic actors rely first on self-enforcing, informal <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements</b> and later adopt more formal arrangements when these are feasible. The authors, by focusing their analysis on the development and adaptation of selected <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements,</b> submit {{that the process of}} legal development in China is consistent with the notion of adaptive efficiency. The implication from the study is that the development of a formal contract regime will become increasingly important as economic development reaches a more advanced stage. When economic actors are able to rely on more formal <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements,</b> more complex, riskier transactions with higher technological content will be pursued. © Oxford University Press 2008, all rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, the Confederate government sought to counter the United States Navy in part by appealing to private enterprise world-wide to engage in privateering against United States shipping. Privateering was the practice of fitting ordinary private merchant vessels with modest armament, then sending them to sea to capture other merchant vessels in return for monetary reward. The captured vessels and cargo fell under customary prize rules at sea. [...] Prizes would be taken to the jurisdiction of a competent court, which could be in the sponsoring country or theoretically in any neutral port. If the court found that the capture was legal, the ship and cargo would be forfeited and sold at a prize auction. The proceeds would be distributed among owners and crew according to a <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Privateers were also authorized to attack an enemy's navy warships and then apply to the sponsoring government for direct monetary reward, usually gold or gold specie (coins).|$|E
2500|$|The {{terms of}} the {{marriage}} were settled by two agreements, a public treaty and a private <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The treaty was executed between Spain and the United Kingdom in London on 7 May 1906 by their respective plenipotentiaries, the Spanish Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Don Luis Polo de Bernabé, and the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, Bt. Ratifications were exchanged on 23 May following. Among other conditions, the treaty stipulated:BE it known unto all men by these Presents that whereas His Catholic Majesty Alfonso XIII, King of Spain, has judged it proper to announce his intention of contracting a marriage with Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena, niece of His Majesty Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and daughter of Her Royal Highness the Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (Princess Henry of Battenberg)…Article I. It is concluded and agreed that the marriage between His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII and Her said Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena shall be solemnized in person at Madrid {{as soon as the}} same may conveniently be done. II. His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII engages to secure to Her said Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena from the date of her marriage with His Majesty, and for the whole period of the marriage, an annual grant of 450,000 pesetas. His said Majesty King Alfonso XIII also engages, if, by the will of Divine Providence, the said Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena should become his widow, to secure to her, from the date of his death, an annual grant of 250,000 pesetas, unless and until she contracts a second marriage, both these grants having already been voted by the Cortes. The private settlements to be made on either side in regard to the said marriage will be agreed upon and expressed in a separate Contract, which shall, however, be deemed to form {{an integral part of the}} present Treaty…III. The High Contracting Parties take note of the fact that Her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria Eugénie Julia Ena, according to the due tenor of the law of England, forfeits for ever all hereditary rights of succession to the Crown and Government of Great Britain… The treaty's reference to the forfeiture of Victoria Eugénie's British succession rights reflected neither the British government's censure of the alliance, nor any [...] made by her. Rather, it was an explicit recognition of the fact that by marrying (and becoming) a Roman Catholic, Victoria Eugénie lost any right to inherit the British crown as a consequence of Britain's Act of Settlement. This exclusion was personal and limited: those among her descendants who do not become Roman Catholic remain in the line of succession to the British Throne.|$|E

We developed a contractual perspective on interlocal <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements</b> as relational contracts by arguing that their institutional designs are partly an effort of the involved parties to reduce transaction costs that are the product of the properties of the services themselves; and partly by state statutes that allowed mixed approaches to <b>contractual</b> <b>arrangements.</b> A relational contract is advantageous because it specifies the activities to be rendered without unnecessarily intruding on the authority of the other jurisdiction. It is nonobligatory, voluntary, and easily terminated without legal consequences to either party. Alternatively, municipal and county governments can choose a more legally binding contract in the presence of regional politics and avoid future disputes by using non-relational contracts such as interlocal agreements, contracts or leases...|$|R
