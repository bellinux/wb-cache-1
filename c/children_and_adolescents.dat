Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{literature}} describing {{the content and}} time allocated to undergraduate medical education curricula in <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry <b>and</b> make recommendations about <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry teaching goals and curricula content. METHOD: A literature search from 1970 to February 2007 using the key words undergraduate, curriculum, teaching, education, psychiatry, <b>child,</b> <b>adolescent,</b> <b>and</b> medical school, was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. RESULTS: There is limited agreement about curricula content for undergraduate <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry teaching programs in medical schools, {{with a wide range}} of objectives identified by different programs. On average, the time allowed for teaching <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry is small. There is also great variation in the time allocated by different medical schools. In many countries, the number of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists with academic appointments is limited, <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatry programs are developed and taught by a small number of teaching staff at each medical school.

40|$|Objective: The {{national}} {{shortage of}} <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists has prompted {{efforts to improve}} recruitment. It is uncertain whether these efforts will be sufficient to address this shortage {{and its impact on}} youth mental health services. Method: Data were compared from 1990 to 2001 by state, county characteristics, number of youths, and percentage of youths living in poverty to determine any changes in the number <b>and</b> distribution of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists. Trends in the number of residents and age distribution of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists were also analyzed. Results: The number of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists has increased, but it still falls below estimates projected to adequately serve youth mental health needs. Disparities in <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrist distribution persist, with significantly fewer in rural counties or counties with a high percentage of children living in poverty. The age of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists has shifted, with fewer below age 35. The number of residents in training has not changed significantly since 1995. Conclusions: The shortage of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists remains <b>and</b> is still accentuated for those living in rural areas or in poverty. Despite the increased number of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> psychiatrists, the number of residents and changes in workforce age indicate that the shortage will continue. J. Am. Acad.

40|$|Objective: <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> mental {{disorders}} are common, with a substantial disease burden, yet services {{for young people}} are nationally inadequate. As services {{should be based on}} policies and (or) plans, we analyzed the availability <b>and</b> content of <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> mental health policies and plans in all provinces and territories. Method: The World Health Organization (WHO) framework for <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> <b>Adolescent</b> Mental Health Policy and Plans was applied. Results: Four provinces in Canada have a <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> mental health policy and (or) plan. The other provinces do not have a policy or plan in place, or else try to integrate these components into existing mental health strategies. Among the policies and plans that exist, there is substantial variability regarding content as well as degree of adherence to the WHO template. Five essential content areas: legislation and human rights, information systems, quality improvement, improving access to and use of psychotropics, and human resource development and training are poorly or very poorly addressed in existing policies and (or) plans. Conclusion: This lack of specific policy and (or) plans for <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> mental health care and the variability of content in plans that exist may help explain why <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> mental health services are poorly developed across Canada. We suggest that a national <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> mental health policy framework be developed for Canada so that the provinces and territories may be encouraged to create or amend their current <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> mental health frameworks in a manner that may enhance national cohesion and commonly addresses service needs in this population...|$|R
5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
