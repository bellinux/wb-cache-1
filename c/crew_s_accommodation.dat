40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} explore the ethnic consumer 2 ̆ 7 s response {{to the use of}} cultural symbols in marketing communications. In this effort, Speech Accommodation Theory was extended to the non-verbal domain, and used to develop hypotheses about the potential consequences of intercultural accommodation efforts. Intercultural accommodation is defined as the attempt of a communicator to use the ethnic group 2 ̆ 7 s culture (e. g. ethnic music or backdrops in advertising, or contributions to ethnic causes) in an attempt to gain approval or enhance communication with ethnic group members. A model was developed that can be used across ethnic groups, and was tested with African-American and Hispanic consumers. ^ The consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> response to <b>accommodation</b> attempts is modeled as three constructs; recognition, attributional response, and affective response. The antecedents which are expected to influence the direction of the response are the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>accommodation</b> experience, attitudes toward accommodation, agent knowledge, strength of ethnic identification, attitude toward the mainstream culture, and the 2 ̆ 2 newness 2 ̆ 2 of the communication itself. The consequences of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s response to the accommodation attempt are hypothesized to take the form of evaluative effects (attitude toward the brand, the company, and the ad), influences on the effectiveness of the communication (comprehension and message recall), and reciprocal accommodative behaviors (positive word-of-mouth and intentions to buy). ^ The study found support for the three factor representation of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s response to the accommodation attempt. The hypothesized consequences of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s response were also supported. The significance of the antecedents varied between the African-American and Hispanic samples. This study contributes to theory development by validating constructs and measures {{that can be used to}} study intercultural accommodation. The model can be used to detect differences among ethnic groups, and to predict consequences of the use of accommodation in targeting. The managerial contributions lie primarily in delineating the complexity of the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s response to ethnic target marketing: intercultural accommodation efforts are not always received positively, and may have the opposite effects of those intended. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of manned operations aboard the International Space Station (ISS), the crew had performed hygiene activities within the aisle way (the habitable volume, not including the sleep areas) of the ISS. The Crew used wet towels, re-hydrated body soap, and "no-rinse" shampoo to cleanse themselves amongst the stowage and systems hardware, referred to as "racks", even without a designated area to dry the wet items. Performing hygiene in this manner became an accepted method; no isolated location was available to the Crew. After several years of hygiene operations, some of the fabric-covered racks began to grow biological material (generically described as mold) and soon became a Crew health concern. Hygiene {{has one of the}} strongest impacts on Crew morale, and mandating changes to the Crew routine would have been met with strong resistance.

40|$|Future long {{duration}} human exploration missions {{away from}} Earth will require closed-loop regenerative {{life support systems}} to reduce launch mass, reduce dependency on resupply and increase the level of mission self sufficiency. Such systems may {{be based on the}} integration of biological and physiocochemical processes to produce potable water, breathable atmosphere and nutritious food from metabolic and other mission wastes. Over the period 1995 to 1998 a series of ground-based tests were conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Johnson Space Center, to evaluate the performance of advanced closed-loop life support technologies with real human metabolic and hygiene loads. Named the Lunar-Mars Life Support Test Project (LMLSTP), four integrated human tests were conducted with increasing duration, complexity and closure. The first test, LMLSTP Phase I, was designed to demonstrate the ability of higher plants to revitalize cabin atmosphere. A single crew member spent 15 days within an atmospherically closed chamber containing 11. 2 square meters of actively growing wheat. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen levels were maintained by control of the rate of photosynthesis through manipulation of light intensity or the availability of carbon dioxide and included integrated physicochemical systems. During the second and third tests, LMLSTP Phases II & IIa, four crew members spent 30 days and 60 days, respectively, in a larger sealed chamber. Advanced physicochemical life support hardware was used to regenerate the atmosphere and produce potable water from wastewater. Air revitalization was accomplished by using a molecular sieve and a Sabatier processor for carbon dioxide absorption and reduction, respectively, with oxygen generation performed by water hydrolysis. Production of potable water from wastewater included urine treatment (vapor compression distillation), primary treatment (ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis and multi-filtration) and post processing. For the Phase II test the water recovery rate ranged from 95 to 98 %, depending on the processor. LMLSTP Phase III, the fourth test of the series, had a duration of 91 days and included four crew members. The test demonstrated an integration of physicochemical and biological technologies for air revitalization, water recovery and waste processing. Wheat supplemented the physicochemical air revitalization systems by providing approximately 25 % of the oxygen required for the 4 -person crew. The water recovery system included immobilized cell and trickling filter bioreactors for primary water treatment, reverse osmosis and air evaporation systems for secondary water treatment, followed by post processing. The 8 day initial supply of water was recycled through the chamber and crew 10 times {{over the course of the}} test. Grain from the wheat together with fresh lettuce from a small growth chamber within the crew chamber provided supplementation to the stored food system, but at a level less than 5 % of the <b>crew</b> <b>s</b> caloric requirement.

The HPM concept would provide the fundamental building block for an efficient, reusable in-space transportation system for both crewed and uncrewed missions. Each HPM would be equipped to implement an advanced zero-boil-off method of managing cryogenic fluids, and would include a fluid-transfer interface comprising standardized fittings that would be compatible with fittings on all supply facilities and on spacecraft to be supplied. The HPM, combined with a chemical or electric orbital transfer spacecraft, would provide an integrated propulsion system. HPMs would supply chemical propellant for time-critical transfers such as crewed missions, and utilize the more efficient electric-propulsion transfer vehicles to transport filled HPMs to the destinations and to return empty HPMs back to near-Earth orbits or other intermediate locations for replenishment and reuse. The HPM prepositioned using electric propulsion would provide the chemical propellant for the <b>crew</b> <b>s</b> return trip {{in a much more}} efficient manner than a chemical-only approach.

40|$|Airborne Precision Spacing {{has been}} {{developed}} by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{over the past seven}} years as an attempt to benefit from the capabilities of the flight deck to precisely space their aircraft relative to another aircraft. This development has leveraged decades of work on improving terminal area operations, especially the arrival phase. With APS operations, the air traffic controller instructs the participating aircraft to achieve an assigned inter-arrival spacing interval at the runway threshold, relative to another aircraft. The flight crew then uses airborne automation to manage the aircraft s speed to achieve the goal. The spacing tool is designed to keep the speed within acceptable operational limits, promote system-wide stability, and meet the assigned goal. This reallocation of tasks with the controller issuing strategic goals and the flight crew managing the tactical achievement of those goals {{has been shown to be}} feasible through simulation and flight test. A precision of plus or minus 2 - 3 seconds is generally achievable. Simulations of long strings of arriving traffic show no signs of instabilities or compression waves.
