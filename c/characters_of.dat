40|$|This article {{begins with}} a {{theological}} argument, then proceeds to practical application. Its thesis {{is that there is}} an inherent link between the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> the preacher, the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> the congregation, and the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> the gospel proclaimed. They mirror one another. Many congregations are not equipped to deal with change, growth, or evangelism because they have become entrenched in one style of leadership or structured life; thus, before congregations can change, before a congregation can take a new direction in gospel living, the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> the preacher must be converted. This contribution to the topic proposes that the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> the preacher and the preacher’s congregation can draw closer to the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> the gospel through the practice and teaching of homiletics...|$|R
