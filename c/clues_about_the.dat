Aspects of the D'ni civilization such as social structure, marriage, and how Ages came about are also imparted as players progress through the Ages. Players may collect Relto pages, which offer cosmetic customization to the player's personal Age—for example, making it rain or adding a waterfall.|$|E
5|$|Gunnerkrigg Court {{is set in}} a {{boarding}} school in a country that resembles the United Kingdom, identifiable from the grey skies and mandatory uniforms. The comic contains other <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> setting, such as the house system that is described {{at the end of the}} first chapter. This system is similar to that used by many UK schools, including the one the author attended; Siddell has even stated that the school in which Gunnerkrigg Court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{observations}} in the 1900s gave the first <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried {{to measure the}} Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any rotation. He surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period than had previously been thought. Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde. Radar observations of Venus were first {{carried out in the}} 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the modern value.|$|E

5|$|The story {{revolves}} around Kōhei Orihara, the main protagonist. His {{father died when}} he was very young, followed by his younger sister Misao and finally his mother. Deeply depressed, he goes to live with his aunt Yukiko, his mother's younger sister, about ten years before Ones story begins on November 30, 1998. After he meets Mizuka Nagamori as a child, Kōhei begins to seclude himself in the Eternal World, a world within his mind. The game's main recurring motif is a focus on the Eternal World, a mystical alternate space which is never clearly explained, and the details of which are unknown. Shun Hikami's remarks in the original game are possible <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Eternal World.|$|E
5|$|These {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} different varieties of ceramics such as {{black and red}} ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.|$|E
5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E

5|$|Shepard {{is brought}} to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to {{investigate}} a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Reapers working by proxy through an insectoid species called the Collectors. The Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned. Shepard is given command of a new starship, the Normandy SR-2, piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI, and begins to assemble a team to stop the Collectors. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that another human colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard successfully defends the colony, but is unable to stop {{a large portion of}} the population from being captured.|$|E

25|$|Because a large {{proportion}} of stars exist in binary systems, binaries are particularly important {{to our understanding of the}} processes by which stars form. In particular, the period and masses of the binary tell us about the amount of angular momentum in the system. Because this is a conserved quantity in physics, binaries give us important <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> conditions under which the stars were formed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Paul began his missionary movement, women were {{important}} agents within the different cities.

50|$|The {{official}} {{title was}} leaked {{several months before}} the official announcement. Soft Club, the Russian distributor of the game, unveiled the name and release date {{of the game in}} February 2007.

25|$|The {{inferential}} view of TOTs {{claims that}} TOTs arise from <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> target that the rememberer can piece together. This {{is to say}} that the rememberer infers their knowledge of the target word, and the imminence of retrieval depends upon the information that they are able to access about the target word from their memory. These views disregard the presence of the target word in memory as having an effect on creating tip of the tongue states.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} the abundances of lithium and {{beryllium}} in open cluster stars can give important <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> evolution of stars and their interior structures. While hydrogen nuclei cannot fuse to form helium until the temperature reaches about 10 millionK, lithium and beryllium are destroyed at temperatures of 2.5 millionK and 3.5 millionK respectively. This means that their abundances depend strongly on how much mixing occurs in stellar interiors. By studying their abundances in open cluster stars, variables such as age and chemical composition are fixed.|$|E

At the time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was developing a new method of tracking killers called offender profiling, and Meirhofer was the first serial killer to be investigated using the technique. Offender profiling is a method used to learn <b>clues</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> characteristics of an unknown killer from evidence {{at the scene of}} the crime and establish their behavioural patterns before they reach the height of their criminality.|$|E
