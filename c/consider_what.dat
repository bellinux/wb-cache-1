5|$|On August 17, when a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Jamaica, Prime Minister of Jamaica Portia Simpson-Miller convened an emergency meeting of Jamaica's national disaster preparedness council.

The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA), which was already responding to Hurricane Dean's impact in the Lesser Antilles, contacted the Jamaican Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management to confirm technical and logistics support, and to notify the Jamaican government that utilities teams had been placed on standby should they be needed. The North-West Caribbean Donor Group also met to <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> action might it might undertake in Dean's aftermath.|$|E

25|$|On Tuesday, September 4, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, adelantado of La Florida, {{set sail}} from the harbor of St. Augustine, and {{coasting}} north, came upon four vessels {{lying at anchor}} off {{the mouth of a}} river. These were Jean Ribault's flagship, the Trinity, and three others of his ships, which the Frenchman had left {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns because they were too large to pass the bars in safety. One of them was flying the Admiral's flag, another the flag of the Captain. Menéndez recognized at once that the French reinforcements had arrived before him, and called a council of his captains to <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> action should be taken.|$|E
25|$|In Salzburg, Austria, {{just before}} World War II, nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the Dixit Dominus.

The Mother Abbess and the other nuns <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> to do about her ("Maria"). Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song ("My Favorite Things"). The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she {{is ready for the}} monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp.|$|E
25|$|The special {{committee}} of the Japanese Lower House investigating the Fukushima disaster had requested to TEPCO to submit its procedural manuals for accidents {{by the end of}} the whole first week of September.

On 12 September 3 pages were presented, including a cover sheet, containing an index of actions to be taken in serious accidents. Most of the index was blacked out and TEPCO did collect the papers immediately after the meeting, explaining that this was restricted information with copyrights, that was not allowed to be made public. The {{special committee}} did ask the industry ministry to order the utility to resubmit the manuals in their original form, as required by law.

25|$|C. vicina play an {{integral}} part in post mortem interval determination. Factors such as region, weather temperatures, time of day and conditions under which the body was found all contribute to determining a post mortem interval (PMI). To complete the calculation the entomologist must <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> is commonly known about C. vicina and integrate it with experimental data gathered from a crime scene. The entomologist must know how the blow-fly behaves specifically {{in the area where}} the body was discovered. This involves recording environment temperatures at the crime scene as well as retrieving a history of the climate in the region. C. vicina in particular is adapted to cooler temperatures, appearing most commonly in winter and less often in the summer months. This puts their flight activity threshold at above 55-60°F (13-16°C), a lower temperature than most other blow-flies. Knowing the threshold temperature allows the entomologist to calculate accumulated degree days, which in turn helps determine PMI.|$|E
25|$|Start {{with one}} setting exactly {{opposite}} to the other. All the pairs of particles {{give the same}} outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A {{small fraction of the}} pairs, say f, now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction f of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2f.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} ships were being pummeled. Weehawken had {{advanced}} {{to a line}} of buoys that Captain Rodgers thought might mark torpedoes, so he swerved from the channel and stopped to <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> to do next. At this time, an underwater explosion rocked the vessel; Rodgers {{thought that it was}} a torpedo, but some historians believe that it was more likely the explosion of a shell from one of the forts. In either case, the ship suffered no significant injury. Because she had left the channel, however, the line of ships following her were thrown into confusion, and whatever was left of Du Pont's battle plan collapsed. The intense fire the ships received from the forts kept them farther from Fort Sumter than the admiral had envisioned, so their return fire was less accurate than planned. It was not accuracy that determined the result, however, but the sheer disparity in firepower. In the course of the two hours of the engagement, the Confederate forces got off more than 2000 shot and shell, of which 520 hit. By contrast, the Union fleet fired only 154 shots. Their armor protected the crews, but several ships suffered damage that impaired their fighting abilities, such as jammed turrets and gunport stoppers. Worst hit was Keokuk, which was hit 90 times, including 19 shots at or below the waterline. Captain Rhind withdrew his ship from the fight, barely able to keep her afloat until she was beyond enemy gunfire. By this time, the tide had turned, so Admiral Du Pont decided to suspend the attack until the following day.|$|E
