25|$|As {{with the}} airheads, all oilhead GS models are shaft driven. The front suspension, however, was changed from {{conventional}} forks to the Telelever, developed by British company Saxon Motodd, {{which uses a}} <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> called an A-arm by BMW to eliminate dive under braking.|$|E
25|$|The Model S has {{independent}} {{coil spring}} suspension {{on all four}} wheels front double wishbone, virtual steer axis <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and rear independent multilink. As an extra-cost option, the car is available with self-leveling, height-adjustable air suspension. This is accomplished via adjustable Bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver. The car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain, despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Control</b> <b>arms</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} encountered {{as part of}} the MacPherson strut independent front suspension. The <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> are perpendicular to the axis of the vehicle and are termed track <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> A diagonal radius rod constrains the strut from moving forward and back.|$|R

25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and a strut stabilized lower control arms in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|E
25|$|The 1998 model {{had a few}} minor {{refinement}} {{changes to}} the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|E
25|$|At the American Society of Clinical Oncology Conference in June 2010, the Bristol-Myers Squibb {{pharmaceutical}} company reported the clinical findings of their drug ipilimumab. The study found {{an increase in}} median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% {{in the control group}} using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone. However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment. The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.|$|E
2500|$|Also new, the {{double-wishbone}} front suspension had ball joints, {{upper and}} lower <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs and shock absorbers above the upper control arms; as well as trailing struts on the lower <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The [...] "Magnum 500" [...] road wheels were now standard, but the new [...] "Machine" [...] 15x7inch slot-styled wheels were optional.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the main}} goal of the <b>Control</b> <b>Arms</b> {{campaign}} has been achieved - an international Arms Trade Treaty has been agreed - the campaign {{will continue to be}} involved in the Arms Trade Treaty process.

25|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies - with an all-new, {{sturdier}} perimeter frame, new chassis/body mounts, larger 8½inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> bushings, increased {{front and rear}} suspension travel, new shock absorber location, and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E
25|$|Needle {{exchange}} programmes are not {{a strategy}} officially sanctioned by the Ministry of Public Security since such strategies {{give the appearance of}} condoning drug use. Thus, when this strategy was first introduced, it was called needle social marketing – increasing the commercial availability and accessibility of needles in combination with health education about safe injecting practices and, in some cases, provision of free needles. Since 2001, the State Council has officially advocated needle social marketing as an HIV prevention measure. Evidence from research and study tours to countries such as Australia, which runs successful needle exchange programmes, prompted the Ministry of Health to support the first such programme in Yunnan province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1999. In 2000–02, a larger intervention trial of needle exchange programmes was done in four counties of Guangdong province and Guangxi, funded by the World AIDS Foundation. Cross-sectional data gathered at follow-up indicated that participants in intervention communities were almost three times less likely to have shared needles in the past month than those in control communities (odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.25–0.52). Furthermore, rates of infection with hepatitis C virus were significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (51.1% vs 83.6%, p=0.001) and HIV rates were lower in the intervention arm; however, this was significant only in Guangdong (p=0.011) and not in Guangxi (p=0.2) nor overall (18.1% vs 23.6%, p=0.391).|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E

2500|$|The ZHP was {{equipped}} with sportier camshafts and revised engine tuning to increase power from [...] to [...] Suspension was modified over the standard suspension with firmer springs and dampers, larger anti-roll bars, stronger front <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> ball joints, a lower ride height, and slightly more negative camber. Car and Driver magazine track-tested the car, which returned a 0–60mph time of 5.2 seconds and passed through the 1/4 mile in 14.3 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The 370Z uses a front double {{wishbone}} suspension, with forged aluminum control arms and steering knuckle, the rear multi-link suspension uses a forged aluminum upper <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> lower arm and radius rod, the toe control rod is steel and wheel carrier assembly is aluminum. [...] The refreshed 2013 model uses new dampers with the Sport package models. The brakes {{have been changed}} from the more expensive Brembo racing brakes to Nissan branded brakes which are manufactured by Akebono.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E
50|$|The B5 S4 is {{fitted with}} 4-wheel {{independent}} suspension. The front suspension is a multi-link design with four individual <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> per wheel. The rear suspension is an unequal length double wishbone design; the lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> are mounted to a subframe which also carries the differential housing. Shock absorbers, coil springs, and anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear.|$|R

2500|$|A new {{race car}} called the Viper Competition Coupe took the GTS-R's {{place for the}} second phase. The Viper Competition Coupe had the same 8.3-liter V10 engine as the street Viper, but {{increased}} power to , and [...] of torque. The Competition Coupe had a carbon fiber composite body on a tubular steel frame with no interior trim and an FIA-legal roll cage. [...] The exterior design of the Competition Coupe {{was based on the}} Viper GTS-R concept from 1999. [...] Modifications to the mechanicals of the Viper were a 27-gallon fuel cell, differential cooler, ducted brakes, improved driver and engine cooling, trap door oil pan, low-inertia flywheel, an improved double-wishbone suspension system, new spherical bearing <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> attachments, two-way adjustable coil over dampers, and a driver-adjustable blade-type rear anti-roll bar. [...] The anti-lock braking system added a distribution control system. The initial price of the car is around $100,000.|$|E
50|$|A <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> {{may be used}} {{to carry}} the {{suspension}} load and transmit them to the spring or shock absorber. Torsion bar suspension commonly does this, with the outboard end of the torsion bar attached to the inboard bearing of the <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
50|$|All late model M3s {{received}} subframe re-inforcements {{and more}} aggressive front end suspension geometry {{due to the}} differences in caster and camber yielded by top hat design and lower <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> bushings.
