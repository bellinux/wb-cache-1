The latter can have profound influence on the way the current is partitioned among the tapes, especially on short laboratory prototypes. In this paper, we first use the numerical model to compute the critical current and the magnetization AC loss of a twisted tape, showing the differences with the case of a straight tape. Then, we use it to calculate the current distribution in a TSTC cable, comparing the results with those experimentally obtained on a cable composed of four straight stacked tapes. The results show the ability of the model to simulate twisted conductors and constitutes a first step toward the simulation of TSTC in high-field magnet applications. The presented modeling approach is not restricted to the TSTC geometry, but may be used for any cable configuration with periodical translational symmetry.

40|$|AbstractReduction of heat {{penetrating}} {{into the}} cryogenic region {{is the important}} method of optimization of superconducting devices. In the cases of short-range power transmission lines and compact HTS devices like magnets, the heat leakage through current leads is relatively large. In order to decrease this contribution, current leads equipped with Peltier elements can be used. The mentioned technology is being actively developed in the Chubu University. Commercial samples of Peltier current leads are installed at the terminals of 500 -meter DC HTS cable in Ishikari (Hokkaido). This cable is designed for 5 kA. The inner conducting layer consists of 37 DI-BSCCO HTS tapes from Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. with a critical current of 180 A; and the outer one consists of 35 tapes of the same type. Each end of the <b>cable's</b> <b>tape</b> {{is connected to the}} individual Peltier current lead. Accordingly, each of the two terminals is equipped with 72 Peltier current leads, 144 pieces in total. In order to examine behavior of the current leads in detail, each piece is supplied with two thermocouples; there are also voltage taps on feedthrough and on HTS tape end. In addition, current through Peltier current lead can be measured by means of individual current transformer. The hardware part of the data acquisition system includes four Keithley 3706 A multimeters equipped with 60 -channel model 3724 FET multiplexer cards. Therefore, 144 data blocks are formed. Furthermore, there are 72 measurements of a voltage drop across HTS tape. Sampling period is set to be 3 s.

50|$|Permanent and expeditionary {{land based}} systems usually consist of two arresting engines located {{on either side}} of the runway. The arresting engines apply braking force to reels holding the {{purchase}} tapes, which in turn slow the aircraft and bring it to a stop. The two most common methods used by land based arresting engines to apply the braking force are the rotary friction brake and the rotary hydraulic (water twister) systems. The rotary friction brake is simply a hydraulic pump coupled to the reel which applies a graduated pressure to multi-disc brakes mounted on the reel. The rotary hydraulic system is a turbine inside a water/glycol filled housing coupled to the reel. The turbulence generated in the water/glycol mixture by the turbine during the arrestment provides the resistance to slow the reel and stop the aircraft.

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} in the properties of superconducting materials have occurred recently. These improvements are being incorporated into the latest generation of wires, <b>cables,</b> and <b>tapes</b> that are being used in {{a broad range of}} prototype devices. These devices include new, high field accelerator and NMR magnets, magnets for fusion power experiments, motors, generators, and power transmission lines. These prototype magnets are joining a wide array of existing applications that utilize the unique capabilities of superconducting magnets: accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, fusion experiments such as ITER, 930 MHz NMR, and 4 Tesla MRI. In addition, promising new materials such as MgB 2 have been discovered and are being studied in order to assess their potential for new applications. In this paper, we will review the key developments that are leading to these new applications for superconducting materials. In some cases, the key factor is improved understanding or development of materials with significantly improved properties. An example of the former is the development of Nb 3 Sn for use in high field magnets for accelerators. In other cases, the development is being driven by the application. The aggressive effort to develop HTS tapes is being driven primarily by the need for materials that can operate at temperatures of 50 K and higher. The implications of these two drivers for further developments will be discussed. Finally, we will discuss the areas where further improvements are needed in order for new applications to be realized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{technical}} problems {{need to be}} developed in order that a high temperature superconducting (HTS) cable will use in a real power network. A second-generation HTS tape (YBCO coated conductor) has potential of making its AC loss lower than that of a BSCCO tape because the superconducting layer of a YBCO tape is thinner than that of a BSCCO tape. Moreover, cost of a YBCO tape will become less than that of a BSCCO tape in future because quantity consumed of costly component (such as silver) in a YBCO tape is less than that in a BSCCO tape. Considering these, an HTS power cable that using YBCO tapes will become an economical choice compared with a conventional XLPE cable or a BSCCO HTS cable. HTS power <b>cables</b> using YBCO <b>tapes</b> have been developed in the Japanese national projects.

5000|$|Bolger's first {{generation}} of [...] "chine log instant boats" [...] for home building {{was followed by a}} generation of [...] "stitch and glue" [...] (aka [...] "tack and tape") boats. This technique was made possible by the evolution of glues and the massification of polyester and epoxy resins combined with fiberglass tape. The new technique basically did away with the chine logs and mechanical fasteners and all the problems associated with their use (mainly the limitation of shape in the design phase, the carpentry challenge in the construction phase and damp/rot in the medium to long term). Instead of using a chine to join the precut panels, in stitch and glue, the preshaped panels are wrapped around bulkheads and/or frames {{in the same way as}} before. However, the panels are only temporarily held in place using nails, duct <b>tape,</b> <b>cable</b> ties, masking <b>tape,</b> wire or other mechanical means, while the seams are filled (both inside and outside the hull) with a resin and filler paste covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth or tape which in turn is saturated in resin. Once the resin hardens, the mechanical joint is stronger than the joined plywood and therefore structurally sound. Payson again popularised the technique in his book Build the New Instant Boats (1984, 160 pages, 8" [...] × 11", 110 illustrations - Also still in print). In this book Payson introduces what he termed [...] "Tack and tape" [...] to the greater American public.

However in this case particular care has to be taken because the eddy current loss in the current leads contributes to the total measured loss. We used numerical simulations to evaluate the contribution of the eddy current loss to the measured AC loss. With help of simulations one can determine whether the contribution of the eddy current loss is significant and possibly optimize the current leads to reduce that loss contribution...|$|R
