40|$|European Customs {{officials}} have used fictive patent rights {{to justify the}} seizure of lawful generic medicines produced in India and destined for non- European markets. Following a public outcry and initiation of two WTO complaints, the EU has proposed amendments to Border Regulations Measure 1383 / 2003. The Proposed Border Regulation {{in its current form}} will not adequately resolve the risk of interception in Europe of medicines lawfully manufactured and exported from India and destined for lawful import and consumption in a non-EU country. This analysis concludes that multiple weaknesses remain in the Border Regulations, including: (1) <b>continued</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> alleged patent and supplemental protection certificate infringement claims that can be based on fictional patent status under national law; the addition of utility models; and <b>continued</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> design rights and civil trademark infringement matters that are more appropriately addressed in ordinary court proceedings; (2) inappropriate application of the law of the in-transit country instead of the law of the importing country when assessing an IP infringement claim; (3) unclear directives to 2 ̆ 2 consider 2 ̆ 2 the risk of diversion to EU markets with no explicit prohibition against seizing in-transit medicines in the absence of such a showing and without requirement of clear and convincing evidence of an imminent diversion by an identified party; (4) insufficient opportunities to be heard for declarants and holders of goods; and (5) insufficient remedies for declarants and holders of goods and for purchasers and consumers who are proximately harmed by unsuccessful border applications...|$|R
