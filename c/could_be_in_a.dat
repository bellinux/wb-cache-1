5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo so that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film {{in order to avoid}} distracting the audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{chromosphere}} of Tau Ceti—the {{portion of}} a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting photosphere—currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One nine-year study of temperature, granulation, and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively {{it has been suggested}} that the star <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low-activity state analogous to a Maunder minimum—a historical period, associated with the Little Ice Age in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The amplitude of the star's oscillations are about half those of the Sun, and have a lower mode lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Observations of the Red Spot Jr. storm suggest Jupiter <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{period of}} global climate change. This is {{hypothesized}} {{to be part of}} an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in Jupiter's atmosphere. These vortices facilitate the heat exchange between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, heat exchange is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles cooling down and the equator region heating up. The resulting large temperature differential destabilizes the atmosphere and thereby leads to the creation of new vortices.|$|E

25|$|While {{there was}} {{substantial}} criticism {{aimed at the}} BCS system from coaches, media, and fans alike, there was is also support for the system. Tim Cowlishaw of The Dallas Morning News cited several advantages that the BCS has over a playoff system. Under the BCS, a single defeat was extremely detrimental to a team's prospects for a national championship, although critics pointed out regularly that history shows non-AQ conference teams were hurt far more than AQ conference teams when they lost a game. Supporters contended that this created a substantial incentive for teams {{to do their best}} to win every game. Under a proposed playoffs system, front-running teams <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position of safety {{at the end of the}} regular season and could pull or greatly reduce their use of top players in order to protect them from injuries or give them recovery time (this happens frequently in the NFL). This may have been less likely to happen under the BCS system where a team in the running for a No. 1 or No. 2 ranking at the end of the year would likely have been punished in the polls for a loss, potentially eliminating them from contention.|$|E

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Disney paid over $4 million per 30-second spot. The Los Angeles Times said, [...] "The clip promoting the April 4 release had a recognizably melancholy tone as Chris Evans' patriotic hero grapples with the moral ambiguities {{of the modern}} age." [...] Also in February, Gameloft announced that a mobile video game, titled Captain America: The Winter Soldier – The Official Game, would be released {{in conjunction with the}} release of the film in late March 2014 for iOS and Android platforms. A few days later General Motors announced that Chevrolet partnered with Marvel Entertainment and provided a specially designed Corvette Stingray C7 for use by the Black Widow in the film. The vehicle debuted at the 2014 Chicago Auto Show, where fans received limited-edition Captain America comic books. Evans was named the grand marshal of the 2014 Daytona 500 to promote the film's release. Later in the month, a 30-second television spot received [...] "a lot of attention on social media" [...] for a line featured in the clip. The line, which was said by Captain America, suggests that Nick Fury would die in the film. The Hollywood Reporter noted that it all seemed [...] "a bit too obvious", noting the fact that Jackson, who plays Fury, is reprising the role in , although pointing out that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> postmortem flashback appearance.|$|E
2500|$|As railroads {{expanded}} rapidly farther inland unchallenged, competition developed along previously existing or developed arterial routes, between {{older and}} slower navigation {{systems and the}} newer and faster railroads. [...] One result over time was their acquisition and closing of existing canals, another result was the development of monopolistic and anti-competitive practices. [...] Where railroads were not so directly involved, the decline in canal traffic developed alternative uses for the water power contained behind these dams and former locks. While these closed canal facilities could not be moved, their water power <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fashion; in some locations the dammed water was otherwise piped through a penstock to multiple nearby locations lower downstream, to provide mechanical hydropower from increasingly more efficient water turbines.|$|E
2500|$|In Italy, a {{distinct}} form called [...] "overture" [...] {{arose in the}} 1680s, and became established particularly through the operas of Alessandro Scarlatti, and spread throughout Europe, supplanting the French form as the standard operatic overture by the mid-18th century. It uses three generally homophonic movements: fast–slow–fast. The opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key; the slow movement in earlier examples was short, and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> contrasting key; the concluding movement was dance-like, most often with rhythms of the gigue or minuet, {{and returned to the}} key of the opening section.

2500|$|Two other {{significant}} actions {{have been brought}} against the NFL on antitrust grounds. The first was from the North American Soccer League (NASL), which challenged an NFL policy, never formally adopted, barring owners from having interests in other professional team sports. Rozelle had pushed for its inclusion as {{an amendment to the}} league constitution, believing that owners must be focused on football and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> conflict of interest with the NFL if they owned franchises in other sports, since the other sports competed for disposable income with the NFL. Opposing them were Hunt, Miami Dolphins' owner Joe Robbie and Edward Bennett Williams, who at the time owned the Baltimore Orioles as well as the Redskins. Hunt had founded the Dallas Tornado, and owned part of the NBA Chicago Bulls for a while. Robbie's wife owned the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, and Robbie himself warned that the policy was [...] "an open invitation for a lawsuit under the Sherman Act".|$|E

2500|$|The movie {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} different critics.

If by any chance you don’t get to like it, then you must be a grumpy grouchy curmudgeon who does not believe people can just burst into song-and-dance numbers, so you surely won’t enjoy this big sing-along fest...accomplishes what our favorite samples of this genre do. The musical sequences are highly entertaining, uplifting and contagious". He also added that it’s everything a movie-goer would want in a movie and the timeless crowd-pleaser is most certainly highly recommended. He also added that Concepcion is simply sensational while Coleta <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Best Supporting Actor award. Cristina Martinez-Belen of Manila Bulletin also gave the film a positive review. She stated, [...] "...i’ve never enjoyed a Filipino movie as much as I enjoyed this(I Do Bidoo Bidoo) which is being dubbed the grand movie-oke of the year...very Filipino in soul and essence. And the performance of the stars is impeccably admirable and superb". One of the print ads for the film shows some of local movie critics’ assessment of the film. They herald “I Do Bidoo Bidoo” as “an endearing musical comedy” that’s [...] "highly entertaining, uplifting, affecting and contagious." [...] Another raved that the music of the APO Hiking Society that’s featured in the film “rocks.” Still another went as {{far as to say that}} it’s the “Best Picture Of The Year.” Ria Limjap of SPOT.ph also gave the film a favorable review stating, [...] "The pamamanhikan scene is brilliant: old fashioned metaphoric speech, initiating an awesome salawikain battle that segues into one of the most charming numbers in the movie (“Salawikain”)." [...] The same goes with the review from Philippine Entertainment Portal (PEP), stating that the movie is a total charmer and its production design is just as excellent, while every backdrop looks meticulously planned. It further added, [...] "Well-choreographed musical numbers help the film feel fresh, and the decision to use songs from the APO Hiking Society hike the nostalgia." [...] He also praises that all casts are perfect for the role. A review from GMA News gave the film a 4/5 rating. The writer, Job B. De Leon states that, [...] "...beyond the music and the actors, it draws strength from its script as it probes the different angles of a teenage pregnancy–how a young couple tries to deal with uncertainty and responsibility, and how parents recover when their darlings color outside the lines of their pre-drawn aspirationsfor all the film's dramatic build-up, there is no climactic moralizing or grand confrontation. Instead the denouement is set to song and highlights to audiences, young and old alike, that together with values like love, friendship and family, the music of APO is forever". The Cinema Evaluation Board, who gave the film the highest rating, [...] "A" [...] states that the film has exceptional performances. Mell Navarro of Independent Cinema Artists of the Philippines commented, [...] "A must-see film! Wonderful! Brilliant!". According to Bong Austero of Manila Standard Today, [...] "...It (I Do Bidoo Bidoo) is in many ways even better than foreign musicals. For one, it features music that has relevance and meaning in our lives. Second, it’s a movie that makes you feel good about being Filipino." [...] He further stated, [...] "...we are told that it is not exactly making the kind of money that Praybeyt Benjamin or No Other Woman made, which is really sad because I Do Bidoo Bidoo is infinitely better than those two other films, which were major blockbusters...if you don’t patronize movies like I Do Bidoo Bidoo, then you should stop complaining about the sorry state of Philippine cinema."Ateneo de Manila University's official publication, The Guidon gave the film 4 stars of 5 and included it at #6 on their [...] "2012 Top Films".|$|E
