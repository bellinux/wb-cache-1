5000|$|<b>Cloperastine</b> (INN) or cloperastin, {{also known}} as <b>cloperastine</b> {{hydrochloride}} (JAN) (brand names Hustazol, Nitossil, Seki) and <b>cloperastine</b> fendizoate (or hybenzoate), is an antitussive and antihistamine that is marketed as a cough suppressant in Japan, Hong Kong, and in some European countries. It was first introduced in 1972 in Japan, and then in Italy in 1981. The precise mechanism of action of <b>cloperastine</b> is not fully clear, but several different biological activities have been identified for the drug, of which include: ligand of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 20 nM) (likely an agonist), GIRK channel blocker (described as [...] "potent"), antihistamine (Ki = 3.8 nM for the H1 receptor), and anticholinergic. It is thought that the latter two properties contribute to side effects, such as sedation and somnolence, while the former two {{may be involved in}} or responsible for the antitussive efficacy of <b>cloperastine.</b>|$|E

Productive cough associated with catarrh is an important protective system for the lung because it favors the upward movement of secretions and foreign bodies to the larynx and mouth. Cough may also appear without bronchial secretions, as dry cough, which may be persistent when inflammatory disease is chronic or when, {{in the early stages}} of respiratory disease, bronchial secretions are not yet fluid. Sometimes bronchitis-induced cough does not significantly affect quality of life, whilst in other cases cough may become so intense as to impair daily activities severely, resulting in permanent disability. This type of cough is one of the most frequent reasons for seeking medical advice. The use of cough suppressants may be appropriate for reaching a precise diagnosis and when dry cough is persistent. <b>Cloperastine</b> has been investigated in various types of cough and, unlike codeine, has been shown to possess dual activity.

40|$|The {{classification}} of an impurity {{of a drug}} substance as genotoxic means that the “threshold of toxicological concern” (TTC) value of 1. 5 ug/day intake, considered {{to be associated with}} an acceptable risk, should be the admissible limit in the raw material and that leads to new analytical challenges. In this study, reliable chromatographic methods were developed and applied as limit tests for the control of three genotoxic impurities (GTIs) in <b>cloperastine</b> fendizoate, drug widely used as an antitussive active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In particular, GC–MS was applied to the determination of one alkyl halide (2 -chloroethanol, 2 -CE), while HPLC-DAD was selected for the analysis of two sulfonate esters (methyl p-toluenesulfonate, MPTS, and 2 -chloroethyl p-toluenesulfonate, CEPTS). Regarding GC–MS, strong anion-exchange (SAX) -SPE was applied to remove fendizoate from the sample solutions, due its low volatility and its high amount in the raw material. The GC–MS analysis was performed on a Factor Four VF- 23 ms capillary column (30 m × 0. 25 mm I. D., film thickness 0. 25 um, Varian). Single ion-monitoring (SIM) detection mode was set at m/z 80. In the case of HPLC-DAD, a suitable optimization of the chromatographic conditions was carried out in order to obtain a good separation of the impurity peaks from the drug substance peaks. The optimized method utilizes a SymmetryShield RP 8 column (250 mm × 4. 6 mm, 5 um, Waters) kept at 50 ◦C, withphosphate buffer (pH 3. 0; 10 mM) –methanol (containing 10 % ACN) (45 : 55, v/v) as the mobile phase, at the flow-rate of 1. 7 mL/min and UV detection at 227 nm. The required sensitivity level was achieved by injecting 80 uL of sample solution, purified from fendizoate by SAX-SPE, followed by a 1 : 1 (v/v) dilutionof the SPE eluate with water. For both GC–MS and HPLC-DAD, the method validation was performed in relation to specificity and limit of detection (LOD), as required by ICH guidelines in relation to limit assays. The developed methods were successfully applied for the determination of GTIs in five different batches of <b>cloperastine</b> fendizoate. In all the analyzed batches, the three target GTIs were below the concentration limit...|$|E

Specific binding of [(3) H] haloperidol {{in the presence of}} 25 nM spiperone was saturable and high affinity) Kd= 1. 96 ± 1. 31 nM, Bmax= 2. 37 ± 0. 27 pmol/mg of protein;n= 8). Among the 29 antipsychotics tested in inhibition studies, bromperidol and haloperidol were the most potent inhibitors (Ki= 0. 9 nM, 1. 0 nM, respectively). The conventional antipsychotics moperone, timiperone etc. and the novel promising drugs YM- 09151, Y- 516, BMY- 14802 and remoxipride potently inhibited [(3) H] haloperidol binding with the Ki in the range of low to moderate nanomolar. On the other hand, among the other 27 drugs tested, the antispasmodics eperisone and tolperisone, the antiischemic agents ifenprodil, the Ca(2 +) antagonist flunarizine and cinnarizine, and the antitussives carbetapentane, <b>cloperastine</b> and dextromethorphan, were especially potent inhibitors. These results, taken together with the evidence that the antiischemic agents ifenprodil and dextromethorphan antagozine NMDA responses and NMDA receptor complex is a possible site of action for neuroprotective agents, strongly suggest that σ receptors may be potential sites of action for antiischemic as well as antipsychotic drugs, i. e., σ receptors mediate the neuroprotective effects of certain antiischemic agents by affecting the NMDA receptor complex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cough {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} symptoms in children and is the most common symptom for which children visit a health care provider. Methods This is an observational study on acute cough associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in children. The study evaluates the epidemiology and impact of cough on quality of sleep and children's activities, and the outcome of cough with antitussive treatments in pediatric routine clinical practice. Study assessments were performed through a pediatric cough questionnaire (PCQ), developed by the Italian Society of Cough Study. A total of 433 children visited by family care pediatricians for acute cough due to a URTI were enrolled in this study, with mean age of 6. 1 years (SD 3. 6). Cough type, duration, severity and frequency, cough impact on sleep disturbances of children and parents and on school and sport activities were assessed at baseline. In a subset of 241 children who were either treated with antitussive drugs (levodropropizine n = 101, central antitussives n = 60) or received no treatment (n = 80), the outcome of cough after 6 days was analyzed in terms of resolution, improvement, no change, or worsening. Descriptive analysis, χ 2 test, and multivariate analysis with stepwise logistic regression were performed. Results Cough disturbed sleep in 88 % of children and 72 % of parents. In children treated with cough suppressants, the duration, type, intensity, and frequency cough were similar at baseline in the two groups respectively treated with levodropropizine and central antitussives (<b>cloperastine</b> and codeine). Both levodropropizine and central drugs reduced cough intensity and frequency. However, percentage of cough resolution was higher with levodropropizine than with central antitussives (47 % vs. 28 % respectively, p = 0. 0012). Conclusions Acute cough disturbs sleep in most children and their parents. Both levodropropizine and central antitussives reduced cough intensity, with levodropropizine producing a higher cough resolution rate. </p...|$|E
