40|$|The rapid {{prototyping}} capability offered by 3 D printing is considered advantageous for commercial applications. However, {{the ability to}} quickly produce precision custom devices is highly beneficial in the research laboratory setting as well. Biological laboratories require the manipulation and analysis of delicate living samples, thus {{the ability to create}} custom holders, support equipment, and adapters allow the extension of existing laboratory machines. Applications include <b>camera</b> <b>adapters</b> and stage sample holders for microscopes, surgical guides for tissue preparation, and small precision tools customized to unique specifications. Where high precision is needed, especially the reproduction of fine features, a printer with a high resolution is needed. However, the introduction of cheaper, lower resolution commercial printers {{have been shown to be}} more than adequate for less demanding projects. For direct manipulation of delicate samples, biocompatible raw materials are often required, complicating the printing process. This paper will examine some examples of 3 D-printed objects for laboratory use, and provide an overview of the requirements for 3 D printing for this application. Materials, printing resolution, production, and ease of use will all be reviewed with an eye to producing better printers and techniques for laboratory applications. Specific case studies will highlight applications for 3 D-printed devices in live animal imaging for both microscopy an...|$|E

30|$|The {{camera is}} {{connected}} to a device controller based on a powerful medical grade computer that is used for image storage and analysis. The device controller includes a <b>camera</b> <b>adapter</b> with a dedicated microprocessor for controlling the camera. Additionally, the <b>camera</b> <b>adapter</b> enables high-speed data transfer between the camera and controller. The Cytocam-IDF imaging device is supplied with an analysis application for quantification of microcirculatory parameters. The digitally recorded images can be analyzed automatically. It is also possible to analyze the recorded files off-line, as we did for this study. A novel feature of the device is its quantitative focusing mechanism, using a piezo linear motor with an integrated distance measuring system to position the sensor within 2 μm. Investigation has shown that each person has a characteristic depth of focus, which allows serial {{measurements to be made}} by pre-setting the characteristic focused depth [21].|$|R

50|$|Lenses for {{the earlier}} Canon FD lens mount are not usable for general {{photography}} on an EF or EF-S mount <b>camera,</b> unless <b>adapters</b> with optical elements are used {{because they are}} made for a flange focal distance of only 42.0 mm. Most of these lenses require autofocus and aperture motors inside the body which isn't available in EOS bodies. Infinity focus would be lost with an adapter which lacks optical elements. The Canon FD-EOS adapter is rare and is only usable with certain FD telephoto lenses. With a manual connection, the aperture and focus controls of the lens cannot be controlled or read from the camera; the lens must be focused manually. Since the only possible metering is through-the-lens, the lens must be manually stopped down to accurately meter at anything less than full aperture. (This is called stop-down metering.) With {{the introduction of the}} Canon EOS-M mirror-less digital <b>camera,</b> an inexpensive <b>adapter</b> allows the full use, including infinity focusing, of nearly all FD and FL lenses.|$|R
50|$|There {{is great}} {{debate in the}} Pentax {{community}} over the applicability and safety of adapters other than those supplied by Pentax. Many users of third-party infinity-focus adapters, such as Bowers, report difficulty in removing the <b>adapters</b> from <b>camera</b> bodies. Such <b>adapters</b> may require modification before they may be safely used. Official Pentax adapters, and flanged non-infinity-focus adapters, do not provoke such problems.|$|R
5000|$|These {{types of}} lenses are used on cameras which lack the {{facility}} {{to change the}} primary lens and therefore cannot accept a standard rear mount teleconverter, such as consumer and [...] "prosumer" [...] video cameras and camcorders, bridge cameras, point-and-shoot cameras and some older consumer medium format cameras. Some camera models have specifically designed teleside converters. Since teleside converters are afocal they can be mounted universally on almost any <b>camera</b> lens via <b>adapter</b> rings designed to fit the filter ring of the camera's primary lens.|$|R
50|$|A {{dandelion}} chip is {{an electronic}} device, {{installed on the}} bayonet mount of a non-electronic <b>camera</b> lens or <b>adapter,</b> which enables electronic interoperation with certain cameras.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the {{improvements to the}} image replicating imaging spectrometer (IRIS) {{and the development of}} novel applications in the field of oximetry. IRIS is a snapshot multispectral device with a high transmission output and no need of inversion for data recovering, hence, with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). IRIS shows great versatility due to the possibility of choosing multiple contiguous or non-contiguous wavelengths inside its free spectral range. IRIS uses a set of waveplates and Wollaston prisms to demultiplex the spectral information of an object and replicate the image of such object in different wavelengths. The birefringent nature of IRIS means that different wavelengths are separated by the Wollaston prisms with different angles, introducing multiple images of the same object. In addition, the spectral transmission function shows multiple spectral sidelobes that contaminate each IRIS band with light belonging to other wavelengths. These issues can lower the performance of IRIS as a multispectral imaging device. In this thesis, these problems were assessed with the introduction of a filter plate array placed in the image plane of the optical system. This filter array is a set of narrow-band filters (Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) = 10 ± 2 nm) that removes undesired wavelengths from each IRIS band. Since the spectral transmission of IRIS is replicated along the free spectral range, the filters can be designed to match any of the present spectral lobes in IRIS. The design and fabrication of a filter array enhance the performance of IRIS as a multispectral imaging device: it allows wavelength selection and improves spectral and spatial image quality. The design and manufacture of the corresponding filter holder and <b>camera</b> <b>adapter</b> were critical in terms of offering an easy filter-camera implementation. The filter plate allowed the removal of other dispersed wavelengths by the Wollaston prisms, improving image registration between the set of spectral images created by IRIS, and so, improving the quality of the registered spectral 3 -D cube. The implemented improvements on IRIS allow high quality, calibration-free oximetry using eight different wavelengths optimised for oximetry. Two main experiments were performed: 1) Using an inverted microscopy interfaced with IRIS and a linear spectral unmixing technique, we measured the deoxygenation of single horse red blood cells (RBC) in vitro in real time. The oximetry was performed with a subcellular spatial resolution of 0. 5 μ m, a temporal resolution of 30 Hz, and an accuracy (standard error of the mean) of ± 1. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{oscillation}} of a {{weld pool}} surface makes the fluid flow motion quite complex. Two-dimensional results cannot reflect {{enough information to}} quantitatively describe the fluid flow in the weld pool; however, there are few direct three-dimensional results available. In this paper, we describe a three-dimensional reconstruction method to measure weld pool surface features based on a single high-speed <b>camera.</b> A stereo <b>adapter</b> was added {{in front of the}} high-speed camera lens to obtain two images in the same frame from different view points at the same time.

40|$|The {{problem of}} preeclampsia is still {{relevant}} in obstetrics {{because of the}} high frequency of complications, severe and atypical forms, resistance to traditional methods of treatment and significant maternal and perinatal deaths. Despite advancements in revealing the mechanisms of preeclampsia, some of its units remain poorly understood and limit the pathogenic therapy. The objective of the research was to study the morphological properties of red blood cells in pregnant women with preeclampsia. Materials and Methods. We examined 23 pregnant women: 11 women with moderate preeclampsia and 12 women with severe preeclampsia at 28 - 39 weeks of gestation. The control group included 11 women with normal pregnancy. The average age of women was 22. 9 ± 0. 8 years. The morphometric study of red blood cells was performed using image analyzer, which consisted of a microscope Lyumam P- 8, optical <b>adapter,</b> <b>camera</b> Kocom (digital CCD colour camera KCC- 310 ND / PD) and PC. Software UTHSCSA Image Tool® for Windows® (version 2. 00) was used for measuring the metric characteristics of red blood cells. Digital material was processed using Microsoft Excel 2000 and Statistica 5. 11. Results. In moderate preeclampsia red blood cells of small and medium diameter with signs of severe defects dominated. In severe preeclampsia the number of red blood cells of large diameter increased. Anisocytosis was detected, red blood cells with uncharacteristic ratio of the surface area and shape factor of a profile dominated. Conclusions. It was noted that the development of preeclampsia caused the progression of changes in morphometric characteristics of erythrocytes toward increase in their degenerative forms with limited functional capacity which are directly related to the severity of the pathological process. ...|$|R
