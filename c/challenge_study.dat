40|$|Cases of Aeromonas {{diarrhea}} {{have been}} described all over the world. The genus Aeromonas includes ca. 30 species, of which 10 have been isolated in association with gastroenteritis. The dominating species that account for ca. 96 % of the identified strains are Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas dhakensis and Aeromonas hydrophila. However, the role of Aeromonas as a true enteropathogen has been questioned {{on the basis of}} the lack of outbreaks, the non-fulfilment of Koch’s postulates and the low numbers of acute illnesses in the only existing human <b>challenge</b> <b>study.</b> In the present study we reassess the enteropathogenicity of Aeromonas using dose response models for microbial infection and acute illness. The analysis uses the data from the human <b>challenge</b> <b>study</b> and additional data from selected outbreak investigations where the numbers exposed and the dose were reported, allowing their inclusion as natural experiments. In the <b>challenge</b> <b>study</b> several cases of asymptomatic shedding were found (26. 3 %, 15 / 57), however, only 3. 5 % (2 / 57) of those challenged with Aeromonas developed acute enteric symptoms (i. e. diarrhea). The natural experiments showed a much higher risk of illness associated with exposure to Aeromonas, even at moderate to low doses. The median dose required for 1 % illness risk, was ~ 1. 4 x 104 times higher in the <b>challenge</b> <b>study</b> (1. 24 x 104 cfu) compared to natural exposure events (0. 9 cfu). The dose response assessment presented in this study shows that the combined challenge and outbreak data are consistent with high infectivity of Aeromonas, and a wide range of susceptibility to acute enteric illness. To illustrate the outcomes, we simulate the risk associated with concentrations of Aeromonas found in different water and food matrices, indicating the disease burden potentially associated with these bacteria. In conclusion this study showed that Aeromonas is highly infectious, and that human susceptibility to illness may be high, similar to undisputed enteropathogens like Campylobacter or Salmonella...|$|E

We perform two studies in rhesus monkeys with Ad 35 /Ad 26 vectors expressing SIVmac 239 Gag/Pol/Env with or without an AS 01 B-adjuvanted SIVmac 32 H gp 140 protein boost. In a repetitive, low-dose <b>challenge</b> <b>study,</b> we observe robust protection against acquisition of infection by both Ad Alone and Ad/Env vaccines.

In this review, we highlight how the applica tion of transcriptomics to human <b>challenge</b> <b>studies</b> allows for the identification of novel correlates and gives insight into the immunological pathways required to develop functional immunity. In malaria challenge trials for example, innate immune pathways appear to play a previously underappreciated role in conferring protective immunity.

Furthermore, gene expression analysis facilitates the identification of host factors contributing to disease susceptibility, such as C 4 BPA expression in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection. Overall, these studies highlight the exceptional value of transcriptional data generated in human challenge trials and illustrate the broad impact molecular data analysis may have on global health through rational vaccine design and biomarker discovery...|$|R

40|$|Heart and {{skeletal}} muscle inflammation (HSMI) is a challenging disease of farmed Atlantic salmon, and was first discovered in farms {{situated in the}} coastal areas of Norway. Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) is the causative agent of HSMI but the mechanism of PRV infection in salmon is still unclear. The NS and NS proteins of PRV are predicted {{to be involved in}} the formation of viral factories. The aim of the present study was to investigate the co-localization of the NS and NS proteins in salmon cells. However, several attempts to amplify and clone the NS and NS genes into the bicistronic mammalian pIRES vector were unsuccessful. The PRV NS gene was successfully amplified from cDNA and was cloned into a pCR vector for further amplification and analysis. We failed, however, to amplify the NS gene after several attempts with different primers. The NS gene, previously cloned into a pcDNA 3. 1 vector, was therefore used and transfected into CHSE cells to identify the localisation of the NS gene product in these cells. The results showed that the NS protein localized both to the nucleus and to the cytoplasm of CHSE cells. In the present study we also investigated the presence of PRV and immune gene regulation in the spleen tissue of infected salmon using the experimental cohabitation challenge mode. In studies performed in freshwater (<b>challenge</b> <b>study</b> 1) and seawater (<b>challenge</b> <b>study</b> 2), we quantified PRV and the regulation of immune genes using the RT-qPCR technique. In this study we determined the regulation of CD 8 α, granzyme, perforin 1 a, perforin 1 b and viral gene copy numbers in freshwater salmon injected with PRV and in their cohabitants, and also in cohabitants in the corresponding study performed in seawater. In <b>challenge</b> <b>study</b> 1, we determined that CD 8 α was gradually increased in spleen tissue of both injected fish and cohabitants.

40|$|Despite {{long-term}} investment, influenza {{continues to}} be a significant worldwide problem. The cornerstone of protection remains vaccination, and approved vaccines seek to elicit a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of ≥ 1 : 40 as the primary correlate of protection. However, recent poor vaccine performance raises questions regarding the protection afforded and whether other correlates of protection should be targeted. A healthy volunteer <b>challenge</b> <b>study</b> was performed with a wild-type 2009  A(H 1 N 1) pdm influenza A challenge virus at the NIH Clinical Center to evaluate two groups of participants with HAI titers of ≥ 1 : 40 and < 1 : 40. The primary objective was to determine whether participants with HAI titers of ≥ 1 : 40 were less likely to develop mild to moderate influenza disease (MMID) after intranasal inoculation. HAI titers of ≥ 1 : 40 were protective against MMID but did not reduce the incidence of symptoms alone. Although the baseline HAI titer correlated with some reduction in disease severity measures, overall, the baseline NAI titer correlated more significantly with all disease severity metrics and had a stronger independent effect on outcome. This study demonstrates the importance of examining other immunological correlates of protection rather than solely HAI titers. This <b>challenge</b> <b>study</b> confirms the importance of NAI titer as a correlate {{and for the first time}} establishes that it can be an independent predictor of reduction of all aspects of influenza disease.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the oral health status and {{treatment}} needs and correlation between dental caries susceptibility and salivary pH, buffering capacity and total antioxidant capacity among students attending special schools of Mangalore city. Materials and Methods: In this study 361 subjects in the age range of 12 – 18 years were divided into normal (n = 84), physically challenged (n = 68), and mentally challenged (n = 209) groups. Their oral health status and treatment needs were recorded using the modified WHO oral health assessment proforma. Saliva was collected to estimate the salivary parameters. Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 17. Chicago. Results: On examining, the dentition status of the study subjects, the mean number of decayed teeth was 1. 57 for the normal, 2. 54 for the physically challenged and 4. 41 for the mentally <b>challenged</b> <b>study</b> subjects. These results were highly statistically significant (P < 0. 001). The treatment needs of the study subjects revealed that the mean number of teeth requiring pulp care and restoration were 1 for the normal, 0. 12 for the physically challenged, and 1. 21 for the mentally <b>challenged</b> <b>study</b> subjects. These results were highly statistically significant (P < 0. 001). The mean salivary pH and buffering capacity were found to be lowest among the mentally challenged subjects. Physically challenged group had the lowest mean total antioxidant capacity among the study subjects. Among the study subjects, normal students had the highest mean salivary pH, buffering capacity, and total antioxidant capacity. These results were highly statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: This better dentition status of the normal compared to the physically and mentally <b>challenged</b> <b>study</b> subjects could be due to their improved quality of oral health practices. The difference in the treatment needs could be due to the higher prevalence of untreated dental caries and also due to the neglected oral health care among the mentally <b>challenged</b> <b>study</b> subjects.
