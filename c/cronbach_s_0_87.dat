40|$|A {{cavitating}} high-pressure water-jet {{provided the}} means by which a range of materials (plastics, clay and concrete) were eroded. The measured erosion resistance was a proxy for an initially unknown combination of other properties: strength, fracture toughness, impact resistance, hardness, surface roughness, and limiting service temperature. To ascertain the cause of damage to sewers during high-pressure water-jetting, information about which material properties contributed to the measured erosion resistance under a standard high-pressure water-jetting test were found. The experimental work, and published literature, provided a database of physico-mechanical, physico-chemical, thermal and tribological material properties each of which in turn were correlated with the measured jetting resistance. The properties best correlated with the jetting resistance were: maximum service temperature (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 93), elastic modulus (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 90), surface roughness (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 89), density (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> <b>87),</b> and thermal conductivity (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> <b>87).</b> The correlation coefficient between jetting resistance and impact resistance (R 2  =  <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 56) lay just outside the top 10, suggesting that this was not an impact problem but a more complex combination of strength, roughness, and heat dissipation despite actual failures ultimately resulting from fracture (for which toughness was nevertheless also poorly correlated (R 2  =  − <b>0</b> <b>ṡ</b> 38)).

However, the information processing perspective has been criticized {{as a basis for}} knowledge-based system development (Suchman, 87) and interactive system development in general (Bannon & B 0 dker, 90), and alternative perspectives have been proposed.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{connection}} between electric dipole moment of the electron and the soft leptogenesis in supersymmetric B −L extension of the standard model. In this model, the B−L symmetry is radiatively broken at TeV scale. Therefore, it is a natural framework for low scale seesaw mechanism and also for implementing the soft leptogenesis. We show that the phases of trilinear soft SUSY breaking couplings A, which are relevant for the lepton asymmetry, are not constrained by the present experimental bounds on electric dipole moment. As in the MSSM extended with right-handed neutrinos, successful leptogenesis requires small bilinear coupling B, which is now given by AN and B − L breaking VEVs. SUSY B − L model with non-universal A-terms such that AN = 0 while Aν ̸ = 0 is a promising scenario for soft leptogenesis.

The two factors explained 50. 04 % of the variance (LV = 20. 24 % and FR = 29. 80 %). Inter-item correlations were all significant and the item-total correlations suggested the weakness of one item in the LV scale. <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha was <b>0.</b> 72 (LV) and 0. 79 (FR). Confirmatory factor analysis however provided marginal support for the posited structure. Vigorous types were significantly more alert than languid types across the day and suggested they are less influenced by sleep inertia on waking. Vigorous types also reported needing significantly less sleep. Significant differences in alertness between flexible and rigid types were found between 16 : 00 and 22 : 00 and suggested flexible types are less influenced by circadian and wakefulness factors during these periods. Flexible types also reported significantly less sleep need compared to rigid types. The findings suggested vigorous and flexible types would best cope with shiftwork.

Bird richness was sampled in 40 1 -ha sites over a range of urban environments in 329 surveys. NDVI and the per cent cover of built-up area were strongly and negatively correlated with each other, and were both very successful in explaining the number of bird species in the study sites.

40|$|Background/Purpose. Black {{women have}} lower injury {{prevalence}} after sexual assault and childbirth {{as compared to}} White women. Investigators have also published findings describing similar differences in wound healing and in pressure ulcer formation. Sommers et al. (2008) suggested that differences in injury prevalence may not be related to race or ethnicity, but rather to skin color, and that {{the properties of the}} skin may vary based on skin color. To explicate biomechanical differences that might influence the effects of skin injury versus protection, we chose to investigate the physiological constructs of viscoelasticity and skin color. The study aim was to account for the variability in skin viscoelasticity at four anatomical locations (volar forearm, upper inner arm, inner thigh, and sacrum) as a function of race/ethnicity, skin color, age, body mass index (BMI), recent weight loss, smoking status, sun exposure, and health status in women. ^ Methods. We enrolled 233 healthy adult female participants at a large urban university in this prospective study with a descriptive, cross-sectional design. Study staff collected data regarding health status and demographics via survey. We calculated BMI after obtaining height and weight measurements on-site and measured skin color with a handheld spectrophotometer and skin elasticity with the Cutometer MPA 580. We also developed and used the Sun Exposure Survey Instrument (SESI), which we first evaluated for content validity (S-CVI 0. 944) and internal consistency (<b>Cronbach.</b> <b>s</b> alpha <b>0.</b> 869, 17 items, N= 63) to measure sun exposure. ^ Results. Significant differences were found in viscoelasticity values across anatomic sites for all participants. The most significant predictor variables of skin viscoelasticity were age, recent weight loss, and BMI. R 2 results ranged from 0. 24 - 0. 41. The significance of the relationships between skin color, sun exposure, and race with viscoelasticity varied across sites. ^ Conclusions and Future Work. The association between aging and decreased skin elasticity is well known, but confirmed herein. The findings on BMI and weight loss are novel and require further investigation. While we explained little of the variance in skin elasticity through the skin color and sun exposure variables, we contend that these relationships should be reassessed with a greater number of participants and a more diverse sample. ...|$|R

Multivariate logistic regressions showed that adolescents' victimization {{and higher levels of}} depressive symptoms and family-related loneliness were associated concurrently with NSSI comparably in all three samples. However, multi-group analyses indicated that the association between NSSI and substance use varied significantly across samples, indicating that NSSI related more strongly to substance use (i. e., cigarette smoking and frequent marijuana use) in the sample from the United States rather than the samples from the Netherlands and Italy.

The length of our original scales to measure trust may limit their use because of the practical needs to minimize both respondent burden and research cost. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop three abbreviated scales to measure trust in: (1) a physician, (2) a health insurer, and (3) the medical profession. METHODS: Data from two samples were used. The first was a telephone survey of English-speaking adults in the United States (N = 1117) and the second was a telephone survey of English-speaking adults residing in North Carolina who were members of a health maintenance organization (N = 1024). Data were analyzed to examine data completeness, scaling assumptions, internal consistency properties, and factor structure.

Two instruments were administered: a questionnaire to explore some of the social habits of adolescents and their use of the three technologies considered, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The results confirmed that those with a higher socio-economic status use Internet more; the computer is used more by those who frequent a computer science section and by those with a higher socio-economic status. Loneliness emerged in relation to gender (higher in females), but not in relation to socio-economic status. Moreover it emerged at both the univariate and multivariate level in relation to the use of Internet and in negative relation to frequenting an informal peer group. A positive relationship between feelings of loneliness and number of friends who go on-line emerged only at the univariate level.

Neutrons were produced by spallation at the innovative n TOF facility at CERN; the γ rays from capture events were detected with organic C 6 D 6 scintillators. Experimental setup and data analysis procedures are described with emphasis on the corrections for detection efficiency, background subtraction, and neutron flux determination. At low energies, resonances could be resolved up to about 1 keV, yielding a resonance integral of 3575 ± 210 b, an average s-wave resonance spacing of (D 0) = 1. 49 ± 0. 07 eV, and a neutron strength function of (<b>S</b> <b>0)</b> = (3. <b>87</b> ± <b>0.</b> 33) x 10 − 4. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections are reported for thermal energies between 5 and 100 keV. These results are of relevance for nuclear structure studies, nuclear astrophysics, and nuclear technology. The new value of the Maxwellian-averaged cross section at kT = 30 keV is 3. 08 ± 0. 15 b, considerably larger than previous theoretical estimates, and provides better constraints for the thermodynamic conditions during the occurrence of the slow neutron capture process in low-mass stars during their asymptotic giant branch phase.

40|$|Leaf area is an {{important}} forest structural variable which serves as the primary means of mass and energy exchange within vegetated ecosystems. The objective {{of the current study}} was to determine if leaf area index (LAI) could be estimated accurately and consistently in five intensively managed pine plantation forests using two multiple-return airborne LiDAR datasets. Field measurements of LAI were made using the LiCOR LAI 2000 and LAI 2200 instruments within 116 plots were established of varying size and within a variety of stand conditions (i. e. stand age, nutrient regime and stem density) in North Carolina and Virginia in 2008 and 2013. A number of common LiDAR return height and intensity distribution metrics were calculated (e. g. average return height), in addition to ten indices, with two additional variants, utilized in the surrounding literature which have been used to estimate LAI and fractional cover, were calculated from return heights and intensity, for each plot extent. Each of the indices was assessed for correlation with each other, and was used as independent variables in linear regression analysis with field LAI as the dependent variable. All LiDAR derived metrics were also entered into a forward stepwise linear regression. The results from each of the indices varied from an R 2 of <b>0.</b> 33 (<b>S.</b> E. <b>0.</b> <b>87)</b> to <b>0.</b> 89 (<b>S.</b> E. <b>0.</b> 36). Those indices calculated using ratios of all returns produced the strongest correlations, such as the Above and Below Ratio Index (ABRI) and Laser Penetration Index 1 (LPI 1). The regression model produced from a combination of three metrics did not improve correlations greatly (R 2 <b>0.</b> 90; <b>S.</b> E. <b>0.</b> 35). The results indicate that LAI can be predicted over a range of intensively managed pine plantation forest environments accurately when using different LiDAR sensor designs. Those indices which incorporated counts of specific return numbers (e. g. first returns) or return intensity correlated poorly with field measurements. There were disparities between the number of different types of returns and intensity values when comparing the results from two LiDAR sensors, indicating that predictive models developed using such metrics are not transferable between datasets with different acquisition parameters. Each of the indices were significantly correlated with one another, with one exception (LAI proxy), in particular those indices calculated from all returns, which indicates similarities in information content for those indices. It can then be argued that LiDAR indices have reached a similar stage in development to those calculated from optical-spectral sensors, but which offer a number of advantages, such as the reduction or removal of saturation issues in areas of high biomass...|$|R

In addition, for n-type crystals, Ga(As,Sb) was harder than (A 1,Ga) As which in turn was harder than GaAs.

The growth of the plastic zone around the microhardness indentation region, examined by photoluminescence and x-ray topography, was not in any way less for the harder n-type Ga(As,Sb) or (GaAs) compared to p-type material indicating that n-type doping alone of the <b>0.</b> <b>87</b> ~m active layers will not be effective in reducing degradation by dark line defects.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of superconductivity SC {{in the ground}} state of the two-dimensional 2 D Hubbard model was investigated {{by means of the}} variational Monte Carlo method. The energy gain of the d-wave SC state, obtained as the difference of the minimum energy with a finite gap and that with zero gap, was examined with respect to dependences on U, electron density r and next nearest neighbor transfer tX mainly on the 10 = 10 lattice. It was found to be maximized around. XUs 8 the energy unit is nearest neighbor transfer t. It was shown to sharply increase for negative values of t and have a broad peak for tX;y 0. 10. For these value of tX the energy gain was a smooth increasing function of r almost independent of the shell structure in the region starting from; 0. 76 up to the upper bound of investigation 0. 92. This clearly indicates that the result is already close to the value in the bulk limit. For tX <b>s</b> <b>0,</b> the energy gain depended on the electronic shell state. This suggests the 10 = 10 lattice is not sufficiently large for this case, although it is highly plausible that the bulk limit value is finite.

When <b>S</b> <b>0</b> Lamb mode interacts with adhesive, reflection, transmission and generation of A 0 takes place.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. While the importance of assessing the occupational consequences of insomnia and other sleep disorders is emphasised in clinical nosologies and research guidelines, there is little consensus on which aspects of occupational performance should be assessed, how such impairment should be measured, and how outcomes should be reported. The research programme described in this thesis aimed to address this issue. Chapter 1 presents a systematic review and methodical critique of studies reporting those aspects of occupational performance most impacted by (or most frequently associated with) insomnia symptoms and degraded sleep quality. Equivocal results, wide variations in reporting conventions, and the overall lack of comparability among studies, strongly indicated {{the need to develop}} a standardised metric able to quantify sleep related occupational performance and serve as an assessment and outcome instrument suitable for use in research and clinical settings. Informed by the literature review, Chapters 2 - 4 describe the development and validation of the Loughborough Occupational Impact of Sleep Scale (LOISS), a unidimensional 19 item questionnaire that captures sleep-related occupational impairment across a number of workplace domains over a 4 -week reference period. Chapters 5 - 7 describe LOISS outcomes from: i) surveys in a random population sample; ii) a representative sample of the UK workforce; and iii) a clinical sample of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (before and after treatment with CPAP). Overall, the scale showed strong internal consistency (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha range= <b>0.</b> 84 - 0. 94) and test-retest reliability (r= 0. 77, r 2 = 0. 59, p< 0. 001), high levels of criterion validity (significantly discriminating between good and poor sleepers), and proved an effective outcome measure in OSA. From the survey data reported in Chapters 2 - 7, LOISS score distributions showed no consistent gender difference but did show a significant ageing gradient, with sleep-related occupational impairment declining with increasing age. In conclusion, the work presented here supports the usability, validity and reliability of the LOISS as an assessment and outcome instrument, and also demonstrates the utility of this instrument in exploring the dynamics of sleep-related occupational performanc...|$|R
