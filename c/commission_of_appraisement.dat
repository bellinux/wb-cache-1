40|$|AbstractSleep {{thermal comfort}} {{is one of}} the {{critical}} factors affecting sleep quality. In recent years, research not only investigates ways and products to improve whole body thermal comfort, but attaches great importance to local thermal comfort of peripheral skin. Healthy sleep containing cycle position change is considered to regulate body temperature. Mattress design contacted to human body provides direct impact on sleep comfort. Twelve healthy participants had general level in BMI were recruited in 2 -day sleep monitoring in simulated laboratory condition to evaluate two different design mattresses, one due to body segment location on the mattress, the other is according to position change during sleep. Sleep position, sleep quality data and skin temperature were examined. Through statistical analysis, this study deduced the relation between mattress design and all dependent variables <b>of</b> <b>appraisement.</b> All night sleep position change cycle and skin temperature in supine was slightly more stable was more regular and had less short phase body movement of the design due to sleep position change. Furthermore, the design due to position change contributed to reduction of sleep disturbance. Also, it promoted distal skin warming. The consequence indicated mattress design on the basis of posture change conformed particularly demands of local thermal comfort and enhanced sleep quality...|$|R
