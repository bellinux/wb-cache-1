60|$|Complete silence {{would have}} reigned {{but for the}} mellow sound of the distant fall and the sweet, plaintive cries of innumerable wildfowl that flew hither and thither, or revelled in the {{security}} of their sedgy homes. Flocks of wild geese passed in constant succession overhead, {{in the form of}} acute angles, giving a few trumpet notes now and then, as if to advertise their passage to the far north to the dwellers in the world below. Bustling teal rose in groups of dozens or half-dozens as the red canoe broke upon their astonished gaze, and sent them, with whistling wings, up or down the river. A solitary northern diver put up his long neck here and there to gaze for an instant inquisitively, and then sank, as if for ever, into the calm water, to reappear long after in some totally new and unexpected quarter. A napping duck or two, being wellnigh run over by the canoe, took wing with a tremendous splutter and a perfectly idiotical compound of a quack and a roar, while numerous flocks of plover, which had evidently meant to lie still among the sedges and hide while the canoe passed, sprang into the air at the unwonted hullabaloo, and made off, with diverse shriek and whistle, as fast as their wings could carry them. Besides these noisy denizens of the wilderness, there were seen, in various places, cranes, and crows, and magpies, and black terns, and turkey-buzzards, all of which were more or less garrulous in expressing surprise at the unexpected appearance of the trappers in their wild domain. And, just as the canoe drew near to the place {{at the foot of the}} fall where they meant to land and make the portage, a little <b>cabri,</b> or prong-horned antelope, leaped out of the woods, intending, doubtless, to drink, caught sight of the intruders, gave one short glance of unutterable amazement, and then rebounded into the bush like an electrified indiarubber ball.|$|E

50|$|At one point, it {{had been}} hoped to have the <b>Cabri</b> {{certified}} in 2003. In March 2005, the first production <b>Cabri</b> performed its first flight. Following a six-year development program and 300 hours of flight testing, the <b>Cabri</b> G2 received type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in December 2007. The granting of EASA certification made the <b>Cabri</b> the first twin-seat piston engine to be certified in more than 30 years.|$|E

50|$|Guimbal did not {{initially}} pursue {{enter into the}} North American market, having instead chosen to wait for demand from suitable customers to emerge. In February 2015, the <b>Cabri</b> G2 received type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), {{clearing the way for}} operations within the United States. By February 2016, the <b>Cabri</b> had received certification in 24 countries.|$|E
50|$|Following its {{national}} debut in 2011, the United Kingdom soon {{emerged as one}} of the major operating nations of the type, having 14 Cabris in service with various operators by February 2016; this has been projected to reach 28 by the end of 2016. In early 2015, Guimbal stated that the <b>Cabri</b> was in service with 32 operators worldwide, and that the firm presently had orders for another 100 aircraft. On 19 May 2017, the 200th <b>Cabri</b> was delivered to HeliGroup, the type's distributor in the United Kingdom; this delivery brought the U.K. fleet to 28, which was the largest national fleet of <b>Cabri</b> G2s in the world.|$|E

[...] Highways and Transportation Minister Pat Atkinson allocated $1 million in the spring of 2001. Summer crews resurfaced 6.5 km beginning 5 km west of <b>Cabri</b> and further westerly. This repair would now handle heavier truck loads on the route.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cabri</b> G2 is a two-seat light {{helicopter}} with a three-bladed fully articulated {{main rotor}} and a Fenestron-type tail rotor. The main rotor {{is designed to}} enable flight within a wide envelope of weather conditions, while the composite rotor blades are damage-tolerant and have no set life span. The use of the Fenestron has been credited as having made the <b>Cabri</b> noticeably quieter than competing rotorcraft such as the Sikorsky S-300, {{in addition to its}} favourable safety, handling, and maneuverability attributes. The <b>Cabri</b> uses a skid landing gear arrangement; unusually, the skids are attached to the fuselage by elastomeric mounts rather than being directly bolted on to reduce ground resonance and provide greater articulation. The fuselage features a damage-resistant all-composite monocoque construction, reducing weight and maintenance requirements while increasing strength.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Cabri</b> {{powered by}} a single [...] Lycoming O-360 piston engine, which has been derated to [...] The engine {{incorporates}} a solid-state electronic ignition system which protects against over-speed upon startup and has greater reliability. The engine mounts also utilize vibration isolation techniques for increased crew comfort. The engine is positioned directly behind the cabin, {{making it easier to}} access for maintenance; while the engine exhaust is elevated above the tail boom in order to reduce noise and lower the risk of ground fires upon landing. The maintenance costs of the <b>Cabri</b> are claimed to be [...] "very low", in part due to only three components on the rotorcraft being time-limited, all others being condition-limited instead. The cost per overhaul of the <b>Cabri</b> is half of that of comparable rotorcraft such as the Robinson R22.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, Eurocopter elected to sponsor the program, {{as well as}} {{providing}} technical assistance during testing. In April 1992, the first prototype <b>Cabri</b> G2-01 conducted its maiden flight, which lasted for a total of 45 minutes. In 1996, this prototype set a world record. In 2000, Bruno Guimbal left Eurocopter to establish a new company, Hélicoptères Guimbal, in order to certify the <b>Cabri</b> G2 and to place the type into commercial production. To this end, research and production facilities were set up in Aix-en-Provence Aerodrome, France.|$|E
