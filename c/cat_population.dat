5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|To date, little {{scientific}} data {{is available to}} assess the impact of cat predation on prey populations. Even well-fed domestic cats may hunt and kill, mainly catching small mammals, but also birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates. Hunting by domestic cats may be contributing to the decline in the numbers of birds in urban areas, although the importance of this effect remains controversial. In the wild, the introduction of feral cats during human settlement can threaten native species with extinction. In many cases, controlling or eliminating the populations of non-native cats can produce a rapid recovery in native animals. However, the ecological role of introduced cats can be more complicated. For example, cats can control the numbers of rats, which also prey on birds' eggs and young, so a <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> can protect an endangered bird species by suppressing mesopredators.|$|E
25|$|Feral cats live on all continents {{except for}} Antarctica. The {{worldwide}} feral <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> {{is estimated to}} be at least 100 million. The United States' feral <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> is estimated at 60 million, Australia's at 12 million, and Britain's at one million.|$|E

40|$|We used nine {{morphological}} {{genes to}} analyze <b>cat</b> <b>populations</b> from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, the Colombian, Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon, Bolivia and Brazil. Most populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the O locus. The highest allele frequencies so far detected at world level for alleles I (inhibitor) and L (long hair) {{were found at}} La Paz (Bolivia). The analyses revealed at least five cat gene pools in Latin America: These {{findings suggest that the}} current genetic distribution of cats in Latin America correlates with the colonization of the Americas during the XIV to XVIII centuries. Additionally, the <b>cat</b> <b>populations</b> of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Manaus were sampled, to compare their 1996 - 2003 genetic profiles with those obtained in 1983. Generally, these genetic profiles seem temporally stable, which is important for comparing <b>cat</b> <b>populations</b> sampled in different years and decades...|$|R
25|$|Up to 2,000 feral cats can in {{some years}} {{be found on the}} island; the {{population}} became established in the 19th century. Their depredations seriously harm the birdlife. Since the late 19th century, they have driven about 60% of the seabird species from the mainland completely, and during particular dry spells they will cross the mudflats and feast upon the birds on the motus. Spectacled tern chicks seem to be a favorite food of the local <b>cat</b> <b>population.</b> There are some measures being taken to ensure the <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> does not grow. That lowering the <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> by some amount would much benefit Christmas and its inhabitants is generally accepted, but the situation is too complex to simply go and eradicate them outright (which is theoretically possible; see Marion Island) – see below for details. A limited population of feral pigs exists. They were once plentiful and wreaked havoc especially on the Onychoprion and noddies. Pig hunting by locals has been encouraged, and was highly successful at limiting the pig population to a sustainable level, while providing a source of cheap protein for the islanders.|$|E
25|$|Italy has outlawed the {{euthanasia}} {{of healthy}} companion animals since 1991 and controls stray populations through trap, neuter and return programs. A compilation of 10 years' worth {{of data on}} feral cat colonies in Rome has shown that although trap-neuter-return decreased the <b>cat</b> <b>population,</b> pet abandonment was a significant problem. Dog attacks on Italian citizens and tourists have been blamed on a lack of enforcement of animal control laws in the country.|$|E
25|$|A feral <b>cat</b> <b>population,</b> {{descendants}} of cats likely brought by colonists in the 1930s, wrought disruption to the island's wildlife and vegetation. These cats were removed through efforts {{which began in}} the mid-1960s and lasted until 1990 when they were completely eradicated. Nineteenth-century tram track remains {{can be seen in the}} dried lagoon bed at the island's center and the late 1930s-era lighthouse-shaped day beacon still stands on the western shore at the site of Millersville.|$|E

25|$|Possession of an unneutered {{female cat}} on Kiritimati is illegal, and owners need {{to prevent their}} {{domestic}} cats from running wild (such animals are usually quickly killed in traps set for this purpose). Nighttime cat hunting has made {{little effect on the}} <b>cat</b> <b>population.</b> As noted above, vigorous protecting of active nesting grounds from cats by traps, poison and supplemented by shooting while otherwise leaving them alone to hunt rats may well be the optimal solution.|$|E
25|$|It {{may seem}} that the {{erstwhile}} numbers of seabirds may only ever be approached again by the wholesale eradication of the feral cats. While this has been since shown to be feasible, {{it is not clear}} whether even a severe curtailing of the <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> would be desirable. Though it previously was assumed that the small Polynesian rat is of little if any harm for seabirds, even house mice have been shown to eat seabird nestlings. Most nesting birds, in particularly Procellariiformes, are now accepted to be jeopardized by Rattus exulans. The Kiritimati's cats are meanwhile very fond of young seabirds; it even seems that their behavior has shifted accordingly, with cats being less territorial generally and congregating in numbers at active bird colonies, and generally eschewing rats when seabird chicks are in plenty.|$|E
500|$|Another folk tale {{involves}} Captain Charles Coon, an English seafarer {{who kept}} long-haired cats aboard his ships.

5000|$|North American {{wildlife}} organizations {{including the}} American Bird Conservancy and The Wildlife Society oppose TNR. They dispute its effectiveness at reducing feral <b>cat</b> <b>populations,</b> and claim that free-roaming cats {{are responsible for}} much of the decline in bird populations over the last number of years, killing 1.4 to 3.7 billion birds annually in the U.S. Rather than TNR, they recommend that free-roaming cats be taken to local animal shelters. The Wildlife Society [...] "supports and encourages the humane elimination of feral <b>cat</b> <b>populations,</b> including feral <b>cat</b> colonies, through adoption into indoor-only homes of eligible cats and humane euthanasia of unadoptable cats." [...] TNR advocates counter that cat predation is inflated. They argue that removing feral cats en masse can harm the environment and even birds; euthanizing healthy cats is inhumane, and even more expensive for public officials than TNR; and research and experience of TNR shows that community <b>cat</b> <b>populations</b> indeed decline. In the U.K., The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds states that {{there is no evidence that}} cat predation [...] "is having any impact on bird populations UK-wide".|$|R

2500|$|The {{wildlife}} {{is particularly}} vulnerable to introduced species and one particular problem has been cats. The main island {{is the home of}} a well-established feral <b>cat</b> <b>population,</b> descended from ships' cats.

2500|$|Domestic cats were {{introduced}} to Rottnest both as pets and as predators of commensal pest animals such as the black rat and house mouse at various times since European settlement. Historically, the Rottnest Island Authority has attempted to rid the island of all cats since the 1960s. It was suggested that cats may be influencing the abundance of native fauna and if left uncontrolled, the <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> was likely to increase and could result in considerable damage to ground nesting birds and heavy predation pressure on quokkas and reptile species.|$|E
2500|$|Quarantine is {{best for}} control of FCV in catteries and kennels. [...] However, FCV is very contagious, and latently {{infected}} cats will continue to shed viruses, so complete control is difficult. [...] An outbreak of VS-FCV at a humane society in Missouri in 2007 led to the euthanasia of the entire <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> (almost 200 cats) to contain it. [...] FCV may survive several days to weeks in a dry environment and longer in a cooler, wet environment. [...] Quaternary ammonium compounds are not thought to be completely effective, but a 1:32 dilution of household bleach used with a detergent and sufficient contact time does seem to kill the virus.|$|E

2500|$|There are 10 {{recorded}} {{species of}} mammals inhabiting the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. The Asian Small-Clawed Otter (Aonyx cinerea) [...] and the Smooth-coated Otter (Lutra perspicillata) are {{both on the}} IUCN Red List as Vulnerable species and Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) is presently listed as Endangered. Aonyx cinerea are considered ‘bioindicators’ of wetland ecosystems, therefore declining populations within Thale Noi are concerning and indicates deteriorating ecological conditions that threatens the biodiversity of the entire ecosystem. The most significant threat to these species are the loss of habitat and population fragmentation due to land conversion into rice paddies and shrimp farms (Mukherjees et al. 2010). [...] Over-fishing and trapping may {{also contribute to the}} declining Fishing <b>Cat</b> <b>population</b> in the region, due to a reduction of food availability and increased risk of being killed by farmers protecting their stock or being sold in the illegal pet trade. A recent study in 2013 [...] found that Fishing Cats in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area were almost completely nocturnal, making recording individual numbers difficult to establish.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the largest}} {{veterinary}} hospital chains in the U.S., Banfield, has released statistics on the recent rates of pet kidney failure. Banfield's veterinarians treat an estimated 6 percent of the nation's cats and dogs, and their findings provide [...] "the most authoritative picture of the harm done by the tainted cat and dog food," [...] according to the FDA. Based on analysis of data collected by more than 600 hospitals and clinics in 43 states, out of every 10,000 cats and dogs seen in Banfield clinics, three developed kidney failure during the time pet food contaminated with melamine was on the market. They reported 284 more cases of kidney failure in cats than the expected [...] "background rate," [...] corresponding to a 30 percent increase. During that period, the Banfield vets saw 100,000 cats. According to Hugh Lewis, who analyzed the results for Banfield, extrapolating to the United States <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> may mean [...] "several hundred cats a week across the country" [...] were affected. No similar statistically significant increase was seen among dogs, suggesting the contamination was more toxic to cats.|$|E
60|$|Seeing {{what was}} going forward, the judicious trappers and the {{enthusiastic}} artist considerately retired to the bower behind the house. What transpired at that strange interview no one can tell, for no one was present except the kitten. That creature, having recovered from its consternation, discovered, to its inexpressible joy, that, an enormous jug having been smashed by Bounce {{along with the other}} things, the floor was covered in part with a lakelet of rich cream. With almost closed eyes, intermittent purring, quick-lapping tongue, and occasional indications of a tendency to choke, that fortunate animal revelled in this unexpected flood of delectation, and listened to the conversation; but, not being gifted with the power of speech, it never divulged what was said--at least, to human ears, though we are by no means sure that it did not create a considerable amount of talk among the <b>cat</b> <b>population</b> of the settlement.|$|E
50|$|If given {{supplemental}} food {{or where}} rodents are plentiful, losses from predation or disease {{may be made}} up by new stray animals moving into territory. If given no supplemental food, particularly in areas with high numbers of predators, farm <b>cat</b> <b>populations</b> may occasionally become extirpated if there are few nearby strays and a low breeding population. Predators, accidents, disease, parasites and hunger will all take a toll. More often, especially when supplemental food is provided, overpopulation is common, and losses then occur primarily due to disease or accidents, with predation playing a minor role—all insufficient to make a substantial dent in the population. Where numbers become an issue, some farm <b>cat</b> <b>populations</b> are controlled by shooting, poisoning, or trapping excess numbers. Sometimes, excess numbers are given to animal shelters, but if the animals are feral, their chances of adoption are low.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} that dingoes can live with red foxes and feral cats without reducing their numbers in areas with sufficient food resources (for example, high rabbit numbers) and hiding places. Nearly nothing is known about the relationship of wild dogs and feral cats, except both mostly live in the same areas. Although wild dogs also eat cats, it is not known whether this affects the <b>cat</b> <b>populations.</b> At the moment, the Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre is investigating the exact effects of dingoes on the fox and <b>cat</b> <b>populations</b> to determine the benefits of keeping the dog in certain areas of Australia. In many areas, wild dogs live together with the most species of quolls , except for the eastern quoll, which is probably extinct on the mainland, so wild dogs are not regarded as a threat to them.|$|R

50|$|Farm cats {{originate}} {{from a variety}} of sources. Sometimes, property owners obtain and release a few cats specifically for rodent control.
