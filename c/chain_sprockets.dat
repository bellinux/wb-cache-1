50|$|A {{belt drive}} is still subject to stretch but {{operates}} very quietly, cleanly, and efficiently. A toothed belt is frequently used. However, {{they are not}} as durable when subjected to high horsepower as a chain. You can not alter the length and change final drive ratios as easily as chains. They also can not wrap as closely around as chains. And require larger pulleys compared to <b>chain</b> <b>sprockets</b> to get an effective final drive ratio. Replacing a drive belt typically requires removal of the swingarm, since belts cannot be split the way a chain with a master link can.|$|E

50|$|Engine {{timing was}} {{controlled}} by the all-steel, silent Morse timing chain (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover {{at the front of}} the engine block. The timing <b>chain</b> <b>sprockets,</b> one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{integrated approach}} to the testing and comparison of motorcycle drive chain lubricants is presented. This is a novel way of testing the lubrication by using loaded operating <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets.</b> A test rig {{has been designed to}} operate <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets</b> in a clean environment and allow direct comparison between different lubricants. The advantage of this method over previous techniques is that it allows the differentiation of lubricants in a more controlled operating environment and evaluates the overall lubricant performance as opposed to individual properties. The lubricants tested were a wax spray, PTFE spray and drip fed light oil. The test rig allowed measurement of the power saved by the lubricant in running the <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets.</b> <b>Chain</b> length and component masses were also taken before and after running the <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets</b> under load on the test rig. The results clearly show that any lubricant is preferable to none. The drip fed oil provided the greatest power saving and wear protection between the chain rollers and pins and the spray lubricants provided the highest level of protection between rollers and sprockets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Timing {{drive systems}} of recent {{passenger}} car engines are usually equipped with chain or synchronous belt drives. The comparatively low stiffness of chains and belts, {{combined with the}} large moments of inertia, resulting from moving parts of camshafts and valvetrains, lead to natural frequencies in the frequency range between 80 and 250 Hz for the entire timing drive [1]. Obviously, engine orders dominating the noise excitation {{are in the same}} frequency range, and resonance effects cannot be avoided. Furthermore, a guarantee is requested that occurring vibration amplitudes do not exceed acceptable limits. Hence, the predicted results of the primary dynamics of the timing drive are key data for the design analysis of a combustion engine. Besides the low frequency range excitation determined by main engine orders, higher-order structure-borne noise excitation is gaining more importance. This is particularly true for chain-driven systems where specic effects lead to considerable excitation of the engine structure in a higher frequency range (typical whine noise). The excitations are caused by the polygon effect, meshing impacts between chain links and sprockets and impacts in the engagement and disengagement between <b>chain,</b> <b>sprockets</b> and guides. This paper presents a comprehensive multi-body dynamics (MBD) model and the relevant simulation environment, which takes into account the entire timing drive as a fully coupled system. While simple MBD models (e. g. longitudinal span representation) are sufcient for the prediction of the primary dynamics of th...|$|E
