5|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>measures</b> {{occur on}} the western and the eastern fringes of the Peak District, and {{evidence}} of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The <b>Coal</b> <b>measures</b> on the eastern fringes of the Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the <b>Coal</b> <b>measures</b> on the western fringes form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E

40|$|The U. S.

The applicability of this additive to improve drilling performance in <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> rocks was demonstrated {{under field conditions}} at an abandoned mine land site in Pennsylvania and a producing coal mine property in Ohio. Penetration rate improvements ranging from 15 to 50 pet were obtained when core drilling {{through a variety of}} <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> lithologies. Drilling cost analysis indicates that the small added cost of using the polymer is more than offset by the savings that result from demonstrated increased drilling penetration rates, which translate into drilling cost savings of about 10 to 30 pct. This report also gives chemical analyses of a variety of <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> rocks and some corresponding local drilling water samples, obtained from a wide geographical base, along with threshold concentrations of PEO required to effect the improved drilling performance in these rocks.

30|$|This also {{suggests}} that the composition and carbon isotope ratios of the Xujiahe Formation gas in the central Sichuan Basin are inconsistent with the maturity of the source rocks. For instance, the carbon isotope ratio of the Xu 2 Member methane in the Hechuan region is lighter (− 39 to − 42  ‰), but the maturity R o of the lower <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> source rocks is 1.1 – 1.3, belonging to the substantial gas generation stage of <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> source rocks. Based on the statistical data from Dai (1992), the carbon isotope ratio of methane should be − 32 to − 36  ‰. In addition, the carbon isotopes of ethane and propane are also characterized by lightening, only the lightening amplitude decreases gradually. The experimental results show that such gas with low maturity was possibly formed and stored in the <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> source rocks at the early stage, but it was discharged, became free gas, and accumulated due to tectonic uplift at the late stage (Fig.  9).|$|R

30|$|Tight sand gas is an {{important}} unconventional gas resource occurring widely in different petroleum basins. In coal-bearing formations of the Upper Triassic in the Sichuan Basin and the Carboniferous and Permian in the Ordos Basin, <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> strata and tight sandstone constitute widely distributed source–reservoir assemblages and form the basic conditions {{for the formation of}} large tight sand gas fields. Similar to most tight gas basins in North America, the Sichuan, and Ordos Basins, all experienced overall moderate uplift and denudation in Meso-Cenozoic after earlier deep burial. Coal seam adsorption principles and actual coal sample simulation experiment results show that in the course of strata uplift, pressure drops and desorption occurs in <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> strata, resulting in the discharge of substantial free gas. This accounts for 28  %– 42  % of total gas expulsion from source rocks. At the same time, the free gases formerly stored in the pores of <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> source rocks were also discharged at a large scale due to volumetric expansion resulting from strata uplift and pressure drop. Based on experimental data, the gas totally discharged in the uplift period of Upper Paleozoic in the Ordos Basin, and Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the Sichuan Basin is calculated as (3 – 6) ×  108  m 3 /km 2. Geological evidence for gas accumulation in the uplift period is found in the gas reservoir analysis of the above two basins. Firstly, natural gas discharged in the uplift period has a lighter carbon isotope ratio and lower maturity than that formed in the burial period, belonging to that generated at the early stage of source rock maturity, and is absorbed and stored in <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> strata. Secondly, physical simulation experiment results at high-temperature and high-salinity inclusions, and almost actual geologic conditions confirm that substantial gas charging and accumulation occurred in the uplift period of the <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> strata of the two basins. Diffusive flow is the main mode for gas accumulation in the uplift period, which probably reached 56  ×  1012  m 3 in the uplift period of the Xujiahe Formation of the Sichuan Basin, compensating for the diffusive loss of gas in the gas reservoirs, and has {{an important}} contribution to the formation of large gas fields. The above insight has promoted the gas resource extent and potential of the <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> tight sand uplift area; therefore, we need to reassess the areas formerly believed unfavorable where the uplift scale is large, so as to get better resource potential and exploration prospects.|$|R
30|$|The adsorption–desorption {{principle}} of coal seam gas emission and simulation experiment results confirms that pressure drop and desorption {{occur in the}} uplift process of <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> formation, and the substantial free gas discharged becomes the gas source in the uplift period. Gas supply strength is estimated as up to (3 – 6) ×  108  m 3 /km 2 in the Upper Paleozoic of the Ordos Basin and the Xujiahe Formation of the Sichuan Basin, which significantly increases the resource potential of tight sand gas. The diffusion charge of desorbed gas {{in the course of}} <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> source rock uplift can compensate for the loss of gas due to diffusion after gas accumulation and contributes more to the formation of large gas fields.|$|R
30|$|Physical {{simulation}} is {{an important}} method to study and reproduce geological processes (Zeng and Jin 2002; Zhao et al. 2006). To better study the gas accumulation process of <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> tight sand formations in the uplift period, an experiment was conducted to simulate gas migration and accumulation under strata uplift and pressure drop settings. To prove the existence of gas desorption and expulsion from <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> formations in its uplift and pressure drop, a physical simulation experiment model was designed based on the configuration relation of source rocks and reservoirs of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the Sichuan Basin. Coal samples were crushed to 150 – 200 mesh, sandstone was replaced by glass beads, and natural gas in the formation was approximated by pure methane. A 3 D high-temperature and high-pressure physical simulation device independently designed by RIPED was used for experiment.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>coal</b> <b>measure</b> gas {{sources of}} coal-derived gas {{fields in the}} Late Paleozoic China are the Lower Carboniferous Dishuiquan Formation, the Upper Carboniferous Batamayineishan Formation and Benxi Formation, the Lower Permian Taiyuan Formation and Shanxi Formation, and the Upper Permian Longtan Formation.

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of <b>coal</b> <b>measures.</b> Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E
