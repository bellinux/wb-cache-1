Suspensions of benfuracarb, <b>carbosulfan</b> and carbo- furan in water were exposed to sunlight, with one set of dark controls, for 6 days, and analyzed by 1 H-NMR and HPLC. Acute toxicity tests were performed on Brachionus calyciflorus, Daphnia magna, and Thamnocefalus platyurus. Chronic tests were performed on Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Cerio- daphnia dubia. Under sunlight irradiation, benfuracarb and <b>carbosulfan</b> gave off carbofuran and carbofuran-phenol, while only carbofuran was detected in the dark experiments.

40|$|Only {{pyrethroid}} insecticides {{have so far}} been recommended {{for the treatment of}} mosquito nets for malaria control. Increasing resistance of malaria vectors to pyrethroids threatens to reduce the potency of this important method of vector control. Among the strategies proposed for resistance management is to use a pyrethroid and a non-pyrethroid insecticide in combination on the same mosquito net, either separately or as a mixture. Mixtures are particularly promising if there is potentiation between the two insecticides as this would make it possible to lower the dosage of each, as has been demonstrated under laboratory conditions for a mixture of bifenthrin (pyrethroid) and <b>carbosulfan</b> (carbamate). The effect of these types of treatment were compared in experimental huts on wild populations of Anopheles gambiae Giles and the nuisance mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say, both of which are multi-resistant. Four treatments were evaluated in experimental huts over six months: the recommended dosage of 50 mg m− 2 bifenthrin, 300 mg m− 2 <b>carbosulfan,</b> a mosaic of 300 mg m− 2 <b>carbosulfan</b> on the ceiling and 50 mg m− 2 bifenthrin on the sides, and a mixture of 6. 25 mg m− 2 <b>carbosulfan</b> and 25 mg m− 2 bifenthrin.

40|$|Background: Highly {{hazardous}} organophosphorus (OP) insecticides {{are responsible}} for most pesticide poisoning deaths. As they are removed from agricultural practice, they are often replaced by carbamate insecticides of perceived lower toxicity. However, relatively {{little is known about}} poisoning with these insecticides. Methods: We prospectively studied 1288 patients self-poisoned with carbamate insecticides admitted to six Sri Lankan hospitals. Clinical outcomes were recorded for each patient and plasma carbamate concentration measured in a sample to confirm the carbamate ingested. Findings: Patients had ingested 3 % carbofuran powder (719), <b>carbosulfan</b> EC 25 liquid (25 % w/v, 389), or fenobucarb EC 50 liquid (50 % w/v, 127) formulations, carbamate insecticides of WHO Toxicity Classes Ib, II, and II, respectively. Intubation and ventilation was required for 183 (14. 2 %) patients while 71 (5. 5 %) died. Compared with carbofuran, poisoning with <b>carbosulfan</b> or fenobucarb was associated with significantly higher risk of death [carbofuran 2. 2 %; <b>carbosulfan</b> 11. 1 %, OR 5. 5 (95 % CI 3. 0 – 9. 8); fenobucarb 6. 3 %, OR 3. 0 (1. 2 – 7. 1) ] and intubation [carbofuran 6. 1 %; <b>carbosulfan</b> 27. 0 %, OR 5. 7 (3. 9 – 8. 3); fenobucarb 18. 9 %, OR 3. 6 (2. 1 – 6. 1) ]. The clinical presentation and cause of death did not differ markedly between carbamates. Median time to death was similar: carbofuran 42. 3 h (IQR 5. 5 – 67. 3), <b>carbosulfan</b> 21. 3 h (11. 5 – 71. 3), and fenobucarb 25. 3 h (17. 3 – 72. 1) (p = 0. 99); no patients showed delayed onset of toxicity akin to the intermediate syndrome seen after OP insecticide poisoning. For survivors, median duration of intubation was 67. 8 h (IQR 27. 5 – 118. 8) with no difference in duration between carbamates. Reduced GCS at presentation was associated with worse outcome although some patients with <b>carbosulfan</b> died after presentation with normal GCS. Conclusions: We did not find carbamate insecticide self-poisoning to vary markedly according to the carbamate ingested although the case fatality varied according to the concentration and formulation of the insecticide. Carbamate poisoning {{did not appear to be}} much less toxic than poisoning with some liquid OP insecticide formulations, e. g., chlorpyrifos EC 40, that we have previously noted in these same hospitals (Lancet 2005, 366 : 1452 – 1459; QJM 2006, 99 : 513 – 522).

40|$|Insecticides {{belonging}} to the pyrethroid family are the only compounds currently available {{for the treatment of}} mosquito nets. Unfortunately, some malaria vector species have developed resistance to pyrethroids and the lack of alternative chemical categories is a great concern. One strategy for resistance management would be to treat mosquito nets with a mixture associating two insecticides having different modes of action. This study presents the results obtained with insecticide mixtures containing several proportions of bifenthrin (a pyrethroid insecticide) and <b>carbosulfan</b> (a carbamate insecticide). The mixtures were sprayed on mosquito net samples and their efficacy were tested against a susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae, the major malaria vector in Africa. A significant synergism was observed with a mixture containing 25 mg/m 2 of bifenthrin (half the recommended dosage for treated nets) and 6. 25 mg/m 2 of <b>carbosulfan</b> (about 2 % of the recommended dosage).

Plantações de trigo, milho e arroz no Brasil utilizam sementes tratadas com o inseticida carbofuran, associado ao corante rodamina B, que é atrativo às aves granívoras, causando notável mortalidade durante o plantio. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar se sementes camufladas minimizam a mortalidade de aves, causada pela ingestão de sementes tratadas com carbofuran. Possíveis alternativas para redução da mortalidade como carbofuran sem a rodamina B e o carbusulfan, foram testadas comparativamente. Realizaram-se três experimentos em regiões de expressiva mortalidade de aves no Paraná e São Paulo. Semeaduras foram convencionais sobre solo arado no sistema de plantio tradicional, utilizando 15. 896 kg de sementes em 111, 46 ha. Carcaças de aves foram coletadas e dissecadas, revelando quais tratamentos de sementes envenenadas causaram mortes. A mortalidade foi de 296 aves de 11 espécies.

40|$|The {{organophosphate}} pirimiphos-methyl and the carbamate <b>carbosulfan</b> {{were evaluated}} {{in comparison to}} the pyrethroid alphacypermethrin and the 'near-pyrethroid' etofenprox against pyrethroid resistant #Anopheles gambiae$ and #Culex$ spp. in an experimental hut station located in central Côte d'Ivoire. Bednets were impregnated with the above mentioned compounds and randomly allocated to the huts. On the 40 consecutive mornings, after sleepers had occupied the huts overnight, mosquitoes were collected from the huts, identified and scored as live or dead (including delayed mortality). #An. gambiae$ s. l. that had been collected were tested for the presence of the kdr allele in heterozygous or homozygous form. Both non-pyrethroid treatments caused very high mortality, whereas mortality with alpha-cypermethrin and etofenprox generally did not differ from the levels observed with untreated control nets in this experiment. The nets had holes cut in them and there was considerable bloodfeeding on the sleepers, which was only significantly reduced for #An. gambiae$ by <b>carbosulfan</b> and alpha-cypermethrin. PCR genotyping suggested that there was selection for the kdr resistance allele by the pyrethroid treated nets. Organophosphates and carbamates may therefore present an alternative to be used on bednets especially in areas of pyrethroid resistance, but the safety of these insecticides will have to be carefully considered.

40|$|Pressurized hot {{liquid water}} and steam {{were used to}} {{investigate}} the possibilities of extracting insecticides (carbofuran, <b>carbosulfan,</b> and imidacloprid) from contaminated process dust remaining from seed-pellet production. Extraction temperature {{was the most important}} parameter in influencing the extraction efficiency and rate of extraction, while varying the pressure had no profound effect. A clean-up procedure of the water extracts using solid phase extraction (SPE) was found to be necessary prior to final analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Quantitative extraction (compared to a validated organic solvent extraction method) of imidacloprid was obtained at temperatures of 100 - 150 °C within 30 min extraction time. Temperatures above 150 °C were required to extract carbofuran efficiently. The most non-polar analyte of the investigated compounds, <b>carbosulfan,</b> gave no detectable concentrations with pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE). One reason might be its low solubility in water, and when attempts are made to increase its solubility by increasing the temperature it may degrade to carbofuran. This can explain recovery values above 100 % for carbofuran at higher temperatures. A comparison of the PHWE results and those obtained with supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) revealed that PHWE is advantageous for polar compounds, where the solubility of the analyte in water is high enough that lower temperatures can be used. For non-polar compounds carbon dioxide based extraction is preferred unless the target analyte is highly thermostable...|$|E
