5|$|Avery Coonley {{began using}} <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> {{instruction}} in 1971 and offering computer programming to students {{as young as}} the fourth group in 1976. Desktop computers were brought into the classrooms to teach math, language arts, music, art, and computer programming, in 1978. Students begin learning basic keyboard and mouse skills in kindergarten and progress to multimedia presentations, data management, and software coding in the eighth group.|$|E
5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop <b>computers</b> (<b>for</b> example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hewitt Crane {{and his colleagues}} {{developed}} the world's first all-magnetic digital computer, based upon extensions to magnetic core memories. The technology was licensed to AMP Inc., who then used it to build specialized <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> controlling tracks in the New York City Subway and on railroad switching yards.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{became a}} center of {{technology}} after World War II. Engineering Research Associates was formed in 1946 to develop <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> the United States Navy. It later merged with Remington Rand, and then became Sperry Rand. William Norris left Sperry in 1957 to form Control Data Corporation (CDC). Cray Research was formed when Seymour Cray left CDC to form his own company. Medical device maker Medtronic also started business in the Twin Cities in 1949.|$|E

5|$|The Kingsley Public Library is the town's only library. The {{original}} {{building was}} built in 1967, later being redone in 1999 to house both the library and the city hall. It includes a large selection of books and DVDs. There are public <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> use by patrons and a story hour for children. The library also participates in an inter-library loan program.|$|E

50|$|Shutdown Day was an Internet {{campaign}} active between 2007 and 2009 {{which promoted}} {{the idea of}} a holiday when people would go without a <b>computer</b> <b>for</b> the entire day. The benefits attributed to not using a <b>computer</b> <b>for</b> 24 hours range from electricity savings to getting back in touch with friends and nature.|$|R

5|$|The {{model was}} {{originally}} developed for programming decompression <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> constant oxygen partial pressure closed circuit rebreathers.

5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes {{on one side of}} the binary point all the positive integer powers of 2, that are contained in the integer part of this number, and the negative powers to the other side of the binary point represent the fractional part. This system is consistently used to represent numbers in <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> hardware reasons.|$|E

5|$|The Brigade was {{composed}} entirely of active duty senior noncommissioned officers and officers who conducted training assistance and valuations {{for a variety}} of combat arms, combat support and combat service support units. A new building was constructed on Fort Stewart, Georgia for the Brigade and was occupied in August 1997. The First United States Army, the Brigade's higher headquarters, also purchased new furniture and <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> the Brigade's use. In 1999, the brigade was again reflagged as the 4th Brigade, 87th Division.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} the Battle of New York, Steve Rogers works in Washington, D.C. for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. under Director Nick Fury, while {{adjusting}} to contemporary society. Rogers and Agent Natasha Romanoff are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team, led by Agent Rumlow, to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from Georges Batroc and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> Fury. Rogers returns to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce to delay the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of SAS began in 1966 after North Carolina State University re-hired Anthony Barr to program {{his analysis of}} variance and regression software {{so that it would}} run on IBM System/360 computers. The project was funded by the National Institute of Health and was originally intended to analyze agricultural data to improve crop yields. Barr was joined by student James Goodnight, who developed the software's statistical routines, and the two became project-leaders. In 1968, Barr and Goodnight integrated new multiple regression and analysis of variance routines. In 1972, after issuing the first release of SAS, the project lost its funding. According to Goodnight, this was because NIH only wanted to fund projects with medical applications. Goodnight continued teaching at the university for a salary of $1 and access to mainframe <b>computers</b> <b>for</b> use with the project, until it was funded by the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations the following year. John Sall joined the project in 1973 and contributed to the software's econometrics, time series, and matrix algebra. Another early participant, Caroll G. Perkins, contributed to SAS' early programming. Jolayne W. Service and Jane T. Helwig created SAS' first documentation.|$|E
