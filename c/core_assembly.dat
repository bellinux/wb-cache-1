The tubes are fabricated from brass strip and coated with a brazing filler material in form of a powder based paste or an amorphous brazing foil is laid between the tube and fin. There is another method of coating the tube in-line on the tube mill. This is done using the twin wire-arc spray process where the wire is the braze alloy, deposited on the tube as it is being manufactured at 200-400 fpm.

40|$|The {{compaction}} of {{the bundle}} of <b>core</b> <b>assemblies</b> is {{an important aspect of}} the core design particularly for the next generation LMR. The core deformation, caused by dynamic condition like the seismic motion, may determine, at large or small extent, an assembly compaction generally characterized by a radial inward displacement, and subsequently result in a possible insertion of reactivity. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the deformation of core (and restraint system) geometry of the Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator - ALFRED (300 MWth). Numerical analyses have been carried out by the finite element MSC©Marc code to simulate the mechanical behaviour of the overall reactor system and, specifically, of the main components of the inner vessel, such as the lower and upper grid, the inner vessel, the support skirt, etc [...] Suitable boundary and initial conditions, such as that one related to the core sub-assemblies mass, the restrictions imposed to the geometrical in-structures connections, etc. have been assumed to numerically investigate the dynamic response of the structures, since confidence was established by sensitivity analyses of size and type of the adopted elements. The results indicate that the stresses overcome the yielding limit particularly in the upper part of the inner vessel, close to the flange support, in the upper grid and in the annular area neighboring the nozzle penetration. The displacement resulted of course variable along the height of the inner vessel, with a mean value of about 2 cm around the <b>core</b> <b>assemblies.</b> This research activity was developed and financed by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MSE) as part of the activities carried out in the framework of the AdP MSE-ENEA-CIRTEN PAR 2013...|$|R

Some of the phosphorylation sites (Ser 155, Ser 162 and Ser 170) of HBV (hepatitis B virus) Cp {{have been discovered}} and these sites are implicated in the regulation of viral genome encapsidation, capsid localization and nucleocapsid maturation. In the present report, the dimeric form of HBV Cp was phosphorylated by PKA (protein kinase A), but not by protein kinase C in vitro, and the phosphorylation of dimeric Cp facilitated HBV <b>core</b> <b>assembly.</b> Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization–time-of-flight analysis revealed that the HBV Cp was phosphorylated at Ser 87 by PKA. This was further confirmed using a mutant HBV Cp with S 87 G mutation. The S 87 G mutation inhibited the phosphorylation and, as a result, the in vitro HBV <b>core</b> <b>assembly</b> was not facilitated by PKA. In addition, when either pCMV/FLAG–Core(WT) or pCMV/FLAG–Core(S 87 G) was transfected into HepG 2 cells, few mutant Cps (S 87 G) as-sembled into capsids compared with the wild-type (WT) Cps, although {{the same level of}} total Cps was expressed in both cases.

We have now expanded this screen {{to identify the}} nonredundant components required for projectile assembly. The results, further supported by gene disruption experiments, indicate that six Grl proteins define the core structure. Both in vivo and in vitro data indicate that <b>core</b> <b>assembly</b> begins in the endoplasmic reticulum with formation of specific hetero-oligomeric Grl proprotein complexes.

40|$|AbstractDuring HIV- 1 morphogenesis, the {{precursor}} Gag protein is processed to release capsid (CA) proteins {{that form the}} mature virus core.

40|$|An {{evolutionary}} BWR {{fuel assembly}} design was studied {{as a means}} to increase the power density of current and future BWR <b>cores.</b> The new <b>assembly</b> concept is based on replacing four traditional assemblies and large water gap regions with a single large assembly. The traditional BWR cylindrical UO 2 -fuelled Zr-clad fuel pin design is retained, but the pins are arranged on a 22 x 22 square lattice. There are 384 fuel pins with 9. 6 mm diameter within a large assembly. Twenty-five water rods with 27 mm diameter maintain the moderating power and accommodate as many finger-type control rods. The total number and positions of the control rod drive mechanisms are not changed, so existing BWRs can be retrofitted with the new fuel assembly. The technical characteristics of the large fuel assembly were evaluated through a systematic comparison with a traditional 9 x 9 fuel assembly. The pressure, inlet subcooling and average exit quality of the new core were kept equal to the reference values. Thus the power uprate is accommodated by an increase of the core mass flow rate. The findings are as follows: - VIPRE subchannel analysis suggests that, due to its higher fuel to coolant heat transfer area and coolant flow area, the large assembly can operate at a power density 20 % higher than the traditional assembly while maintaining the same margin to dryout. - CASMO 2 D neutronic analysis indicates that the large assembly can sustain an 18 -month irradiation cycle (at uprated power) with 3 -batch refueling, < 5 wt% enrichment with < 60 MWD/kg average discharge burnup. Also, the void and fuel temperature reactivity coefficients are both negative and close to those of the traditional BWR core. - The susceptibility of the large <b>assembly</b> <b>core</b> to thermalhydraulic/neutronic oscillations of the density-wave type was explored with an in-house code. (cont.) It was found that, while well within regulatory limits, the flow oscillation decay ratio of the large <b>assembly</b> <b>core</b> is higher than that of the traditional <b>assembly</b> <b>core.</b> The higher core wide decay ratio of the large <b>assembly</b> <b>core</b> is due to its somewhat higher (more negative) void reactivity coefficient. The pressure drop in the uprated core is 17 %Vo higher than in the reference core, and the flow is 20 % higher; therefore, larger pumps will be needed. FRAPCON analysis suggests that the thermo-mechanical performance (e. g., fuel temperature, fission gas release, hoop stress and strain, clad oxidation) of the fuel pins in the large assembly {{is similar to that of}} the reference assembly fuel pins. A conceptual mechanical design of the large fuel assembly and its supporting structure was developed. It was found that the water rods and lower tie plate can be used as the main structural element of the assembly, with horizontal support being provided by the top fuel guide plate and <b>core</b> plate <b>assembly,</b> and vertical support being provided by the fuel support duct, which also supports the finger-type control rods. by Aydin Karahan.

40|$|The {{location}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleocapsid (<b>core</b> particle) <b>assembly</b> in infected cells remains controversial. Some lines of evidence implicate the nucleus; others favor the cytoplasm. Via injection of a synthetic mRNA encoding the HBV nucleocapsid protein (p 21. 5), we have expressed both unassembled p 21. 5 and nucleocapsidlike core particles in Xenopus oocytes. Subcellular fractionation reveals that approximately 91 % of the unassembled p 21. 5 and 95 % {{of the core}} particles are cytoplasmic, with only 9 and 5 %, respectively, in the nucleus. We present evidence showing that unassembled p 21. 5 equilibrates between nucleus and cytoplasm by passive diffusion and that intact core particles do not enter the nucleus.

On the basis of our data, we propose that in oocytes, most <b>core</b> particle <b>assembly</b> (up to 95 %) occurs in the cytoplasm, but that at least approximately 5 % of the cellular core particles are assembled in the nucleus and remain there.
