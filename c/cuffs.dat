The aetiology of rotator <b>cuff</b> deficiency is often multi-factorial {{and there are many}} facets towards successful management in this often debilitating condition. Evidence Acquisition We performed a literature search of MEDLINE and Embase databases using the terms large rotator <b>cuff</b> tears, fatty infiltration rotator <b>cuff,</b> rotator <b>cuff</b> atrophy, rotator <b>cuff</b> augmentation, rotator <b>cuff</b> tendon transfers, allografts rotator <b>cuff</b> repair, xenograft rotator <b>cuff</b> repair and synthetic grafts rotator <b>cuff</b> repair.

5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, <b>cuffs,</b> and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and <b>cuffs,</b> commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} 5 years {{the use of}} <b>cuffed</b> {{tracheal}} tubes in infants and children has become popular worldwide and is accepted by major medical authorities. The advantages of <b>cuffed</b> tracheal tubes in smaller children - in particular the almost 100 % chance to insert the right sized tracheal tube at the first attempt and their reliable sealing characteristics within the trachea - makes tracheal intubation and ventilation considerable easier and safer. This certainly compensates for the higher cost of <b>cuffed</b> compared to uncuffed tracheal tubes. The fear that <b>cuffed</b> tracheal tubes cause increased laryngeal damage in small children could not be confirmed, if adequately designed, <b>cuffed</b> tracheal tubes are correctly used. Conditions for the safe use of <b>cuffed</b> tubes in children are the availability of an adequately designed <b>cuffed</b> tube with a proofed recommendation for tube size selection and <b>cuff</b> pressure monitoring. The following rules must be fulfiled when <b>cuffed</b> tubes in children using are: confirmation of an air leak < 20 cmH 2 O inspiratory pressure with the <b>cuff</b> not inflated, <b>cuff</b> pressure limitation at 20 cmH 2 O and the avoidance of negative <b>cuff</b> pressures, resulting in sharp, cutting edges of the <b>cuff</b> membrane within the trachea...|$|R
40|$|In endotracheal intubation, a secured airway {{includes}} an insufflated <b>cuff</b> distal to the vocal cords. High <b>cuff</b> pressures {{may lead to}} major complications occurring after {{a short period of}} time. <b>Cuff</b> pressures are not routinely checked after intubation in the prehospital setting, dealing with a vulnerable group of patients. We reviewed <b>cuff</b> pressures after intubation by Helicopter Emergency Medical Services and paramedics noted in a dispatch database. Initial <b>cuff</b> pressures are almost all too high, needing adjustment to be in the safe zone. Dutch paramedics lack manometers and, therefore, only few paramedic intubations are followed by <b>cuff</b> pressure measurements. We recommend <b>cuff</b> pressure measurements after all (prehospital) intubations and, therefore, all ambulances need to be equipped with <b>cuff</b> manometers...|$|R
30|$|Even when well applied, {{discontinuous}} {{control of}} <b>cuff</b> pressure using a manometer is not efficient in keeping <b>cuff</b> pressure within the recommended range (20 to 30 cmH 2 O). In {{a cohort of}} 101 critically ill patients intubated with a PVC-cuffed tube, <b>cuff</b> pressure was continuously recorded for eight hours after manual adjustment of <b>cuff</b> pressure at 25 cmH 2 O [61]. Only 18 % of study patients spent 100 % of recording time with normal (20 to 30 cmH 2 O) <b>cuff</b> pressure. Fifty-four per cent of study patients developed <b>cuff</b> underinflation, 73 % developed <b>cuff</b> overinflation, and 44 % developed both. Thirty-three per cent of study patients developed underinflation or overinflation for[*]>[*] 30  minutes. No modifiable risk factor for underinflation or overinflation of the tracheal <b>cuff</b> was identified in that study. Duration of intubation and absence of sedation were independently associated with underinflation of the tracheal <b>cuff.</b> Percentage of time spent with underinflation of the tracheal <b>cuff</b> significantly increased during the recording period, suggesting that <b>cuff</b> pressure should be checked and regulated more frequently using a manometer. However, previous studies showed that the connection of manometer to external <b>cuff</b> {{is associated with a}} sudden drop in <b>cuff</b> pressure which might result in microaspiration [62, 63]. In another prospective study, our group aimed to determine the impact of <b>cuff</b> shape and material on <b>cuff</b> pressure [56]. Patients were intubated with PVC standard (n[*]=[*] 26), polyurethane cylindrical (n[*]=[*] 22), or polyurethane conical-shaped <b>cuffed</b> (n[*]=[*] 28) tracheal tubes. <b>Cuff</b> pressure was continuously recoded for 24  hours, and adjusted by nurses using a manometer thrice a day. Patients spent 51 % to 62 % of recording time within the normal range. No significant difference was found in percentage of time spent with underinflation, and overinflation between the three groups. However, coefficient of variation of <b>cuff</b> pressure was significantly higher in patients intubated with conical-shaped <b>cuffed</b> tracheal tubes compared with the two other groups.|$|R

Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{safe use}} of <b>cuffed</b> {{tracheal}} tubes for children necessitates a <b>cuff</b> pressure limitation at 20 - 25 cmH 2 O. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the reliability and benefit of a new <b>cuff</b> pressure release valve (opening pressure 20 cmH 2 O) for children intubated with a <b>cuffed</b> tracheal tube. METHODS: In a prospective, observational trial <b>cuff</b> pressure was recorded in paediatric and adolescent patients intubated with a <b>cuffed</b> tracheal tube during sevoflurane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia. The <b>cuff</b> pressure release valve was interposed between the <b>cuff</b> manometer and the pilot balloon. In 25 patients measurements were started at the initial opening pressure (group A) and in a further 25 patients measurements were started at the minimal sealing <b>cuff</b> pressure (group B). RESULTS: A total of 50 patients, aged from 0. 4 to 17. 8 years (median 7. 4 years) were enrolled in the study. The opening pressure measured (group A) was 19. 7 +/- 0. 8 cmH(2) O and the <b>cuff</b> sealing pressure (group B) was 11. 7 +/- 2. 9 cmH 2 O (range 6 - 16 cmH 2 O). Mean <b>cuff</b> pressure values in group A were 20. 4 +/- 1. 6 cmH 2 O and 16. 5 +/- 3. 3 cmH 2 O in group B. In one patient (group A) the <b>cuff</b> pressure exceeded 25 cmH 2 O and was manually decreased to 20 cmH 2 O. In total, 24 filling procedures (group A 14; group B 10) were required during 103. 1 h of investigation because of <b>cuff</b> pressure drop and audible air leakage, mainly caused by <b>cuff</b> pressure increases and consequent releases during patient positioning. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that the tested <b>cuff</b> pressure release valve was useful and reliable to limit <b>cuff</b> pressure in tracheal intubated children and adolescents within an acceptable pressure range...|$|R
