I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E
500|$|To {{mark the}} new era, on 20 January 1970, the couple shaved off their shoulder-length hair, {{an act that}} Britain's Daily Mirror {{described}} as [...] "the most sensational scalpings since the Red Indians went out of business". Lennon and Ono pledged to auction the shorn hair for a charitable cause, having similarly announced on 5 January that they would donate all future royalties from their recordings to the peace movement. Also while in Denmark, the Lennons, Cox and the latter's current partner, Melinde Kendall, discussed the concept of [...] "instant karma", whereby the causality of one's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime. Author Philip Norman writes of the concept's appeal: [...] "The idea was quintessential Lennon – the age-old Buddhist law {{of cause and effect}} turned into something as modern and synthetic as instant coffee and, simultaneously, into a bogey under the stairs that <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> if you don't watch out." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Not on Drugs" [...] is {{the opening}} track on Tove Lo's debut {{extended}} play, Truth Serum. According to the artist, {{the songs on}} the EP talk about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship from beginning to end, which started [...] "really happy and passionate". Following the narrative of Truth Serum, the track conveys the time when Lo was [...] "really {{in love with someone}} and [...] think straight" [...] and felt [...] "high" [...] all the time. She also stated that she wanted to write a happy and euphoric song that represented the positive beginning of her relationships, since most of her tracks are about the decay of them. In an interview with MTV UK, the artist said, [...] "'Not On Drugs' is, like many of my songs so far, about love. At least it's about the happy kind of love where you feel like there's nothing that <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> higher than the person you're with and have these feelings for". [...] "Not on Drugs" [...] was also included in [...] "The Love" [...] section of Lo's debut studio record, Queen of the Clouds, a concept album that describes the pattern of the singer's relationships.|$|E

500|$|Walter Afanasieff, long-time Mariah Carey collaborator, {{worked with}} Simpson on three cuts from Irresistible. One of the songs, [...] "When You Told Me You Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul. The message is there's so much in life that <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> discouraged, but if you trust that you're being watched over, you have a reason to live and a sense of freedom. It's different for everyone, but for me, my relationship with God is the way I clear out the shadows that hang in our lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Film sound {{re-recording}} is a time-honored practice. Sound designer Walter Murch {{is known}} for a technique called [...] "worldizing" [...] in which [...] "real world" [...] ambiance is added, via re-recording, to dry recorded program. Sound designer Nick Peck describes the worldizing process: [...] "Place a speaker in a room or location with the desired aural fingerprint and position a microphone {{some distance from the}} speaker. Next, play back your original sounds through the speaker and re-record them on another recorder, capturing the sound with all the reverberant characteristics of the space. This requires much time and effort, but when only the most authentic reproduction will do, worldizing <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mad Men has {{encouraged}} much discussion about gender. The show presents a subculture in which men, {{many of whom}} are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages. Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that [...] "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt {{with each other and with}} power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far back in our past as we would like to think. Our daughters continually get the messages that power still comes through powerful men. And unfortunately being pretty is still a quality that <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> on the ladder—though it still won't take you to the top." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hines {{recalled}} {{much of the}} group's early {{material as}} being [...] "primitive," [...] stating that [...] "the production on our early stuff didn't come up to par until [...] "Klap Ya Handz." [...] A producer named Dexx, also from Crown Heights, produced [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] for the group. In early 1991, Hines and Weston heard that EPMD would be hosting a talent show at Club Tropicana in Richmond, Virginia and decided to enter. Hines and Weston performed their song [...] "Klap Ya Handz," [...] which they'd recorded as a demo with Dexx (In fact, for the album, Hines and Weston had to rhyme over the demo for [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] because they didn't have an instrumental version of the music.). The group apparently had {{the highest score in}} the contest, which would earn the winner a $100 prize. However, according to Weston, although the duo had the highest score Parrish Smith, one half of the group EPMD, told the club announcer to give the second best group the prize. While the winning group went up to claim their prize, Smith came to Hines and Weston and said, [...] "yo, what would you guys rather have: a record deal or a hundred dollars? Meet me {{in the back of the}} club in five minutes." [...] Smith and Erick Sermon, the other member of EPMD, met with Hines and Weston in the back of the club and asked the two to play them the [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] track again. Sermon and Smith were so impressed by the song that they asked Hines and Weston for the tape, with Smith telling them, [...] "if you can get us nine more songs like the one you just performed, we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> a deal." [...] Hines and Weston kept in touch with EPMD during their junior year in college, finishing out the school year in May.|$|E
