40|$|AbstractThis paper {{summarizes}} {{the effect of}} activator ratio on the processing of <b>cement</b> <b>powder.</b> Geopolymer slurry was produced via alkaline activation of calcined kaolin. Once the geopolymer slurry solidified, it was crushed and ground to obtain <b>cement</b> <b>powder.</b> Ultilizing the concept of “just adding water”, hardened cement paste could be produced from <b>cement</b> <b>powder.</b> This paper concluded that solids-to-liquid and sodium silicate-to-sodium hydroxide ratios {{have a significant effect}} on compressive strength of hardened cement paste. The optimum solids-to-liquid and sodium silicate-to-sodium hydroxide ratios were 0. 80 and 0. 20, respectively. SEM micrographs showed that a processing route to produce <b>cement</b> <b>powder</b> by “just adding water” was possible, and the structure became denser and fewer unreacted particles were observed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cement</b> <b>powder</b> {{particles}} of micronic size tend to form agglomerates {{due to the}} influence of interparticle forces (Van der Waals forces). The formation of agglomerates results in an increased air-void in the solid structure (aerated powder) requiring an increase in water demand to sustain the feasibility of the structure. Consequently, if the compound formed is not stabilized, it would have low mechanical strength that may result in cracking of hardened cement. In this study, the results of <b>cement</b> <b>powder</b> consolidation and its flow properties show that its behaviour is controlled by internal forces (Van der Waals) and external forces (elastic and plastic). These forces have a direct influence on the powder structure, leading to a variable packing behaviour (void reduction).

Therefore, studies were conducted to identify and examine the factors that significantly influence {{the determination of the}} PSD in <b>cement</b> <b>powder</b> by LDS. Potentially, the most significant influence on variability of PSD measurement is the state of dispersion of the powder prior to analysis by LDS; dispersion efficiency will depend on factors such as solids concentration, choice of dispersion medium, and the application of chemical and/or mechanical de-agglomeration methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{distribution}} of particle sizes or {{particle size distribution}} (PSD) is a fundamental characteristic of <b>cement</b> <b>powder.</b> Accurate PSDs are required in computational efforts to model the hydration process {{and it is an}} important practical issue for the cement industry. Presently, the only available standard method for measuring the PSD of cement, namely ASTM C 115, is limited in scope, with a lower size detection limit of 7. 5 µm. Since there are no standard procedures that adequately cover the broad particle size range associated with portland <b>cement</b> <b>powder,</b> the implementation of different measurement techniques varies widely within the industry. Two ASTM-sponsored round robin tests were performed to (1) ascertain the techniques and methods currently used in the cement industry and (2) develop and refine a standard method or methods. The results have been incorporated into a best practice method based on the technique of laser diffraction. The aim of the current paper is to summarize the findings based on the data generated during the round robins and to summarize the various approaches available to measure the PSD of cement.

40|$|Superplasticiser (SP) is an {{indispensable}} {{ingredient in the}} production of contemporary concrete, which is designed to satisfy multi-concurrent performance criteria such as strength, flowability, passing ability, segregation and dimensional stability. Use of SP can decrease flocculation of fine powder and enhance the workability of concrete. However, {{at the same time it}} increases the shear thickening of concrete resulting in reduced pumping distance, less uniform mixing and more difficult on-site manual handling, e. g. shovelling or surface trowelling. Therefore, the SP dosage for concrete mix design should be limited, or more practically, fillers should be added to reduce the shear thickening. This paper proposes to decrease the shear thickening of <b>cement</b> <b>powder</b> paste by replacing part of the cement with an equal volume of filler. From the test results, it was evident that when fly ash, silica fume or limestone is added to replace cement, the shear thickening decreases significantly. Also, it was found that the shear thickening of <b>cement</b> <b>powder</b> paste can be correlated negatively to the wet packing density. As the wet packing density increases, the tendency of having clustering of particles or free polymer chains from the SP decreases and thus shear thickening...|$|R

Autologous bone has been the gold standard to date in spite of associated donor-site morbidity and the limited amount of available donor bone. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the progress of bone regeneration and material degradation of calcium phosphate granules (CPG) produced from a calcium phosphate self-setting <b>cement</b> <b>powder</b> compared to the use of autologous bone grafting in the treatment of "critical size defects" on load-bearing long bones of minipigs. Methods A critical size defect in the tibial metaphysis of 16 mini-pigs was filled either with autologous cancellous graft or with micro- and macroporous carbonated, apatic calcium phosphate granules (CPG) produced from a calcium phosphate self-setting <b>cement</b> <b>powder.</b> After 6 weeks, the specimens were assessed by X-ray and histological evaluation. The amount of new bone formation was analysed histomorphometrically. Results The semi-quantitative analysis of the radiological results showed a complete osseous bridging of the defect in three cases for the autograft group. In the same group five animals showed a beginning, but still incomplete bridging of the defect, whereas in the CPG group just two animals developed this. All other animals of the CPG group showed only a still discontinuous new bone formation. Altogether, radiologically a better osseous bridging was observed in the autograft group compared to the CPG group. Histomorphometrical analysis after six weeks of healing revealed that the area of new bone was significantly greater in the autograft group concerning the central area of the defect zone (p Conclusions Within the limits of the present study it could be demonstrated that autologous cancellous grafts lead to a significantly better bone regeneration compared to the application of calcium phosphate granules (CPG) produced from a calcium phosphate self-setting <b>cement</b> <b>powder</b> after 6 weeks.

40|$|Abstract. Development of an apatitic calcium {{phosphate}} bone cement is reported. 100 m Particles of tetra-{{calcium phosphate}} (TTCP) and {{dicalcium phosphate dihydrate}} (DCPD) were mixed in equimolar ratio to form the <b>cement</b> <b>powder.</b> The wetting medium used was distilled water with Na 2 HPO 4 as accelerator to manipulate the setting time. The <b>cement</b> <b>powder,</b> on wetting with the medium, formed a workable putty. The setting times of the putty were measured using a Vicat type apparatus and the compressive strength was determinedith a Universal Testing Machine. The nature of the precipitated cement was analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and energy dispersive electron microprobe (EDAX). The results showed the phase to be apatitic wi h a calcium–to–phosphorous ratio close to that of hydroxy-apatite. The microstructure analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed hydroxyapatite nano-crystallite growth over particulate matrix surface. The structure has an apparent porosity of ~ 52 %. There were no appreciable dimensional or thermal changes during setting. The cement passed the in vitro toxico-logical screening (cytotoxicity and haemolysis) tests. Optimization of the cement was done by manipulating the accelerator concentration so that the setting time, hardening time and the compressive strength had clinically relevant values...|$|R

While the conventional water-NaCl phase diagram would suggest that no freezing or damage would occur in samples saturated with 15 % and 23. 3 % NaCl solution by mass within the applied freeze-thaw temperature range, damage was observed.
