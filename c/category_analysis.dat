50|$|The book Recasting Women, {{in using}} gender as <b>category</b> of <b>analysis</b> {{in their study}} of Colonial India, {{reworked}} our notions of social reform. The authors used women’s question as entry point to recast our understanding of social reform in colonial India. Thus, the book foregrounds a different kind of gender history. The authors have shown through their studies how the middle class, who spearheaded the social reform movement, was gendered. They have also argued how the public and private sphere was redrawn. Thus they have made clear distinction between gender as category of description and <b>category</b> of <b>analysis.</b> By doing so, they recognized women as a separate <b>category</b> of <b>analysis</b> in history.|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} framework known as Six Category Intervention Analysis is described. This framework {{has been used}} in the teaching of interpersonal skills in various settings but there appears to be little or no empirical work to test out the theory. In the present study, an instrument was devised for assessing student nurses’ perceptions of their interpersonal skills based on the <b>category</b> <b>analysis.</b> The findings of the study are presented and a quantitative comparison is made with the results of an earlier study of trained nurses’ perceptions. Marked similarities were noted between the two sets of findings. The key trend to emerge was that both groups of nurses tended to perceive themselves as being more authoritative and less facilitative in their interpersonal relationships, in terms of the <b>category</b> <b>analysis.</b> This trend and others are discussed and suggestions made for future directions in research and training in the field of interpersonal skills in nursing. Implications for the theory of six category intervention analysis are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the study}} of aging merged out of Second-wave {{feminism}} during the 1960 ’s, aging has been associated exclusively with the time of old age. In this study I will revisit the assumptions which have underpinned the exclusive nature of this relationship in recent historiography through an analysis of a wide-range of primary sources addressing aging as a physiological and psychic process. Whilst aging was a much contested concept; a matter for speculation and fundamentally unquantifiable, it {{was also in the}} final analysis an unregulated process which could begin at any time of life. Whilst ideas of aging were constituted in a number of contexts: medical, theological and philosophical dominate this study, I will also illustrate ways in which practices and discourses of age were interrelated, each informing the other. Historians of age have in their own ways paraphrased Joan Scott’s definition of gender, statements have however been qualified by the prefix that a certain age; either childhood or old age is a useful <b>category</b> of <b>analysis.</b> My study eschews such an approach, arguing instead that for age to become a useful <b>category</b> of <b>analysis</b> we must firstly attempt to fully understand the process which gives rise to the value judgements that certain ages are a more useful <b>category</b> of <b>analysis</b> than others. Understanding aging will make are per se a useful <b>category</b> of <b>analysis</b> {{in the same way that}} studies of masculinity, in addition to studies of femininity, have made studies of gender a useful <b>category</b> o <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
