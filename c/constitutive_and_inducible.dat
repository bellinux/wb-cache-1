40|$|The {{deep-sea vent}} shrimp Rimicaris exoculata is {{believed}} to occur {{at the hot end}} of the hydrothermal biotope in order to provide essential elements to its epibiosis. Because it is found close to hot venting water, R. exoculata lives in a highly fluctuating environment where temperature (2 – 40 °C in the swarms) can exceed its critical maximal temperature (33 – 38. 5 ± 2 °C). In order to understand how this vent shrimp copes with hyperthermia, we compared its molecular heat stress response following an acute but non-lethal heat-shock (1 h at 30 °C) with that of its monophyletic shallow-water relative, the shrimp Palaemonetes varians, known to frequently undergo prolonged exposure at temperatures up to 30 °C in its natural environment during summer. We isolated four isoforms of heat-shock proteins 70 (HSP 70) in R. exoculata (2 <b>constitutive</b> <b>and</b> 2 <b>inducible</b> isoforms) <b>and</b> two isoforms in P. varians (1 <b>constitutive</b> <b>and</b> 1 <b>inducible</b> isoform) <b>and</b> quantitatively compared their magnitude of induction at mRNA level, using real-time PCR, in the case of experimentally heat-stressed shrimps, with respect to control (unstressed) animals. Here, we report the first quantification of the expression of multiple hsp 70 genes following heat stress in a deep-sea vent species living at 2300 m depth. Our results show a strong increase of hsp 70 inducible genes in the vent shrimp (not, vert, similar 400 -fold) compared to the coastal shrimp (not, vert, similar 15 -fold). We therefore propose that, the highly inducible molecular response observed in R. exoculata may contribute to the ability of this species to tolerate thermal extremes...|$|R

50|$|Aldehyde {{dehydrogenase}} is a polymorphic enzyme {{responsible for}} the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, which leave the liver and are metabolized by the body’s muscle and heart. There are three different classes of these enzymes in mammals: class 1 (low Km, cytosolic), class 2 (low Km, mitochondrial), and class 3 (high Km, such as those expressed in tumors, stomach, and cornea). In all three classes, <b>constitutive</b> <b>and</b> <b>inducible</b> forms exist.

50|$|Many resurrection plants use <b>constitutive</b> <b>and</b> <b>inducible</b> {{mechanisms}} {{to deal with}} drought and then later desiccation stress. Protective proteins such as cyclophilins, dehydrins, and LEA proteins are maintained at levels within a desiccation resistant species typically only seen during drought stress for desiccation sensitive species, providing a greater protective buffer as inducible mechanisms are activated. Some species also continuously produce anthocyanins and other polyphenols. An increase in the hormone ABA is typically associated with activation of inducible metabolic pathways. Production of sugars (predominantly sucrose), aldehyde dehydrogenases, heat shock factors, and other LEA proteins are upregulated after activation to further stabilize cellular structures and function. Composition of the cell wall structure is altered to increase flexibility so folding can take place without irreparably damaging {{the structure of the}} cell wall. 9. Sugars are utilized as water substitutes by maintaining hydrogen bonds within the cell membrane 8 Photosynthesis is shutdown to limit production of reactive oxygen species and then eventually all metabolic are drastically reduced, the cell effectively becoming dormant until rehydration.|$|E

Initial studies of the JP- 17 and JP- 59 (rat VP promoter / human growth hormone (hGH) reporter gene) transgenic lines detected expression of the reporter gene in the supraoptic nucleus (SON), but not the SCN, as determined by in situ hybridisation (ISH). Therefore, no further analysis of circadian clock-regulated VP expression could be conducted in these lines. Four (mPer 1) promoter / destabilised enhanced green fluorescent protein (d 2 EGFP)) (Y) transgenic lines were generated, but failed to express the EGFP reporter gene. Sequence analysis of the transgene failed to explain the absence of expression. Subsequent studies in the egr- 1 d 4 EGFP (57 C) transgenic line detected tissue-specific <b>constitutive</b> expression <b>and</b> <b>inducible</b> expression in the brain, as determined by ISH. Region-specific and physiologically-regulated expression in the pituitary gland was also detected, as determined by Northern blot and dual ISH / immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. Nevertheless, direct GFP fluorescence remained undetectable in this line. Seven egr- 1 /d 2 EGFP (Z) transgenic lines were then generated using a novel construct lacking the egr- 1 intron present in the 57 C construct.

She was particularly interested in Streptomyces, the soil bacteria from which the antibacterial agent known as streptomycin is derived. Her most important discovery was of the existence of isozymes of kynurenine formamidase in the bacterium S. paravulus. Isozymes are enzymes that have slightly different amino acid sequences but regulate the same biochemical reactions. In the case of S. paravulus, isozymes are used to catalyze the development of antibacterial compounds. In 1980, while at Georgetown, she became the co-author of “Evidence of a <b>Constitutive</b> <b>and</b> <b>Inducible</b> Form of Kynurenine Formamidase,” that was published the journal Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics. Her research helped demonstrate that bacteria are more complex organisms than most scientists had previously believed. In an interview by Megan Sullivan for the National Science Teachers Association, Emeagwali states: “The overall goal of my work has always been to answer fundamental questions about cellular processes. I also like my work to have potential significant applications in the medical field…A typical day involves checking on previous experiments, setting up new investigations, and analyzing data.

40|$|Expression {{of human}} {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) molecules is essential for antitumour immune responses. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) up-regulates HLA and, paradoxically, programmed cell death ligand- 1 (PD-L 1), which inhibits immune activation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK), overactivated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), is implicated in HLA and PD-L 1 expression.

The traditional view of the plant cell wall as a passive barrier has evolved to a concept that considers the wall as a dynamic structure that regulates both <b>constitutive</b> <b>and</b> <b>inducible</b> defence mechanisms, and as a source of signalling molecules that trigger immune responses. The secondary cell walls of plants also represent a carbon-neutral feedstock (lignocellulosic biomass) for the production of biofuels and biomaterials.

40|$|Allergic asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} airways' disease, characterized by allergen-induced {{early and late}} bronchial obstructive reactions, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway inflammation and airway remodelling. Recent ex vivo and in vivo studies in animal models and asthmatic patients have indicated that arginase may {{play a central role}} in all these features. Thus, increased arginase activity in the airways induces reduced bioavailability of L-arginine to <b>constitutive</b> (cNOS) <b>and</b> <b>inducible</b> (iNOS) nitric oxide synthases, causing a deficiency of bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory NO, as well as increased formation of peroxynitrite, which may be involved in allergen-induced airways obstruction, AHR and inflammation. In addition, both via reduced NO production and enhanced synthesis of L-ornithine, increased arginase activity may be involved in airway remodelling by promoting cell proliferation and collagen deposition in the airway wall.

40|$|Why {{are some}} traits <b>constitutive</b> <b>and</b> others <b>inducible?</b> The term costs often appears in work {{addressing}} this issue {{but may be}} ambiguously defined. This review distin-guishes two conceptually distinct types of costs: phenotypic costs and plasticity costs. Phenotypic costs are assessed from patterns of covariation, typically between a focal trait and a separate trait relevant to fitness. Plasticity costs, separable from phenotypic costs, are gauged by comparing the fitness of genotypes with equivalent phenotypes within two environments but differing in plasticity and fitness. Subtleties associated with both types of costs are illustrated by {{a body of work}} addressing predator-induced plasticity. Such subtleties, and potential interplay between the two types of costs, have also been addressed, often in studies involving genetic model organisms. In some in-stances, investigators have pinpointed the mechanistic basis of plasticity. In this vein, microbialwork is especially illuminating andhas three additional strengths.
