40|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>powders</b> {{from various}} sources were {{manufactured}} and characterized to investigate the influence of their crystallinity index, surface area, and pore volume on sorption phenomena and the relevant pharmaceutical functionality. The influence of the cellulose crystallinity index on moisture sorption was important at low and intermediate relative humidities. At high relative humidities, properties such as surface area and pore volume took precedence in governing the moisture sorption process. The theory of physical adsorption of gases onto fractal surfaces was useful for understanding the distribution of water in cellulose and the inner nanoscale structure of cellulose particles. It was found that, {{as a consequence of}} swelling, moisture induces a fractal nanopore network in <b>cellulose</b> <b>powders</b> that have a low or intermediate degree of crystallinity. On the other hand, no swelling occurs in highly crystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>powders</b> and moisture sorption is restricted to the walls of the open pores. No correlation was found between the cellulose crystallinity index and the incorporation and release of nicotine in cellulose mixtures. By loading nicotine in highly porous matrices of the Cladophora sp. algae cellulose, higher stability against oxidative degradation, higher loading capacity, and more steady release into an air-stream was achieved than when commercially available microcrystalline cellulose was loaded. It was also shown that, by manipulating the structure of cellulose, the undesired hydrolysis of acetylsalicylic acid in mixtures with cellulose can be avoided. It was suggested that a broad hysteresis loop between the moisture adsorption and desorption curves of isotherms at low relative humidities could be indicative of an improved compatibility between acetylsalicylic acid and cellulose. In all, this thesis demonstrates how the pharmaceutical functionality of microcrystalline cellulose can be improved via engineering of the structure of native <b>cellulose</b> <b>powders...</b>|$|R
3000|$|... α-Cellulose (<b>powdered</b> <b>cellulose)</b> was {{obtained}} from the corn cob using inorganic substances following a procedure based on that reported elsewhere (Azubuike et al. 2011). Briefly, the method involved the delignification of the cellulosic material with 3.5 % nitric acid and 0.01 % sodium sulphite at 90 °C for 2 h followed by treatment with 2 % sodium hydroxide extraction and 2 % sodium sulphite at 50 °C for 1 h and 17.5 % sodium hydroxide at 80 °C for 0.5 h. Bleaching was carried out with 3.2 % sodium hypochlorite at 40 °C for 1.5 h. The α-cellulose powder obtained from the corn cob was hydrolyzed at room temperature with 2 N hydrochloric acid under reflux for 15 min (Paralikar and Bhatawdekar 1988); the solid-liquor ratio was 1 : 10. The hydrolyzed cellulose was thoroughly washed with cold distilled water until neutral to litmus paper and then air dried. The microcrystalline cellulose obtained via this process was labelled MCMSa. This procedure was repeated for the α-cellulose for reflux times of 30 and 45 min, respectively; the microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>powders</b> obtained via this process were labelled MCMSb and MCMSc, respectively. The physicochemical, spectroscopic and thermal properties of the microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>powders</b> obtained from the corn cobs were compared with that of Avicel® PH 101 (MCCA).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a new method to predict the flow behavior of pharmaceutical powders using a multichamber microscale fluid bed. Different amounts of poorly flowing paracetamol were added to various grades of microcrystalline celluloses and silicified microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>powders.</b> Magnesium stearate was used as a lubricant. Experimental minimum fluidization velocities (umf) were defined using 2 to 4 g (equal to 10 mL) of material (Video 1). The reference flowability of the powders was determined using a specific flow meter. Also, the weight variation of the compressed powders, using a single-punch press, was measured. When the amount of paracetamol in the excipients was increased, the experimentalumf increased and the fluidization behavior grew worse (Video 2). Principal component analysis (PCA) established that the pressure difference over the bed as a function of fluidization velocity could be used to characterize the behavior of powders. The increase in poor fluidization behavior of the powders was in accordance with the increasing amount of paracetamol and with the increasing weight variation of the tablets. Furthermore, the angle of repose and the flow rate of silicified microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>powders</b> were predicted using a partial least squares (PLS) model. The developed method to predict flowability is a promising approach for use in the preformulation and formulation stages of new drug candidates, for example...|$|R
5000|$|The {{stationary}} phase or adsorbent in column chromatography is a solid.

Also possible are ion exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography (RP), affinity chromatography or expanded bed adsorption (EBA). The stationary phases are usually finely ground powders or gels and/or are microporous for an increased surface, though in EBA a fluidized bed is used. There is an important ratio between the stationary phase weight and the dry weight of the analyte mixture that can be applied onto the column. For silica column chromatography, this ratio lies within 20:1 to 100:1, depending on how close to each other the analyte components are being eluted.|$|E

Powder flow and compactibility {{results showed that the}} application of nano-thin polymer layers on the fibers turned non-flowing, non-compacting <b>cellulose</b> into <b>powders</b> {{that can be used in}} the direct compression of tablets. The powder flow properties and tableting indices of compacts compressed from these nanocoated microfibers were similar or better than that of directly compactible microcrystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>powders.</b> <b>Cellulose</b> microfibers coated with four PSS/PVP bilayers had the best compaction properties while still producing tablets that were able to absorb water and disintegrate and did not retard the dissolution of a model drug acetaminophen. The advantages of nanocoating rather than traditional pharmaceutical coating are that it add less than 1 % to the weight of the fibers and allows control of the molecular properties of the surface and the thickness of the coat to within a few nanometers. This process is potentially friendlier to the environment because of the type and quantity of materials used. Also, it does not involve acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and neutralization of depolymerized cellulose. [URL]...|$|R

Moreover, among the microcrystalline cellulose samples obtained from corn cob, thermal analysis studies showed that the MCMSa sample had the highest residual char weight at 550 °C and the lowest value of inflection slope. Since farmers generate a lot of corn cob as a waste material, it would ultimately be a cheaper source than that of the costly Avicel® brand of microcrystalline cellulose.|$|R

The hydrophobization was done by heterogeneous esterification with three carboxylic acids which differ in chain length (3, 10 and 18 carbons).

It was demonstrated that the esterification significantly decreases thermal {{stability of}} the material, which reduces feasible processing window. Under non-oxidative atmosphere, the single-step decomposition of materials is prevailing, while the process is more complex in air. In both cases the oleic acid esters showed the lowest stability and the original cellulose was the most stable. Finally, all powders were compounded with polyethylene or polypropylene.

Similar tablets containing blends of the microcrystalline cellulose and α-lactose monohydrate {{as well as those}} containing pure microcrystalline cellulose were also produced.

It also showed better flow properties (Carr’s index of 18. 9 % and Hausner’s ratio of 1. 23). Compact density of tablets increased but tensile strength decreased with increase in the proportion of chitosan in the binary mixtures. In contrast to lactose, the disintegration time increased and the dissolution rate decreased with increase in the proportion of chitosan. This study has shown that chitosan promotes flowability of powder mix and rapid disintegration of tablet.
