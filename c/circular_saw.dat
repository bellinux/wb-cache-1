5|$|Goldfinger—notably {{featuring}} 007 {{being threatened}} with the novel's <b>circular</b> <b>saw,</b> {{rather than the}} film's laser beam—and Diamonds Are Forever. In 1991 a TV cartoon series James Bond Jr. was produced with Corey Burton {{in the role of}} Bond's nephew, also called James Bond.|$|E
5|$|Steve Frankel was {{the only}} {{carpenter}} on set, which made him the art direction's sole contributor. For exterior shots, Frankel had to produce several elaborate props with a <b>circular</b> <b>saw.</b> Otherwise, the cabin mostly remained {{the way it was}} found during production. The cabin had no plumbing, but phone lines were connected to it.|$|E
5|$|The 1973 BBC {{documentary}} Omnibus: The British Hero featured Christopher Cazenove {{playing a}} number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond), including James Bond in dramatised scenes from Goldfinger – notably featuring the hero being threatened with the novel's <b>circular</b> <b>saw,</b> rather than the film's laser beam – and Diamonds Are Forever.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} Analysis of cutting process of {{thermally}} modified wood using <b>circular</b> <b>saws</b> is to present a comprehensive summary of available findings and knowledges about this particular process. The {{first part of the}} study deals with the <b>circular</b> <b>saws,</b> its history, division and particularly characteristics of the blade, as well as its geometry, possible materials for its production and maintenance. In the second part is described the process of cutting itself, namely the features which accompany the process, also the kinematics of <b>circular</b> <b>saws,</b> cutting resistance and cutting force. The third part deals with thermally modified wood, its principles, the production processes, features and machining of thermo wood using <b>circular</b> <b>saws...</b>|$|R

5|$|Two men, Brad and Ryan, {{wake up in}} a {{metropolitan}} storefront window, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> {{in front of each}} of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw. As the scene draws attention and police arrive, a puppet informs the men that they can kill each other or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut, but ultimately choose to allow Dina to die instead.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.|$|E
5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did {{high-power}} industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table to which Bond was strapped.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Circular</b> saw: a <b>saw</b> with a <b>circular</b> blade which spins. <b>Circular</b> <b>saws</b> can {{be large}} {{for use in}} a mill or hand held up to 24" [...] blades and {{different}} designs cut almost any kind of material including wood, stone, brick, plastic, etc.|$|R
25|$|The <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> is a metal disc or blade with {{saw teeth}} {{on the edge}} {{as well as the}} machine that causes the disk to spin. It may cut wood or other {{materials}} and may be hand-held or table-mounted. Tabitha Babbitt is credited with inventing the first <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> used in a saw mill in 1813.|$|E
25|$|The carpenter's shed was {{attached}} to the north end of this, but not to the engine shed. It had a <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> powered by the workshop steam engine.|$|E

25|$|The Breton-Prétot {{machine was}} a saw {{designed}} {{to cut the}} barbed wire protecting enemy trenches of World War I. The first version consisted of a small <b>circular</b> <b>saw,</b> driven by a six hp engine, attached to a long lever that was placed on a small cart with four wheels, {{that had to be}} pushed towards its objective. Breton proposed the machine to the French government in November 1914 and a prototype was tried in January 1915, when it was shown that the system in this form had little practicality. The use of caterpillar tracks was discussed that same month, but since none was available at that time, the system was then mounted at Liancourt {{on the back of a}} Bajac tractor in an attempt to obtain all-terrain mobility, towards the end of February 1915. The small <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> was replaced by a large vertical saw with thirteen teeth, but a larger horizontal <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> was added, just above ground level to cut the barbed-wire poles. In July the system was again changed, the horizontal saw being left out and large deflection shields being placed to protect the wheels. Eight small bronze cannon were used as simulation weights.|$|E
25|$|In the novel, Goldfinger captures Bond {{and threatens}} {{to cut him}} in half with a <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> as Oddjob tortures him using his {{pressure}} points. Bond offers to work for Goldfinger {{in exchange for his}} life, but Goldfinger refuses to spare him, and he blacks out.|$|E
25|$|A {{table saw}} or {{sawbench}} is a woodworking tool, {{consisting of a}} <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, mounted on an arbor, that is driven by an electric motor (either directly, by belt, or by gears). The blade protrudes through {{the surface of a}} table, which provides support for the material, usually wood, being cut.|$|E

2500|$|The {{seed cotton}} {{goes into a}} Cotton gin. The cotton gin {{separates}} seeds and removes the [...] "trash" [...] (dirt, stems and leaves) from the fibre. In a <b>saw</b> gin, <b>circular</b> <b>saws</b> grab the fibre and pull it through a grating that is too narrow for the seeds to pass. A roller gin is used with longer staple cotton. Here a leather roller captures the cotton. A knife blade, set close to the roller, detaches the seeds by drawing them through teeth in <b>circular</b> <b>saws</b> and revolving brushes which clean them away.|$|R
50|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>saws</b> can be solid tooth(straight saw steel {{which are}} bent to give {{clearance}} of the saw blade) or can have carbide, Stellite or insert teeth that don't need swaging.|$|R
25|$|In the 1830s several {{technologies}} {{came together}} to allow an important shift in wooden building construction. The <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> (1777), cut nail machines (1794), and steam engine allowed slender pieces of lumber such as 2"x4"s to be efficiently produced and then nailed together in {{what became known as}} balloon framing (1832). This {{was the beginning of the}} decline of the ancient method of timber frame construction with wooden joinery.|$|E
25|$|An edge tone {{occurs when}} a jet impinges on a fixed surface. A {{trailing}} edge tone {{occurs when a}}n exterior flow passes over a trailing edge. There is a whistle that {{is a combination of}} an edge tone and a trailing edge tone and might be called a wake-edge tone. It occurs in rotating circular saws under idling conditions and may be called the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> whistle. Under load conditions, blade vibration plays a role which is not addressed here.|$|E
25|$|A {{radial arm}} saw has a <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> mounted on a sliding {{horizontal}} arm. In addition to making length cuts a {{radial arm saw}} may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the radial arm saw. A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|E

2500|$|Timber mills use {{very large}} {{bandsaws}} for ripping lumber; they are preferred over <b>circular</b> <b>saws</b> for ripping {{because they can}} accommodate large-diameter timber and because of their smaller [...] (cut size), resulting in less waste.|$|R
25|$|A biscuit joiner (or {{sometimes}} plate joiner) is a {{woodworking tool}} used to join {{two pieces of}} wood together. A biscuit joiner uses a small <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or wood composite panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or particle wood) is covered with glue, or glue is applied in the slot. The biscuit is immediately placed in the slot, and the two boards are clamped together. The wet glue expands the biscuit, further improving the bond.|$|E
500|$|Filming of {{the trap}} scenes, which was done last, began in March. The film's opening trap scene was filmed at Metro Hall in Toronto, Ontario, just outside Roy Thomson Hall, and {{included}} 400 extras. [...] In the trap, the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades were actually real and functional, but safety precautions were taken for the actors. One actor {{that was in}} the trap, Jon Cor, told Demon FM that he had scars on his hands from the shackles, and said the other actors, Sebastian Pigott chipped his tooth and Anne Lee Greene lost the feeling in her feet and had to receive medical attention.|$|E
500|$|... "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend", {{the slowest}} {{song on the}} album, was solely written by Tommy and pays homage to love songs by pop music acts of the 1960s. The song used a 12-string guitar, glockenspiel, and tubular bells in its composition, and was said by author Scott Schinder to be an [...] "unexpected romantic streak". The next song, [...] "Chain Saw", opens {{with the sound of}} a running <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> and was {{influenced}} by the 1974 horror film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. At nearly 180 beats per minute, [...] "Chain Saw" [...] had the fastest tempo among the album's songs, and according to Rombes, is the most [...] "home-made" [...] sounding.|$|E
50|$|From 1973 to 1985 {{the factory}} was intensively enlarged. A new foundry started {{production}} of cast iron. New productive halls were built and in 1983 a new division was opened in Bisztynek, producing farmer’s <b>circular</b> <b>saws.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{years from}} 1960 saw the company grow with the {{introduction}} of a range of machinery for the 'Do it yourself' market and educational training. The range included thicknessers, <b>circular</b> <b>saws,</b> planers, bandsaws and wood lathes.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} stone sawing during stone processing. It {{is divided into}} theoretical and practical parts. In the theoretical part diamond blades, the sawing process and stone extraction are described. The practical part {{is focused on the}} wear of <b>circular</b> <b>saws</b> in granite <b>circular</b> <b>sawing.</b> The wear is determined for two diamond cutting blades made by different manufacturers and is determined by the blade weight loss and segments height loss as a function of time. Both measured values show linear dependence. The results are the basis for a future comparison of the two diamond blades on the economic side, which is not the subject of this work...|$|R
