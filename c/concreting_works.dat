40|$|Testing the {{mechanical}} properties (especially compressive strength and tensile strength) of concrete {{is one of}} the most crucial stages of construction works. To control the quality of concrete, there are various moulds that are used for casting concrete samples during <b>concreting</b> <b>works</b> according to different standards at different countries. On the other hand, it is known that different shapes and sizes of concrete samples can cause variations in results of compressive strength or splitting tensile strength. This research concentrated on the effect of specimen sizes and shapes on compressive and splitting tensile strength of concrete, cured at different conditions and tested at both early and late ages. At the end of experimental study, hardened density, non-destructive tests (i. e. rebound hammer and PUNDIT), compressiv...|$|E

The laboratory tests were performed according to the standard of the Japan Society of Civil Engineers. Both the fine and coarse aggregates, especially the later, are generally poor comparing with those of Japan, consequently it is emphasized to develope the unique specifications by using those representative aggregates {{to make a good}} correlation with the <b>concrete</b> <b>works</b> on Okinawa Islands...|$|R
40|$|Concrete is the {{predominant}} construction material in Bangladesh. In large projects, stringent quality control procedures are usually followed {{under the supervision}} of experienced engineers and skilled labors. However, in the case of small projects and particularly at distant locations from major cities, proper quality control is often an issue. It has been found from experience that such quality related issues mainly arise from inappropriate proportioning of concrete mixes and improper curing conditions. In most cases external curing method is followed which requires supply of adequate quantity of water along with proper protection against evaporation. Often these conditions are found missing in the general construction sites and eventually lead to production of weaker concrete both in terms of strength and durability. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the performance of general <b>concreting</b> <b>works</b> of the country when subjected to several adverse curing conditions that are quite common in various small to medium construction sites. A total of six different types of adverse curing conditions were simulated in the laboratory and samples were kept under those conditions for several days. A set of samples was also submerged in normal curing condition having proper supply of curing water. Performance of concrete was evaluated in terms of compressive strength, tensile strength, chloride permeability and drying shrinkage. About 37 % and 25 % reduction in 28 -day compressive and tensile strength were observed respectively, for samples subjected to most adverse curing condition as compared to the samples under normal curing conditions. Normal curing concrete exhibited moderate permeability (close to low permeability) whereas concrete under adverse curing conditions showed very high permeability values. Similar results were also obtained for shrinkage tests. This study, thus, will assist concerned engineers and supervisors to understand the importance of quality assurance during the curing period of concrete...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{main advantages}} and disadvantages of mobile mortar concrete plants in comparison with stationary concrete mixing units. The main idea of the mobility is to provide quick movement. In its turn, this approach imposes some restrictions on dimensions and weights of concrete mixing equipment. However {{in the context of the}} concrete mixing equipment and construction site as whole the mobility concept is considered in the form of three components: minimum expenses on site preparation for assembly of a mortar concrete plant, transportability, reduction in installation and startand-adjustment periods. In this regard processing chain for production of concrete and mortar mixes is divided in separate complete operations. Then it is necessary to develop modules which are performing the required operations. Every module is developed in accordance with the size of a shipping container in order to make transportation convenient. Detachable connections are stipulated in the place of module linkages, electrical wiring, pipelines for supply water and chemical admixtures, pneumatics. Henceforth, these connections make it possible to reduce time for on-site assembly and disassembly of the equipment. The paper presents a mobile mortar concrete unit of block-module arrangement which has been developed within the framework of the State Scientific Research Programme at the BNTU. The unit has been manufactured using production capacities of JSC “Viprotekh” and it has been successfully introduced in production process. One of the promising directions is to use the mobile mortar concrete plants which are located and which are operating directly on construction sites. Their economic efficiency becomes higher with an increase of distance to the nearest stationary mortar concrete unit and scope of <b>concreting</b> <b>works.</b> Mobile mortar concrete plants are mainly intended for construction organizations which are realizing construction projects away from urban infrastructure and transportation networks: bridges, dams, highways, transport junctions. While ensuring the same production output of concrete these plants are located in close proximity to the construction site and the required mortars can be supplied directly to the site with the help of special concrete pumps. </p...|$|E
