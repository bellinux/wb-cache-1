50|$|The fatal {{accident}} on pit road was the trigger {{for a series}} of new pit road procedures in the Winston Cup Series. At this time, pit road had no speed limit, which meant that cars would blast down pit road in order to lose the least amount of time. Drivers were essentially waved into their pit stall by a sign board man who would stand out in pit lane holding up their team's pit board. (Examples of this {{can be seen in the}} movie Days of Thunder.) In addition, pit road was not closed when the caution was first displayed, which would result in cars rushing into the pits before the pace car picked up the field. This was first curtailed by the banning of tire changes under caution, an extremely unpopular move (all other services were still allowed though). The pit road <b>closing</b> <b>procedures</b> (that continue today in a modified form) also began with this pit procedure. New rules for pit crews that required crews to stay on the other side of the pit wall from the cars until their car was one stall away were instituted.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to try to clarify <b>closing</b> <b>procedure</b> of the double entry {{bookkeeping}} under the Asset-and-Liability View.

New methods for ring formation of planar, heterocyclic quinones, with the indolo[3, 2 b]carbazole or indolo[2, 3 -b]carbazole structures are described. The synthesis of indolo[3, 2 b]carbazole- 6, 12 -dione has been performed via ring oxidations or with two novel ring <b>closing</b> <b>procedures.</b> The corresponding indolo[2, 3 -b]carbazole- 6, 12 -dione has been prepared in a related ring closing process with trifluoroacetic anhydride as the principal reagent. Five metabolites formed from the high affinity Ahr ligand, indolo[3, 2 -blcarbazole 6 carboxaldehyde have been identified. The precursors for their synthesis, the appropiate 2, 3 'bisindolylketones, have been prepared in a Lewis acid mediated acylation involving different indoles and indolyl- 2 -carbonyl chlorides. Synthesis of the metabolites proved the assigned structures as 2 -hydroxy-, 8 -hydroxy-, 2, 10 -dihydroxy-, 4, 8 -dihydroxy- and 2, 8 dihydroxyindolo[3, 2 -b]carbazole- 6 -carboxaldehydes. The corresponding hydroxylated acids and 6 -unsubstituted indolo[3, 2 -b]carbazoles have also been prepared. 2 Hydroxyindolo[3, 2 b]carbazole- 6 -carboxaldehyde has also been sulfated with pyridine-sulfur trioxide and isolated as the barium salt. The Vilsmeier reaction was first used to prepare highly activated 2, 3 '-biindolyls in triflic anhydride mediated couplings between substituted oxindoles and methyl. 5, 6 dimethoxyindole- 2 carboxylate.

A small perforation {{was made in the}} linea alba through the window, extended to 2  cm using a pair of scissors, and then the laparotomy procedure was completed. A simple continuous suturing pattern through both the peritoneum and the muscle layers was employed to close the inner incision with 5 - 0 PDS-II sutures (Johnson & Johnson K.K., Tokyo, Japan); 0.05  ml of Marcaine™ (Bupivacaine hydrochloride hydrate, AstraZeneca K.K., Osaka, Japan) was applied to the incision as a local analgesic aid. The skin was closed with a needle attached to 5 - 0 nylon suture (Monosof, COVIDIEN.CO, Tokyo, Japan) with a single interrupted pattern. Maintenance gas anesthesia was terminated following suturing and the rat was placed back in an individual cage following recovery. Rats in Group III underwent additional manipulation; the skin {{on both sides of the}} incision (5  mm from the center of the incision) was manually scratched with a sharp surgical curette until oozing was visually observed to ensure the occurrence of inflammation at the suturing site.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the stated goal of {{reducing}} the final <b>closing</b> <b>procedure</b> time cycle for construction projects at the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Odessa District, several standard operating procedures (SOPs) for project construction control and management had to be revised. Seemingly unrelated tasks created posterior chains of events that resulted in bottlenecks {{in the process and}} delayed final project closing. Four specific SOPs were identified and analyzed to determine which tasks required modification and what was expected from these modifications. A mission for each specified SOP was conceived and written to give {{a clear view of the}} intent of the procedure. Afterwards, district policies were drafted to provide the means to fulfill the intent. The procedural changes, compatible with TxDOT statewide procedures, allowed the time spent in the processes to remain the same but redistributed it to reduce the end-loading of the control process. The new SOPs require an even time distribution cyclically throughout the project. Control procedures are done only once, shortening the final <b>closing</b> <b>procedure</b> for projects by doing one-time, short, cyclical, consecutive control tasks of the same procedure throughout the life of the project, rather than doing some of them once cyclically and then again at the <b>closing</b> <b>procedure</b> and others just at the <b>closing</b> <b>procedure.</b> These changes resulted in a shorter end-cycle time, which substantially reduced the final <b>closing</b> <b>procedure</b> time for each project, without affecting the integrity and safeguards of the project.

We evaluated {{the adequacy of}} surgical implantation and <b>closing</b> <b>procedures</b> for tagging eels with biotelemetry transmitters. Epoxy dummy transmitters (18 _ 8 mm, 1. 6 – 1. 7 g) were implanted in eels anaesthetised with 2 -phenoxy-ethanol (0. 9 ml l− 1), through a 20 mm mid ventral incision made in the posterior quarter of their body cavity. The incision was either left open, or closed in different ways: stitches (absorbable or non absorbable suture material) or commercial-grade cyanoacrilate adhesive (LoctiteTM). Fish were stocked in a 4 m 2 flow through tank (15 – 17 _C), controlled daily for mortality and weekly for evaluating the healing process. No transmitter was expelled over a 12 -week period, even in eels with unclosed incisions, of which 50 % healed within 28 days (t 50). Regardless {{of the nature of}} the filament, suturing induced skin and muscle necrosis, caused significantly higher mortality rates (60 % after 10 weeks) and paradoxically slowed down the healing rate (40 and 45 d, respectively). Cyanoacrilate suppressed the inflammatory response and granted higher survival rate (90 %), but did not permit to speed up the closing process (t 50 = 52 d), as eels actively bit and removed the adhesive within hours. This behaviour was suppressed when we applied a freshly cut fragment of the eel dorsal fin as a biological bandage over the drying cyanoacrilate. The adhesive remained in place for one to two days and permitted to substantially increase the healing rate (t 50 = 15 d). These results substantiate the efficiency of surgery techniques for tagging eels with radio transmitters, at least for units of small weight and bulk. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The twin-mine “Bartensleben-Marie ” {{situated}} in the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt (Germany), was chosen, in 1970, {{to serve as a}} deep geological repository for the disposal of low and intermediate level radioactive waste. In 1978, the waste emplacement started in rock cavities at the mine’s fourth level, some 500 m below the surface. Until the end of the operational phase, in 1998, about 36, 800 m in total of radioactive waste was disposed of. Now the repository is under licensing for closure. Due to the recent potash and rock salt production, {{the central part of the}} Morsleben repository is mined out to a large extent, and due to the long period of time since excavation (50 - 75 years) as well as the short distance to the top of the salt plug, the central part appears to be mechanically highly stressed. In Novem-ber 2001, a significant roof fall occurred in a cavity on the – 297 m NN level, which was restricted area due to the danger of roof falls. Numerical calculations, geotechnical surveillance measures and in-situ observations show that the risk of a progressive failure in the central part of the Morsleben repository affecting repository safety cannot be excluded. Therefore, it was planned to stabilize the central part by backfilling a number of selected cavities by salt concrete prior to the <b>closing</b> <b>procedures.</b> The backfilling process started on October 8 th, 2003.

40|$|Mortgage fraud, often a {{violation}} {{of federal and state}} criminal statutes, covers a number of different types of behavior, all of which have the common denominator of conduct that has the intent or effect of impairing the value of residential mortgage loans. Mortgage fraud has become prevalent over the past decade and shows no signs of diminishing despite the collapse of domestic housing markets during the past two years. This paper analyzes the complex relationships between prime mortgage loan markets, subprime markets, and various types of mortgage fraud. This paper concludes that the root causes of mortgage fraud are associated with the core institutional and structural components of mortgage markets, which cut across all types of residential mortgage products. The organizing principle is the historical evolution from proximity to distance within the mortgage market, which is explored along three axes. First, geographical distance between lenders and borrowers has replaced geographical proximity. The mortgage market is national, with local lending institutions no longer making a significant proportion of the loans that are originated. Second, transactional distance has replaced transactional proximity. Lenders and borrowers have little direct contact; instead intermediaries such as mortgage brokers, appraisers, insurers, and closing officers, separate the principals. Third, financial distance has replaced financial proximity. Previously both borrowers and lenders had significant financial interests in the mortgage loan transaction. The borrower had equity in the property, and the lender held the loan in its portfolio. Presently many borrowers have no equity (or negative equity) in their homes, and due to the securitization of loans through the secondary mortgage market, few originating lenders retain a stake in the loans they create. Reforms that could serve to reduce borrower-lender distance or to ameliorate its effects include the fashioning of better <b>closing</b> <b>procedures</b> for verifying borrower identity, providing a premium for community-bank loans to local borrowers, making originating lenders liable for all misconduct by appraisers, requiring significant down payments for borrowers, and allowing secondary market purchasers full recourse against originating lenders for losses caused by borrower defaults...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that there is}} an {{invariance}} property for each of the elements of the information matrix of a multiplicative seasonal autoregressive moving-average time-series model, which enables the integral specification of Whittle (1953 a,b) to be solved in a straightforward way. The resulting non-iterative <b>closed</b> <b>procedure</b> shares the property possessed by the piecemeal approach of Godolphin and Bane (2006) of being independent of the seasonal period, but our procedure is preferable if one or more orders of the seasonal components of the model are greater than unity. The procedure is therefore simpler, in general, than the iterative method of Klein and Mélard (1990) that depends necessarily on the seasonal period. In the strictly non-seasonal case this invariance property prescribes a non-iterative <b>closed</b> <b>procedure</b> for evaluating the information matrix which improves on the methods of Godolphin and Unwin (1983), Friedlander (1984), McLeod (1984) and Klein and Spreij (2003).

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 82). BRAC Bank Limited is a scheduled commercial bank in Bangladesh. It established in Bangladesh under the Banking Companies Act, 1991 and incorporated as private limited company on May 20, 1999 under the Companies Act, 1994. Its operation started on July 4, 2001 with a vision to be the market leader through to providing all sorts’ support to people in term of promoting corporate, small entrepreneurs and individuals all over the Bangladesh. BRAC Bank will be a unique organization in Bangladesh. The bank consist of major divisions named 1) Corporate banking, 2) Retail banking, 3) Operations 4) Small & Medium Enterprise (SME). At present the Bank operating its business by 165 branches and 624 SME offices. BRAC Bank is the first local commercial banks that proving online banking service to its customers {{from the very beginning}} of its starts. BRAC Bank, for the first time among local commercial banks, starts providing loan facilities to small and medium trading, manufacturing and service oriented enterprises all over the country. The bank has already established its network in different area of the country with assistance of BRAC. BRAC Bank is trying to develop economic condition of the country. So the bank provides loan facility 3 to 30 lacs taka to that small and medium enterprise that has no easy access to banks/financial institutes. The bank already established 41 Zones and 624 SME offices all over the country. There is 2104 Officers providing service to clients. Till 2014, the bank Disbursed 471618 loans which amount is Tk 291871 million. The success of SME will largely depends on the selection of a business and man behind the business. BRAC Bank provides this facility to those whose business operation is minimum one year and environment friendly business. It provides no loan facility to tobacco business. The business should be legally registered and must have valid trade license. The entrepreneur should be physically able, preferably between the ages 21 to 50. She/he must have the necessary technical skills to run the business and acceptable social standing in the community i. e. people should speak highly of him/her. BRAC Bank gives equally important to the guarantor to getting the SME facility. The guarantor must have the ability to repay the entire loan and is economically solvent. The guarantor should know the entrepreneur reasonable well and should preferable live in the same community. SME loan can be repaid in two ways, 1) in equal monthly loan installment with monthly interest payment. 2) By one single payment at maturity, with interest repayable a quarter ends residual on maturity. Customer relation officers search new potential customer by providing door-to-door service. They talk with clients and monitor their manners, activities of their business and provide the loan to the potential customers. SME, BRAC Bank may provide 100 % of net required working capital but not exceeding 75 % of the aggregate value of the inventory and account receivable. Normally, organizations meet their working capital from over draft loan but BRAC Bank designed the loan to meet working capital but as term loan which is repaid in installment. The customer relation officers also monitor the borrowers’ activities after the loan disbursement. Monitoring also facilitates the buildup of an information base for future reference. Asset Operation Department acts as the last line defense of the bank. This division is responsible for the complete disbursement, recovery and <b>closing</b> <b>procedures.</b> The procedures start from the sanction of the SME loan. The respective select potential enterprise, collect confidential information about the enterprise, open clients account is the respective bank where BRAC Bank has its own account, filled up CIB form and send it to the Asset Operation Department. Then the Asset Operation Department starts its activities. The Asset Operation Department sends the CIB form to the Bangladesh Bank to know the CIB status of the applicant. If the report found clean then it send back to the unit office for send proposal for the loan. Then the unit office sanction loan and send it again in Asset Operation Department for disbursement. The Asset Operation Department then prepare a loan file and checks all necessary documents, prepare a list and disburse it. Then the Asset Operation Department starts enter all information regarding the loan in the banking software “Millennium Banking System (MBS) ” which includes initial ID generation, loan account opening, risk fund collection, activation of the loan. Post disbursement manual activities includes repayment schedule send to unit office, documents stamp cancellation, send the loan file to archive. Recovering activities include receive SMS/Fax for installment deposit, entry the installment information to MBS, print vouchers, cross check SMS/Fax and solve problems, repayment voucher check and posting. Closing activities includes receive SMS/Fax requesting for closing, bring the loan file from archive, obtained approve to closing from the concern authority, checking in MBS, SMS sent to concern customer relation officer (CRO), receiving and print closing SMS/Fax. The core competence of the BRAC Bank is to provide the fastest loans to the clients in this country. To retain this competitive advantage BRAC Bank would provide computer and palmtop facilities whether they can give fastest services to clients than other banks. Also to convey the customer focus, BRAC Bank is trying to reduce collateral securities than other banks. It provides more collateral free secured loans to capture the market. Regarding the services by the CRO, almost all clients are satisfied by get these quick facilities from them. Though it is pioneer division of this bank, I tried to give an in-depth analysis for every factor, which relates the SME division from the perspective of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

This paper reports the results from the first-ever series of 121  patients operated between 1988 and 1990. They were followed until bone union was achieved. The mean patient age was 75 years. Most patients were in poor general health and had unstable fractures. Anatomical preoperative reduction was achieved in 72 % of cases. Fixation was good in 66 % of cases and acceptable in 27 % of cases. Intra-operative complications consisted of nine fractures without consequences. Of the treated patients, 83. 4 % resumed weight-bearing during the first week. There was one case of deep infection that resolved with treatment. The mortality rate was 12. 3 % at three months. We noted 7  alunions in varus, 3 in valgus, 2 in external rotation and 1 in internal rotation. There were no cases of non-union. In six cases, the screw had cut out of the femoral head. The drawbacks associated with surgical treatment methods for trochanteric fractures also apply to the Gamma nail. Nevertheless, one of its primary advantages is the possibility of using a <b>closed</b> <b>procedure.</b> When compared to Ender nailing, knee pain is absent and weight-bearing can be achieved in all patients, no matter the fracture type...|$|R
30|$|T&W Metro has {{recently}} changed the door <b>closing</b> <b>procedure</b> from two-button to one-button operation. In the past, the drivers {{had one more}} button to press after a door closing tone has sounded. This means {{that they were able}} to react if a passenger tried to misuse the doors by running for a train after the warning tone. The respondents admit that the new procedure left them with less control over a situation and increased the risk of passenger entrapment. This could be the reason behind a doubling of the number of passenger entrapment incidents between the two operational years studied.|$|R
