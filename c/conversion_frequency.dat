Strains carrying the same known gene conversion control factors, which have major effects on conversion frequencies at their specific target locus, sometimes gave significant differences in <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency.</b> Selection for high or low conversion frequencies at the w 1 - 78 site was practiced for five generations, giving significant responses in both directions. These responses were due to polygenes, or genes of minor effect, not to new conversion control factors of major effect.

Practical maintenance data contains large number of censoring samples, information uncertainty of which makes it hard to evaluate reliability of aileron actuator. Considering that true lifetime of censoring sample has identical distribution with complete sample, if censoring sample is transformed into complete sample, <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency</b> of censoring sample can be estimated according to frequency of complete sample. On the one hand, standard life table estimation and product limit method are improved on the basis of such <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency,</b> enabling accurate estimation of various censoring samples. On the other hand, by taking such frequency as one of the weight factors and integrating variance of order statistics under standard distribution, weighted least square estimation is formed for accurately estimating various censoring samples. Large amounts of experiments and simulations show that reliabilities of improved life table and improved product limit method are closer to the true value and more conservative; moreover, weighted least square estimate (WLSE), with <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency</b> of censoring sample and variances of order statistics as the weights, can still estimate accurately with high proportion of censored data in samples.

40|$|Gene conversion, the non-reciprocal {{exchange}} of genetic information, {{is one of}} the potential products of meiotic recombination. It can shape genome structure by acting on repetitive DNA elements, influence allele frequencies at the population level, and is known to be implicated in human disease.

40|$|The {{repair of}} double strand DNA breaks is {{important}} to genomic stability. Gene conversions are non-reciprocal exchanges of DNA created through the repair of double strand DNA breaks. Relatively few studies have looked at examining {{the similarities and differences}} of the physical characteristics of ectopic gene conversions (conversions between non-allelic genes) within and between diverse lineages of prokaryotes and yeast. I found that several factors affect the frequency of ectopic gene conversions in prokaryotes and yeast. The size and organization of multigene families affects how often genes are converted. In E. coli a positive correlation was found between gene family size and <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency.</b> In yeast, I found that intra-chromosomal gene conversions are more frequent than inter-chromosomal conversions. The amount of sequence similarity between the converted genes affects their <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency.</b> I found that long conversions tend to occur between highly similar homologs. In addition, the sequence similarity requirements are not uniform for every organism. For example, I found indications that the life-style of the organism affects the stringency of sequence similarity requirements for ectopic gene conversion. I determined that ectopic gene conversions occur more frequently and require significantly less flanking similarity in the pathogenic bacteria strains than in the non-pathogenic. The functional importance of the converted genes affects how frequently they are converted. Genes that have been functionally maintained throughout evolution are ectopically converted less frequently than genome specific paralogs. Nucleotide distance between homologous genes affects their ectopic <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency.</b> In paralogous multigene families of yeast, gene conversions occur more frequently between genes which are close together on the same chromosome than between dispersed homologs. Converted regions are not uniformly distributed along the length of genes. Converted regions tend to be clustered near the 3 ' end of genes in yeast but not in prokaryotes.

40|$|The ade 6 -M 26 {{mutation}} of Schizosaccharomyces pombe increases <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency</b> {{in comparison}} with the nearby mutation ade 6 -M 375. In order to investigate the effect of ade 6 -M 26 on crossover frequency, heteroallelic ade 6 duplications were constructed by integration of plasmids carrying the marker gene ura 4. One ade 6 gene carries either of the mutations M 26 or M 375 while the other ade 6 copy carries the L 469 mutation in both duplications. The duplication with ade 6 -M 26 yields Ade(+) recombinants at significantly higher frequencies in meiosis, but not in mitosis. Tetrad analysis and physical characterization of spore clones from recombination tetrads demonstrate that conversions, unequal crossovers and intrachromatid exchanges occur at higher frequencies but with unaltered proportions among them. The conversion events show a pronounced bias when M 26 is involved: they take place preferentially at the M 26 allele. Thus the ade 6 -M 26 mutation not only enhances <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency</b> as demonstrated before, but also crossover frequency. It displays the properties expected for a preferred site of initiation of general meiotic recombination.

40|$|Summary Previously, we {{demonstrated}} that, in some cell lines, exogenous {{applications of}} ascorbic acid (ASC) enhance the <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency</b> of white spruce (Picea glauca (Mo-ench) Voss) somatic embryos, by stimulating mitotic {{activity in the}} apical meristems. To examine this event in more detail, we investigated the effects of ASC on de novo, salvage and degra-dation pathways of pyrimidine metabolism by following the metabolic fate of 14 C-labeled orotic acid, thymidine, uridine and uracil in shoot and root poles of germinating embryos, after altering the cellular ASC content of the embryos. Alterations in endogenous ASC content {{did not affect the}} utilization of either orotic acid or uracil, but affected the metabolism of thymidine and uridine. Specifically, a lowering of endogenous ASC con-tent by applications of lycorine (L), an inhibitor of the last en-zyme of the ASC de novo biosynthetic pathway, resulted in a lower embryo <b>conversion</b> <b>frequency,</b> as well as a reduced per-centage of thymidine and uridine incorporated into nucleotides and nucleic acids. The reduction in thymidine and uridine anabolism was mainly ascribed to the decreased activities of thymidine kinase (TRK) and uridine kinase (URK), the respec-tive salvage enzymes of thymidine and uridine, measured in L-treated embryos. These effects were solely a result of a de-crease in endogenous ASC content because applications of ascorbic acid plus lycorine (ASC + L) increased embryo con-version frequency, thymidine and uridine salvage activities, and TRK and URK activities to near control values. Inclusion of exogenous ASC in the germination medium did not affect the percentage of embryos able to convert to viable plantlets, although it increased thymidine and uridine utilization for nu-cleic acid synthesis in the shoot and root poles of the embryos. Taken together, these findings confirm that cellular ASC {{plays a key role in}} the reactivation of the apical meristems of germi-nating white spruce somatic embryos...|$|E
