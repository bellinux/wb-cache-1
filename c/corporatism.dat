5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, <b>corporatism,</b> nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Conspiracy theorists, such as American writer Jim Marrs, {{claim that}} some ex-Nazis, {{who survived the}} fall of the Greater German Reich, along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere, given haven by {{organizations}} like ODESSA and Die Spinne, have been working behind the scenes since the end of World War II to enact at least some principles of Nazism (e.g., militarism, imperialism, widespread spying on citizens, <b>corporatism,</b> the use of propaganda to manufacture a national consensus) into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S. They cite the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from Nazi UFOs, and the acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both Europe and the U.S.|$|E

25|$|The fall of James Callahan in {{the summer}} of 1979 meant, {{according}} to most commentators across the political spectrum, the end of an ancien régime, a system of <b>corporatism,</b> Keynesian spending programmes, subsidized welfare, and trade union power.|$|E
25|$|The {{stabilising}} {{techniques of}} the 1980s managed by the vice-chancellor, Michael Birt (1981–1992), provided a firm base for the energetic <b>corporatism</b> and campus enhancements pursued by the subsequent vice-chancellor, John Niland (1992–2002). The 1990s saw the addition of fine arts to the university. The university established colleges in Newcastle (1951) and Wollongong (1961), which eventually became the University of Newcastle and the University of Wollongong in 1965 and 1975 respectively.|$|E
25|$|This {{economic}} model {{based on a}} partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere, in {{what came to be}} known as <b>corporatism.</b> At the same time, the aggressive foreign policy of Mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure. After the invasion of Ethiopia, Italy intervened to support Franco's nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. By 1939, Italy had the highest percentage of state-owned enterprises after the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Fascists opposed both {{international}} {{socialism and}} free market capitalism, arguing that their views represented a third position. They claimed {{to provide a}} realistic economic alternative that was neither laissez-faire capitalism nor communism. They favored <b>corporatism</b> and class collaboration, believing {{that the existence of}} inequality and social hierarchy was beneficial (contrary to the views of socialists), while also arguing that the state had a role in mediating relations between classes (contrary to the views of liberal capitalists).|$|E
25|$|The reactionary and feudalistic {{thought in}} Müller's writings, which agreed so little {{with the spirit}} of the times, {{prevented}} his political ideas from exerting a more notable and lasting influence on his age, while their religious character prevented them from being justly appreciated. However, Müller's teachings had long-term effects in that they were taken up again by 20th century theorists of <b>corporatism</b> and the corporate state, for example Othmar Spann (Der wahre Staat. Vorlesungen über Abbruch und Neubau der Gesellschaft, Vienna, 1921).|$|E
25|$|In 1933 he was {{a founder}} of the Union of Young National Legions and became part of the triumvirate that officially led this movement. The group was {{initially}} anti-communist and nationalist but it soon came under the influence of Italian fascism and Nazism and added <b>corporatism</b> and anti-Semitism to its platform. In 1934 Dochev went to Nazi Germany with Nikola Zhekov and met both Adolf Hitler and Alfred Rosenberg. Dochev failed to come fully to terms with Hitler however as he would not support the Nazi demand for the Legions to overthrow King Boris.|$|E
25|$|Labor (workers) {{and capital}} (owners) have always battled over {{the share of}} the {{economic}} pie each obtains. The influence of the labor movement has waned in the U.S. since the 1960s along with union participation and more pro-capital laws. The share of total worker compensation has declined from 58% of national income (GDP) in 1970 to nearly 53% in 2013, contributing to income inequality. This has led to concerns that the economy has shifted too far in favor of capital, via a form of <b>corporatism,</b> corpocracy or neoliberalism.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} year, Sân-Giorgiu's {{newspaper}} published influential essays by Mihail Manoilescu, who advocated <b>corporatism</b> {{and called for}} its implementation in the National Legionary State. Having survived the violent clash between the Iron Guard and their nominal partner, Conducător Ion Antonescu (events known as the Legionary Rebellion), he left Romania after Antonescu's regime and Romania's alliance to the Axis Powers crumbled in autumn 1944 (see Soviet occupation of Romania). He joined Sima's Vienna-based Legionary cabinet, holding a nominal office as Minister of Education. The justice system in Communist Romania tried him in absentia, and sentenced him to death. The writer died in exile.|$|E
25|$|As Päts {{believed}} that a nation should be organized not by political views into parties, but by vocation into respective chambers, a series of state corporative institutions were introduced, based on <b>corporatism</b> in Fascist Italy. Päts had promoted the idea of corporate chambers already in 1918, but the idea did not gain support from strong left-wing parties at the time. Päts was the main proponent {{of the formation of}} the chambers and the first two were founded while his government cabinets were in office in 1924 and 1931. Fifteen more chambers were established between 1934 and 1936, bringing the total number to 17.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, he was {{involved}} in nationalist politics, supporting Alexandru Averescu, Nicolae Iorga and, ultimately, the extremist Iron Guard, of which he was among the most prominent intellectual backers. A theoretician of organicism, <b>corporatism,</b> and antisemitism, he inspired the creation of Iconar, a literary society, and founded the review Însemnări Sociologice. He was elected to the Romanian Senate in 1937, and reached the apex of his political career during the short-lived National Legionary State of 1940–1941. He served as Education and Arts Minister under this regime, targeting the country's Jewish community and his various political opponents. In the wake of the Legionnaires' rebellion, he was arrested, tried and acquitted, but later arrested again and interned.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, he made {{loans to}} the French {{government}} and was appointed resident at Paris by {{the republic of}} Geneva. Madame Necker entertained {{the leaders of the}} political, financial and literary worlds of Paris, and her Friday salon became as greatly frequented as the Mondays of Mme Geoffrin, or the Tuesdays of Mme Helvétius. In 1773, Necker won the prize of the Académie Française for a defense of state <b>corporatism</b> framed as a eulogy in honor of Louis XIV's minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. In 1775, he published his Essai sur la législation et le commerce des grains, in which he attacked the free-trade policy of Turgot. His wife now believed he could get into office as a great financier and made him give up his share in the bank, which he transferred to his brother Louis.|$|E
25|$|While he had {{a degree}} of sympathy for Italian fascism and <b>corporatism,</b> Iorga viewed the Iron Guard as {{dangerous}} for Romania. Having parted with Cuza by the 1920s, he was briefly co-opted by the National Peasants' Party, went on to serve as Premier, and, in the {{years leading up to}} World War II, joined those who advocated the authoritarian politics of Codreanu's bitter rival, Carol II. His publicized criticism of Codreanu's methods and the Iron Guard leader's answer played a part in escalating the entire conflict, and, after Codreanu's killing on Carol's orders, made Iorga a potential target for the movement's violent retribution. In November 1940, during the interval when the Guard set up the National Legionary regime (see Romania during World War II), Iorga became a victim of its assassins. This final action, was seen by Lovinescu, as well as by Stanomir and Veiga, as the equivalent of a political patricide.|$|E
25|$|Fascists {{claimed that}} this {{system would be}} egalitarian and {{traditional}} at the same time. The economic policy of <b>corporatism</b> quickly faltered: the left-wing elements of the Fascist manifesto were opposed by industrialists and landowners who supported the party because it pledged to defend Italy from socialism. As a result, corporatist policy became dominated by the industries. Initially, economic legislation mostly favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes by allowing privatization, liberalization of rent laws, tax cuts and administrative reform. However, economic policy changed drastically following the Matteotti Crisis where Mussolini began pushing for a totalitarian state. In 1926, the Syndical laws (also known as the Rocco laws) were passed, organizing the economy into 12 separate employer and employee unions. The unions were largely state-controlled and were mainly used to suppress opposition and reward political loyalty. While the Fascist unions could not protect workers from all economic consequences, they {{were responsible for the}} handling of social security benefits, claims for severance pay and could sometimes negotiate contracts that benefited workers.|$|E

500|$|During Milan Stojadinović's premiership, {{many members}} of Zbor left the party and joined Stojadinović's Yugoslav Radical Union ( [...] , JRZ). Nevertheless, the {{movement}} continued to advocate the abandonment of individualism and parliamentary democracy. Ljotić called for Yugoslavia to unite around a single ruler and return to its religious and cultural traditions, embracing the teachings of Christianity, traditional values and <b>corporatism.</b> He advocated a centrally organized state, stating that the unification of South Slavs was a historical and political inevitability and that Serbs, Croats and Slovenes shared [...] "blood kinship and feeling of common fate." [...] At the same time, the Yugoslavia that Ljotić envisioned was one {{that was to be}} dominated by Serbia. Zbor openly promoted antisemitism, being the only party in Yugoslavia to openly do so, as well as xenophobia.|$|E
500|$|Suharto {{proceeded}} with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicized [...] "floating mass" [...] {{supportive of the}} national mission of [...] "development", a concept similar to <b>corporatism.</b> The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created Korpri (Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia) in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organized the FBSI (Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia) as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the MUI in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote assimilation of the influential Chinese-Indonesians, the Suharto government passed several laws as part of so-called [...] "Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were phased-out, and the ethnic-Chinese were encouraged to take-up Indonesian-sounding names. In 1968, Suharto commenced the very successful family-planning program (Keluarga Berentjana / KB) to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.|$|E

2500|$|Mussolini and the Fascist Party promised Italians a new {{economic}} system known as <b>corporatism,</b> an outgrowth of socialism into a {{new economic}} system where {{the means of production}} were nominally left {{in the hands of the}} civil sector, but directed and controlled by the State. In 1935, the Doctrine of Fascism was published under Mussolini's name, although it was most likely written by Giovanni Gentile.

2500|$|A {{number of}} senior members, {{including}} Griffin and John Bean, had anti-capitalist leanings, having {{been influenced by}} Strasserism and National Bolshevism. Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP promoted economic protectionism and anti-globalisation. Its economic policies reflect a vague commitment to distributist economics, ethno-socialism, and national autarky. The BNP maintains a policy of protectionism and economic nationalism, although in comparison with other far-right nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on <b>corporatism.</b> It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the [...] "subordination {{of the power of}} the City to the power of the government". It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum self-sufficiency in food production. [...] In 2002, the party criticised <b>corporatism</b> as a [...] "mixture of big capitalism and state control", saying it favoured a [...] "distributionist tradition established by home-grown thinkers" [...] favouring small business.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pillars of}} the Peronist ideal, known as the [...] "three flags", are social justice, {{economic}} independence, and political sovereignty.

2500|$|Brăileanu's writings, {{including}} his articles in teachers' magazines, shifted toward developing a Romanian [...] "elite theory" [...] {{and the role}} of state pedagogy in cultivating a fresh political establishment.

2500|$|This {{economic}} model {{based on a}} partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere, in {{what came to be}} known as <b>corporatism.</b> From 1934 onwards, believing that Italy could have avoided the Great Depression if it had not been linked to international markets, Benito Mussolini insisted that autarky should be one of the primary goals of his government's economic policy. To this end, the Fascists began to impose significant tariffs and other trade barriers. In 1934, Mussolini boasted that three-quarters of Italian businesses [...] "is in the hands of the state." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael C. Macmillan, Bourassa's {{political}} thought {{was largely a}} combination of Whig liberalism, Catholic social thought, and traditional Quebec {{political thought}}. He was distinctly liberal in his anti-imperialism and general support for civil liberties for French Canadians, while his approach to economic questions was essentially Catholic. While Bourassa embraced the ultramontane idea that the Church was responsible for faith, morals, discipline, and administration, he resisted Church involvement in the political sphere and rejected the <b>corporatism</b> espoused by the Church. Bourassa opposed state intervention wherever possible and increasingly throughout his career emphasized the need for moral reform.|$|E
2500|$|The Legion was {{excluded}} from political coalitions by nominally fascist King Carol, who preferred newly formed subservient movements and the revived National-Christian Defense League. Cuza created his antisemitic government together with poet Octavian Goga and his National Agrarian Party. Codreanu {{and the two}} leaders did not get along, and the Legion started competing with the authorities by adopting <b>corporatism.</b> In parallel, he was urging his followers to set up private businesses, claiming to follow the advice of Nicolae Iorga, after the latter claimed that a Romanian-run commerce could prove a solution to what he deemed the [...] "Jewish Question".|$|E
2500|$|For {{different}} reasons, Carp and Maiorescu preferred agriculture to industry, {{and were}} {{just as likely to}} demand checks on urban and industrial growth. Carp's own solution to urban proletarization was grassroots <b>corporatism,</b> with modernized guilds that were supposed to provide the working class with [...] "solidarity" [...] and [...] "prestige". Carp imagined a guild network supported by and supporting an educational system that, unlike the one conceived by PNL-backed educationists, was to be decentralized and vocational. He intervened personally to help the schoolchildren on his Țibănești domain, donating money and participating on a student examination board (1886).|$|E

The PȚ had much success in the elections of November 1919, forming a coalition government with the Transylvanian Romanian National Party (PNR), under Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. As a politician, Mihalache made himself known for supporting a political option that mixed traditionalist reserve towards industrialization and calls for preserving the rural base of Romanian economy through voluntary cooperative farming (allowing for a peasant-based industry) with a vision of left-wing <b>Corporatism.</b> In 1929, he wrote: ...|$|E
