40|$|CFC {{legislation}} {{has become an}} instrument to protect national tax bases and minimize the abusive effects of international tax planning. The Swedish CFC legislation is found in chapter 39 a of the ITA whereas it is established under what circumstances CFC taxation can arise. If a shareholder of a foreign legal entity is liable of CFC taxation in Sweden such a holder is also entitled to deduct tax paid by the CFC abroad. The purpose of the granted tax credit is to avoid double taxation, although if foreign tax is paid by another entity than the foreign entity in question such CFC-tax cannot be credited. The situation at hand can result in that the holder is liable of paying double <b>CFC</b> <b>tax,</b> contrary {{to the purpose of}} tax credit. The freedom of establishment is part of the fundamental freedoms concluded in the EC Treaty. The general goal of the Community is to establish an internal market. The freedom of establishment, stated in Article 43 EC stipulates that restrictions on the freedom of establishment on nationals shall be prohibited. However, restrictions on the freedom of establishment can be justified under certain circumstances. The ECJ has developed a rule of reason test which can justify prohibited restrictions if certain criterias are fulfilled. Concerning tax matters the grounds of justification that have been accepted by the ECJ are the cohesion of the tax system, the effectiveness of fiscal supervision, the counteraction of tax avoidance, the need to safeguard the balanced allocation of the power to tax between the Member States and a combination of grounds of justification. An exemplification scheme serves as a mean to illustrate in what instance double CFC taxation can arise. The scheme concerns a corporate group whereas a Swedish parent company owns a subsidiary in the U. K. through which the parent company plans to establish another subsidiary in the UAE. Swedish tax legislation provides that the Swedish parent company is subject to corporation tax on its worldwide profits in Sweden. However, the parent company is generally not taxed on the profits of its subsidiaries as they arise nor is it taxed on dividends distributed by a subsidiary established in Sweden. Although, when subsidiaries are not resident in Sweden and CFC legislation applies tax exempt according to the intercorporate share holding legislation will not be applicable. Therefore, in order for double CFC taxation to arise it is established that CFC legislation will be applicable to the exemplified scheme. Profits accrued in the UAE will be subject to CFC taxation in both the U. K. and Sweden and double taxation relief will not be granted in Sweden for the <b>CFC</b> <b>tax</b> paid in the U. K. It is questionable if double CFC taxation and the lack of tax relief in such a situation is in compliance with the freedom of establishment. The analysis, whereas the purpose of this thesis is concluded, follows the reasoning of the ECJ in accordance with the rule of reason. The purpose is to examine if the lack of double <b>CFC</b> <b>tax</b> relief is in compliance with Community law. It is established that since relief is not granted for double CFC taxation, national legislation hinders the freedom of establishment by forcing a parent company to avoid or modify an intra group structure which leads to the unfavorable consequences in taxation. The tax disadvantage must be seen as making it less attractive for Sweden’s own resident to establish in another Member State and the hindering nature of the lack of double CFC taxation relief constitutes a prohibited restriction to the freedom of establishment. The grounds of justification previously accepted by the ECJ are examined in order to establish if such grounds can justify the lack of double <b>CFC</b> <b>tax</b> relief as a prohibited restriction on the freedom of establishment. None of the acknowledged grounds of justification are able to justify the lack of double <b>CFC</b> <b>tax</b> relief and such a restricted measure is therefore not found to be in compliance with Community Law. Lastly, potential adjustments to CFC legislation, regarding the lack of double <b>CFC</b> <b>tax</b> relief, are discussed to enable compliance with Community law...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of the thesis is new as the {{phenomenon}} of the Box Corporation has not been the subject of a specialized investigation from the fiscal perspective before. A foreign subsidiary indirectly owned in a third country jurisdiction is in the thesis classified as a Box Corporation. The subject of the thesis is primarily to analyze and establish the following connections: the intended corporate objectives and ends and the modus operandi and the means that often require the Box Corporation as a necessary vehicle to attain those ends. The close connections between corporate law and tax law as intended legal results interdependent on one another. The application of the Box Corporation as an important vehicle for international tax planning by Swedish corporate groups on ever increasing competitive international markets and the special tax problems connected to the Box Corporation as it presents serious challenges to the pursuits for a consistent, neutral and undistorted Swedish corporate tax system. The thesis also investigates legislative and regulatory public reactions to the Box Corporation in the ways of <b>CFC</b> <b>tax</b> provisions, of denying tax treaty privileges by Limitation of Benefits clauses and of increasing domestic requirements on reportable transactions and international exchange of information and co-operation...|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{foreign company}} (“CFC”) {{legislation}}, governed by section 9 D of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, serves as anti-avoidance legislation in South Africa’s residence-based tax system. Section 9 D {{provides for the}} calculation of a deemed amount which must {{be included in the}} South African resident’s income. This deemed amount is calculated with reference to the net income for the <b>CFC’s</b> foreign <b>tax</b> year. Section 9 D(6) provides for this deemed amount, which is denominated in the foreign financial reporting currency, to be translated into South African rand by applying the average exchange rate for that year of assessment. The legislation refers to the South African resident’s year of assessment and not the <b>CFC’s</b> foreign <b>tax</b> year. It is submitted that the average exchange rate for the <b>CFC’s</b> foreign <b>tax</b> year should be used for translation. The author therefore disputes the period to be used in calculating the average exchange rate.

5000|$|Repatriation of {{currency}} is when foreign currency is converted {{back to the}} currency of the home country. An example would be an American converting British pounds back to U.S. dollars. Repatriation also refers to the {{payment of a dividend}} by a foreign corporation to a U.S. corporation. This happens often where the foreign corporation is considered a [...] "controlled foreign corporation" [...] (CFC), which means that more than 50% of the foreign corporation is owned by U.S. shareholders. Generally, foreign direct investment in <b>CFC's</b> are not <b>taxed</b> until a dividend is paid to the controlling U.S. parent company, and is thus repatriated. The foreign direct investment income of the <b>CFC</b> is <b>taxed</b> only by the country where it is incorporated until repatriation. At that time, income is subject to the (typically higher) U.S. tax rate minus the Foreign Tax Credits. (FN: See IRC 951-965) There are currently {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} of Foreign direct investment in CFC's because of the disincentive to repatriate those earnings.

40|$|In the {{proposal}} for a Council Directive on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) there have been introduced a specific anti-abuse provisions, CFC rules. These rules are aimed at tax evasions and tax avoidance. The basic principle is {{the protection of the}} tax base against erosion through practices of artificial income shifting. Generally, <b>CFC</b> rules prevent <b>tax</b> avoidance in a state of a shareholder by denying the deferred taxation of profits generated by its controlled company, which is a resident in a tax preference jurisdiction. Even thought the CCCTB directive would be aided easier and low-costs cross-border business as well as it would be restricted the harmful tax competition there are questions whether it is advisable to introduce these rules into such system of the CCCTB, whether these rules are compatible with the CCCTB and whether it is regulated properly. So, the focus of this paper rests on the interaction of the proposed CCCTB directive with existing CFC rules in the European Union.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the Swedish CFC (Controlled foreign corporation) legislations compatibility with the EC law, freedom of establishment and towards those double taxation agreements that Sweden have signed with other states. The study is interesting and important for several reasons. There are two main ones. Fist of all; if the court in Luxemburg finds the CFC legislation not compatible with the freedom of establishment - the Swedish internal laws, in purpose of protecting tax avoidance by companies in tax havens, will suddenly be inoperative towards companies established inside the Union. Secondly; the same result will be a fact if the internal law is considered to be incompatible with the agreements that Sweden has signed with other states, in order to avoid double taxation. If the legislation is incompatible with the EC law, the problem is quite big, but anyway limited to the 25 countries that today constitute the Union. No quick or simple solution is to be found. If it is not compatible with the agreements, the problem is greater - since Sweden have 70 complete agreements - though, a problem simpler to solve. The purposes of the CFC legislation are to eliminate tax advantages of the shareholder when he transfers his earnings to a CFC corporation - or when he defers the taxation by postponing the dividend from the same corporation. Such postponement could otherwise be a fact, for all future. If the level of taxation, in the foreign corporation is lower than 15. 4 %, the incomes are considered to be a CFC income and are <b>CFC</b> <b>taxed</b> - if the owner holds 25 % control of the assets or votes of the corporation, directly or indirectly. The income is calculated according to Swedish rules for the same type of company and credit is given for taxes paid abroad. The Swedish exchange control was abolished in 1992. The control restrained the possibilities to establish enterprises abroad by prohibiting the export of securities or other means of payment without the consent of the bank of Sweden. The abolishment of exchange controls has provided opportunities for tax avoidance. To prevent such avoidance, many countries have introduced legislations that tax shareholders directly - even though the profits from the foreign controlled companies not yet have been distributed. Besides the restrains on foreign investments caused by the control, the CFC legislation was preceded by the less extensive “Luxemburg paragraph” - introduced in 1933. This paragraph has not much in common with today's legislation - the real means of preventing tax avoidance came with the CFC legislation 1990. The last decades have seen much more of harmful tax competition, and both the EU and the OECD have come up with strategies to tackle these problems. In order to prevent the problems, the organisations suggest the member states to introduce some form of CFC legislation. The first of July 2003 a new legislation came into effect, giving companies a right to bring back profits or earnings without taxation, if the companies are closely tied to each other or the possession of owning the company are due to dependence between them - when holding a kind of business related shares. Such rules were needed to avoid that some companies - or a combined groups of companies - would have to pay taxes three or four times for the same earnings. With the possibility of bringing profits and earnings back to Sweden tax free, a new possible problem occurred. According to the government, there was a risk that a company based in Sweden choose to have a loan of money in Sweden, only in order to transfer the money to a tax haven. The result would be that the cost would appear in Sweden while the earnings would appear in a low tax regime. Later, whenever it would be suitable, the earnings - or the profits from selling the foreign corporation - could be brought back to Sweden. In order to tackle such, and other, tax avoidance, Sweden introduced the new legislation for CFC companies, the first of January 2004. These rules are now the subject of analysis, in relation to the EC law, freedom of establishment, and the double taxation agreements, signed by Sweden. The study is made in Swedish, but with an English summary...|$|R
