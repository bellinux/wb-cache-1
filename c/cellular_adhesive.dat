Subsequent platelet activation results in the recruitment of additional platelets and the generation of platelet aggregates forming a stable platelet plug. In addition, activated platelets form a strong link between primary and secondary haemostasis as they provide the phospholipid surface that {{is necessary for the}} assembly of activated coagulation factor complexes required for thrombin generation. Other than the physiological function acting as a first line of defence against bleeding, platelets may also contribute to pathological thrombus formation.

Modulation of the focal adhesion plaque provides {{a mechanism for}} the regulation of <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> strength. Using interference reflection microscopy, we found that activation of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) by PDGF induces the dissipation of focal adhesions. Loss of this close apposition between the cell membrane and the extracellular matrix coincided with a redistribution of α-actinin and vinculin from the focal adhesion complex to the Triton X- 100 –soluble fraction. In contrast, talin and paxillin remained localized to focal adhesions, suggesting that activation of PI 3 -kinase induced a restructuring of the plaque rather than complete dispersion. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5) -trisphosphate (PtdIns (3, 4, 5) -P 3), a lipid product of PI 3 -kinase, was sufficient to induce restructuring of the focal adhesion plaque.

60|$|The tips of both branches, {{when they}} {{come into contact with}} a stick, grasp it like any {{ordinary}} tendril. But {{in the course of a}} few days, the lower surface swells and becomes developed into a cellular layer, which adapts itself closely to the wood, and firmly adheres to it. This layer is analogous to the adhesive discs formed by the extremities of the tendrils of some species of Bignonia and of Ampelopsis; but in the Hanburya the layer is developed along the terminal inner surface, sometimes for a length of 1.75 inches, and not at the extreme tip. The layer is white, whilst the tendril is green, and near the tip it is sometimes thicker than the tendril itself; it generally spreads a little beyond the sides of the tendril, and is fringed with free elongated cells, which have enlarged globular or retort-shaped heads. This cellular layer apparently secretes some resinous cement; for its adhesion to the wood was not lessened by an immersion of 24 hrs. in alcohol or water, but was quite loosened by a similar immersion in ether or turpentine. After a tendril has once firmly coiled itself round a stick, it is difficult to imagine of what use the <b>adhesive</b> <b>cellular</b> layer can be. Owing to the spiral contraction which soon ensues, the tendrils were never able to remain, excepting in one instance, in contact with a thick post or a nearly flat surface; if they had quickly become attached by means of the adhesive layer, this would evidently have been of service to the plant.|$|R

40|$|Interaction {{of cells}} with the {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{plays an important}} role in the regulation of cell behavior. Formation of adhesive contacts leads to transduction of signals into the cell and results in altered gene expression and modulation of the <b>cellular</b> phenotype. Specific <b>adhesive</b> interactions of the fibronectin and vitronectin receptors with their ligands in the matrix modulates expression of ECM-degrading metalloproteases. These proteases are involved in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype by a number of cell types. The activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is reduced by endogenous inhibitors referred to as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs). Alterations in the balance between the activity of MMPs and TIMPs alters cellular invasion through effects on matrix degradation. In this study we demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous gelatinase A activity in A 2058 human melanoma cells results in enhanced cellular adhesion. To further explore this phenomenon, we have used retroviral infection vectors to control the amount of the MMP inhibitor TIMP- 2 in human melanoma A 2058 cells. Altering the production of TIMP- 2 modulates not only proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, but also the adhesive and spreading properties of the cells and results in altered cell morphology. These effects of TIMP- 2 appear to be mediated by inhibition of gelatinase A activity. We conclude that gelatinase A, in addition to contributing to proteolysis of ECM components, also functions to proteolyse cell surface components that mediate attachment of A 2058 cells to the ECM. Thus, gelatinase A may function to modulate cell attachment and facilitate cell migration and invasion...|$|R
40|$|Collective cell {{migration}} is ubiquitous in biology, from development to cancer; it {{is influenced by}} heterogeneous cell types, signals and matrix properties, and requires large scale regulation in space and time. Understanding how cells achieve organized collective motility is crucial to addressing cellular and tissue function and disease progression. While current two-dimensional model systems recapitulate the dynamic properties of collective {{cell migration}}, quantitative three-dimensional equivalent model systems have proved elusive. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that cell collectives are heterogeneous in nature; and that the influence of biochemical, physical, and mechanical factors combined leads to diverse physical behaviors. The central goal of this work is to establish standard tools for the understanding of 3 D collective cell motility by treating individual cell-collectives as independent entities. An experimental model studies cell collectives by tracking individual cells within cell cohorts embedded in three dimensional collagen scaffolding. A computational model of 3 -dimensional multi-scale self-propelled particles recreates experimental data and accounts for intercellular adhesion dynamics. A custom algorithm identifies cellular cohorts from experimental and simulated data so these may be treated as independent entities. A second custom algorithm quantifies the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of motion in cell cohorts during ‘motility events’ observed in experiments and simulations. The results show that cell-cohorts in 3 D are dynamic with spatial and temporal heterogeneity; cohesive motility events can emerge without an external driving agent. Simulated cohorts are able to recreate experimental motility event signatures.

We have studied the binding of fibronectin to the purified vitronectin receptor, and the role of this receptor in the attachment of cells to fibronectin. A solid-phase microtiter assay was developed to investigate the binding properties of the vitronectin receptor. Purified alpha v beta 3 bound fibronectin with high affinity in a saturable, divalent cation- dependent manner. Binding was inhibited by soluble vitronectin, by RGD- containing peptides, and by LM 609, a monoclonal antibody against the vitronectin receptor known to inhibit the binding of adhesive proteins to alpha v beta 3. Immunoinhibition experiments showed that M 21 human melanoma cells, which express the fibronectin receptor, alpha 5 beta 1, as well as alpha v beta 3, used both of these integrins to attach and spread on fibronectin. In support of this finding, M 21 -L cells, a variant cell line that specifically lacks alpha v beta 3 but expresses alpha v beta 1, attached and spread poorly on fibronectin. In addition, alpha v beta 3 from surface-labeled M 21 cells was retained, and selectively eluted by RGDS from a fibronectin affinity column. These results indicate that alpha v beta 3 acts in concert with alpha 5 beta 1 in promoting fibronectin recognition by these cells. We conclude that fibronectin binds to the alpha v beta 3 vitronectin receptor specifically and with high affinity, and that this interaction is biologically relevant in supporting cell adhesion to matrix proteins...|$|R

40|$|Many cell–cell {{adhesive}} {{events are}} {{mediated by the}} dimerization of cadherin proteins presented on apposing cell surfaces. Cadherin-mediated processes {{play a central role}} in the sorting of cells into separate tissues in vivo, but in vitro assays aimed at mimicking this behavior have yielded inconclusive results. In some cases, cells that express different cadherins exhibit homotypic cell sorting, forming separate cell aggregates, whereas in other cases, intermixed aggregates are formed. A third pattern is observed for mixtures of cells expressing either N- or E-cadherin, which form distinct homotypic aggregates that adhere to one another through a heterotypic interface. The molecular basis of cadherin-mediated cell patterning phenomena is poorly understood, in part because the relationship between <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> specificity and intermolecular binding free energies has not been established. To clarify this issue, we have measured the dimerization affinities of N-cadherin and E-cadherin. These proteins are similar in sequence and structure, yet are able to mediate homotypic cell patterning behavior in a variety of tissues. N-cadherin is found to form homodimers with higher affinity than does E-cadherin and, unexpectedly, the N/E-cadherin heterophilic binding affinity is intermediate in strength between the 2 homophilic affinities. We can account for observed cell aggregation behaviors by using a theoretical framework that establishes a connection between molecular affinities and cell–cell adhesive specificity. Our results illustrate how graded differences between different homophilic and heterophilic cadherin dimerizaton affinities can result in homotypic cell patterning and, more generally, show how proteins that are closely related can, nevertheless, be responsible for highly specific <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> behavior...|$|E

40|$|The dismal {{outlook for}} {{patients}} with the most aggressive and common form of adult brain cancer, glioblastoma (GBM), motivates a search for new therapeutic strategies and targets for this aggressive disease. Here we review the findings {{to date on the}} role of Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands in brain cancer. Expression of the Eph family of cell surface proteins is generally downregulated to very low levels in normal adult tissues making them particularly attractive for directed therapeutic targeting. Recent Eph targeting studies in pre-clinical models of GBM have been very encouraging and may provide an avenue to treat these highly refractory aggressive tumours. Eph receptor primary function occurs during early development, where these proteins regulate many <b>cellular</b> processes including <b>adhesive</b> and repulsive mechanisms, mediated by the ability of Eph receptor signalling pathways to regulate key molecules involved in cell motility and adhesion. Although most extensively characterised for their roles in development, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are re-expressed in a variety of diseases including a number of human malignancies (Pasquale, 2010). Dysregulated cellular de-adhesion and abnormal cytoskeletal functions affecting cell shape and motility are key features of advanced cancers. Eph and ephrins regulate many of these key cellular processes, enabling them to promote tumour invasion and metastasis. The challenge of identifying new targeted therapies with efficacy in GBM is immense. GBMs are the most common malignant primary adult brain cancer and are typically highly aggressive, infiltrative and resistant to conventional therapies. At present treatment involves surgical resection, post-operative radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy (Wen and Kesari, 2008).

These characteristics are lost when the epithelia transform during embryogenesis into mesenchymal cells or after neoplasia into invasive carcinoma cells. Of the syndecan family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans, simple epithelia produce predominantly syndecan- 1, which is found at basolateral surfaces and within adhesive junctions. To elucidate the function of this syndecan- 1, normal murine mammary gland epithelia were made deficient in syndecan- 1 by transfection with an expression vector containing the syndecan- 1 cDNA in the antisense configuration. Several independently derived clones of stable transfectants contained the antisense cDNA in their genome and expressed the antisense transcript. These grew either as epithelial islands of closely adherent polygonal cells, identical to both the parental cells and the vector-only control transfectants, or as individual elongated fusiform cells that invaded and migrated within collagen gels, like mesenchymal cells, but were anchorage-independent for growth. The clones that retained epithelial characteristics were moderately deficient in cell surface syndecan- 1 (greater than 48 % of control levels) but did not differ from control cells in expression of beta 1 -integrins and E-cadherin, or in F-actin organization. However, the clones of fusiform cells were severely deficient in cell surface syndecan- 1 (less than 12 % of control levels) and showed rearranged beta 1 -integrins, markedly reduced E-cadherin expression, and disorganized F-actin filaments, but retained mammary epithelial markers. Therefore, depleting epithelia of cell surface syndecan- 1 alters cell morphology and organization, the arrangement and expression of adhesion molecules, and anchorage-dependent growth controls.

For that purpose, different types of PDMS (i. e., soft (S-) and hard (H-) PDMS) and differently patterned surfaces were prepared by a commercially available tool which is originally used to produce patterned PDMS stamps for substrate conformal imprint lithography. To increase surface wettability and <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> behavior, PDMS surfaces were modified by O 2, Ar/O 2, Ar, and forming gas (N 2 /H 2) plasma treatment. It is shown that, especially, plasma treatment using N 2 /H 2 is a promising method to modify PDMS surfaces towards enhanced wettability. Such modified PDMS surfaces exhibit water contact angle values (WCA) of nearly 0 ° and demonstrate enhanced attachment of melanoma cells. Differences between as prepared and plasma-treated S- and H-PDMS can be observed, where H-PDMS shows smaller WCA than SPDMS. Even plasma-treated PDMS surfaces, however, exhibit only temporary hydrophilicity, due to hydrophobic recovery. To overcome this problem, plasma-treated PDMS films were stored in ethanol and water, where low and constant WCAs for several months could be achieved. Finally, the influence of surface topography of different patterned PDMS thin films on the adhesion behavior of melanoma cells was investigated. It can be concluded that chemical as well as structural modifications of PDMS enable to gradually control the adhesive properties of cells on their surfaces.

ABS {{has been used as}} a topical haemostatic agent because of its antihaemorrhagic effect. Its haemostatic mechanism of action remains to be investigated. ABS does not affect individual levels of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XIII. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ABS on endothelium and immune response. So, we investigated the possible changes in EPCR and PAI- 1 without and with LPS-challenge inside HUVECs. METHODS: 10 μL and 100 μL ABS is given to HUVECs in 5 min., 25 min., and 50 min., 6 hour and 24 hour time periods. 10 μg/ mL LPS has been added for one hour to observe the effects of LPS challenge on HUVECs and then the cells have been treated with ABS for the time period of 5 min., 25 min., 50 min. and 6 hours to observe ABS-effects on HUVECs. Total RNAs were isolated from HUVECs and then EPCR ve PAI- 1 mRNA expression levels were investigated. RESULTS: It was microscopically observed that cells arised from the surface and adhered to each other after the ABS application to the HUVECs. Also, after 24 hours cells returned the normal growth and physiology. It suggests that the <b>adhesive</b> <b>cellular</b> functions of ABS may be reversible. 10 µl ABS have negative effect on EPCR and PAI- 1 expressions. Moreover the effects increases with 100 µl ABS. EPCR and PAI- 1 expression increased by time with LPS and 10 µl ABS. Expressions were very low during the first hour when LPS and 100 µl ABS were given but at the end of 6 hour, EPCR and PAI- 1 expression increased similar to LPS and 10 µl ABS experiment.

These molecules were synthetic products of the cells, as shown by immunoprecipitation of intrinsically labeled proteins. Promyeloid U 937 cells could be induced by 4 beta-phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate to synthesize and express GPIIb/IIIa-related molecules on their cell surface. The GPIIb/IIIa-related molecules were not precisely identical in the various cell types, based on slight differences in electrophoretic mobility and their failure to react with monoclonal antibodies specific for each subunit of platelet GPIIb/IIIa. These results suggest {{the existence of a}} widely distributed family of GPIIb/IIIa-related molecules. This family of "cytoadhesins" may share a common function in <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> reactions...|$|E
40|$|Neurons {{are highly}} {{specialized}} cells that input, process, store and output information. Interneuronal communication is achieved in four basic ways: (i) Ca 2 + evoked exocytosis with chemical neurotransmission, (ii) gap junction electrotonic coupling, (iii) secretion of neurosteroids, nitric oxide and derivatives of the arachidonic acid acting in paracrine manner, and (iv) <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> protein interactions with scaffold protein reorganization. Central structure integrating these anisomorphic signals is the neuronal cytoskeleton {{that is considered}} to be both sensitive to the local electromagnetic ﬁeld and prone to intense biochemical modiﬁcation. With the use of biophysical modeling we have shown that the local electromagnetic ﬁeld interaction with neuronal microtubules could result in formation of dissipationless waves (solitons) of tubulin tail conformational states that propagate along the microtubule outer surface. Soliton collisions may subserve the function of elementary computational gates and the output of the computation performed by the microtubules may be achieved by the energase action of the tubulin tails that control microtubule-associated protein and motor protein attachment/detachment on the microtubule outer surface...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{migration}} requires {{extension of}} lamellipodia that are stabilized by formation of adhesive complexes at the leading edge. Both processes are regulated by signaling proteins recruited to nascent adhesive sites {{that lead to}} activation of Rho GTPases. The Ajuba/Zyxin family of LIM proteins are components of <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> complexes. We show that cells from Ajuba null mice are inhibited in their migration, without associated abnormality in adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, cell spreading, or integrin activation. Lamellipodia production, or function, is defective {{and there is a}} selective reduction in the level and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, p 130 Cas, Crk, and Dock 180 at nascent focal complexes. In response to migratory cues Rac activation is blunted in Ajuba null cells, as detected biochemically and by FRET analysis. Ajuba associates with the focal adhesion-targeting domain of p 130 Cas, and rescue experiments suggest that Ajuba acts upstream of p 130 Cas to localize p 130 Cas to nascent adhesive sites in migrating cells thereby leading to the activation of Rac...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1, CD 11 a/CD 18, alphaLbeta 2), {{the most}} {{abundant}} and widely expressed beta 2 -integrin, is required for many <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> interactions during the immune response. Many {{studies have shown that}} LFA- 1 is centrally involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases caused by Repeats-in-toxin (RTX) -producing bacteria. Results The porcine-LFA- 1 CD 11 a (alpha) subunit coding sequence was cloned, sequenced and compared with the available mammalian homologues in this study. Despite some focal differences, it shares all the main characteristics of these latter. Interestingly, as in sheep and humans, an allelic variant with a triplet insertion resulting in an additional Gln- 744 was consistently identified, which suggests an allelic polymorphism that might be biologically relevant. Conclusion Together with the pig CD 18 -encoding cDNA, which has been available for a long time, the sequence data provided here will allow the successful expression of porcine CD 11 a, thus giving the first opportunity to express the Sus scrofa beta 2 -integrin LFA- 1 in vitro as a tool to examine the specificities of inflammation in the porcine species. </p...|$|E
40|$|Precisely {{controlling}} the {{spatial distribution of}} biomolecules on biomaterial surface is important for directing cellular activities in the controlled cell microenvironment. This paper describes a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gradient-generating microfluidic device to immobilize the gradient of <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide on poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel. Hydrogels are formed by exposing the mixture of PEG diacrylate (PEGDA), acryloyl-PEG-RGD, and photo-initiator with ultraviolet light. The microfluidic chip was simulated by a fluid dynamic model for the biomolecule diffusion process and gradient generation. PEG hydrogel covalently immobilized with RGD peptide gradient was fabricated in this microfluidic device by photo-polymerization. Bone marrow derived rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were then cultured {{on the surface of}} RGD gradient PEG hydrogel. Cell adhesion of rat MSCs on PEG hydrogel with various RGD gradients were then qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by immunostaining method. MSCs cultured on PEG hydrogel surface with RGD gradient showed a grated fashion for cell adhesion and spreading that was proportional to RGD concentration. It was also found that 0. 107 – 0. 143 [*]mM was the critical RGD concentration range for MSCs maximum adhesion on PEG hydrogel.

40|$|Cells {{directly}} {{probe and}} respond to the physicomechanical properties of their extracellular environment, a dynamic process which has been shown to {{play a key role in}} regulating both <b>cellular</b> <b>adhesive</b> processes and differential cellular function. Recent studies indicate that stem cells show lineage-specific differentiation when cultured on substrates approximating the stiffness profiles of specific tissues. Although tissues are associated with a range of Young's modulus values for bulk rigidity, at the subcellular level, tissues are comprised of heterogeneous distributions of rigidity. Lithographic processes have been widely explored in cell biology for the generation of analytical substrates to probe cellular physicomechanical responses. In this work, it is shown for the first time that that direct-write e-beam exposure can significantly alter the rigidity of elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates and a new class of 2 D elastomeric substrates with controlled patterned rigidity ranging from the micrometer to the nanoscale is described. The mechanoresponse of human mesenchymal stem cells to e-beam patterned substrates was subsequently probed in vitro and significant modulation of focal adhesion formation and osteochondral lineage commitment was observed as a function of both feature diameter and rigidity, establishing the groundwork for a new generation of biomimetic material interfaces...|$|E
