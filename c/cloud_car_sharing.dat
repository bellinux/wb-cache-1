40|$|Motivated by the {{involvement}} of Daimler and BMW in the <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> business we consider an OEM who contemplates introducing a <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> program. The OEM designs its product line by accounting for the trade-off between driving performance and fuel efficiency. Customers have different valuations of driving performance and decide whether to buy, join <b>car</b> <b>sharing,</b> or rely on their outside option. <b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> can increase the profit from selling. This happens when the OEM prefers to serve the lower-end customers through <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> and the higher-end through selling. In this case, <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> increases {{the efficiency of the}} vehicles used for the lower-end, and the price charged to the higher-end customers. This is more pronounced for higher-end OEMs, which may help explain Daimler's and BMW's involvement in <b>car</b> <b>sharing.</b> Despite the higher efficiency, <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> may lower the OEM's Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) level even when it increases profit and decreases environmental impact.

The proven positive effects of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> can only contribute to solving traffic problems {{if the number of}} <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> customers grows. The present paper investigates, {{on the basis of a}} household survey, the awareness and the market potential of mobility service <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> in Germany. The results show that the majority of the respondents do not know what the term <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> stands for. Even within the sub-group of people who could explain what <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> is, local <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> offers are not well known. To measure the attitudes towards the different modes of transport and the acceptance of the general idea to <b>share</b> a <b>car</b> with other people, statement batteries were used. On the basis of factor analyses, linear and logistic regression models, the factors are determined that influence whether a person has a liking for <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> or not. Furthermore, the correlation between attitudes and behavioral aspects are revealed. In this context, people with multimodal mobility behavior are found to be more open-minded for shared used vehicle systems. Finally, by taking subjective (attitudes) and objective criteria (current mobility behavior) into account, the potential of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> is estimated.

40|$|<b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> is an {{emerging}} transportation industry in which drivers access {{a fleet of}} shared vehicles for short-term use. <b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> programs have demonstrated success in reducing private car ownership and kilometres travelled by private <b>car</b> and <b>shared</b> vehicle use is increasingly positioned as {{a useful tool for}} cities seeking to transition away from private car dependency. For a number of reasons, car sharing's success is dependent on the provision of fixed and reserved car parking space. Allocated parking space works to provide consistency and reliability in the location of the act of transfer where the car is conferred from one user to the next. The reservation of parking space for the <b>car</b> <b>share</b> <b>car</b> delineates the structure of a <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> network and determines its ability to offer a service to car sharers. Furthermore, the allocation of space sends a strong message of regulatory support for a sustainable transport mode, relieving <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> organisations of the need to invest in parking, and contributing to the financial viability of the <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> business, particularly in the start-up phase. This paper first presents a review of car parking policy for <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> in Sydney, Australia. We show how parking for <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> is governed at the scale of the municipality and detail the emergence of several different approaches to the provision of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> parking, with parking-related policy used to both restrict and encourage the use of <b>shared</b> <b>cars.</b> We then position these policies within the findings of a series of in depth interviews carried out with Sydney car sharers who recount their practical experiences of the way car parking makes <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> work. The ability to park a car close to home is identified as a key motivator for the uptake of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> in areas where on street parking is constrained and private off street parking unavailable. Non-car <b>sharing</b> <b>cars</b> parking illegally in designated <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> parking space is consistently cited as a key complaint, with car sharer's indicating that a lack of parking enforcement detracts considerably from car sharing's appeal. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for policy, and implications for emergent <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> models. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|SStrong {{evidence}} suggests that the climate is changing and that these changes are largely caused by human activities. A consensus exists among researchers that human activity is causing global warming and that actions to mitigate global warming need to be taken swiftly. The transportation sector, which relies heavily on fossil fuel burning and primarily oil, is one of the big contributors to air pollution problems at local, regional and global levels. It is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and is estimated to be responsible for nearly a quarter of global energyrelated carbon dioxide emissions. <b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> is a mobility solution encouraging its users to decrease private car usage in favour of communal transit and environmental goals. The idea of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> originates from the aspiration to decrease personal car ownership and to reduce vehicle distance travelled. This thesis seeks to complement the understanding of Finnish <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> users and their usage through better categorization. Through better categorization and segmentation of Finnish <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> users the thesis seeks to provide information for improved marketing insight. Research is done on the demographic and behavioural characteristics of Finnish <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> users and they are compared with international findings about the characteristics of International <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> users. The main research problem is Are Finnish <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> users similar to international ones? A theoretical research framework on the determinants of individual <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> usage is built based on international research about demographic and behaviouristic characteristics.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> has become a {{mainstream}} transportation mode for over a million users worldwide with organisations now operating in more than 1100 cities across 26 countries and on five continents. <b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> has developed alongside significant intellectual currents exploring the attributes and effectiveness of the diverse strands of transport policy. These debates include the efficacy of behaviour change programmes to shift transport practice, the imprints of neoliberalism on transport policy, and the withdrawal of the state as active agent in shaping policy privatisation. Despite its emergence amid these debates, <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> has largely escaped their due consideration. This paper brings <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> and transport policy scholarship into explicit conversation.

40|$|As {{response}} to the financial crisis and global warming, a movement called the collaborative economy or sharing economy, has risen which promotes the use and enjoyment of products and services, without actual ownership. An evident example of this movement is the phenomenon <b>car</b> <b>sharing.</b> <b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> is the organized use of a publically available car, owned by a company or private owner, which multiple persons or households can use for a monthly fee, a fee per hour, and/or a fee per mileage. This study aims {{to answer the question}} why the adoption of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> in The Netherlands is regionally very uneven distributed. To answer this question this study takes a spatial perspective on this phenomenon, and therefore complements the very recent literature on the geography of transitions. According to other studies the success of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> is highly dependent on specific regional factors. A first investigation reveals that these factors differ per region and therefore most likely explain the regional adoption differentials.

40|$|AbstractSustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) are a core {{element of}} the European Commission's Urban Mobility Package. A bundle of {{measures}} combines infrastructure; clean fuels and vehicles; and soft measures to promote walking, cycling and public transport use. Looking at the problems of cities world-wide, one crucial aspect not (yet) adequately addressed is increasing car-ownership, leading to over-consumption of space in cities creating both congestion and parking problems. The City of Bremen's SUMP, which received the 2014 CIVITAS Award and the 2015 SUMP Award, integrates <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> as a strategic element to reduce car ownership. The ambitious <b>Car</b> <b>Sharing</b> Action Plan from 2009, the first municipal thematic plan on <b>car</b> <b>sharing,</b> set a target of 20, 000 <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> users by 2020 and, more important, the replacement of about 6, 000 private cars through the service of <b>car</b> <b>sharing.</b> Annual user surveys in Bremen show that every <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>car</b> takes 15 private cars off the road. This figure includes only cars that car sharers report giving up after becoming car sharers and does not include car purchases that were avoided by users who may have bought a car if no option had been available. Station-based <b>car</b> <b>sharing,</b> with its wide variety of vehicles and the reliability of pre-reservation (but also the option of spontaneous bookings) has a much higher impact on car ownership than does free-floating <b>car</b> <b>sharing.</b> In its 2010 ‘momorandum’, the European IEE project momo <b>Car</b> <b>Sharing</b> estimated that European cities could be unburdened of the parking needs of 600, 000 cars – end-to-end a row from London to Athens – if other cities applied policies {{similar to those in}} Bremen (and also Switzerland). The potential is huge to improve traffic, the environment and quality of life in European cities. This practitioner's report presents municipal policies and activities undertaken in Bremen (1) to exploit the potential of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> (e. g. providing mobility hubs and on-street <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> stations; integration in new urban developments; multi-modal integration; optimising fleet management, information and awareness), (2) to develop quality requirements and (3) to prepare for future developments (e. g. autonomous transport systems). It also clarifies the different roles of station-based and free-floating <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> and their potential for different types of cities and towns.

While it may be true that many Americans do love their cars, it is equally true that what they love most about them is the instant mobility that they provide. <b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> is a concept that addresses the reality ofour need and desire for mobility with a growing desire to be economically and environmentally sensitive and sensible. <b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> provides access to automobiles without the costs associated with ownership. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the impacts of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> as a mobility service and to determine how to best incorporate <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> into local and regional transportation planning.

40|$|<b>Car</b> <b>sharing</b> is {{normally}} {{seen as an}} alternative for the car; however for many households the option of not owning a car may be unthinkable. In this study we explore the idea of combining <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> and vehicle ownership in order to change the consumer behavior of car purchases {{in a way that}} reduces energy usage, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions by improving the fuel efficiency of the consumer fleet. We consider the personal vehicle as a bundle of functional attributes (such as seating, luggage space, performance, all-wheel drive (AWD), towing, roof rack) and symbolic attributes (such as vehicle brand, new technology, environmental friendliness). In this case we look at the distinction between “daily use” and “peak use” attributes. If the vehicle attributes could be unbundled, the personal vehicle would include only those features needed on a daily basis, likely reducing capital costs and improving fuel economy, with <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> or another service providing the occasional “peak use” features, increasing consumer welfare. However, the transaction costs of unbundling the complete “daily use plus peak use” vehicle into a “daily use” vehicle and a shared “peak use” vehicle would have to be sufficiently small for most consumers to consider this option. In the paper we qualitatively explore what the <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> service would need to look like for the transaction costs of the service to outweigh the capital investment and operating costs of a bundled vehicle. We also explore the readiness of <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> or rental <b>car</b> companies to provide this type of service. The study consists of three parts: the first being an overview of the related literature on car choice and <b>car</b> <b>sharing.</b> The second part consists of an inventory of available models in <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> fleets in order to assess the availability of “peak use” vehicles. In the third part we interview experts and representatives from <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> and rental <b>car</b> companies in California and Sweden. We find that <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> today does not cover the needs for unbundling the vehicle. Most <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> services today have focused on providing the primary vehicle for people without a vehicle. There are not enough “peak use” vehicles available in these services to guarantee access when the consumer needs them.

Overall I attempt to address what the potential are for <b>car</b> <b>sharing,</b> and how it could be used to influence the car dependency in the society. The project is also trying to find evidence on how <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> could lead to a sustainable transport system in Bergen.

The modelling approach complies with the idea of a life-cycle assessment, since indirect effects from inter-sectoral production relations are also taken into account. The scenario results indicate that increased <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> leads to small production gains since the reductions in the losing sectors such as car producers, garages, oil processing, or insurance services, are more than compensated by the production increases in the winning sectors such as <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> services or public transportation.

In addition, increased <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> tends to require average job qualifications but more flexible working times. It further results in a regionally more evenly distributed industry structure, but some regions face considerable pressure for adjustment.

The Swiss Federal Office of Energy, in their Energie 2000 /Mobility study found that people who switch from car ownership to <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> used other forms of mobility, including walking, to a far greater extent. The 2000 Portland study also found that members used walking for almost 37 % of all trips, compared to using a private or shared automobile for about 32 % of all trips. Further, for six of the ten types of trips, walking had the largest mode share. In a recent survey of Portland Flexcar members conducted for this paper, 21 % reported that they walk more often than they did before joining Flexcar. Members also reported that they were more willing to walk in the rain and walk longer distances after joining Flexcar. As an alternative to <b>car</b> ownership, <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> imposes some scheduling and accessibility constraints that may encourage walking, but perhaps more importantly, members pay full incremental cost when they use <b>car</b> <b>sharing,</b> with itemized monthly bills describing each trip. Walking and transportation alternatives such as transit and bicycling are thus encouraged by <b>car</b> <b>sharing</b> membership...|$|R
