25|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{agricultural development}} program {{is beginning to}} take effect. The prefecture is now a commercial base for edible fungi, dried and fresh fruit, bamboo and bamboo shoots, tea, <b>commercial</b> <b>forest,</b> oil tea, sericulture, herb medicine, vegetable and nuts.

25|$|The {{eucalyptus}} species most planted are E. grandis, E. globulus and E. dunnii; {{they are}} used mainly for pulp mills. Approximately 80,000 ha of E. grandis situated in the departments of Rivera, Tacuarembó and Paysandú is primarily earmarked for the solid wood market, although a portion of it is used for sawlogs and plywood. The current area under <b>commercial</b> <b>forest</b> plantation is 6% of the total. The main uses of the wood produced are elemental chlorine free pulp mill production (for cellulose and paper), sawlogs, plywood and bioenergy (thermoelectric generation). Most of the products obtained from sawmills and pulp mills, as well as plywood and logs, are exported. This has raised the income of this sector with respect to traditional products from other sectors. Uruguayan forestry plantations have rates of growth of 30 cubic metres per hectare per year and commercial harvesting occurs after 9 years.|$|E
2500|$|Pedologic surveys {{conducted}} by the Bureau of Soils Management of the Philippine Department of Agriculture have identified two major soil series or categories in Quezon. These road categories are the Bago Sandy Clay Loam and the San Juan Clay. The San Juan Clay is extensively distributed covering about 113.94km² or about 60 percent of the municipality. It offers excellent potential for such agricultural land use like onchards, <b>commercial</b> <b>forest,</b> woodland and pasture/ grazing lands. The Bago Sandy Clay Loam on the other hand, covers about [...] or bout 40% of the municipality. This particular type of soil is devoted to lowland rice farming.|$|E

40|$|European aspen is {{important}} in boreal forests because of its rich fauna and flora. In Finnish <b>commercial</b> <b>forests,</b> however, aspen stems—especially large ones—are rare. Alternatives to aspen in managed forests were studied with a decision-support system where biodiversity was assessed according {{to the number of}} beetle species. The results showed that large aspen stems maintain the richness of beetle species in a forest. Such stems appear in <b>commercial</b> <b>forests</b> if green-retention trees remain after regeneration cutting...|$|R
