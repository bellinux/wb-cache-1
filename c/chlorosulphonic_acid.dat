The SPSBR/CNBs composites proton exchange membrane was characterized to determine the thermal stability, water uptake, porosity and proton conductivity. The results obtained revealed that blending of the membrane with CNBs improved the thermal stability, water uptake retention and proton conductivity of the membrane with about 50 % increase in proton conductivity.

40|$|Synthesis and {{characterisation}} of PEM using aryl backbone commercial polystyrene-butadiene rubber (locally sourced) {{were carried}} out by sulphonation with <b>chlorosulphonic</b> <b>acid,</b> and assessed for its potential to serve as possible PEMFC application. The effect of weight of the polystyrene-butadiene rubber (PSBR), sulphonation time, stirring speed, concentration of sulphonation agent and sulphonation temperature {{on the degree of}} sulphonation (DS), ion exchange capacity (IEC) and viscosity of the resulting sulphonated material were investigated. Synthesized membranes were thus characterized by Fourier Transform Infra-red (FT-IR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 HNMR) to confirm sulphonation. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimentry (DSC) were used to verify the thermal stability of the membrane, while impedance spectroscopy was used to measure the proton conductivity of the membrane. The results obtained revealed that the weight of the rubber, sulphonation time, stirring speed, concentration of sulphonating agent and the sulphonation temperature affect the DS, IEC, viscosity, thermal stability and proton conductivity of the membrane, such that, sulphonation time of 24 hrs and acid concentration of 1. 6 M/ml gave the best DS, with IEC ranging from 0. 23 to 2. 36 mmol/g. Conductivities were in the range of 10 - 3 – 10 - 2 S/cm. However, over 2 folds increase in ion exchange capacity and degree of sulphonation was achieved on the effect of temperature. The sulphonation kinetic of PSBR was studied in 0. 0016 mol L- 1 of <b>chlorosulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> where first-order kinetic model; without the effect of HCl and the effect of HCl were investigated. The reaction rate was found to obey the first-order model with the HCl produced having a desulphonation effect on the reaction. A predictive model Page iv developed is able to predict degree of sulphonation at different initial concentration of acid. The thermodynamic study showed that the reaction is non-spontaneous, and as temperature increases the reaction system experienced phase change from liquid to solid at temperature above 328 K. The DSC and TGA analysis showed that polystyrene-butadiene rubber is a thermo stable polymer for PEM fuel cell application with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 198 oC. Porosity of the membrane and uptake of solvent per sulphonic groups at different thickness of membrane were also calculated. The porosity of the membrane to methanol increased with a decrease in membrane thickness and increased with an increase in methanol concentration. Based on the results obtained from the porosity of the membrane to methanol and methanol up take, it can be inferred that the membrane is less permeable to methanol than water. In comparism, the porosity of the synthesised membrane to methanol was less than that of Nafion® which was in the range of 0. 40 - 0. 51. The results also showed that water uptake increases as the thickness of the membrane decreases. However, the membrane was found to exhibit a moderately water absorption and desorption capacity. But considering the effect of temperature, the membrane will require proper humidification especially if the fuel cell where the membrane will be used will be operated above room temperature.

After incubation of SS with normal guinea-pig serum, a C 3 -cleaving enzyme bound to the SS particles was present. This enzyme was inhibited by antisera against the components C 2 and C 4. Anti-serum against factor B or anti-C 3 -Fab had no inhibitory effect. Incubation at 37 ° inactivated the enzyme; activity was restored by incubation with C 2, but not with factors B and D of the APC.

However, preincubation of SS with C 4 deficient serum did not yield an enzyme which could act on purified C 3, but enzymatic activity cleaving C 4 and C 2 was present, indicating that binding and activation of C 1 had occurred. Utilizing purified C[unk] 1, it was shown that SS binds purified C[unk] 1 in a functionally active state.

In this research, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) was synthesized by sulphonation of polystyrene butadiene rubber that is readily available in South Africa, using <b>chlorosulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> as the sulphonating agent. The synthesized membrane was blended with carbon nanoballs (CNBs) produced by the swirled floating catalytic chemical fluid deposition (SFCCVD) method designed and conceptualized by Iyuke (2005). Synthesis of carbon nanoparticles with this reactor was optimized using different experimental conditions of pyrolysis temperature, flow rates of acetylene, hydrogen and argon gases. A maximum production rate of 0. 35 g/min was obtained at 1000 oC, acetylene flow rate of 370 ml/min, hydrogen flow rate of 180 ml/min and a flow ratio of acetylene to hydrogen equal to five. Since clean nanoparticles are required in this work for membrane synthesis, the SFCCVD reactor was modified to synthesize clean carbon nanoballs via a non-catalytic method. The carbon nanoballs produced were used in the formulation of sulphonated polystyrene butadiene rubber–carbon nanoballs composite membrane. The synthesised membranes and the composite membranes were characterized to determine the ion exchange capacity, degree of sulphonation, thermal stability, water uptake, vi porosity, proton conductivity, solvent uptake, and morphology and methanol crossover.

First stage is the synthesis of silica sulphuric acid ionic liquid in an eco-friendly way by the reaction of silica gel and <b>chlorosulphonic</b> <b>acid.</b> It is interesting to note that the reaction is easy, clean and not requiring any work-up procedure. Second stage is the Fisher esterification reaction of a variety of carboxylic acids and alcohol utilizing silica sulphuric acid. Third stage is the purification of products by chromatographic techniques. The fourth stage id the characterization of all the products by spectral methods. Fifth stage is the comparison of the catalytic efficiency of silica sulphuric acid with the conventional sulphuric acid catalyst. Results: The silica supported sulphuric acid is bench top reagent which is easy to handle with better accessibility of the reactants to the active sites. Fisher esterification reactions were completed with excellent yields (97 - 99 %) within 1. 5 - 8 hr at the temperature range of 80 - 135 oC. The reaction does not require any additional catalyst because the ionic liquid itself acts as a catalyst and solvent as well in these experiments, the products were isolated and the remaining catalyst was washed and reloaded with fresh substrates. When similar reactions were carried out in sulphuric acid (conventional acid catalyst), a mixture of products was obtained in poor yields One of the greatest advantages of the reagent sio 2. oso 3 h is that it is recoverable and reusable for several times without potential loss in its catalytic activity.
