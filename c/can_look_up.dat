25|$|As a solution, Nawaz {{suggests}} {{building of}} global youth-led democratic movements that are above politics, and that build demand for democracy at the civilisational level. He notes that while Islamists offer a full package to the Muslim youth, the democrats of the Muslim world offer nothing: {{there is nothing}} to dream, no democratic leaders to follow and no democratic symbolism to admire. He cites Malala Yousafzai as a successful symbol of democracy and women's rights, but stresses the need for more such symbols which young Muslims <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to.|$|E

500|$|Both Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters {{inspired}} them {{to conceive}} Kim as [...] "a character that our daughters and other girls <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to", all-the-while {{aware of the}} [...] "ancient truism" [...] that while girls seldom hesitate to watch a show about a male lead, boys are usually less {{willing to do the}} opposite. Thus, the writers decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's competent action hero and Ron her [...] "fumbling" [...] sidekick, longing to provide young girls with [...] "a character that they can pretend to be" [...] similar to their own childhood heroes, fictional spy James Bond and Captain Kirk from Star Trek. According to McCorkle, Kim has much more in common with James Bond than comic book superheroes. The recurring character Monique was created because Schooley and McCorkle felt that it would be more realistic if Kim had a female best friend in addition to Ron.|$|E

The creators were also influenced by their own childhood heroes James Bond and Captain Kirk from Star Trek, and wanted Kim to resemble a character their daughters could idolise similarly. Despite being a [...] "strong female role model", Schooley maintained that heroism [...] "doesn't help [...] a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Unlike traditional superheroes, Kim is entirely devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity; the creators avoided making the character [...] "impervious" [...] like most comic book superheroes tend to be because they wanted both her and Ron to remain relatable to younger viewers. Working completely independently from government spy organizations, Kim's crime-fighting abilities are drawn from real-life activities such as cheerleading and gymnastics, [...] "something that any kid…in the world could do", according to the creators.|$|E
