25|$|An {{electric}} vehicle charging station, also called EV charging station, electric recharging point, <b>charging</b> <b>point,</b> charge point and EVSE ({{electric vehicle}} supply equipment), {{is an element}} in an infrastructure that supplies electric energy for the recharging of electric vehicles, such as plug-in electric vehicles, including electric cars, neighborhood electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.|$|E
500|$|Chademo:On {{the left}} hand {{side of the car}} towards the rear is the “rapid” DC CHAdeMO <b>{{charging}}</b> <b>point.</b> at 125 Amps. It is beneath a cover (released from inside the car), [...] there is a dust cover beneath to keep out insects etc. [...] There are two large pins (for the charging current) and eight small ones for control circuitry. [...] The cable used for this purpose is captive to the roadside <b>charging</b> <b>point.</b> When the car is on fast (DC) charge, the air conditioning system is automatically started and refrigerated air is blown through the battery pack for cooling purposes. There is a diverter flap in the ventilation system for this. From depletion, the battery may be charged to 80% full in 20 minutes using this socket.|$|E
500|$|Mennekes:On {{the right}} hand {{side of the car}} is the “fast” and “slow” AC <b>charging</b> <b>point,</b> {{accessed}} in a similar way to the DC charge point. This is a five pin [...] point. Three large pins are the line, neutral and earth/ground. The two small pins are a control circuit. This circuit enables the charge current to be cut off when charging is complete, cuts off power if the plug is removed from the vehicle (the plug and socket are both unshuttered), prevents both rapid and fast charging being done simultaneously and also prevents the vehicle from being driven while the plug is inserted. For “fast charging”, the control box (mounted at the roadside) is limited to 20 amps enabling a charge time (from depletion) of four hours. For “slow charging”, [...] a non-captive lead/cord is provided with the car. It is intended for use in the home or other domestic places. This has a local plug at one end and a Mennekes connector at the other. [...] The Mennekes plug has a retaining trigger with a hole for a padlock to prevent the plug from being removed from the car if deemed necessary. There is a “floating” [...] control box {{in the middle of this}} lead/cord that functions similarly to the fast charger but limits current to 10 amps so enabling an eight-hour charge time (from complete depletion on 230 volts) ...|$|E

50|$|The plug-in hybrid comes {{equipped}} with two charging sockets, regular and quick charging CHAdeMO. When charging at home the driver can choose between a standard 3-pin plug socket or via a dedicated EV <b>charging</b> <b>point.</b> The vehicle {{comes with a}} 5 m charging cable for connection to a standard plug socket. From a standard plug, charging from empty to full charge takes about five hours. From a dedicated <b>charging</b> <b>point</b> at home or at a public <b>charging</b> <b>point,</b> it takes about 3.5 hours for a full charge. The DC rapid charging socket can be used at CHAdeMO charging stations. Rapid charging allows for an 80% charge in approximately 30 minutes.|$|E
