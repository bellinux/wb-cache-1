5000|$|They {{have been}} placed in the Gruiformes but this is not entirely certain. It was also {{proposed}} to ally them with the Galloanserae (Weber & Hesse, 1995).

40|$|The {{process of}} {{surveying}} crane runways has been continually refined {{due to the}} competitive situation, modern surveying instruments, additional sensors, accessories and evaluation procedures. Guidelines, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 12488 - 1, define target values that must be determined by survey. For a crane runway these are for example the span, the position and height of the rails. The process has to be objective and reproducible. However, common processes of surveying crane runways do not meet these requirements sufficiently. The evaluation of the protocols, ideally by an expert, requires many years of experience. Additionally, the recording of crucial parameters, e. g., the wear of the rail, or {{the condition of the}} <b>rail</b> fastening <b>and</b> <b>rail</b> joints, is not regulated and for that reason are often not considered during the measurement. To solve this deficit the Advanced Rail Track Inspection System (ARTIS) was developed.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a method for}} measuring the geometry of <b>crane</b> <b>rails</b> with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Two sets of <b>crane</b> <b>rails</b> were divided into segments, their planes were adjusted, <b>and</b> the characteristic <b>rail</b> lines were defined. We used their profiles to define the positional and altitude deviations of the <b>rails,</b> the span <b>and</b> height {{difference between the two}} <b>rails,</b> <b>and</b> we also verified that they complied with the Eurocode 3 standard.

40|$|<b>Crane</b> wheels <b>and</b> <b>rails</b> are {{subjected}} to intensive wear {{in the process of}} operation. Therefore, improvement of these components’ performance can be considered a task of high importance. A promising direction in this regard is surface treatment by highly concentrated energy flows such as laser beams or plasma jets. This thesis suggests that the use of gradient plasma surface treatment can improve the performance of <b>crane</b> <b>rails.</b> A research was conducted, according to which hardened zones were deposited on <b>crane</b> <b>rails</b> under different treatment modes. Microhardness was measured both at the surface and in depth using custom-made microsections. The article includes the results of study of plasma surface hardening effects on wear resistance of <b>crane</b> <b>rails.</b> Change of plasma surface treatment parameters (current, plasma torch movement speed, argon gas flow rate) allows for desired steel hardness and structure, while the choice of optimal location for hardened zones makes it possible to significantly improve wear resistance and crack resistance. As a result of plasma surface hardening, the fine-grained martensite structure is obtained with mainly lamellar morphology and higher hardness rate compared toinduction hardening or overlaying. Wear test of carbon steels revealed that plasma surfacing reduces abrasive wear rate compared to the irinitial state by 2 to 3 times. Enough sharp boundary between hardened and non-hardened portions has a positive effect on the performance of parts under dynamic loads, contributing to the inhibition of cracks during the transition from solid to a soft metal. For carbon <b>and</b> low alloy <b>rail</b> steels, the properties achieved by plasma surface hardening can effectively replace induction hardening or overlaying. The mode range for plasma surface treatment that allow sobtaining a surface layer with certain operating properties has been determined. </p...|$|R

The Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds, based upon DNA–DNA hybridization, suggested that the limpkin's closest relatives were the Heliornithidae finfoots, and Sibley and Monroe even placed the species in that family in 1990. More recent studies have found little support for this relationship. More recent DNA studies have confirmed a close relationship with particularly the cranes, with the limpkin remaining as a family close to the cranes and the two being sister taxa to the trumpeters.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Some {{aspects of}} the ecology of 93 waterbird species, found {{predominantly}} on freshwater ecosystems, are reviewed. These species, belonging to six major orders — Anseriformes (ducks, geese and Black Swan), Podicipediformes (grebes), Pelecaniformes (Australian Pelican and cormorants), Ciconiiformes (herons, ibis, spoonbills <b>and</b> bitterns), Gruiformes (<b>cranes,</b> <b>rails,</b> crakes <b>and</b> gallinules), and Charadriiformes (waders and terns) — use {{a wide range of}} habitats and about half occur throughout the continent. Knowledge of their ecology remains poor for many waterbirds, particularly cryptic and rare species, and is moderate to good for hunted species. Life histories of Australian waterbirds differ from their counterparts elsewhere. Australia’s highly variable climate and river-flooding patterns create wetland habitats, the spatial and temporal variability of which strongly influence the ecology of local waterbirds. Many waterbirds respond to newly generated habitats to feed and/or breed and then disperse or die as wetlands dry. Regular movements are not common in most Australian species although some, particularly waders, migrate between Northern Hemisphere breeding grounds and non-breeding habitat in Australia. Breeding of Australian waterbirds coincides with food abundance in the southern spring, the wet season in the tropics and following floods inland. Habitat loss through draining of wetlands, regulation of rivers, diversion of water for irrigation and floodplain development are currently the major threats to waterbirds. Other potentiall...|$|R

It thus represents a remarkable case of morphological convergence, or perhaps it is simply extremely plesiomorphic in morphology (the buttonquails, meanwhile, having turned out to be a very basal offshoot of the wader radiation).
