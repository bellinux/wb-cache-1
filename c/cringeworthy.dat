Heisler also said making the police department part of the script was a good way to better flesh out Pawnee and its townspeople. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the performances of Offerman and Aubrey Plaza, and referred to Tammy as Pawnee's equivalent of Sideshow Bob in The Simpsons Springfield.

It is clarified in the final season that the entire show spans a single academic year.|$|E
5000|$|Cheeseman was a self-centred, egocentric and materialistic Computer Hardware (Fictitious Lancelot 2000 DRAM sound card) sales {{executive}} {{with virtually no}} redeeming features, and is generally regarded as the best (and most <b>cringeworthy)</b> of the Coogan's Run characters. He is perhaps best remembered for looking into his bathroom mirror at a Travel Inn motel and saying [...] "You're a tiger! Grrrrrr!!!!!" [...] and urging a client to sign a new sales contract, even though just seconds before the client had been informed of his son's suicide.|$|E
5000|$|Paget {{felt that}} the story {{fragments}} were written exceptionally well and its approach neither pretentious or preachy. Chatziioannou disagreed, describing the writing as [...] "a series of <b>cringeworthy</b> snippets of eco awareness with all the subtlety of high school activism", a message awkwardly juxtaposed with gameplay that encouraged the destruction of wildlife. Davenport considered his motivations as he killed creature after creature, continuing on through the sake of play and pleasure, and they caused him to reflect on how his real world actions too could harm others.|$|E
5000|$|Horror review website Bloody Disgusting {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars and wrote that the film should not be {{compared}} to the original. The site concluded that the film is [...] "a pretty good modern slasher". The Radio Times also gave the film a positive review, giving the film three stars out of five and calling the film a [...] "cheeky but no less brutal remake." [...] In a retrospective by Fangoria, Ken Hanley said the film [...] "benefits from solid and focused direction" [...] and [...] "wears its <b>cringeworthy</b> elements as a badge of honor." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jasper Rees in the {{newspaper}} The Telegraph was rather less impressed, describing the show as [...] "packaged in a demoralisingly traditional form of comedy". Christopher Stevens in The Daily Mail said that by the final episode, the show had [...] "...given up all pretence at being a sitcom. It’s simply an instruction manual on what to say, think and feel about sex changes. The conversations between lovebirds Leo and Judy and their parents are excruciatingly twee. This episode centred on a father-and-son chat that was so <b>cringeworthy,</b> it could make a plank of wood curl up in embarrassment." ...|$|E
5000|$|ABC's {{coverage}} of the 2015-16 show was yet again panned by viewers. Viewers this year criticised the show as a [...] "disaster" [...] with the hashtag #abcnye hijacked with complaints during the broadcast. The Children's show was dubbed a [...] "train wreck" [...] by viewers slamming the segment as <b>cringeworthy.</b> The pub quiz, however was praised with some viewers calling host Lawrence Mooney [...] "the funniest man on tv." [...] Some viewers even asked {{for the rights to}} be handed back to the Nine Network. Ratings were comparable with the previous year for the midnight fireworks, however the 9pm family fireworks were down around 18%.|$|E
5000|$|Game Revolution's Jed Whitaker {{gave the}} game a {{positive}} review, applauding the branching paths {{and magnitude of}} content to unlock, while also praising the replay value and ability of seeing through objects, saying it added depth. Despite this, he complained of the faulty touch controls and sexualization of underage girls. Ultimately though, Whitaker gave the game an 8/10, saying [...] "I kind of love Gal-Gun: Double Peace not only for daring to be as stupid and perverse {{as it is with}} no excuses, but also for being one of the most content-rich and replayable games in its genre. If you can overlook (or enjoy) the <b>cringeworthy</b> perverseness found here, you'll find an enjoyable little shooter." ...|$|E
5000|$|He further {{commented that}} [...] "these three albums remain {{definitive}} {{in the world}} of commercially-orientated chill comps. Unlike many other series where the devotion to chilled house and trendy bar grooves borders on slavish (Ministry of Sound anyone?) this is not music as fashion. Though cleverly marketed, the Euphoria mixes are - to coin a slightly <b>cringeworthy</b> phrase - more about the music. Ambient music. They are not guilty of genre snobbery: inclusion of tracks by Groove Armada (lounge) and Kruder & Dorfmeister (dub) and Autechre (pure techno) is adequate proof of that. But these albums do suggest a recognition that, in the club music of the 90s and beyond, old-school ambient musics legacy has emerged most potently in the subtle, lush, psychedelic qualities of progressive trance and house." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cuthbert <b>Cringeworthy,</b> the {{brightest}} {{student in the}} class, is a teacher's pet and has a name for every letter of the alphabet. First appearing in 1972, he resembles a miniature Teacher (a play on the D. C. Thomson comic tradition that pets resemble their owners, like Dennis the Menace and Gnasher) and Walter the Softy from Dennis the Menace. The first thing Danny said about Cuthbert was, [...] "He reminds me of someone I don't particularly like". His character has evolved slightly; although he still swots and is as bright as ever, particularly in longer strips by Mike Pearse and Kev F. Sutherland {{he is one of}} the gang (unlike earlier strips, where he seemed to dislike the other kids) and sometimes comes up with intelligent ideas to help their cause or save the school. Cuthbert wants to be like the other kids, but although he is liked he does not quite fit in. The school janitor observes that he will never make any friends. Cuthbert is the only kid who wears the school uniform and turns in homework. A school-dance strip hints at a crush on Toots, but she quickly rejects him. Cuthbert appears in the fewest strips of all the characters.|$|E
5000|$|David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, [...] "Ty Dolla $ign {{comes off}} as a hip-hop and street-level {{alternative}} to R. Kelly or T-Pain, one who's able to sling the slang like it ain't no thing, while making epic musical moments. There's no filler, which isn't so stunning since this is an EP, and before there's even a moment of lackluster music, the large guest roster rotates another exciting name through." [...] Erin Lowers of XXL said, [...] "While Ty Dolla $ign {{may not be the}} most lyrically endowed, it’s apparent that his melodic deliveries illuminates the chopped and screwed music soundscape. Enhanced with layered synths and hyperactive basslines, Beach House EP is an open narrative about sexual politics and hedonistic satisfaction. Despite offering ratchet R&B at its finest, Ty Dolla $ign fails to provide a memorable experience that differs from his previous two mixtapes." [...] Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album a negative review saying, [...] "Beach House EP is <b>cringeworthy,</b> brainless hip hop at its worst. It's like listening to a lobotomised T-Pain perform an album written by Yo Gotti, without the polished delivery of either. The one redeeming feature is DJ Mustard's infectious, deceptively simple production. It's barebones, yet could give genuine talent the perfect platform to weave their magic on - unfortunately Ty Dolla Sign just isn't the person to deliver 'magic'." ...|$|E
5000|$|In May 2012, Wade {{revealed}} that the scriptwriters has lined up a new love interest for Priya, but she was unaware of who it would be.

[...] In August, Priya takes an interest in David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) after she is touched by his fatherly bond with Jacob Gallagher (Joe Warren-Plant). Priya and David talk and he reveals that his marriage to Jacob's mother, Alicia (Natalie Anderson), was fake. However, when Priya asks David out for a drink, she is disappointed when he turns her down. Wolfenden later confirmed that a romance between Priya and David would begin to develop and they would share [...] "secret snogs in the woods". David and Priya try to be discreet with their relationship, but after they are almost caught by Genesis Walker (Sian Reese-Williams), they decide to arrange [...] "a rendezvous" [...] outside the village. However, they are caught by Nikhil and a show spokesperson explained [...] "Being caught kissing by your brother is <b>cringeworthy</b> at the best of times, but Nikhil doesn't even know what's been going on. As far as he's aware, David is with Alicia - which means David's got a bit of explaining to do before that situation gets out of hand." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mike Watson of the Ambient Music Guide was {{favourable}} to {{the album}} {{and to the}} three chill out installments in the Euphoria series as a whole. He said that the three [...] "stellar" [...] albums [...] "prove that credibility and mainstream appeal sometimes do magically co-exist. More than any other chill compilations that appeared {{around the turn of}} the third millennium - and there were millions of them - these ones define the ecstasy-fuelled bliss of post-clubbing chillout to perfection." [...] He singled out Chilled Euphoria for its unusual choice of artists, including Brian Eno, and commended how it combined several better known ambient remixes with [...] "many lesser known gems that compilers of standard commercial fare just wouldn't bother searching out." [...] He further commented it and its two chill-out successors [...] "remain definitive in the world of commercially-orientated chill comps.

5000|$|While he had {{successfully}} {{contributed to their}} complex experimental music, his instrumental style was then grounded in classical technique and bore little consanguinity with the folk, blues, and country and western stylings that would largely anchor the band's oeuvre throughout the early 1970s. Although he performed with a full panoply of keyboard instruments (including piano and harpsichord) on 1969's Aoxomoxoa, Constanten initially played a double-manual Vox Continental II combo organ on stage before switching to McKernan's Hammond B-3 {{in the spring of}} 1969; nevertheless, he was dissatisfied with the comparatively dulcet timbres of both instruments vis-à-vis guitarists Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir in a live performance context: [...] "Their sounds ranged from barely acceptable to <b>cringeworthy.</b> For another, I couldn't find a place for the sustained sound of an organ in a guitar band context—ahhh, for a piano! Furthermore, the action of an organ keyboard, electronic or not, was sufficiently different from that of a piano, which was all I'd known until then, to be an obstacle to my getting a feel for the music. Basically, I wasn't an organist. A Merl Saunders or a Melvin Seals could've stepped in... but they weren't there. As if that weren't enough, the amplification technology of the times was much kinder to guitars, with their direct pickups, than it was to pianos. All the electric keyboards available then, you might recall, represented some sort of cheesy compromise with the real thing..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dinner time is {{exceptionally}} busy, {{and several}} guests are {{dissatisfied with the}} quality of the service and the food. One guest, Mr. Johnston, and his wife complain that her starter prawns are [...] "off", and they wish it to be deducted from their bill, even though she has already eaten half of them. Another couple, the Arrads, have been waiting nearly half an hour for their main course. When Basil checks on them, however, they do not even mention it. Meanwhile, Sybil lazily talks to one of the guests (who himself appears not to be enjoying her conversation), leaving everyone else to cope. Just as Basil is about to serve the Johnstons their lamb, an elegant Englishwoman, Mrs. Hamilton, then arrives to check in, forcing Mr. Johnston to collect the lamb himself. A loud and short-tempered American man follows Mrs. Hamilton in, complaining about the weather and the journey from London, including the size of his hired car and having to drive on [...] "the wrong side of the road" [...] (and sarcastically referring to the M5 as a [...] "little backstreet"). The patriotic Basil is irate and makes derogatory comments about the man until Mrs. Hamilton introduces him as her husband, forcing Basil into <b>cringeworthy</b> backtracking. Mr. Hamilton demands a proper meal, even though the kitchen is closed, and also insists on freshening up first. Mr. Hamilton bribes Basil with £20 to keep the chef on so the kitchen will stay open. Tension is heightened as, whilst Basil annoys the Hamiltons to no end, Sybil makes good friends with them.|$|E
5000|$|Poet {{and critic}} G. Lelevich, in Pechat i Revolyutsia (Press and Revolution, No.1, 1926), {{expressed}} his reservations:"Surely, {{the poem is}} masterfully written, but the chasm between the brain and the heart here is painful. There are some emotionally charged, infectious bits, but as a whole this poem {{is the result of}} 'mind's cool reflections'... It's a tragedy that the ultra-individualistic verses 'about that' are strikingly sincere with Mayakovsky, while the Lenin poem, some exceptions aside, is cerebral and rhetorical. Neither singing paeans to the revolution through abstract logic, nor exploiting the bohemian and individualistic motives of old will do as the basis for Mayakovsky's huge talent's further development. He really needs to step over himself... The Lenin poem is a failed but significant and promising attempt to do just that. Critic Viktor Pertsov (at the time a LEF activist) in his 1925 article [...] "Revising the Left Front Policy in the Modern Russian Art", wrote: [...] "The poem 'Vladimir Ilyich Lenin' is this extraordinarily strange, self-contradictory thing. On the one hand, the grief over this immense loss is cast in such words that won't fail to excite any of the future generations. Their condensed bitterness is a timeless battle cry, not just for the future, for the present too. On the other hand, several pages earlier we have the insufferable wordiness, <b>cringeworthy</b> naivety and clumsiness in the descriptions of Lenin's life, as well as history of the working class. May be because… Lenin's genius is so huge, Mayakovsky should have stayed away from this historical narrative which proved to be so restrictive for his constructive horizons." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kyle Smith of the New York Post {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} four stars, saying [...] "The comedy-action mash-up is as weird as if the Dark Knight took a break from belting the Joker to plug Pizza Hut and bang out a hiphop beat on his nunchucks." [...] Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "While this reboot is fun, it's also forgettable and {{occasionally}} infuriating." [...] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film zero stars, saying [...] "Even youngsters may wonder why any hint of charm or fun has scurried away. Those new to the franchise may withdraw their head into their neck, turtle-like." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "Rougher and slightly funnier than the 1990 original, but still harmless junk at best." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film one and half stars out of four, saying [...] "Not much of an effort is made to differentiate the personalities of the turtles, who all frankly look as grotesque as a Terry Gilliam cartoon." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times said [...] "Attached to this movie, the title no longer sounds zany; it looks like a series of keywords." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said [...] "There is something half-hearted about the entire film, as if those behind it were involved not because they wanted to make it, not because they should make it, but just because they could." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+, saying [...] "Too-brief thrills only shine a harsher light on the film's laborious pacing and <b>cringeworthy</b> one-liners spilling from the maws of the ninja teens." ...|$|E
5000|$|Conversely, Gabriel Chong of [...] "Movie Exclusive" [...] {{gave the}} film four stars {{out of a}} {{possible}} five, praising the dialogue, wedding and action scenes, and particularly Condons direction, stating, [...] "In the hands of a lesser director, the turn of events could very well descend into farce—thankfully then, this movie has found a masterful helmsman in Condon." [...] He went on to praise Stewarts performance, calling it [...] "mesmerising" [...] and saying that she [...] "makes Bellas every emotion keenly felt that runs the gamut from joy, trepidation, anxiety, distress and above all quiet and resolute determination." [...] Mark Adams of Daily Mirror also gave the film four stars out of five and said, [...] "The Twilight films manage to cleverly blend melodrama with supernatural thrills, and while the film is not without its silly moments and <b>cringeworthy</b> dialogue it does deliver the drama and emotional highs we have come to expect". He also praised the wedding, describing it as [...] "beautifully staged", and Stewarts performance. Other positive reviewers from The New York Times and Philadelphia Inquirer said the dialogue was improving and the whole movie played out with style, while being faithful to the book and servicing hardcore fans. MSN Entertainment critic Alaina OConnor gave Condon some praise for bringing [...] "a certain visual elegance that helps with some of the more-absurd elements of the story." [...] OConnor also felt that the film {{did a good job of}} [...] "examining the relationship between Edward and Bella", but felt that the narrative was weak otherwise. The film was also ranked the tenth best film of 2011 by E!. Will Brooker, writing for Times Higher Education, makes the case that Breaking Dawn has a feminist element, stating that it [...] "reverse(s) the embedded cinematic conventions of male voyeur and female-as-spectacle", and that [...] "the lack of attention to (Bella) as sex object is remarkable." ...|$|E
40|$|Eleven years ago, I wrote a novel. It {{was called}} Combat Aircrew Seven. There {{had been nothing}} written about my obscure {{military}} profession up to that point, at least nothing I could find on Amazon or Barnes and Noble. I was a naval flight officer, mission commander on the P- 3 C Orion antisubmarine, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft. It has since been replaced with the P- 8 Poseidon which I employ in my novel, Killing Atlas. ^ A decade later, I read the pages of Combat Aircrew Seven (quickly scanning with my face turned partially away from the pages), and while there were certainly some <b>cringeworthy</b> passages, it wasn’t a terrible novel, but I {{found a way to}} publish it in paperback for free and purchase copies to pass around to family and friends. One will pop up on the online bookstores from time-to-time but I never marketed it to a wider audience than family, friends of family, squadron-mates in the P- 3 community and shipmates in two aircraft carrier battle groups. ^ I’ve been working on “Killing Atlas”, my second attempt for approximately four years. Until late 2015, I wasn’t writing consistently but I eventually realized that, after a full military career and another decade running a small business, writing became something more than a lark and was something I had to pursue full-time. Whether the novel is good is yet to be seen, but I learned long ago that, to do something well it takes hard work and study. After two careers, this was something I really wanted to learn to do as well as possible, so I joined the MFA in Creative Writing program. ^ My novel is 2 ̆ 7 hard 2 ̆ 7 science fiction, {{which is to say that}} I extrapolate 40 -years into the future, current technological research. It is fictional until the technology exists, but I stay away from the impossible fantasy genre which employs concepts not possible according to laws of physics, whether that be Einstein 2 ̆ 7 s Theory of Relativity or the mysteries of Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Mechanics and Physics allow me to propose concepts that are unimaginable because it is that physics that gave us the ceramic superconductor which defies all physics – scientists simply don’t know how it works, only that it does. This is like many psychotropic drugs, even lithium that has been used for decades for bipolar disorder. Neuroscientists can 2 ̆ 7 t explain precisely 2 ̆ 7 why 2 ̆ 7 they work 2 ̆ 7. Even as late as 2009, Columbia University was soliciting funding to better understand how Lithium works in bipolar patients as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). [1] Killing Atlas was originally military fiction set in the present but I learned over the past two and a half years that I could take the story anywhere I liked, and though the primary setting I chose to set the story is still the island nation of Singapore, I have extrapolated current societal aspects a half-century into the future. ...|$|E
