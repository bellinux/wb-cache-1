5|$|Vincent first {{appears in}} the December 16, 2004 episode as his alter-ego Valerie Davis. While working as an {{executive}} assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, Valerie is characterized through her connection with the Crane family and past sexual encounter with Chad Harris-Crane.

25|$|Nolde {{arrived on}} a {{steamship}} in 1880 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He {{was drawn to}} the German speaking communities of southeastern Pennsylvania and quickly found employment as a weaver for the Louis Kraemer Woolen Mills near Reading. Nolde soon rose {{to the top of the}} <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder</b> at Kraemer Mills, from there he was able to acquire much of the machinery that Kraemer Mills had used in their hosiery business. Nolde established his own hosiery factory in Reading in 1888, just eight years after leaving Germany. Nolde took on some partners, Jacob Lorah and George Horst, and was able to expand his hosiery business. His operation, Nolde and Horst Company, employed 500 workers who operated about 400 knitting machines in 1897.|$|E
25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder.</b> They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E
500|$|Player Piano {{draws upon}} Vonnegut's {{experience}} as an employee at GE. He satirizes the drive to climb the <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder,</b> one that in Player Piano is rapidly disappearing as automation increases, putting even executives out of work. His central character, Paul Proteus, has an ambitious wife, a backstabbing assistant, {{and a feeling of}} empathy for the poor. Sent by his boss, Kroner, as a double agent among the poor (who have all the material goods they want, but little sense of purpose), he leads them in a machine-smashing, museum-burning revolution. Player Piano expresses Vonnegut's opposition to McCarthyism, something made clear when the Ghost Shirts, the revolutionary organization Paul penetrates and eventually leads, is referred to by one character as [...] "fellow travelers".|$|E
5000|$|The bamboo {{ceiling in}} the United States {{is a subtle}} and complex form of discrimination, and the {{umbrella}} term [...] "Asian American" [...] extends to include a number of diverse groups, including South Asians, East Asians, and Southeast Asians. These groups are often subject to [...] "model minority" [...] stereotypes, and viewed as quiet, hardworking, family-oriented, high achieving in math and science, passive, non-confrontational, submissive, and antisocial. In the workforce, some of these perceptions may seem positive in the short-term, but in the long-term they impede progression up the <b>corporate</b> and academic <b>ladders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Adler (1975) {{proposed}} that the emancipation of women during the 1970s increased economic opportunities for women and allowed women to be as crime-prone as men. While [...] "women have demanded equal opportunity {{in the fields of}} legitimate endeavours, a similar number of determined women have forced their way into the world of major crime such as white-collar crime, murder, and robbery" [...] (Adler, 1975: 3). She suggested that as women were climbing up the <b>corporate</b> business <b>ladder,</b> they were making use of their 'vocational liberation' to pursue careers in white-collar crime. However, feminism has made female crime more visible through increased reporting, policing and the sentencing of female offenders and, even then, the statistical base is small in comparison to men. Carlen (1985) argues that Adler's 'new female criminal' is cast as the 'biological female' who is essentially masculine. The 'new female' criminal {{turns out to be the}} 'old maladjusted masculine female' of traditional criminology, rejecting her proper feminine role such as institutionalising rather than incarcerating women who commit 'male' offences such as robbery, i.e. Adler's 'sisters in crime' appears to work within the frameworks of traditional criminology rather than a feminist one.

500|$|In May 2008, {{several issues}} {{came to the}} fore that damaged the {{credibility}} of Burger King and its position on the topic. Steven Grover was found to be trolling websites that have posted pro-CIW positions and opinions; under an assumed screen name, Grover posted several comments disparaging the ethics and honesty of the leadership of the group. Besides the trolling incident, Grover was tied to several terse, stridently worded e-mails sent from a possibly fictitious employee name at the BK global headquarters in Miami to supporters and media groups; the company labeled these communications as unsanctioned and not reflecting official corporate positions. Additionally, Burger King was found to have hired an outside security company, Pembroke Pines, Florida based Diplomatic Tactical Services, to infiltrate the CIW and its supporting groups and spy on their members. After these issues came to light, BK terminated Grover and company spokesman Keva Silversmith, as well as its relationship with Diplomatic Tactical Services. Critics of the personnel action, such as PR Watch editor Sheldon Rampton, noted that it appeared that the two terminated employees were being made scapegoats by the company. Rampton went on to note that Silversmith had been, up to {{a few weeks before the}} story came to light, employed by the PR firm Edelman, which had been contracted by company parent Burger King Brands to provide PR services; Edelman has employed tactics on the behalf of its other clients, Wal-Mart and Microsoft, which Rampton and his organization termed [...] "sleazy". [...] Sen. Sanders agreed with Rampton's claim of scapegoating, and called for hearings into the incidents to investigate the company's behaviors to see if other Burger King officers had instigated the attacks on the labor group as company policy. Sanders stated that he wished to [...] "make sure that we find out how high up the <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder</b> this scheme went".|$|E

40|$|Communication is {{of central}} {{importance}} {{for business and}} public authorities to make substantial progress on the sustainability <b>ladder.</b> <b>Corporate</b> social responsibility (CSR) is about the contribution of business to sustainability, and stakeholder theory is an integral concept of CSR. The literature regularly associates stakeholder management with good CSR schemes and practices. Proactive companies are assumed to interact at a certain level with their affected stakeholders through their business activities. It is quite common to find studies that show a direct connection between stakeholder management and business success, {{especially with regard to}} financial success. However, this study, based on an in-depth case study on Campina, the second largest dairy company in the Netherlands, has its primary focus not on direct financial implications of stakeholder management, but on the impact proactive stakeholder management has on the interaction between companies and public authorities. The study argues that CSR pro-active companies are better positioned in their sectors, especially when relating with public authorities, and that such companies are better able to influence the policy-making process compared with their competitors...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to other survey modes, web-surveys allow {{for using a}} closed response format for survey questions {{with a large number}} of categories, such as car types, camera types, countries, regions, industries, and occupations. In other survey modes, these questions require an open response format, followed by field- or office-coding. Web-surveys allow the use of drop-downs, for example for an alphabetically sorted list of 200 + countries, or for the use of search trees. A search tree is the most appropriate way for selfidentification of occupation, which is a key variable in socio-economic research. This paper summarizes the design principles underlying a Database of Occupations for the measurement of occupations in multi-country web-surveys by means of selfidentification. The Database was compiled as part of the FP 6 funded EurOccupations project (2006 - 2009, no 028987). The paper introduces the use of the occupation variable in datasets, in particular multi-country datasets, and explores the reasons why the Database has been designed. Using a variety of sources, the Database includes almost 1, 600 occupational titles, which is judged to be sufficiently detailed for valid-self-identification. The Database consists of a source list, a search tree and translations into the languages of almost 50 countries. It is explained how the source list has taken into account issues such as skill levels, <b>corporate</b> hierarchies, job <b>ladders,</b> managerial and supervisory occupations, craft versus manufacturing occupations, composite occupations and the methods used for translations. The requirements posed by web-surveys, such as readability, alphabetical sorting, coping with the category "Other" are discussed. Finally, the paper details how the Database is used in the worldwide WageIndicator web-survey. For more information see www. euroccupations. org or www. wageindicator. org...|$|R

2500|$|Tommy grows {{dissatisfied}} with the Jaffes, feeling {{that they are not}} helping him. Seeking out other possibilities, Tommy ends up abandoning and undermining the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert), a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing nihilistic/absurdist philosophy. She teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and their problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of [...] "pure being." [...] Being lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever, yet she tells them that it is inevitable to be drawn back to the human drama, and to understand that the core truth of that drama is misery and meaninglessness. In order to prove her point, Caterine takes Albert to go and have sex in the woods, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy finds out about the two of them being together and feels hurt. Caterine tells him that they found each other through all of the human suffering and drama. Tommy rejects this idea and leaves them furious and lost. Meanwhile, in Brad's further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian. In the following days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives: Dawn rejects the modeling world and looks for deeper meaning, and Brad realizes that his whole ascent on the <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder</b> is meaningless, as he has lived his whole life just trying to please others and not himself.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to {{the sticky}} floor, the frozen middle {{describes}} {{the phenomenon of}} women's progress up the <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder</b> slowing, if not halting, {{in the ranks of}} middle management. Originally the term referred to the resistance corporate upper management faced from middle management when issuing directives. Due to a lack of ability or lack of drive in the ranks of middle management these directives do not come into fruition and as a result the company's bottom line suffers.The term was popularized by a Harvard Business Review article titled [...] "Middle Management Excellence". Due to the growing proportion of women to men in the workforce, however, the term [...] "frozen middle" [...] has become more commonly ascribed to the aforementioned slowing of the careers of women in middle management. The 1996 study [...] "A Study of the Career Development and Aspirations of Women in Middle Management" [...] posits that social structures and networks within businesses that favor [...] "good old boys" [...] and norms of masculinity exist based on the experiences of women surveyed. According to the study, women who did not exhibit stereotypical masculine traits, (e.g. aggressiveness, thick skin, lack of emotional expression) and interpersonal communication tendencies are at an inherent disadvantage compared to their male peers. As the ratio of men to women increases in the upper levels of management, women's access to female mentors who could advise them on ways to navigate office politics is limited, further inhibiting upward mobility within a corporation or firm. Furthermore, the frozen middle affects female professionals in western and eastern countries such as the United States and Malaysia, respectively, as well as women in a variety of fields ranging from the aforementioned corporations to STEM fields.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} {{principal}} photography was completed, Ashby had his editor send {{what he had}} cut together so far. The director was shocked at the results and fired the editor. He was afraid {{that he would have}} to edit the film himself. Ayres recommended bringing in Robert C. Jones, one of the fastest editors in the business, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Jones put the film back into rushes and six weeks later had a first cut ready that ran four hours. Ashby was very impressed with his abilities and trusted him completely. Jones cut the film with Ashby at the filmmaker's home. The process took an unusually long time, as the director agonized over all the footage he had shot. Ashby would ignore phone calls from Columbia, and eventually executives higher and higher up the <b>corporate</b> <b>ladder</b> tried to contact him. Ashby was in London, England meeting with Peter Sellers about doing Being There when he received a phone call from Jones, who told him that Columbia was fed up with the time it was taking for the film to be assembled. The head of the studio's editing department called Jones to say that a representative was coming to take the film. Jones refused to give up the film, and Ashby called the studio and managed to calm down the officials. Towne occasionally visited Ashby's house to check in and did not like the pacing of the film. According to Towne, Ashby [...] "left his dramatizing to the editing room, and the effect was a thinning out of the script". During the editing process, Columbia hated the jump cuts Ashby employed. The studio was also concerned about the number of expletives. It needed a commercial hit as they were in major financial trouble. By August 1973, the final cut of The Last Detail was completed and submitted to the MPAA, which gave it an R rating.|$|E
