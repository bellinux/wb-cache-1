50|$|A <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> used {{in central}} air {{conditioning}} systems typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming refrigerant vapor into liquid, a compressor to raise {{the pressure of the}} refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside. A typical configuration of such a <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> is as follows: The heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside. In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes, which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can move from outside to inside the unit. There is a motorized fan inside the <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> near the top, which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan. The fan is used to blow the outside cooling air in through the heat exchange section at the sides and out the top through the grating. These condenser units are located {{on the outside of the}} building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit. Of course, an electric power supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{integration}} of a flue gas <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> {{in a district}} heating (DH) system source increases {{the efficiency of the}} DH system due to the partial recovery of flue gas heat. A multi-regression equation obtained linking the gas <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> efficiency indicator with several statistically significant independent variable parameters based on the statistical analysis of the DH system data in Ludza, Latvia, is discussed in this paper. Parameters related to the interaction between the gas <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> and the DH system, boiler capacity and the influence of the DH network return temperature on the efficiency of the gas <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> is discussed in more detail. To assess the efficiency of the gas <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> and to show the distribution of the boiler house heat load between the boiler and the gas <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> during the heating season, a diagram is proposed. As a result of the installation of a gas <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> after the boiler, the primary energy savings during the heating season is 11. 8 %...|$|R

5000|$|... 1974 - Formed by two Leeds based {{entrepreneurs}} Alan Duttine and Peter Midgley who recognised {{the opportunity}} for air conditioning for specialist computer and healthcare environments {{at the dawn of}} a new technological era. Alan and Peter who both worked for Calverley based Thermatank barely knew each other, but met by chance, at Leeds Bradford International Airport when their flights were delayed. The two got talking and decided to set up Airedale Air Conditioning in June 1974. Airedale Air Conditioning manufactures its first precision air conditioning unit and <b>condenser</b> <b>unit,</b> the VA5 and CU5.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to packaged systems {{is the use}} of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems. These systems, although most often seen in residential applications, are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings. The evaporator coil is connected to a remote <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.|$|E
5000|$|A {{heat pump}} is an air {{conditioner}} in which the refrigeration cycle can be reversed, producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating. Some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a central air conditioner. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).|$|E

Extension of service life of the operating NPP power units {{is one of the most}} important tendencies of the modern stage of nuclear power engineering development and the most efficient funds investment for preserving generating capacities. The data indicate when modernizing the <b>condensing</b> <b>unit,</b> its cooling area was increased for about 4, 000 m 2 due to increasing number of tubes. In addition, tube geometrical dimensions were changed; the wall thickness was reduced from 1 and 2 mm to 0. 7 and 1. 25 mm respectively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of air-conditioning, {{the largest}} energy demand for {{buildings}} in the tropics, is increasing as regional population and affluence grow. The majority of installed systems are split type air-conditioners. While the performance of new equipment is much better, {{the influence of the}} microclimate where the <b>condensing</b> <b>units</b> are installed is often overlooked. Several studies have used CFD simulations to analyse the stack effect, a buoyancy-driven airflow induced by heat rejected from <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> This leads to higher on-coil temperatures, deteriorating the performance of the air-conditioners. We present the first field measurements from a 24 -storey building in Singapore. A network of wireless temperature sensors measured the temperature around the stack of <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> We found that the temperatures in the void space increased continuously along the height of the building by 10 – 13 °C, showing a significant stack effect from the rejected heat from <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> We also found that hot air gets stuck behind louvres, built as aesthetic barriers, which increases the temperature another 9 °C. Temperatures of around 50 °C at the inlet of the <b>condensing</b> <b>units</b> for floors 10 and above are the combined result, reducing the unit efficiency by 32 % compared to the undisturbed design case. This significant effect is completely neglected in building design and performance evaluation, and only with an integrated design process can truly efficient solutions be realised...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Recessed spaces outside {{high-rise}} {{residential buildings}} of public-type in Hong Kong often contain {{a large number}} of <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> of window-type air-conditioners that during summer reject heat into this space at the same time. For four <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> per story, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is used to predict temperature and flow fields inside the recessed spaces that differ in heights and condenser-unit locations. The results show that a powerful rising hot air stream and one vortex pair are formed in the space near to its corner wall. In addition, the results show that <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> will suffer more when they are placed inside the taller recessed space, and at locations higher at this space and nearer to its corner wall. Then, these units would draw less air at an elevated temperature, and therefore become less energy efficient and de-rated in output capacity and sometime have interrupted operation. However, the <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> at lower levels may benefit because they will draw more air at nearly environmental temperature. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, forced {{circulation}} evaporators {{in the food}} industry use modified designs that mimic the original system however involve extra secondary steam units to enhance {{forced circulation}} flow. Whilst the single effect design employs a <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> to stimulate a condensation action subsequent to vapour inflow from the heat exchanger, the double effect design does a similar duty however the extra component acts to reduce the overall pressure in the system. In comparison, the triple effect system is used when high levels of effective evaporation are needed with minimum labour. In this design, the liquid enters the third effect at a low temperature {{and moves to the}} second stream in which concentration is increased due to the previous evaporation effect. Finally, the optimum product concentration is achieved in the first effect.|$|E
50|$|Newcomen's {{engine was}} only {{replaced}} when James Watt improved it in 1769 {{to avoid this}} problem (Watt {{had been asked to}} repair a model of a Newcomen engine by Glasgow University; a small model that exaggerated the problem). In the Watt steam engine, condensation took place in an exterior <b>condenser</b> <b>unit,</b> attached to the steam cylinder via a pipe. When a valve on the pipe was opened, the vacuum in the condenser would, in turn, evacuate that part of the cylinder below the piston. This eliminated the cooling of the main cylinder walls and such, and dramatically reduced fuel use. It also enabled the development of a double-acting cylinder, with both upwards and downwards power strokes, increasing amount of power from the engine without a great increase {{in the size of the}} engine.|$|E
5000|$|The mine {{power station}} {{is located at}} the eastern base of the Urquhart Shaft hill (...) [...] The power station forms a {{two-level}} complex comprising two sections, a boiler and furnace house on the eastern side and a turbine-generator powerhouse on the western side. The external appearance of both sections has remained comparatively unchanged since construction although substantial extension and adaptation of internal structure and plant have taken place with the development of the mine. The power station was initially coal-fired. The boiler house now contains oil-fired furnaces and waste-heat boilers which powered compressors to produce compressed air for the entire mine operation The power house which is a long steel framed corrugated iron clad building aligned north south has been substantially renewed and re- equipped since the 1950s. The original central third of the powerhouse remains structurally intact. This section originally housed Nos.1 and 2 turbo-generators. No.3 turbo generator (made in England by The General Electric Co Ltd., Witton, Birmingham) was installed in line north of No.2 in 1936 to replace No.1 generator after it blew up. No.2 generator has since been removed leaving No.3 as the only surviving early generator plant. No.3 plant comprising a General Electric alternator and turbine generator is coupled to a water-tube <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> (manufactured by Hick Hargreaves & Co Ltd., Bolton, England) situated beneath. The northern and southern sections of the powerhouse contain compressors installed in the 1950s. Mine power is now drawn from Mica Creek power station.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{split-type}} air-conditioners in {{new apartment}} buildings becomes popular in Hong Kong.

When surrounding temperature gets 34. 2 °C, the outlet reaches 69 °C. That high surrounding temperature could reduce output of condenser. Aiming at the problem of condenser output limit, the spray humidification system is presented here to reduce inlet air temperature. Then temperature drops of different contact factors are studied, and results show the higher surrounding temperature, the bigger temperature drop, which means spray humidification system could reduce inlet air temperature effectively, especially in high surrounding temperature...|$|E
