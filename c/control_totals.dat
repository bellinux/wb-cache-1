40|$|The {{efficient}} use of auxiliary information to improve the precision of estimation of population quantities of interest is a central problem in survey sampling. We consider nonparametric regression estimation using much weaker assumptions on the superpopulation model in more general survey situations. Complex designs such as multistage and multiphase sampling are often employed in many large-scale surveys. Nonparametric model-assisted estimators, based on local polynomial regression, for two-stage and two-phase sampling designs are proposed. The local polynomial regression estimator is a nonparametric version of the generalized regression (GREG) estimator and shares most of the desirable properties of the generalized regression estimator. The estimator of the finite population total for two-stage element sampling with complete cluster auxiliary information is a linear combination of cluster total estimators, with sample-dependent weights that are calibrated to known <b>control</b> <b>totals.</b> The nonparametric estimator for two-phase sampling with a regression model for between-phase inference is also expressed as a weighted linear sum of the study variable of interest over a second-phase sample, in which the weights are not calibrated directly to known <b>control</b> <b>totals,</b> but are calibrated to the Horvitz-Thompson estimators of known <b>control</b> <b>totals</b> over a first-phase sample. Asymptotic design unbiasedness and design consistency of the estimators are established, and consistent variance estimators are proposed. Simulation experiments indicate that the local polynomial regression estimators are more efficient than parametric regression estimators under model misspecification, while being nearly as good when the parametric mean function is correctly specified...|$|E

40|$|Sample weight calibration, also {{referred}} to as calibration estimation, is a widely applied technique in the analysis of survey data. This method borrows strength from a set of auxiliary variables and can produce weighted estimates with smaller mean square errors than those estimators that do not use the calibration adjustments. Poststratification is a well-known calibration method that forces weighted counts within cells generated by cross-classifying the categorical (or categorized) auxiliary variables to equal the corresponding population <b>control</b> <b>totals.</b> Several assumptions are critical to the theory developed to date for weight calibration. Two assumptions relevant to this research include: (i) the <b>control</b> <b>totals</b> calculated from the population of interest and known without (sampling) error; and (ii) the sample units selected for the survey are taken from a sampling frame that completely covers the population of interest (e. g., no problems with frame undercoverage).

40|$|Agent-based microsimulation {{models for}} land use or {{transportation}} simulate {{the behavior of}} agents over time, although at different time scales and with different goals. For both kinds of models, the initial step {{is the definition of}} agents and their relationships. Synthesizing the population of agents often is the only solution, due to privacy and cost constraints. In this paper, we assume that the model simulates persons grouped into households, and a person/household population needs to be synthesized. However, the methodology presented here can be applied to other kinds of agent relationships as well, e. g. persons and jobs/workplaces or persons and activity chains. Generating a synthetic population requires (a) reweighting of an initial population, taken from census or other survey data, with respect to current constraints, and (b) choosing the households that belong to the generated population. The reweighting task can be performed using an Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure; however, IPF cannot control for attributes at both person and household levels. A frequently applied pattern is to estimate household-level weights using IPF, so that they match the <b>control</b> <b>totals</b> for the households, and then, using these weights, to generate a population of households that best fits the person-level <b>control</b> <b>totals.</b> We propose an algorithm that estimates household-level weights that fit the <b>control</b> <b>totals</b> at both person and household levels. This eliminates the need to account for person-level control during the generation of synthetic households. The algorithm essentially performs a proportional fitting in the domains of both households and persons, and introduces an entropy-minimizing fitting step to switch between these two domains. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm by generating a synthetic population for Switzerland and checking it against the complete Swiss census. ...|$|E

A procedure was developed to construct <b>control</b> <b>totals,</b> which were consistent with estimates of age, gender, and race/ ethnicity obtained from a commercial source and distributions of other demographic variables from the Current Population Survey.

The resulting risk factor estimates were then compared with those based on the current BRFSS weighting methodology and mean squared error estimates were developed. The research demonstrates that by identifying socio-demographic variables associated with key outcome variables and including these variables in the weighting methodology, nonresponse bias can be substantially reduced.

40|$|Weighting for {{the monthly}} Current Population Survey {{includes}} an iterative proportional fitting procedure (“second-stage ratio adjustment ” or “raking”) that forces CPS estimates to match {{three sets of}} population <b>control</b> <b>totals.</b> The procedure now in place successively computes ratio adjustments to weights so that estimates are forced to match three sets of controls representing the Civilian Noninstitutional Population of the United States: 1) state controls; 2) national ethnicity x gender x age controls; and 3) national race x gender x age controls.

40|$|The {{design of}} the Finnish Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a complex {{rotating}} panel. Survey is repeated over time with partially overlapping samples. In the case of repeated surveys with partial overlapping, it has been seen that to utilize entire information collected in the previous waves is very advantageous (for example Singh et al., 2001). Currently, the Finnish LFS uses the generalized regression (GREG) estimator. It is based only on the current quarter's data. The LFS does not use the fact that 60 % of the LFS sample is common between consecutive quarters to improve estimates. Exploiting sample overlap over time to improve efficiency of estimates can be done via calibration by using a certain composite estimator. A method termed regression composite (RC) estimator extends the GREG-estimator {{in the sense that}} it takes advantage of the correlations over time induced by sample overlap to achieve gains in efficiency. The RC-estimator introduced by Singh, Kennedy and Wu (2001), Fuller and Rao (2001) and Gambino, Kennedy and Singh (2001). Methods have also been studied in Bocci and Beaumont (2005).
