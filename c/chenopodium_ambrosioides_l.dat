40|$|Introduction: Mastruz (<b>Chenopodium</b> <b>ambrosioides)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} used plants in folk medicine.

40|$|AbstractThe {{essential}} oil of <b>Chenopodium</b> <b>ambrosioides</b> <b>L.,</b> Amaranthaceae, {{was obtained by}} steam distillation in a Clevenger apparatus and characterization was performed using chromatographic and spectroscopic assays (GC-FID, GC/MS, 1 H NMR). Two major compounds were identified: p-cymene (42. 32 %) and ascaridole (49. 77 %). The ethanolic extract and hydrolate were fractionated by liquid–liquid partitioning and the compounds were characterized by GC/MS. The {{essential oil}}, ethanol extract and fractions by partitioning with dicloromethane, ethyl acetate and butanol were tested in tumor cell lines (K 562, NALM 6, B 15, and RAJI). Significant cytotoxic activity was found for essential oil (IC 50 = 1. 0 μg/ml) for RAJI cells and fraction dicloromethane (IC 50 = 34. 0 μg/ml) and ethanol extract (IC 50 = 47. 0 μg/ml) for K 562 cells. The activity of the essential oil of C. ambrosioides is probably related to {{the large amount of}} ascaridol, since the other major compound, p-cymene, is recognized as a potent anti-inflammatory and has low cytotoxic activity...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect fungitoxic of plant extracts on the mycelial growth and on the spores germination of C. gloeosporioides. The plant extracts were obtained starting from dried ground plants, using water and ethilic alcohol as extractor. Twenty-two plant species were used to obtain the extracts. The extracts were tested {{by means of the}} incorporation of 20 % (v/v) in PDA medium, before or after sterilization. The percentage of inhibition of the mycelial growth (PIM) was determined.

40|$|For this paper, solid-liquid extractions of epazote (<b>Chenopodium</b> <b>ambrosioides</b> <b>L.)</b> {{were carried}} out using water (IE) and ethanol (EtOHE) as solvents, with the {{objective}} of evaluating its antioxidant effect on raw ground beef stored at 4 °C for 9 days. The analysis was carried out under the following treatments: CTL (meat without antioxidants), CIE (meat with infusion of epazote), CEtOHE (meat with ethanolic extract of epazote) and ASC (meat with sodium ascorbate solution). The characteristics determined for both IE and EtOHE before being added to the meat were pH, antioxidant activity (AA), total polyphenols (TP) and total flavonoids (TF). The antioxidant effect on the ground beef was evaluated using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method and instrumental color. EI showed the highest TF content. Meat with IE and EtOHE treatments had lower TBARS values than control meat, and higher of L* and b* values, which indicate greater clarity in both treatments.
