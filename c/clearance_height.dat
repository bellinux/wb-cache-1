25|$|The {{architect}} of the Burrard Street Bridge was George Lister Thornton Sharp, the engineer John R. Grant. The bridge's two close approach spans are Warren trusses placed below deck level, while its central span is a Pratt truss placed above deck level to allow greater <b>clearance</b> <b>height</b> for ships passing underneath. The central truss is hidden when crossing the bridge in either direction by vertical extensions of the bridge's masonry piers into imposing concrete towers, connected by overhead galleries, which are embellished with architectural and sculptural details that create a torch-like entrance of pylons. Busts of Captain George Vancouver and Sir Harry Burrard-Neale in ship prows jut from the bridge’s superstructure (a V under Vancouver’s bust, a B under Burrard’s).|$|E
25|$|Both CR and WR competed {{to acquire}} the rake, with WR even announcing a time table for {{operating}} the air-conditioned rake. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the rake would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 metres the rake exceeds the maximum <b>clearance</b> <b>height</b> of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the rake cannot clear the some low height British-era bridges between CST and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the rake on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the rake, CR conducted tests, safety and mobility checks, and trial runs {{under the supervision of}} the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the rake in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the rake due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the rake to WR. The rake was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that rake would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could rectified.|$|E
25|$|In general, two {{different}} light sources {{are needed in}} an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the ambient lighting for interventional procedures. Particular attention should {{be paid to the}} possibility to dim the lights. This is frequently needed during fluoroscopy or endoscopy. For the surgical lights it is most important that they cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the OR table. If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the OR table. Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the angiography system determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head <b>clearance</b> <b>height</b> for the OR-light may be an issue. This makes lights a critical item in the planning and design process. Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required. Sometimes even a third light may be required, in cases where more than one surgical activity takes place at the same time, e.g. vein stripping of the legs.|$|E

30|$|High (HSS) {{and very}} high {{strength}} (VHSS) steels have gained considerable attention in recent years. Increased construction demands impose {{the need of}} improved material properties. HSS contributes to reduced cross-sectional area, resulting in lighter structures (or greater strength to weight ratio), greater <b>clearance</b> <b>heights</b> and easier fabrication and inspection. These reasons explain why HSS has been preferred {{to a great extent}} in bridge engineering and high rise buildings. Additionally, the use of VHSS has been recently introduced in civil engineering applications, while it has already been widely used in the automotive industry, due to its high tensile strength and energy absorption (Azhari et al., 2015).|$|R

A theoretical model, based on the continuity equation and properly combined with a simplified analytical treatment of leakage flows, is first presented and used to characterise the stationary behaviour of a 9 piston pump for different operating conditions and different configurations. In this study attention is focused on pump volumetric efficiency dependency on overall operational conditions as supply pressure, pump speed, leakage <b>clearance</b> <b>heights,</b> swash plate angle and port plate timing. Successively, a numerical vs. experimental comparison of steady-state pump characteristics is presented; this last part of the paper has been developed with the aim of showing the validity limits of the assumptions made to build up the numerical model. Results confirm the applicability of the simplified hypotheses introduced and validates the analysis of volumetric efficiency previously performed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{factors affecting}} aminoglycoside clearance in adult patients with cystic fibrosis who received multiple courses of antibiotic therapy {{over a period}} of up to 15 years. Methods: Aminoglycoside concentration-time data and relevant clinical characteristics were collated from clinical pharmacokinetic databases established in Glasgow, Scotland and The Hague, The Netherlands. Data from Glasgow (1993 - 2009) were used for population model development; data from The Hague (2002 - 11) were used for model validation. NONMEM was used to determine structural and covariate models, with a particular focus on between-occasion variability and changes in aminoglycoside handling over multiple courses of therapy. Results: The Glasgow dataset comprised 1075 courses of aminoglycoside therapy (96 % tobramycin and 4 % gentamicin) in 166 patients and included 2238 concentration measurements. The data were best described by a two-compartment model with creatinine <b>clearance</b> and <b>height</b> influencing aminoglycoside <b>clearance,</b> and <b>height</b> influencing volume of distribution. Between-subject and between-occasion variabilities in clearance were low, at 18 % and 11 %, respectively; between-subject variability was 12 % for volume of distribution. Internal and external model validations were satisfactory. Multiple courses of therapy (ranging from 2 to 28 courses per patient) were not associated with any systematic changes in aminoglycoside <b>clearance.</b> Conclusions: <b>Height</b> was a better descriptor of aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics than weight in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. No changes in clearance were observed over time, even in patients who had received multiple courses of therapy over several years © The Author 2013...|$|R
