5|$|The Vikings have {{selected}} number one overall twice. The Vikings received {{the first pick}} in 1961 as an expansion franchise and then again in 1968 when the franchise chose Ron Yary, an offensive tackle from the University of Southern California. The Vikings have used first-round selections on players from the University of Southern California five times, Michigan State University four times, and from the University of Notre Dame, Oklahoma State University, Ohio State University and Florida State University three times. The Vikings have drafted 10 running backs, the most <b>common</b> <b>position</b> drafted by the franchise, followed by defensive end (9), defensive tackle (8), offensive tackle (7) and linebacker (7). Five eventual Hall of Famers have been selected by the Vikings in the first-round: Carl Eller, Alan Page, Chris Doleman, Randall McDaniel and Ron Yary.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a <b>common</b> <b>position</b> significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E

25|$|Car parks {{which serve}} {{shopping}} centres {{can be built}} adjacent to the centre for easier access at each floor between shops and parking. One example is Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, USA, which has two large car parks attached to the building, at the eastern and western ends. A <b>common</b> <b>position</b> for car parks within shopping centres in the UK is on the roof, around the various utility systems, enabling customers to take lifts straight down into the centre. Examples of such are The Oracle in Reading and Festival Place in Basingstoke.|$|E
25|$|The first {{delegation}} to be upgraded {{was the one}} in Washington D.C., the new joint ambassador was Joao Vale de Almeida who outlined his new powers as speaking for both the Commission and Council presidents, and member states. He would be in charge {{where there was a}} <b>common</b> <b>position</b> but otherwise, on bilateral matters, he would not take over from national ambassadors. All delegations are expected to be converted by the end of 2010. Some states may choose to operate through the new EU delegations and close down some of their smaller national embassies, however France has indicated that it will maintain its own network around the world for now.|$|E
25|$|During the Cold War, anti-Americanism was the {{official}} government policy in East Germany, and dissenters were punished. In West Germany, anti-Americanism was the <b>common</b> <b>position</b> on the left, {{but the majority}} praised America as a protector against communism and a critical ally in rebuilding the nation. After reunification in 1990, the Communist Party in the East struggled on under a new name, 'Die Linke", and maintained its old anti-American position. Today it warns that America is plotting to spoil Germany's friendly relationship with Russia. Germany's refusal to support the American war on Iraq in 2003 was often seen {{as a manifestation of}} anti-Americanism. Anti-Americanism had been muted on the right since 1945, but reemerged in the 21st century especially in the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that began in opposition to European Union, and now has become both anti-American and anti-immigrant. Annoyance or distrust of the Americans was heightened in 2013 by revelations of American spying on top German officials, including Chancellor Merkel.|$|E

25|$|At least sixteen pretenders during Catherine's reign {{claimed that}} they were the deposed tsar, Peter III. A less <b>common</b> <b>position</b> pretenders claimed during Catherine's reign was that of Ivan VI. Ivan VI was a {{potential}} threat to Catherine since he was exiled as an infant and could lay claim to the throne. Peter III was the more popular option for pretenders since there existed legends that he was not actually dead, allowing pretenders to convince discontented Russians they were Peter III. Peter III was also popular among Russians because of his benevolent rule. Pretenders claiming to be Peter III used his popularity among Russians to gain support. Pretenders had to be careful to establish themselves as the ruler they claimed to be without being recognised as a normal mortal and not of royal blood. One popular way to prevent recognition was to claim their right to royalty far from their home as both Emal'Ian Ivanovich Pugachev and the pretender Artem'ev did. Pretenders also had to account for where they had disappeared to for the time since their reported deaths. For example, Pugachev claimed that he spent the eleven years since Peter III's reported death wandering abroad as far as Egypt or Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|The {{ordinary}} {{legislative procedure}} is used in nearly all policy areas and provides an equal footing between the two bodies. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a [...] "common position". That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve those, then a [...] "Conciliation Committee" [...] is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus {{an equal number of}} MEPs who seek to agree a <b>common</b> <b>position.</b> Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament again by an absolute majority. There are other special procedures used in sensitive areas which reduce the power of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|The legal {{instruments}} {{used by the}} Council for the Common Foreign and Security Policy {{are different from the}} legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of [...] "common positions", [...] "joint actions", and [...] "common strategies". Common positions relate to defining a European foreign policy towards a particular third-country such as the promotion of human rights and democracy in Myanmar, a region such as the stabilisation efforts in the African Great Lakes, or a certain issue such as support for the International Criminal Court. A <b>common</b> <b>position,</b> once agreed, is binding on all EU states who must follow and defend the policy, which is regularly revised. A joint action refers to a co-ordinated action of the states to deploy resources to achieve an objective, for example for mine clearing or to combat the spread of small arms. Common strategies defined an objective and commits the EUs resources to that task for four years.|$|E

500|$|By this time, Vespasian's {{position}} in Rome was secure. The details of Alexander's career {{under the new}} emperor remain unclear. A damaged papyrus refers to Alexander as holding the position of [...] "Praetorian Prefect", which is open to two interpretations. It could indicate his rank during Titus' campaign in 70, which would mean that he held his own independent imperium (commanding authority). According to another view, it means that he became Prefect of the Praetorian Guard at Rome, which in later years became a <b>common</b> <b>position</b> for former Prefects of Egypt. In either case, Alexander attained a {{position in}} the Roman Empire that was unparalleled for a man of Jewish birth, not to mention one who suffered from the further stigma of an Egyptian origin. The xenophobic speaker of Juvenal's first Satire, composed in the late 1st or early in the 2nd century AD, complains of passing the Forum's triumphal statues, [...] "where some Egyptian Arabarch's had the nerve to set up his titles. At his image it's right to do more than piss!" [...] This is very likely a reference to Alexander.|$|E
500|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22. The people {{discussed}} if Cisneros should stay in power and, in the case he was removed from office, which type of government should be established. Saavedra stayed silent for the most part, awaiting his turn to speak. The most important speakers were Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, Juan José Castelli, Ruiz Huidobro, Manuel Genaro Villota, Juan José Paso and Juan Nepomuceno de Sola, among others. Saavedra {{was the last one}} to speak, and suggested that the political control should be delegated to the Cabildo until the formation of a governing Junta, in the manner and form that the Cabildo deemed appropriate. In his speech, he pointed out the phrase: [...] "(...) [...] "And there be no doubt that it is the people that confers the authority or command." [...] This statement was in line with the Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people, a political concept formulated by Castelli, stating that {{in the absence of the}} rightful governor the sovereignty returned to the peoples, who had then the power to give it to someone else. Castelli aligned his position with Saavedra's, becoming the <b>common</b> <b>position</b> which was eventually passed with 87 votes.|$|E

2500|$|Statistics on atheism {{are often}} {{difficult}} to represent accurately {{for a variety of}} reasons. Atheism is a position compatible with other forms of identity including religions. Anthropologist Jack David Eller, states that [...] "atheism is quite a <b>common</b> <b>position,</b> even within religion" [...] and that [...] "surprisingly, atheism is not the opposite or lack, let alone the enemy, of religion but is {{the most common form of}} religion." [...] Furthermore, he observes that [...] "some atheists call themselves [...] "spiritual", and as we have shown above, atheism in its broadest sense does not preclude other religious concepts like nature spirits, dead ancestors, and supernatural forces." [...] In many cultures, little conceptual or practical distinction is made between “natural” and “supernatural” phenomena and the very notions of [...] "religious" [...] and [...] "nonreligious" [...] dissolve into unimportance, especially since people have beliefs in other supernatural or spiritual things irrespective of belief in gods. For instance, in Netherlands people who lack of beliefs in gods do have a variety of beliefs in other supernatural entities or things.|$|E
