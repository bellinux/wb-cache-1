A 4 -DOF, roll-plane model of the road vehicle employing a double wishbone type suspension comprising a strut with linear spring and asymmetric damper is formulated for the analyses.

The influences of damper asymmetry are also investigated under rounded-step lateral excitations. The results of the study suggested that the responses are complex functions of damper asymmetry ratio, defined as the ratio of damping coefficient in rebound to that in compression, vehicle forward speed and type of input.

40|$|Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS), using a laser-imploded target as a source, {{can yield}} the {{properties}} of laser-shocked metals on a nanosecond time scale. EXAFS measurements of vanadium shocked to {approx} 0. 4 Mbar yield the compression and temperature in good agreement with hydrodynamic simulations and shock-speed measurements.

This is shown to be due to the {alpha}-Ti to {omega}-Ti crystal-phase transformation, known to occur below {approx} 0. 1 Mbar for slower shock waves. The dynamics of material response to shock loading has been extensively studied in the past [1]. The goal of those studies has been to understand the shock-induced deformation and structural changes at the microscopic level [2].

The goal of this work is to examine the use of in-situ EXAFS [5] as a complementary characterization of laser-shocked metals.

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{sponsored}} by QinetiQ Limited (QinetiQ); whose aim it is to model the dynamics of a prototype high-speed military tracked vehicle. Specifically their objective is to describe the mechanism by which force inputs are transmitted from the ground to the vehicle’s hull. Many track running gear components are steel and can be modelled as simple lumped masses or as linear springs without internal damping. These present no difficulty to the modeller. However tracked vehicle running gear also has nonlinear components that require more detailed descriptions. Models for two rubber components, the road wheel tyre and track link bush, and {{a model for the}} suspensions rotary damper, are developed here. These three components all have highly nonlinear dynamic responses. Rubber component nonlinearities are caused by the materials nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic characteristics. Stiffness is amplitude dependent and the material exhibits a significant amount of internal damping, which is predominantly Coulombic in nature but also relaxes overtime. In this work, a novel method for measuring the elastic and viscoelastic response of Carbon Black Filled Natural Rubber components has been devised and a ‘general purpose’ mathematical model developed that describes the materials response and is suited to use in multibody dynamic analysis software. The vehicle’s suspension rotary damper model describes three viscous flow regimes (laminar, turbulent and pressure relief), as a continuous curved response that relates angular velocity to damping torque. Hysteresis due to the compression of entrapped gas, compliance of the dampers structure and <b>compression</b> of <b>damper</b> oil is described by a single non-parametric equation. Friction is considered negligible and is omitted from the model. All components are modelled using MSC. ADAMS TM multibody dynamic analysis software.

40|$|Attenuation {{structure}} in the Central American subduction zone was imaged using local events recorded by the Tomography Under Costa Rica and Nicaragua array, a 20 -month-long deployment (July 2004 until March 2006) of 48 seismometers that spanned the fore-arc, arc, and back-arc regions of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. P and S waveforms were inverted separately for the corner frequency and moment of each event and for the path-averaged attenuation operator (t*) of each event-station pair, assuming attenuation is slightly frequency-dependent (= 0. 27). Then, tomographic inversions were performed for S and P attenuation (Q S ? 1 and Q P ? 1). Since P wave amplitudes reflect both shear and the bulk moduli, tomographic inversions were also performed to determine shear and bulk attenuation (Q S ? 1 and Q ? 1), the loss of energy per cycle owing to shearing and uniform <b>compression,</b> respectively. <b>Damping</b> and other inversion tomographic parameters were systematically varied. As is typical in subduction zone attenuation studies, a less attenuating slab, upper plate, and wedge corner and a more attenuating mantle wedge were imaged. In addition, first-order differences between the mantles beneath Nicaragua and Costa Rica were observed. The slab in Nicaragua is more attenuating than the slab in Costa Rica. A larger zone of higher shear attenuation also characterizes the Nicaraguan mantle wedge. Within the wedge, maximum attenuation values at 1 Hz correspond to Qs = 38 – 73 beneath Nicaragua and Qs = 62 – 84 beneath Costa Rica, and average values are Qs = 76 – 78 and Qs = 84 – 88, respectively. Attenuation variations correlate with along-arc trends in geochemical indicators that suggest that melting beneath Nicaragua occurs at more hydrated conditions, and possibly to greater extents and depths, relative to northern Costa Rica. Shear attenuation dominates over bulk attenuation in the well-resolved regions of the wedge. The more extensive zones of greater shear attenuation observed in the Nicaraguan wedge {{could be explained by}} higher temperatures and/or greater hydration, but comparison with petrological data suggests that hydration variations play a larger role. Average wedge attenuation values are comparable to estimates for the Andes and Japan, greater than those for Alaska, and less than those for Tonga-Lau. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{down-hole}} surveys {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the small strain dynamic properties of soils by the effects these properties have on wave propagation. The relevant effects include amplitude decay (corrected for beam divergence) and velocity dispersion. In this paper, down-hole data collected during the GeoInstitute 2 ̆ 7 s Denver 2000 field day are presented and analyzed as a Kelvin-Voigt solid. Findings for these unsaturated soils include viscous damping and stiffness which differ significantly for shear and compressional waves. A strong viscous damping is observed in <b>compression,</b> but weak <b>damping</b> is presented in shear. Lumped parameter constitutive models are discussed which mathematically represent the soil dynamics. It appears that, in the case of unsaturated soils, the relatively low level of viscous damping in shear may be explained by the low mass of the air in the pores. That is, it is difficult for inertial decoupling to occur between the soil frame and the pore fluid when the pore fluid (air) is of such low density. Thus, a pore fluid in coupled motion with the frame can not produce significant viscous drag. On the other hand, large viscous damping is observed for compressional waves. This larger damping {{may be due to the}} larger relative motions between air and frame which can be forced by compression of the frame matrix. These observations may be relevant in areas such as the design of driven piles and the estimation of potential for damages from vibrations due to construction...|$|R

40|$|For the {{compression}} of a cylindrical plasma by fast rising axial magnetic fields, the initial state of this plasma is {{of critical importance}} (1). Therefore experiments with a preheating discharge {{for the production of}} an initial plasma with known and reproducible properties were started at this laboratory simultaneously with the first experiments on {{the compression}} of a weakly preionized deuterium gas. An electrodeless ring discharge was chosen. The absence of electrodes makes a high degree of purity of the plasma possible. Kolb's experience with a preheating discharge for magnetic com-pression experiments (2) confirmed this conception and gave further impulse to this work. Early experiments were made with a RF-transmitter as current generator, in pulsed as weIl as in stationary operation. Dueto the low inductance of the compression coil considerable difficulties are met in coupling the RF power to the discharge. The maximum available power is limited to some hundred kilowatts. By discharging a low inductance condenser on the <b>compression</b> coil a <b>damped</b> RF pulse with apower of 100 M Watt is easily obtained. To avoid prefiring of the main condenser bank, the voltage of the coil must be lirnited. With the spark gaps used at this laboratory the maximum permissible voltage at the coil was about 5 kV. This voltage, however, is sufficient to start an electrodeless ring discharge in hydrogen. Investigations on this electrodeless ring discharge were made with and without a steady magnetic bias field in a wide pressure range.

40|$|AbstractThe {{demands on}} {{mountain}} bike (MTB) components {{continue to grow}} as the sport matures. Components are driven toward increased functionality, reliability, and weight savings. In the arena of mountain bike rear shocks, air shocks lead the way in both weight savings and user adjustment over their coil spring counterparts. Not only do air shocks allow multiple controls over both <b>compression</b> and rebound <b>damping</b> but they also allow easy control for rider sag, adjusting for varied sized riders and rider suspension travel preferences. They do so with significant weight saving over coil spring competitors. A downside to air shocks over coil are the thermal issues surrounding housing an air spring concentric with the shock damping mechanism {{as well as the}} seal-friction issues associated with containing the air. The continual compressing of the air and the air seal friction are thermal dynamics that coil shocks do not experience. Also, the insulation of the damper mechanism by the air spring constrains more heat in the air shock. The net result of these thermal complexities is that air shocks typically get much hotter than coil shocks and as such cannot easily be used in continual high load riding scenarios such as downhill racing and long distance downhill riding. This paper examines some of these issues by developing a mountain bike rear air shock model incorporating air spring and frictional thermal effects. Heat is generated by compression and friction, stored in material and air thermal capacitances, and transferred between system elements and eventually to atmosphere. Damper energy generation effects are ignored in this paper and saved for a future study. The effects of shock design on thermal time constants and maximum temperatures are evaluated. Certain model predictions are compared to laboratory data...|$|R
