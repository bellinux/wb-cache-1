40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the basic freezing point of buffalo milk. Bulk milk samples were collected from buffalo and cattle farms in Caserta area from 2008 to 2014. The analysis involved a total of 1886 buffalo milk samples and 1711 bovine milk samples. These were also tested for fat, protein and lactose contents by means of infrared spectrometry. The freezing point was determined by means of a thermistor <b>cryoscope.</b> Data underwent statistical analysis. Our research showed an average freezing point of - 0. 528 °C for buffalo milk and - 0. 522 °C for bovine milk. Given the lack of data on the freezing point of buffalo milk, our study provides the first indication of a basic freezing point of the milk of this species in Italy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{freezing}} point (FP) {{was established in}} 48 bulk tank samples of raw and 48 samples of pasteu-rized goat milk that were collected {{in the course of}} lactation. Alongside, non-fat solids (NFS) content was moni-tored. Milk {{freezing point}} measurements were carried out using the thermistor <b>cryoscope</b> method in compliance with the standard CTS 570538 (1998). The mean freezing point of raw milk was found to be in an interval of – 0. 5513 ± 0. 0046 °C, variation ranged from – 0. 5466 °C to – 0. 5567 °C, with higher values in the spring months and a drop at the end of lactation. FP corresponded to the NFS content. The average freezing point of goat milk heat-treated on the farm to the temperature of 72 °C over a period of 20 s was – 0. 5488 ± 0. 0046 °C, pasteurisation brought an average increase in FP by 0. 0025 °C...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol-free beer is {{increasingly}} marketed with the claim “isotonic”. According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), isotonic beverages {{should have an}} osmolality {{in a range of}} 270 – 330 mOsmol/kg. A method to determine osmolality in beer using an automatic <b>cryoscope</b> was applied and validated in this study. Isotonic and hypotonic beers can be measured directly, while hypertonic beers have to be diluted into the linear range of the instrument. As proven in several different beer matrices, the assay was linear with an average correlation coefficient of 0. 998. The limits of detection and quantitation were 2 and 10 mOsmol/kg, so that the sensitivity of the method was judged sufficient to control the isotonic range. The measurement uncertainty expressed as coefficient of variation was less than 1 % interday. The applicability of the method was proven by measurement of 86 beer samples. Our study has shown that the cryoscopic method is fit for the purpose to validate claims of isotonicity in food control...|$|E
40|$|Samples of {{bulk tank}} milk are {{collected}} regularly and milk quality tests are performed by milk coops, plants, or Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Some milk coops offer bulk tank profiles which involve several tests related to milk quality. The various tests are briefly described below, {{as well as}} a list of goals for high quality milk and conditions which adversely affect test results. Hopefully, an explanation of the use of these tests will help Virginia dairy farmers produce high quality milk, which has been defined by the Extension Milk Quality Leadership Council as milk with: • Somatic cell count equal to or less than 200, 000 • Standard plate count equal to or less than 5, 000 • Preliminary incubation count equal to or less than 10, 000 • Drug residue free • Sediment count equal to or less than 1. 0 • <b>Cryoscope</b> reading equal to or less than-. 530 ° H Standard Plate Count (SPC) determines the number of visible colony-forming units (numbers of individual or tightly associated clumps of bacteria) in 1 ml. of milk incubated at 90 °F for 48 hours. If SPC exceeds 5, 000 cfu/ml., there is usually a reason. SPC is usually less than 5, 000 cfu/ml. if sanitation is good and cooling is adequate. A SPC of 10, 000 should be achievable b...|$|E
40|$|Two {{analytical}} methods {{were used for}} determination of the freezing point on identical test raw milk samples. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate possibility of usage infrared spectrometry method, with MilcoScan FT 6000 milk analyzer for determination of milk freezing point, comparing to results obtained by using a reference thermistor cryoscopy method with <b>Cryoscope</b> 4 C 3 analyzer. During period of four months, total of 320 milk samples were analyzed. Once a week milk samples were sampled at collection reservoirs from twenty milk producers. Milk freezing point was analyzed with each of investigated methods in three consecutive testing respectively repetition. The results of freezing point were recorded as higher by reference in comparison to infrared spectroscopy method. Mean difference from 1. 31 to 5. 28 m°C respectively 3. 43 m°C was determined between results obtained with infrared spectroscopy and reference method. Mean repeatability results for both investigated methods showed slight difference, sr%= 0. 194 for the reference method and sr%= 0. 193 for the infrared spectrometry method. Statistically significant difference between the means of the obtained results with two different investigated methods (P> 0. 05; P> 0, 01) was not determined. The results indicate the conclusion that infrared spectroscopy method can be used for detecting adulteration of milk with water addition as screening method. Based upon the obtained results usage of infrared spectrometry method in determination of raw milk freezing point is recommended because it is faster and can be carried out with current analyzers used for determination of other milk quality parameters, for example analyzer MilkoScan FT 6000...|$|E
40|$|In {{the dairy}} industry, raw milk samples {{collected}} for quality testing {{should be tested}} or refrigerated immediately to control bacterial growth. A thermistor <b>cryoscope</b> is used to accurately determine the freezing point depression (FPD) of raw milk. Milk containing extraneous amounts of water will have a grossly elevated FPD. Milk that has been spoiled or adulterated with other sources, such as sugar, salt, or milk powder, will depress the freezing point, potentially masking the addition of added water. The pH of milk is a general measure of acidity in the sample. Lower pH values indicate an acidification process such as bacterial spoilage. Impedance methods monitor changes in the metabolic processes and will measure lactic acid as a by-product of lactose, for example. The {{purpose of this study}} was to show the effects that storage conditions have on FPD, pH, and impedance of raw milk. In two identical experiments, 20 raw milk samples were stored at 20 - 25 °C, and 20 at 2 - 8 °C, for 168 hours. All samples were tested at numerous intervals throughout this time period. Spoiled and unspoiled milk samples generated similar results using all 3 methods up to 24 hours of storage. Between 24 and 48 hours, the FPD of the spoiled milk was erroneously depressed by an average of 102. 4 m°C, the pH was lowered by an average of 1. 19 units, and the impedance measurement dropped by an average of 19. 1 ohms. The FPD, pH, and impedance data collected generally indicate that raw milk samples with or without refrigeration can be tested up to 24 hours without showing an appreciable shift in response due to bacterial spoilage...|$|E
40|$|A Wescor Vapor Pressure Osmometer {{measured}} the osmolality {{of a solution}} by sensing the vapor pressure above the solution in a closed chamber. The instrument sensing element comprised a precision thermocouple which {{measured the}} dew point temperature depression, {{a function of the}} water vapor pressure in the chamber. It used approximately 5 - 7 microliter samples to saturate a 0. 64 cm filter paper disc. The instrument fixed a milliosmolal digital reading and signaled test completion in 110 seconds. The instrument weighed approximately 3. 62 kilograms, was 26. 7 x 24. 1 x 10. 2 cms in size and had a range of 0 to 1999 milliosmolal. The modular solid state osmometer contained no mechanical moving parts, required no refrigerated components, sample pipetting, sample tube, and no operator attention following sample insertion. Cleaning the sample chamber pocket between tests with an acetone impregnated tissue improved repeatability of the osmometer and reduced the coefficient of variability from O. 76 % to 0. 70 % on a raw milk sample. Two hundred individual cow milk samples from 20 herds were run in February, 1974, to establish a mean freezing point in Cache Valley herds for that period. The mean and standard deviation was 280 ± 3. 0 millisomolal. Results of milk samples containing 0 to 25 % added water measured by the osmometer were compared to those obtained from an Advanced thermistor <b>cryoscope.</b> The coefficient of correlation was 0. 991. A collaborative study was conducted involving eight hospitals and industry laboratories. When the results of two laboratories were discarded, due to instrument maintenance problems, {{there were no significant differences}} among the laboratories in their abilities to quantitate added water. Proper maintenance of the osmometer in order to keep the thermocouple clean and frequent calibration checks are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se comparar metodologias de referência com a espectroscopia de infravermelho com transformada de Fourier para análises do pH e do ponto de congelamento sob diferentes condições de conservação em amostras de leite bovino cru. Foram coletadas amostras de leite de tanques de expansão em 57 propriedades. Cada amostra foi subdividida em 45 frascos (40 mL), que foram distribuídos de acordo com a temperatura de armazenamento (- 20; 7 e 25 ºC), a idade da amostra (0, 3, 6 e 9 dias) e os níveis de adição de água (0, 2, 4 e 6 %). Foi adicionado {{bronopol}} a 44 frascos e um foi mantido sem adição do conservante para controle. O pH e o ponto de congelamento foram determinados pela metodologia de referência (potenciômetro e crioscópio eletrônico, respectivamente) e pela metodologia alternativa por meio do equipamento MilkoScanTM FT+. Os resultados obtidos em cada metodologia nas diferentes condições de conservação das amostras foram avaliados por análise de variância e comparação de médias. A análise de regressão linear foi realizada para avaliar as metodologias (referência e alternativa) quanto aos resultados do ponto de congelamento em função da idade da amostra. O bronopol não alterou as médias de pH, porém reduziu o ponto de congelamento. Foram calculados fatores de correção para eliminar esse efeito nos resultados do ponto de congelamento. As médias de pH em amostras com três dias, mantidas a - 20 e 25 ºC foram mais baixas que as amostras a 7 ºC. A idade da amostra influenciou os resultados de pH quando as amostras foram submetidas a 25 ºC. O aumento da temperatura de armazenamento para 25 ºC reduziu as médias do ponto de congelamento em amostras sem adição de água e com nove dias de armazenagem. O aumento na idade da amostra a - 20 e 7 ºC não tem efeito sobre médias do ponto de congelamento. Há forte correlação entre as metodologias em função da idade da amostra para o ponto de congelamento. The {{objective of}} this work was to compare reference methodologies to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for analysis of pH and freezing point (FP) under different storage conditions on samples of raw bovine milk. Milk samples were collected from bulk tank milk on 57 farms. Each sample was subdivided into 45 vials (40 mL) which were distributed according to storage temperature (- 20 ºC, 7 ºC and 25 ºC), age of the sample (0, 3, 6 and 9 days) and levels of water addition (0, 2, 4 and 6 %). Bronopol was added into 44 flasks and one was maintained without addition of preservative for control. Frozen point and pH were determined by the standard methods (thermistor <b>cryoscope</b> and potentiometer, respectively) and by the alternative methodology by using MilkoScanTM FT+. The results from each method, at different conditions of conservation of the samples, were evaluated by analysis of variance and comparison of means. The linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the methodologies (reference and alternative) for results of the frozen point in function {{of the age of}} the sample. Bronopol did not alter pH means, but it reduced frozen point. Correction factors were calculated to eliminate this effect on the results of the frozen point. Means of pH in three-day samples, kept at - 20 ºC and 25 ºC were lower than the samples at 7 ºC. The age of the samples affected the results of pH when they were submitted to 25 ºC. The increase of storage temperature to 25 ºC reduced means of frozen point in samples without addition of water and at nine days of storage. The increase in age of sample at - 20 ºC and 7 ºC does not affect means of frozen point. There is a strong correlation among methodologies in function of age of the sample for frozen point...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have not}} {{previously}} interrelated {{in detail the}} vegetation and soils in areas of soluble salt accumulation in North America. The reports which have appeared have been limited to general descriptions and distribution of communities and their general relationship to soil characteristics. Two brief accounts of this nature have considered Canadian vegetation. The surface glacial deposits in the northern Great Plains grassland have favored the development of saline areas by providing a source of salts and in restricting the flow of runoff {{water out of the}} area. Evaporation from shallow "kettles" and depressions in glacial lake beds and drainage channels has resulted in the gradual accumulation of soluble material from the till. Approximately 2 percent (over 1, 000, 000 acres) of the settled areas of Saskatchewan is affected by this process. The concentration of salts is sufficient so that a large part of this is not cultivated or utilized in any way. Elsewhere, lower salinity permits cropping, but with poor results. Some areas are periodically affected by movement of the salt within the soil. The relatively level surface and topographic position of these areas provide a situation where irrigation would be practical in the absence of saline conditions. The purposes of the present study were to relate characteristics of the native vegetation within such areas in Saskatchewan to conditions within the soil and to ascertain the course of parallel changes taking place in soil and vegetation during plant succession. This information is of value in planning for proper land use, particularly with respect to the potential value of marginal areas as irrigated cropland. The area of study was within the major agricultural region of Saskatchewan, south of a line drawn from Melfort to the Alberta Boundary through North Battleford and to the Manitoba Boundary near Moosomin. About 270 saline areas were observed and/or sampled during three summers (1957 - 59). This enabled a comparison of saline conditions and native vegetation throughout the entire region. A recent classification of salty soil distinguishes between "saline", "nonsaline-nonalkali", "nonsaline-alkali", and "saline-alkali" (U. S. Salinity Laboratory 1954). Saline soils have an electrical conductivity of the saturation extract in excess of four mmhos. /cm. This {{is similar to that of}} the saline-alkali group, but greater than the nonsaline-nonalkali and nonsaline-alkali. The exchangeable-sodium-percentage of saline and nonsaline-nonalkali soils is less than 15, while it exceeds this value in the nonsaline-alkali and saline-alkali soils. The pH of saline soil, like saline-alkali, is usually 8. 5 or less, while that of nonsaline-alkali soil exceeds 8. 5. Nonsaline- nonalkali soil ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in reaction. Saline soil is similar to saline-alkali in most respects, except that sodium comprises a higher proportion of the soluble cations in the latter, while sodium and the alkaline-earth carbonates are prominent in the former. Many papers have used the term "alkali" in a broader sense than indieated above. Undoubtedly much of this work relates to saline soil, but it is often difficult to distinguish between the types of salty soils because of lack of uniformity in definition in many previous papers. In the present investigation the term "saline" is used in the narrower sense, as defined above. This investigation was conducted while the author was a graduate student in the Department of Plant Ecology at the University of Saskatchewan. It was made possible through the provision of funds by the Saskatchewan Research Council and the Saskatchewan Agricultural Research Foundation. Plants collected during the investigation were placed in the W. P. Fraser Memorial Herbarium (SASK.) at the University of Saskatchewan. Uncertain identifications were checked by the staff of the herbarium of the Canada Department of Agriculture (DAO) at Ottawa. The author expresses his gratitude to members of the Soil surveys of the Saskatchewan and Canada Departments of Agriculture and the Department of Soil Science, particularly Dr. D. A. Rennie, for advice, criticism, and assistance throughout this study, and for the unrestricted use of equipment. Appreciation is also extended to the Department of Dairy Science for the use of their <b>cryoscope.</b> Help, advice, and criticisms from the members of the Department of Plant Ecology is gratefully acknowledged.
