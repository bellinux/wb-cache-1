The aimed SFRSCC was prepared in a <b>concrete</b> <b>mix</b> <b>plant,</b> and standard specimens, ½ scale beam prototypes and a ¼ scale grid prototype were cast. To take into account, in the design context, the fibre distribution and orientation that can occur in grid foundations, core samples were extracted from distinct locations and depths in these beams, and the stress-crack width relationship, σ-w, was experimentally assessed. Based on the obtained σ-w curves, and using a cross-section layer model, the flexural capacity of the grid foundation was evaluated.

It also explores new sources of recycled water in terms of their quality and suitability for use in concrete production. The complete recycling of washout water has been considered for use in <b>concrete</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>plants</b> because of the great benefit in terms of reducing the cost of waste disposal cost and environmental conservation. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of using washout water on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. This was carried out by utilizing a 10 week sampling program from three representative sites across South East Queensland. The sample sites chosen represented a cross-section of plant recycling methods, from most effective to least effective. The washout water samples collected from each site were then analysed in accordance with Standards Association of Australia AS/NZS 5667. 1 : 1998. These tests revealed that, compared with tap water, the washout water was higher in alkalinity, pH, and total dissolved solids content. However, washout water with a total dissolved solids content of less than 6 % could be used in the production of concrete with acceptable strength and durability. These results were then interpreted using chemometric techniques of Principal Component Analysis, SIMCA and the Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods PROMETHEE and GAIA were used to rank the samples from cleanest to unclean. It was found that even the simplest purifying processes provided water suitable for the manufacture of concrete form wash out water. These results were compared to a series of alternative water sources. The water sources included treated effluent, sea water and dam water and were subject to the same testing parameters as the reference set. Analysis of these results also found that despite having higher levels of both organic and inorganic properties, the waters complied with the parameter thresholds given in the American Standard Test Method (ASTM) C 913 - 08.
