25|$|In 1156, Brittany was hit {{by civil}} unrest when Bertha died, ending in Conan IV's accession. Meanwhile, in Nantes, the {{population}} attempted to oust their Count, Hoël, and called on Henry II for help. Geoffrey, Henry's brother, was installed as Count by Henry, but died in 1158. Conan IV then briefly ruled as Count, but Henry took the title that same year by mustering an army in Avranches to threaten <b>Conan.</b> <b>In</b> 1160 Henry's cousin Margaret of Scotland married Conan. Henry then supported Breton independence in 1161 when he secured the Archbishopric of Dol. The jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Tours would have overrun into Brittany if Henry hadn't appealed to Rome. Henry then appointed the archbishop of Dol, Roger du Hommet. Without a tradition of a strong rule in Brittany, discontent grew among the nobles in the years following, culminating in a baronial revolt that Henry II ended in 1166. He betrothed his own 7-year-old son, Geoffrey, to Conan's daughter, Constance, and later forced Conan to abdicate for his future son-in-law, making Henry II the ruler of Brittany, yet not the Duke. Breton nobles strongly opposed this, and more attacks on Brittany occurred in the following years until 1173. Each of these invasions were followed by confiscations, and Henry II installed his men, William Fitzhamo and Rolland of Dinan, in the area. Although it was not formally part of the Plantagenet fiefdom, Brittany was under firm control.|$|E

500|$|The character, Conan, and {{the world}} of Hyboria were based on the creations of pulp-fiction writer Robert E. Howard from the 1930s. [...] Published in Weird Tales, his series about the barbarian was popular with the readership; the barbarian's adventures in a savage and mystical world, replete with gore and brutal slayings, {{satisfied}} the reader's fantasies of being a [...] "powerful giant who lives by no rules but his own". [...] From the 1960s, Conan gained a wider audience as novels about him, written in imitation of Howard's style by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, were published. [...] Frank Frazetta's cover art for these novels cemented Conan's image as a [...] "virile, axe-wielding, fur-bearing, cranium-smashing barbarian". [...] John Milius, the film's director, intended the film's Conan to be [...] "a Northern European mythic hero". Danny Peary described Conan as [...] "muscular, majestic, brainy, yet with ambivalent scruples". [...] Don Herron, a scholar on Howard and his stories, disagreed, noting that the personality of <b>Conan</b> <b>in</b> the film differs greatly from that of the literature. [...] The <b>Conan</b> <b>in</b> the books detests restrictions to his freedom and would have resisted slavery in a violent fashion, whereas the film version accepts his fate and has to be freed. [...] Robert Garcia's review of the film in his American Fantasy magazine states, [...] "this Conan is less powerful, less talkative, and less educated than Howard's".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Star Wars in 1977 {{increased}} Hollywood's interest in producing films that portray [...] "heroic adventures in supernatural lands of fables". [...] The film industry's attention {{was drawn to}} the popularity of Conan among young male Americans, who were buying reprints of the stories with Frazetta's art and adaptations by Marvel Comics. [...] John Milius first expressed interest in directing a film about <b>Conan</b> <b>in</b> 1978 after completing the filming of Big Wednesday, according to Buzz Feitshans, a producer who frequently worked with Milius. (Milius had long been an admirer of films like The Vikings (1958)). Milius and Feitshans approached Pressman, but differences over several issues stopped discussions from going further.|$|E

500|$|Although the game's {{violence}} was praised by the gaming industry, it was condemned by the National Institute on Media and the Family, which placed Conan {{on a list}} of games that parents were urged to avoid buying for their children. [...] Conans Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, largely due to its violent content, made the game a target for a law being pushed in California, United States. [...] Proposed in 2005, the law was intended to regulate sales of Mature-rated games. [...] It was blocked by a legal challenge from the gaming industry in 2007, but California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who played <b>Conan</b> <b>in</b> the 1982 film, appealed the judgment, seeking to ensure that Conan and other games with similar levels of violence would be sold only to those above the age of 17. [...] On February 20, 2009, His appeal was rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who ruled that such a restriction violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Because of poor distribution, Fantastic {{was never}} able to benefit from the {{increasing}} popularity of the fantasy genre, though White was able to publish several stories by well-known writers in the field, including a sword and sorcery novella by Dean R. Koontz, which appeared in the October 1970 issue, and an Elric story by Michael Moorcock in February 1972. [...] A revival of Robert E. Howard's character <b>Conan,</b> <b>in</b> stories by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, was successful at increasing sales; the first of these stories appeared in August 1972, and White reported that sales of that issue were higher than for any other issue of Amazing or Fantastic that year. [...] Each Conan story, according to White, increased sales of that issue by 10,000 copies. [...] White also published several of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, and added [...] "Sword and Sorcery" [...] to the cover in 1975. [...] In the same year a companion magazine, Sword & Sorcery Annual, was launched, but the first issue was the only one to appear.|$|E

500|$|Conan is {{also seen}} {{as a product of}} its time: The themes of the film reflect the {{political}} climate of the United States in the 1980s. [...] Ronald Reagan was the country's president and the ideals of individualism were promoted during his two terms in office. [...] He emphasized the moral worth of the individual in his speeches, encouraging his fellow Americans to make the country successful and to stand up against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. [...] Dr. Dave Saunders, a film writer and lecturer at South Essex College of Further and Higher Education, linked facets of Conan the Barbarian to aspects of Reaganismthe conservative ideology that surrounded the president's policies. [...] Saunders likened Conan's quest against Doom to the Americans' crusades, his choice of weaponryswordsto Reagan's and Milius's fondness of resisting the Soviets with only spirit and simple weapons, and Doom's base of operations to the Kremlin. [...] <b>Conan,</b> <b>in</b> Saunder's interpretation, is portrayed as the American hero who draws strength from his trials and tribulations to slay the evil oppressorsthe Sovietsand crush their un-American ways. [...] Douglas Kellner and his fellow academic Michael Ryan proposed another enemy for the American individual: an overly domineering federal government. [...] The film's association with individualism was not confined to the United States; Jeffrey Richards, a cultural historian, noticed the film's popularity among the youths of the United Kingdom. [...] Robin Wood, a film critic, suggests that in most cases, there is only a thin veneer between individualism and fascism; he also said that Conan is the only film in that era to dispense with the disguise, openly celebrating its fascist ideals in a manner that would delight Riefenstahl.|$|E
