5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} <b>complaint</b> to the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter {{said that the}} nurses feared losing their jobs if their identities were revealed {{in connection with the}} <b>complaint.</b> Arafiles became aware of the <b>complaint</b> and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the <b>complaint</b> amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the <b>complaint</b> to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the <b>complaint</b> to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the <b>complaint.</b>|$|E

40|$|Hardiness {{has been}} {{associated}} with health, but it does not seem like previous studies have investigated the effect of hardiness on the association between job insecurity and health. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether job insecurity and hardiness were associated with subjective health <b>complaints,</b> and if hardiness could moderate any potential associations. 275 (45. 5 %) employees in the oil and gas industry answered an electronic questionnaire that included demographics, job insecurity (quantitative and qualitative), hardiness and subjective health <b>complaints</b> (SHC total, musculoskeletal <b>complaints,</b> pseudoneurological <b>complaints</b> and gastrointestinal <b>complaints).</b> The results showed that quantitative job insecurity, hardiness and the interaction between these variables explained 23. 1 % of the variance in SHC total, 12. 7 % in musculoskeletal <b>complaints,</b> 34. 0 % in pseudoneurological <b>complaints</b> and 7. 1 % in gastrointestinal <b>complaints.</b> Qualitative job insecurity, hardiness and the interaction between these variables explained 25. 4 % of the variance in SHC total, 14. 5 % in musculoskeletal <b>complaints,</b> 35. 7 % in pseudoneurological <b>complaints</b> and 8. 7 % in gastrointestinal <b>complaints.</b> Hardiness moderated the association between quantitative job insecurity and SHC total (β=-. 12, p<. 05) and pseudoneurological <b>complaints</b> (β=-. 16, p<. 01), but not musculoskeletal <b>complaints</b> (β=-. 08, p=. 209) or gastrointestinal <b>complaints</b> (β=-. 05, p=. 455). Furthermore, hardiness moderated the association between qualitative job insecurity and pseudoneurological <b>complaints</b> (β=-. 14, p<. 01), but not SHC total (β=-. 07, p=. 205), musculoskeletal <b>complaints</b> (β=-. 05, p=. 422) or gastrointestinal <b>complaints</b> (β=. 03, p=. 668). The study indicates that the personality characteristic hardiness is an important factor concerning the occurrence of health <b>complaints</b> in employees within the oil and gas industry who experience job insecurity...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} <b>complaints</b> {{concerning}} aspects of care from patients and/or carers have increased over time. Yet, {{in spite of}} a growing body of national and international literature on health care <b>complaints</b> {{there is a lack of}} knowledge around how nurses and midwives manage informal <b>complaints</b> at ward level, or staff needs in relation to this. Aim: Using an Action research (AR) approach with mixed methods, four phases and four cycles, the aim was to explore informal <b>complaints</b> management by nurses and midwives at ward level. We discuss the AR process primarily in connection with learning and service change, drawing from the qualitative data in this paper. Findings: The analysis of the collected qualitative data resulted in three main themes related to the complexities of <b>complaints</b> and <b>complaints</b> management, staff support needs and the existing ambiguous <b>complaints</b> systems which are hard for both staff and servicer users to negotiate. The AR approach facilitated learning and change in participants in relation to views on <b>complaints</b> management, and the main issues around <b>complaints</b> management in the collaborating trust. Conclusions: The extant body of research on <b>complaints</b> does not sufficiently recognise the complexity of <b>complaints</b> and informal <b>complaints</b> management or the <b>complaints</b> systems in place. Needs based staff training can help support staff to manage informal <b>complaints</b> more effectively...|$|R

40|$|<b>Complaints</b> {{have been}} studied from two major {{disciplinary}} perspectives.

In addition, {{a handful of studies}} have examined written <b>complaints,</b> while fewer still have investigated <b>complaints</b> in CMC (computer mediated communication). In order {{to determine the extent to}} which CMC <b>complaints</b> display some of the defining characteristics of <b>complaints</b> as identified by previous research, a data set of 100 <b>complaints</b> (negative reviews of hotels on the website, TripAdvisor) was examined. The study found that a significant proportion of <b>complaints</b> tended to juxtapose overall negative evaluation with some positive appraisal, and that a similar proportion of the <b>complaints</b> made explicit reference to reviewer’s expectations not being met. The study also found that <b>complaints</b> tended to occur as a speech act set. Whereas previous studies have found that <b>complaints</b> tended to co-occur with speech acts such as warnings or threats, in this particular context, <b>complaints</b> tended to co-occur more frequently with advice and recommendations. Finally, the study found that while the majority of the <b>complaints</b> on TripAdvisor can be considered indirect (or third party) <b>complaints,</b> there were nevertheless some examples that blur the direct/indirect dichotomy...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} voice <b>complaints,</b> risk factors for voice <b>complaints</b> and history of voice problems in student teachers before they embarked on their professional teaching career. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was performed among female student teachers. The response rate was 72 % and 457 questionnaires were analyzed. Voice <b>complaints</b> at the moment and/or during the past year were reported by 39. 6 % subjects. Subjects with voice <b>complaints</b> had significantly higher VHI scores than subjects without voice <b>complaints.</b> In comparison to subjects without voice <b>complaints,</b> overall, subjects with voice <b>complaints</b> reported more frequently that vocal loading factors, physical factors, environmental factors and psychological factors had a negative influence on their voice. Subjects with voice <b>complaints</b> reported more frequently a history of voice <b>complaints</b> during puberty and before puberty in comparison to subjects without voice <b>complaints.</b> Voice <b>complaints</b> in student teachers apparently had a multifactorial genesis and with roots during puberty or before puberty. Logistic regression analysis revealed that intensive voice use, emotions and history of voice <b>complaints</b> during puberty were the most discriminating set of risk factors for voice <b>complaints.</b> Subjects with voice <b>complaints</b> in comparison to those without voice <b>complaints</b> reported more frequently that they would develop a voice problem due to future teaching and that future teaching would have a negative influence on their voice. Around three quarters of subjects with and without voice <b>complaints</b> reported that attention paid to their voice during their training was sufficient. However, subjects with voice <b>complaints</b> were observed to report the need for a refresher course on voice use more frequently than those without voice <b>complaints.</b> The findings call for more intensive voice training for student teachers to cope with the vocal, physical and psychological demands of the teaching profession. Authorities should take responsibility to monitor and improve working conditions of student teachers and teachers. Copyright c 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel. status: publishe...|$|R
