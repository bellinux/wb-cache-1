5|$|In July 1916, {{there was}} a major {{reorganization}} of 2nd Line yeomanry units in the United Kingdom. All but 12 regiments were converted to cyclists and as a consequence the regiment was dismounted and joined the 6th <b>Cyclist</b> Brigade (and the division became 2nd <b>Cyclist</b> Division) at Tolleshunt d'Arcy near Tiptree. Further reorganization in November 1916 saw the 2nd <b>Cyclist</b> Division being broken up and the regiment was merged with the 2/1st North Somerset Yeomanry to form 10th (Wiltshire and North Somerset) Yeomanry <b>Cyclist</b> Regiment in 4th <b>Cyclist</b> Brigade at Ipswich. In March 1917 it resumed its identity as 2/1st Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, still in 4th <b>Cyclist</b> Brigade at Ipswich. In July it was at Wivenhoe and later moved to Frinton and Clacton. Early in 1918, the regiment moved to Ireland with 4th <b>Cyclist</b> Brigade and was stationed in Dublin; there was no further change {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>cyclist</b> {{to cross}} the finish line {{received}} 1 point. Other cyclists received one point more than the <b>cyclist</b> who passed the line directly before him, plus an additional point for every five minutes between them, with a maximum of ten points. In this way, a <b>cyclist</b> could not get more than 11 points more than the <b>cyclist</b> that crossed the finish line just before him.|$|E
50|$|Of the 67 <b>cyclists</b> {{that started}} the race, only 11 <b>cyclists</b> finished. On 12 August 1919, Paul Duboc (8th overall), was disqualified for {{borrowing}} a car to go and repair his pedal axle, which left only 10 <b>cyclists</b> in the final classification.In total, 43 <b>cyclists</b> started as category A, and 24 <b>cyclists</b> as category B.|$|R
50|$|There were 126 <b>cyclists</b> {{who started}} the Tour de France; 82 of them were touriste-routiers, <b>cyclists</b> {{who did not have}} the support from a team. The other 44 <b>cyclists</b> started the race in teams; some teams only had two <b>cyclists.</b>|$|R

50|$|A 1999 Decima Research {{study showed}} that 48 percent of Torontonians were <b>cyclists</b> and 60% of {{households}} owned bicycles. During the peak summer months, <b>cyclists</b> in Toronto made {{more than three million}} trips per week, including over 1.6 million recreation trips. Approximately 20 percent of the population (388,000) are utilitarian <b>cyclists,</b> riding to work and school, going shopping, running errands or going visiting. The largest age groups of utilitarian and recreational <b>cyclists</b> were the 18-34 and 35-39 age groups. Gender-wise <b>cyclists</b> split about 60 percent male and 40 percent female. 23 percent of utilitarian <b>cyclists</b> continue to cycle through the winter whereas only 5 percent of recreational <b>cyclists</b> do the same. Bicycle ownership and recreational <b>cyclists</b> levels were fairly level across the city. Utility cycling, however, is much higher in Central Toronto (comprising York, East York and Old Toronto). Utilitarian <b>cyclists</b> are much more concerned about careless drivers, poor road conditions and car doors opening in comparison to non-cyclists and recreational <b>cyclists.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 1965 Tour {{started with}} 130 <b>cyclists,</b> divided into 13 teams of 10 <b>cyclists.</b> Each team had to {{include at least}} six <b>cyclists</b> with the same nationality. The Molteni-Ignis team was a {{combined}} team, with 5 <b>cyclists</b> from [...] and 5 from [...]|$|R
5000|$|A {{new record}} of 150 <b>cyclists</b> started the race. [...] The {{previous}} Tours had been successful, and similar races were initiated {{in other countries}} (most notably the Tour of Belgium, which started in 1908 and the Giro d'Italia, which started in 1909). The Tour de France was still the major race where the best <b>cyclists</b> came, {{and it was the}} first large-scale invasion of foreign stars. In total, 19 Italians, 5 Belgians, 4 Swiss, 1 German and 1 Luxembourgian started the race.Because <b>cyclists</b> could enter the race as sponsored <b>cyclists,</b> there were two classes of cyclists: <b>cyclists</b> with sponsors and <b>cyclists</b> without sponsors. There were seven different sponsors in the race (Nil-Supra, Alcyon, Biguet-Dunlop, Le Globe, Atala, Legnano and Felsina), with three to six <b>cyclists.</b> The majority of the <b>cyclists,</b> 112 in total, were not sponsored but were in the Isolé class, the class for <b>cyclists</b> without a sponsor.|$|R

25|$|Following the {{formation}} of the Australian Corps in 1917, the II ANZAC Corps became the XXII Corps. As a result, in March 1918 the 1st <b>Cyclist</b> Battalion was assigned to the Australian Corps, while the Australian personnel serving in the 2nd <b>Cyclist</b> Battalion were returned to other units of the AIF (mainly artillery and infantry) as reinforcements and the remaining New Zealand personnel were used to form the XXII Corps Cycle Battalion. Although the battalions were not used as fighting units, their personnel were regularly exposed to the dangers of artillery fire and attacks by hostile aircraft. However, <b>cyclist</b> detachments were used in the last stages of the war, as the German Army withdrew to the Hindenburg Line. During the war the 1st <b>Cyclist</b> Battalion lost 13 men killed, while the 2nd <b>Cyclist</b> Battalion lost 59 dead. The Australian Corps <b>Cyclist</b> Battalion was disbanded on 30 April 1919. Approximately 3,000 men served in the Australian Cycling Corps, although many probably did not serve in operational units.|$|E
25|$|The {{time that}} each <b>cyclist</b> {{required}} {{to finish the}} stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the <b>cyclist</b> with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.|$|E

25|$|Physically {{separated}} bikeways best protect <b>cyclists.</b> Less optimally, terminating cycle lanes {{well before}} roundabout entrances require <b>cyclists</b> to merge {{into the stream}} of motor traffic, but keeps <b>cyclists</b> {{in full view of}} drivers, at some cost in motor vehicle speed. <b>Cyclists</b> may also be permitted to use the crosswalks.|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} stage, Ottavio Bottecchia, {{at that moment}} a little-known Italian <b>cyclist,</b> won the sprint. Bottecchia had {{finished}} in {{second place in the}} first stage, and now took over the lead. He was the first Italian <b>cyclist</b> to wear the yellow jersey.|$|E

50|$|As was {{the custom}} since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1951 Tour de France was contested by {{national}} and regional teams. The three major cycling countries in 1951, Italy, Belgium and France, each sent a team of 12 <b>cyclists.</b> Other countries sent teams of 8 cyclists: Switzerland, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain. The French regional <b>cyclists</b> were divided into four teams of 12 cyclists: Paris, Ile de France-North West, East-South East and West-South West. The last team of eight <b>cyclists</b> was made up out of <b>cyclists</b> from the French North African colonies. In the end, Luxembourg only sent 7 <b>cyclists,</b> so altogether this made 123 <b>cyclists.</b> There were 68 French <b>cyclists</b> (of which 1 French-Moroccan and 7 French-Algerian), 12 Italian, 12 Belgian, 8 Dutch, 8 Spanish, 8 Swiss and 7 Luxembourgian <b>cyclists.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The bicycle {{manufacturers}} {{had also}} {{suffered from the}} war, and were unable to sponsor teams of <b>cyclists.</b> They worked together, and sponsored {{more than half of}} the <b>cyclists</b> under the name [...] "La Sportive", but effectively all the <b>cyclists</b> rode as individuals. <b>Cyclists</b> were divided in an A-category (professional) and a B-category (amateurs).|$|R
50|$|Although 110 riders {{were on the}} {{starting}} list, 17 did not show up, so the race started with 93 <b>cyclists.</b> At {{the end of the}} Tour de France, 33 <b>cyclists</b> remained.The <b>cyclists</b> officially were not grouped in teams; some <b>cyclists</b> had the same sponsor, even though they were not allowed to work together.|$|R

To avoid these problems, the categories for individual <b>cyclists</b> were removed for the 1938 Tour de France, and the race was contested by national teams. But because there were many French <b>cyclists</b> that did not fit into the national team, there were two extra French teams, the Bleuets and Cadets.
