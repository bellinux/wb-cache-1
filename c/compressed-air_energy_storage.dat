[...] Furthermore, FirstEnergy is hosting a 1MWe pilot plant test of carbon capture retrofit equipment {{on one of the}} remaining coal units at the R.E. Burger Plant. [...] In September, FirstEnergy decided to complete construction on the Fremont Energy Center, a 707-MW natural-gas-fired peaking plant by the end of 2010. And finally in November, FirstEnergy purchased the rights to develop a compressed-air electric generating plant in Norton, Ohio, which Ohio Governor Ted Strickland praised as [...] "an example of how we can leverage technology and our natural resources to grow our economy and ensure our energy future." [...] The Norton project, part of the company’s overall climate change strategy, {{has the potential to be}} expanded to up to 2,700 MW of capacity—the largest in the world by far. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, [...] "a <b>compressed-air</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> project of this size...could be a key component in integrating large-scale intermittent renewables (such as wind) onto the nation's grid system."

40|$|Rapid {{expansion}} of wind {{power in the}} electricity sector is raising questions about how wind resource variability might affect the capacity value of wind farms at high levels of penetration. Electricity storage, with the capability to shift wind energy from periods of low demand to peak times and to smooth fluctuations in output, may {{have a role in}} bolstering the value of wind power at levels of penetration envisioned by a new Department of Energy report (' 20 % Wind by 2030, Increasing Wind Energy's Contribution to U.

The analysis was done employing the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model, formerly known as the Wind Deployment System (WinDS) model. ReEDS was used to estimate the cost and development path associated with 20 % penetration of wind in the report. ReEDS differs from the WinDS model primarily in that the model has been modified to include the capability to build and use three storage technologies: pumped-hydroelectric storage (PHS), <b>compressed-air</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> (CAES), and batteries.

40|$|This paper investigates a slug-flow {{expander}} (SFE) for {{conversion of}} high-pressure gas/vapor into kinetic energy of liquid slugs. The energy transfer from high-pressure to kinetic energy is quantified using thrust plate measurements. Non-dimensional thrust data {{is used to}} quantify performance by normalizing measured thrust by thrust for the same water flow rate at zero air flow rate. A total of 13 expander configurations are investigated and geometries with the shortest cavity length and the smallest exit diameter are found to result in the largest non-dimensional thrust increase. Results show that thrust augmentation increases with the initiation of slug flow in the SFE. The analysis performed on the normalized thrust readings suggested that as the water and air flow were increased to critical conditions, the liquid slugs produced by the SFE augmented the thrust measurements. The final performance evaluation was based on linear regression of the normalized thrust measurements where slug flow was generated for each SFE architecture. Greater magnitudes of the slope from the linear regression indicated the propensity of the SFE to augment thrust. This analysis confirmed that for the SFE configurations over the range of values investigated, the SFE increased thrust up to three times its original value at no air flow. Given the inherent multiphase nature of the slug-flow expander, application to systems involving expansion of wetting fluids (water {{as part of a}} waste-heat recovery system) or air with water droplet formation (as part of a <b>compressed-air</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> system) could be considered...|$|E

The challenge is addressed through the design of a two-phase renewable energy system that can provide electrical energy during both day and night without the use of chemical batteries. “Phase 1 ” is the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy using photovoltaic panels for both immediate supply to the household load and for storage in a fluid based system. “Phase 2 ” is the conversion of the stored potential energy back into electrical energy for use during the night and at times of peak demand. Methods of energy storage evaluated for this project are pumped-hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) and <b>compressed-air</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> (CAES), both of which are widely used in large-scale systems such as power plants. The “two-phase ” system scales the same idea for practical use at a small scale. Effective methods for converting this stored energy into electrical energy involve the use of a turbine-generator. The system is mathematically modeled in order to determine system parameters to optimize efficiency while meeting constraints on power and total energy output. Based on the results, pumped hydroelectric energy storage was chosen as the method of energy storage, and components were chosen for a prototype. The prototype utilized an electric fluid bench to simulate the system and validate the model. This research may result in an efficient and clean renewable energy system and eliminate the need for a chemical battery in residential photovoltaic systems.

40|$|The current {{energy system}} {{is subject to}} a {{fundamental}} transformation: A system that is oriented towards a constant energy supply by means of fossil fuels is now expected to integrate increasing amounts of renewable energy to achieve overall a more sustainable energy supply. The challenges arising from this paradigm shift are currently most obvious {{in the area of}} electric power supply. However, it affects all areas of the energy system, albeit with different results. Within the energy system, various independent grids fulfill the function of transporting and spatially distributing energy or energy carriers, and the demand-oriented supply ensures that energy demands are met at all times. However, renewable energy sources generally supply their energy independently from any specific energy demand. Their contribution to the overall energy system is expected to increase significantly. Energy storage technologies are one option for temporal matching of energy supply and demand. Energy storage systems have the ability to take up a certain amount of energy, store it in a storage medium for a suitable period of time, and release it in a controlled manner after a certain time delay. Energy storage systems can also be constructed as process chains by combining unit operations, each of which cover different aspects of these functions. Large-scale mechanical storage of electric power is currently almost exclusively achieved by pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations. These systems may be supplemented in the future by <b>compressed-air</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> and possibly air separation plants. In the area of electrochemical storage, various technologies are currently in various stages of research, development, and demonstration of their suitability for large-scale electrical energy storage. Thermal energy storage technologies are based on the storage of sensible heat, exploitation of phase transitions, adsorption/desorption processes, and chemical reactions. The latter offer the possibility of permanent and loss-free storage of heat. The storage of energy in chemical bonds involves compounds that can act as energy carriers or as chemical feedstocks. Thus, they are in direct economic competition with established (fossil fuel) supply routes. The key technology here – now and for the foreseeable future – is the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be transformed by various processes into other energy carriers, which can be exploited in different sectors of the energy system and/or as raw materials for energy-intensive industrial processes. Some functions of energy storage systems can be taken over by industrial processes. Within the overall energy system, chemical energy storage technologies open up opportunities to link and interweave the various energy streams and sectors. Chemical energy storage not only offers means for greater integration of renewable energy outside the electric power sector, it also creates new opportunities for increased flexibility, novel synergies, and additional optimization. Several examples of specific energy utilization are discussed and evaluated with respect to energy storage applications. The article describes various technologies for energy storage and their potential applications in the context of Germany's Energiewende, i. e. the transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Therefore, the existing legal framework defines some of the discussions and findings within the article, specifically the compensation for renewable electricity providers defined by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act, which is under constant reformation.
