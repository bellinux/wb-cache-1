5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 25, and ultimately discontinued {{about three days}} later. Two cruise ships left Bermuda early to avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there. The threat of the storm, <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lack of passengers due to cruise ship diversions, resulted in the suspension of ferry service. Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E
5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view {{is different from that}} of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical low <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frontal system, Bonnie {{continued}} to produce moderate rainfall in Canada, peaking at 3.5inches (90mm) in Edmundston, New Brunswick. The rainfall caused basement flooding and road washouts; slick roads caused a traffic fatality in Edmundston.|$|E

5|$|Cindy's remnant low {{moving across}} western and {{northern}} North Carolina <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frontal boundary to produce several supercell thunderstorms.

Continuing north, Cindy brought over 5in (125mm) of rain to areas as distant as Salisbury, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Modern {{period of}} Swiss history, the growing {{authoritarianism}} of the patriciate families <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> financial {{crisis in the}} wake of the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, {{graduates}} of state-run Shinto schools, such as Kokugakuin University and Kougakkan University, were implicitly allowed to become public school teachers. A {{greater number of}} better-trained priests with educations at state-supported schools, <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rising patriotic fervor, is believed by some to have seeded {{an environment in which}} grassroots Emperor worship was possible, even without financial support for local shrines.|$|E
5|$|In Oklahoma, {{moisture}} from the storm, <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slow-moving cold front, produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 8.98inches (228mm) in Courtney. Due to below normal precipitation {{by as much as}} 5 to 10inches (127 to 255mm), flooding was localized and overall minimal. Near Medford, the rainfall lead to 2feet (0.6m) deep flooding on U.S. Highway 81, forcing its closure. The rainfall was welcome in the state, and lessened the rainfall deficit.|$|E
