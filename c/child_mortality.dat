5|$|There {{are almost}} no written sources {{from which to}} {{reconstruct}} the demography of early medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 in Dál Riata and 80–100,000 for Pictland, which was probably the largest region.

The examination of burial sites for this period, such as that at Hallowhill, St Andrews, indicates a life expectancy of only 26 to 29. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility, high mortality society, similar to developing countries in the modern world, with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children born to each woman (although with high <b>child</b> <b>mortality).</b> This would have meant a relatively low ratio of available workers to the number of mouths to feed, which in turn would have made it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and the development of more complex societies.|$|E

A United Nations envoy concluded in 2011 that Rajoelina's controversial accession to the presidency had reduced food security, with Madagascar ranking among the worst in the world for child nutrition. The frequent non-payment of civil servant and military salaries resulted in regular school and hospital closures, general strikes and widespread increases in corruption. Crime and insecurity grew dramatically, with a sharp upswing in violent crime and theft in Antananarivo and increasingly frequent and deadly incidences of armed cattle rustling in the central southern region of the island. Key development indicators steeply declined between 2009 and 2013, including maternal and <b>child</b> <b>mortality,</b> education enrollment and completion, per capita income and employment rates.

The aim of this study is investigating the role of socioeconomic disparties in under 5 mortality in Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) countries.   Materials and Methods This study is a restropective and panel data type. Data used in this study inquired form the World Health Organization(WHO) and the World Bank database for 20 EMRO countries. In order to investigate socio-economic factors of  under 5 mortality we used per capita income logarithm, health expenditure per capita, out-of-pocket health expenditure, access to improved sanitation and Measles vacination, literacy rate in 15 to 24 years old females, female unemployment rate, and birth rate. Results According to results, all variables (Per Capita National Income, Health Expenditure Per Capita, Access  to Health Facilities, Out-of-Pocket Health Expenditure, and Measles  Immunization, Female Literacy Rate for 15 to 24 year old, Female Unemployment Rate and Crude Birth Rate) showed significant relationship with under 5 mortality except per capita health expenditure. Per capita income logarithm also had the greatest impact in reducing the <b>mortality</b> of <b>children</b> under 5 year in comparison with other variables.
