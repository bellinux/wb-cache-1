50|$|The pied {{kingfisher}} (<b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis)</b> is a water kingfisher and is found widely distributed across Africa and Asia. Originally described by Linnaeus in 1758, it has five recognised subspecies. Its {{black and white}} plumage, crest and the habit of hovering over clear lakes and rivers before diving for fish make it distinctive. Males have a double band across the breast while females have a single gorget that is often broken in the middle. They are usually found in pairs or small family parties. When perched, they often bob their head and flick up their tail.|$|E

40|$|Tanganyika Lake is {{frequented by}} many {{fish-eating}} birds, especially kingfishers. Our {{research has focused}} in particular on <b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis</b> Linné, 1758, pied kingfisher. This study, conducted {{over a period of}} two months, from June 21 to July 19 and from August 19 to September 16, 2002, aims to analyze the fishery of pied kingfisher, considering fishing time during the day, before and afternoon. This bird was fishing from a perch or a hovering position. This regularly observed behavior allows the bird to fish in the pelagic water, which is uncommon in other species of kingfishers. This part distinguishes direct dives carried out from a perch and dives performed after a hovering position. Results show that, on a total of 583 dives, 324 or 55, 5 % were dives from perches while the rest were made from a hovering position. We found that <b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis</b> is very active in fishing until midday and it is less so in the afternoon. The average number of fish eaten per day per bird was 9, 3. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|ItSi segnala il primo avvistamento per l’Italia del martin pescatore bianco nero (<b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis</b> L., Alcedinidae), specie stanziale, con areale di distribuzione che si estende dall’Africa sub sahriana al S/E asiatico. L’esemplare femmina è stato individuato per la prima volta il giorno 5 novembre 2014, presso i bacini idrografici del Parco Naturale Regionale “Litorale di Ugento” (LE), durante l’osservazione dell’avifauna. L’esemplare ha svernato nel vasto biotopo acquatico con regolarità fino al 10 gennaio 2015, successivamente è stato osservato saltuariamente, fino al 12 aprile. La sua presenza nel Salento potrebbe essere dovuta o ad una serie di cambiamenti climatici, oppure molto più probabilmente potrebbe trattarsi di un caso di dispersione dell’esemplare fuori dal suo areale di distribuzione. The author {{presents}} {{the first report}} for Italy of the pied kingfisher (<b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis</b> L., Alcedinidae) on November 5, 2014, in the wet area of the Regional Natural Park “Litorale di Ugento”, Lecce, Apulia, Italy. The species was not reported {{in the list of}} the birds of the Apulian region (Liuzzi et al., 2013) and check list of the italian national avifauna (Fracasso G. et al., 2009). This first sighting was reported among the rarities of Italy in the mailing list of EBN Italy. The female specimen has wintered for over two months. The observation made it possible to study a number of behaviors, roots, selection of time shooting, etc. The diet generally consists of mullet (Mugil cephalus), also of medium size, which are identified from a high perch, or scouring from high the water, remaining steady in flight. From 10 January 2015 the specimen has not been observed in his regular routine site. The specimen was subsequently sighted occasionally until April 12. The pied kingfisher is classified as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List. Its presence in Salento may be due either to climate change, or a case of dispersion of the specimen outside its natural range...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} {{kingfisher}} occur on Lake Nokoué, southern Bénin, including Malachite (Alcedo cristata) and Pied Kingfishers (<b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis).</b> Here, we compare their diet and estimate {{the degree of}} overlap in food niche by analysing contents of regurgitated pellets collected near nesting sites of Pied Kingfishers or inside the nest chambers of Malachite Kingfishers. Characteristic fish skull bones were identified using a reference collection of local fish skeletons. Malachite Kingfishers feed most frequently on fish that occur around floating vegetation, mainly Kribia sp. (56 %), Hemichromis fasciatus (28 %) and Sarotherodon melanotheron (8 %). Important {{differences were found between}} different pairs, and between adults and nestlings, the latter being fed almost exclusively on Kribia sp. Larger fish are fed to nestlings than are eaten by the adults. Pied Kingfishers prey upon 14 different fish species, some of them being caught in the pelagic region of the lake, particularly clupeids taken by hovering. By comparison with Malachite Kingfishers, Pied Kingfishers feed on a wider diversity of prey, and take larger fish, so that the dietary overlap between the species is relatively low (O = 0. 181).

40|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} pied kingfishers (<b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis)</b> {{blood plasma}} levels of LH and testosterone (T) were compared among {{three types of}} males: breeders, primary (= related) helpers and secondary (= unrelated) helpers. These categories {{did not differ in}} LH, but primary helpers had significantly lower T titers than breeders and secondary helpers. The low levels were paralleled by small gonad sizes and no sperm production, ~u~!!;csting that primary helpers were not able to fertilize eggs. The differences in T levels could neither be attributed to stochastic variation nor to differences in age, stress, molt, or reproductive activities. The most likely explanation arises from the observation that primary helpers are behaviorally dominated by breeders, whereas secondary helpers are not. The adaptive significance of low T titers and reduced fertility as a result from being dominated is discussed on the basis of empirical data and theoretical models. We argue that primary helpers in the pied kingfisher, and subordinate helpers in many other cooperative breeders, apparently are not "unwillingly " suppressed in their sexual development; they rather "choose " delayed reproduction when the costs from sexual competition with breeders exceed the benefits from cooperative breeding. In contrast, helpers that benefit more from competition than from cooperation, as secondary helpers do, cannot be expected to show reduced fertility...|$|E

This research study was carried out to find the intestinal helminth parasites of birds in this ecosystem and evaluation of their medically importance with emphasis on heterophyid trematodes. For these reasons, the total of 37 birds including; Himantopus himantopus, Fulica atra, Egretta grazetta, Bubulcus ibis, <b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis,</b> Vanellus indicus, Vanellus vanellus, Charadrius sp.

40|$|The {{avifauna}} of lowland Ethiopia {{consisting of}} grassland and bushland was investigated {{during the dry}} season from November 1981 to February 1982 in Omo National Park. One hundred and thirty-eight species of 48 families were observed in the whole area of the Park. One hundred and seven of these species were observed in the bushland around a small river and 45 species in the grassland and a small swamp. In the bushland area, dominant species were Turtur chalcospilos, Lamprotornis purpuropterus, Pycnonotus barbatus, Streptoperia decipiens, S. capicola, Tockus jacksoni, Corythaixoides leucogaster, Dicrurus adsimilis, and Francolinus sephaena. In the vicinity of the river, Burhinus senegalensis, Butorides striatus, Megaceryle maxima and <b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis</b> were commonly found. In the grassland area, Struthio camelus, Ardeotis kori, some species of Bustards, Oenanthe sp. and Cisticola sp. were commonly found. At the swamp in the grassland, Hoplopterus spinosus and Himantopus himantopus dominated. Comparing the savanna bushland with the grassland, the number of species and the density of birds in the former were three to five times and about thirty times respectively as many as those in the latter. In the savanna bushland, frugivores (19. 5 % of total number of species) accounted for 43. 4 % of total observed individuals and graminivores were next.

40|$|Pied Kingfishers: {{ecological}} {{causes and}} reproductive consequences of cooperative breeding H. -V. REYER* Studies on the adaptive significance of behavioral strategies are most promising {{when there is}} high variability, both in the behavioral trait and the ecological conditions under which it occurs. This allows comparison of {{the costs and benefits}} ofpursuing different strategies under the same conditions and of pursuing the same strategies under different conditions. The Pied Kingfisher (<b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis)</b> shows such variability in its helper system. I have studied this species over eight breeding seasons (1976 [...] - 83) at Lake Naivasha and Lake Victoria in Kenya. The following account of the results consists of four sections: (1) a description of the life history and the helper structure; (2) a functional interpretation of the cooperative breeding from the helpers ' and from the breeders ' points of view; (3) an analysis of the causal mechanisms which allow the birds to choose the strategy which maximizes their fitness under the prevailing ecological conditions; and (4) some speculations as to the origin of this helper system. Life history and helper structure General biology Pied Kingfishers range, in three subspecies, from eastern Asia through Asia Minor to South Africa. They occur along many rivers, but are particularly frequent in the marginal regions of big freshwater lakes. They feed almost exclusively on fish. To catch their prey, they either dive from papyrus stems, dead trees or other perches along the shore, or- more often- fly over the water searching, sometimes hovering above the surface, and plunging swiftly when they see a fish. Although individual birds have preferential perches and hunting areas, there are no defended territories. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns in selected components of the ichthyofauna and piscivorous avifauna in the small temporarily open/closed Riet River Estuary located on the eastern seaboard of southern Africa was investigated monthly over the period August 2005 to July 2006. The ichthyofauna within the littoral zone of the estuary was sampled using a 5 m seine net (8 stations) while a 30 m seine net (4 stations) was employed to sample {{the fish in the}} channel. Bird counts were made along repeat transects {{along the length of the}} estuary. Total ichthyofaunal abundances and biomass ranged between 1. 60 and 8. 67 individuals m⁻² and 0. 45 to 21. 76 g wwt m⁻² within the littoral zone, and between 0. 08 and 0. 44 individuals m⁻² and 0. 58 and 36. 52 g wwt m⁻² in the channel of the estuary. The highest values were generally recorded during the summer months. Results of the numerical analysis indicated that the breaching events recorded over the study period did not lead to a common trend in the ichthyofaunal community. In the absence of a link to the marine environment, the ichthyofaunal community in the littoral zone was numerically dominated by the estuarine resident species, Gilchristella aestuaria and to a lesser extent by Glossogobius callidus, which collectively accounted for ca. 54 % of the total ichthyofauna sampled. The establishment of a link to the marine environment coincided with increased numbers of marine breeding species including Atherina breviceps and Rhabdosargus holubi to total fish counts within the estuary. Hierarchical cluster analysis did not identify any spatial patterns in the community structure of the ichthyofauna in the littoral zone or channel zone of the estuary, which could likely be linked to the absence of any distinct horizontal patterns in salinity and temperature within the system. A total of thirteen piscivorous bird species was recorded over the study period. Of the recorded species, six species were wading piscivores, four species were aerial divers and the remaining three species were pursuit swimmers. There were no significant correlations between the estimates of the ichthyofaunal abundance and biomass and bird numbers evident during the study (P> 0. 05 in both cases). The Reed Cormorant (Phalacrocorax africanus) was the dominant species throughout the study, with a mean of 8. 25 (SD ± 7. 90) individuals per count. Mean values of the Pied Kingfisher (<b>Ceryle</b> <b>rudis)</b> and Giant Kingfisher (Megaceryle maximus) were 3. 42 (SD ± 1. 20) and 1. 17 (SD ± 0. 60) individuals per count, respectively. The remaining species revealed mean values < 0. 5 individuals per count. The highest bird numbers were recorded in winter reflecting the migration of large numbers of the Reed Cormorant into the system. Breaching events were associated with a decrease in total bird numbers, which was most likely due to loss of potential foraging habitat (littoral zone) for waders resulting from reduced water levels. Monthly food consumption by all piscivorous birds revealed large temporal variability, ranging from 26. 35 to 140. 58 kg per month. The observed variability could be linked to mouth phase and bird numbers...|$|E
