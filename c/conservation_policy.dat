Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction.

Little is known and {{has been written about}} environmental <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> in different historical epochs. The stated objectives have been accomplished by analyzing the following themes: firstly the pre-colonial environmental conservation in Morogoro and Shinyanga regions; secondly, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} environmental <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> among the Luguru and Sukuma of Tanzania during the colonial period; thirdly, the impact of environmental <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> on cultural aspect on both regions and lastly, the post-colonial environmental <b>conservation</b> <b>policies.</b> The thesis has mainly centred on environmental conservation strategies and practices. Economic and political changes have been broadly treated as complex processes of transformation and adjustment of environmental <b>conservation</b> strategies and <b>policies.</b> To explain this transformation, the Political Ecology, Ecological Revolution, and Historical Ecology theories have been used. The thesis used qualitative method. Data analysis was guided by the stated research questions. Each question was expanded to form a major chapter. The researcher presented the findings by using primary and secondary information. It was concluded in the thesis that the European capital penetration alone did not automatically simplify the imposition of colonial environmental <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> there were other internal factors that acted upon. It is recommended that there is a need to review and research the narratives and organizational models for promoting more significant local involvement in environmental management...|$|R

Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), economic stability (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries). Agricultural policy can also touch on food quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and <b>conservation.</b> <b>Policy</b> programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.|$|E

An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey {{had set up}} the Club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish Redwoods National Park and North Cascades National Park. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the Club's legislative activity—preserving Alaskan lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, the Clean Air Act amendments, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, passed during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of Walter Mondale's unsuccessful campaign to unseat Ronald Reagan. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the Club's senior strategist, devoting his time to <b>conservation</b> <b>policy</b> rather than budget planning and administration.

The primary source of water for irrigation in this region is the Ogallala Aquifer. The Southern portion of the Ogallala Aquifer is considered exhaustible due to the low level of recharge relative to the quantities of water pumped. Analysis and evaluation of water <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> which could extend the economic life of the Ogallala Aquifer in the Southern High Plains of Texas and Eastern New Mexico, and which could contribute to maintaining the viability of the regional economy is important. This study evaluates the impacts of water <b>conservation</b> <b>policies</b> which limit drawdown of the Ogallala Aquifer. County level dynamic optimization models maximizing net present value of net returns to land, management, groundwater, and irrigation systems over a sixty year planning horizon were formulated to evaluate three aquifer drawdown restrictions.
