5|$|Eighty-nine {{per cent}} of courts martial {{returned}} a guilty verdict, {{the vast majority}} of cases being for offences such as Absence Without Leave (the most common offence), drunkenness and insubordination. Terms of imprisonment were often suspended, to discourage soldiers from <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence</b> to escape the front lines, but also to give a convicted man a chance to earn a reprieve for good conduct.|$|E
5|$|Police {{work and}} {{criminal}} prosecutions {{relied heavily on}} confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators {{in the act of}} <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence</b> or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. Forensic techniques, such as fingerprint analysis, were not in use. Policing in London was—and still is—divided between two forces: the Metropolitan Police with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the City of London Police with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9km2) of the city centre. The Home Secretary, a senior minister of the United Kingdom government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the Corporation of London. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.|$|E

25|$|Situation-specific amnesia {{can arise}} {{in a variety}} of {{circumstances}} (for example, <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence,</b> child sexual abuse) resulting in PTSD. It has been claimed that it involves a narrowing of consciousness with attention focused on central perceptual details and/or that the emotional or traumatic events are processed differently from ordinary memories.|$|E
25|$|Burglary (also called {{breaking}} and entering and sometimes housebreaking) is an unlawful entry into a building or other location {{for the purposes of}} <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence.</b> Usually that offence is theft, but most jurisdictions include others within the ambit of burglary. To engage in the act of burglary is to burgle (in British English) or to burglarize (in American English).|$|E

25|$|As per his destiny, the {{messengers}} of Yama came to {{take away}} Markandeya's soul, but failed to approach him as he ceaselessly repeated Shiva's name. Yama came himself to take Markandeya's soul and told Markandeya to stop his worship and come with him as per his fate. Markandeya refused, warning Yama that he was <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence</b> against Shiva. Yama, however, proclaimed that not even Shiva could stop him. The wrathful Yama assumed a fearsome form and threw his noose to capture Markandeya, who hugged the linga tightly. When the noose touched the linga, Shiva emerged from it and struck Yama with his Trishula and kicked his chest, killing the lord of death.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, many {{companies}} in debt decide {{it is more}} beneficial to start again by creating a new company, {{often referred to as}} a phoenix company. In business terms this will mean liquidating a company as the only option and then resuming under a different name with the same customers, clients and suppliers. In some circumstances it may appear ideal for the directors; however, if they trade under a name which is the same or substantially the same as the company in liquidation without approval from the Court, they will be <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence</b> under S216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (and equivalent legislation in UK regions). Persons participating in the management of the 'phoenix' company may also be held personally liable for the debts of the company under s217 of the Insolvency Act unless the Court approval has been granted.|$|E
25|$|Lady Pan {{was from}} Juzhang County (句章縣; within present-day Ningbo) in Kuaiji Commandery. Her father, {{who served as}} a low-ranking official, was {{executed}} for <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence</b> whose details are not recorded. Both Lady Pan and her elder sister ended up as workers in a textile factory. Once, Sun Quan encountered her and felt that she was extraordinary so he took her as his concubine. In 243, while she was pregnant, she dreamt of receiving a dragon head and gave birth to Sun Liang later. In 250, {{in the aftermath of a}} succession struggle between Sun Quan's sons Sun He and Sun Ba, Sun Liang was designated as the crown prince by his father. In the same year, Lady Pan requested Sun Quan to arrange a marriage for her elder sister and he agreed. In 251, Sun Quan instated Lady Pan as the empress. Empress Pan was known for charming but jealous as she never ceased slandering and harming Sun Quan's other wives until her death.|$|E

25|$|Yellow and red {{cards are}} both used in futsal. The yellow card is to caution players over their actions, and, {{if they get}} two, they are given a red card, which means they are sent off the field. A yellow card is shown if a player shows unsporting behaviour, dissent, {{persistent}} infringement of the Laws of the Game, delaying the restart of play, failing to respect {{the distance of the}} player from the ball when play is being restarted, infringement of substitution procedure or entering, re-entering and leaving the field without the referee's permission. A player is shown the red card and sent off if they engage in serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting at another person, or denying the opposing team a goal by handling the ball (except the goalkeeper inside their penalty area). Also punishable with a red card is denying an opponent moving towards the player's goal a goalscoring opportunity by <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence</b> punishable by a free kick or a penalty kick and using offensive, insulting or abusive language or gestures. A player who has been sent off must leave the vicinity of the field. A substitute player is permitted to come on two minutes after a teammate has been sent off, unless a goal is scored {{before the end of the}} two minutes. If a team with more players scores against a team with fewer players, another player can be added to the team with an inferior number of players. If the teams are equal when the goal is scored or if the team with fewer players scores, both teams remain with the same number of players.|$|E
500|$|During the 2000 Canadian federal election, Hudema {{was part}} of a group calling itself the Edible Ballot Society, the members of which ate their ballots (Hudema stir-fried his) as a protest against what they saw as a lack of true {{democracy}} and a system that only asked for individuals' participation once every four years. [...] He was charged, along {{with other members of the}} EBS, with [...] "unlawfully and willfully altering, defacing or destroying a ballot or the initials of the Deputy Returning Officer signed on a ballot contrary to section 167(2)(a) of the Canada Elections Act thereby <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence</b> under subsection 489(3)(e)". The charges were eventually dropped.|$|E
500|$|The Court {{held that}} the report made by the prison medical officer was {{obviously}} a decision but that alone did not make him a [...] "decision-maker" [...] in the sense explained by Lord Diplock. This was because the officer's report that the appellant was fit for caning did not have legal effect– the District Court judge was duty bound to impose the sentence of caning irrespective of what the officer might have said in his report. Hence, {{it was not a}} case for judicial review at all. The Court also said that another example of non-decision-making conduct was a police officer arresting a person suspected of <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the courts in reviewing the decisions of such domestic tribunals is of a limited nature. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held in Dawkins v. Antrobus (1881) that before a member is expelled from a club for <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence</b> against the club's constitution, the member has to be given proper notice of the meeting, an opportunity to attend the meeting, {{and an opportunity to}} be heard. Moreover, the charges made against him and the proceedings must be conducted bona fide, fairly, and in the honest exercise of the powers given to the meeting by the club. However, these conditions having been fulfilled, [...] "the court has no right to consider whether or not what was done by the meeting was right or whether or not what was decided was reasonable". The court will not resolve factual issues as these are within the scope of the tribunal's inquiry.|$|E

Jiang Yi had no son so his military post was inherited by his younger brother, Jiang Xiu (蔣休). Jiang Xiu was later discharged from service for <b>committing</b> <b>an</b> <b>offence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Section 54 {{also creates}} a new {{criminal}} offence of [...] "providing false or misleading information in connection with an application for probate".
