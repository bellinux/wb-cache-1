50|$|Although no <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> is of high {{abundance}} in the Earth's crust, chalcophile elements constitute {{the bulk of}} commercially important metals. This is because, whereas lithophile elements require energy-intensive electrolysis for extraction, chalcophiles can be easily extracted by reduction with coke, and chalcophiles' geochemical concentration - which in extreme cases can exceed 100,000 times average crustal abundance. These greatest enrichments occur in high plateaux like the Tibetan Plateau and the Bolivian altiplano where large quantities of chalcophile elements have been uplifted through plate collisions. A side-effect of this in modern times is that the rarest chalcophiles (like mercury) are so completely exploited that their value as minerals has almost completely disappeared.|$|E

Finally, the effects of volatile depletion, core formation, and mineral/melt fractionation on the abundances of siderophile and <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements</b> in the SPB and the earth have been taken into consideration.

40|$|Two basic types {{exogenous}} {{models were}} proposed {{to account for}} siderophile and <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> abundances in the Earth's upper mantle. The first model requires that the Earth be depleted in volatiles and that, after a core formation event which extracted the most siderophile elements into the core, additional noble siderophile elements (Pt, Ir, Au) were added as a late veneer and mixed into the mantle. The second model postulates a reduced Earth with approximately CI elemental abundances in which a primary core forming event depleted all siderophile elements in the mantle. The plausibility of models which require fine scale mixing of chondritic material into the upper mantle is analyzed. Mixing in liquids is more efficient, but large degrees of silicate partial melting will facilitate the separation of magma from residual solids. Any external events affecting the upper mantle of the Earth should also be evident in the Moon; but siderophile and <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> abundance patterns inferred for the mantles of the Earth and Moon differ.

40|$|The Aguablanca Ni-Cu-(PGE) magmatic {{sulphide}} deposit {{is associated}} with a magmatic breccia located {{in the northern part of}} the Aguablanca gabbro (SW, Iberia). Three types of ores are present: semi-massive, disseminated, and chalcopyrite-rich veined ore. The principal ore minerals are pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite. A relatively abundant platinum-group mineral (PGM) assemblage is present and includes merenskyite, melonite, michenerite, moncheite and sperrylite. Moreover, concentrations of base and precious metals and micro-PIXE analyses were obtained for the three ore-types. The mineralogy and the mantlenormalised <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> profiles strongly suggest that semi-massive ore represents mss crystallisation, whereas the disseminated ore represents an unfractionated sulphide liquid and the chalcopyrite-rich veined ore a Cu-rich sulphide liquid. Palladium-bearing minerals occur commonly enclosed within sulphides, indicating a magmatic origin rather than hydrothermal. The occurrences and the composition of these minerals suggest that Pd was initially dissolved in the sulphides and subsequently exsolved at low temperatures to form bismutotellurides. Negative Pt and Au anomalies in the mantle-normalised <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> profiles, a lack of Cu-S correlation and textural observations (such as sperrylite losing its euhedral shape when in contact with altered minerals) suggest partial remobilisation of Pt, Au and Cu by postmagmatic hydrothermal fluids after the sulphide crystallisation...|$|E

40|$|The <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements,</b> as {{associated}} with sulfides, are believed {{mainly from the}} study of ophiolites to be generally enriched in the upper mantle, but depleted by magmatic processes in the lower and upper ocean crust. However, studies of some orogenic lherzolites suggest a copper depletion of peridotites in relation to the primitive mantle, suggesting that a portion of the sulfides is melted during decompression and incorporated into the ascending magmas. The rarity of abyssal peridotites and the high degree of their alteration have not allowed these results to be verified in situ in the oceans. Here, we present the first complete study of <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements</b> based on a suite of rocks from an oceanic core complex (OCC), the Kane Megamullion at 22 ° 30 ’N at the MidAtlantic Ridge.

We have made XRF, TDMS and INAA analyses of 129 representative peridotites, gabbroic rocks, diabases and basalts. Our results suggest a depletion of some peridotites in relation to the primitive mantle (28 ppm Cu).

The highest bulk abundance of <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements</b> in our sample suite was observed in dunites (up to ~ 300 ppm Cu in several samples) and a contact zone between residual peridotite and a mafic vein (294 ppm Cu). Plagioclasebearing harzburgites, generally formed by latestage melt impregnation in the mantle, are typically more enriched in Cu than unimpregnated residual peridotites.

Of particular interest is a comparison of {{processes of}} core formation in the Earth and in the Shergottite Parent Body (SPB), a terrestrial planet tentatively inferred to be Mars. To this end, we (i) present new INAA and RNAA analyses of the non-Antarctic SNC meteorites, (ii) infer {{the composition of the}} SPB mantle from the compositions of the SNC meteorites, (iii) infer the composition of the Earth’s mantle from the compositions of terrestrial basahs, and (iv) deconvolve the effects of volatile depletion, core formation, and mineral/melt fractionation on the abundances of siderophile and <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements</b> in the SPB and the Earth.

From correlations within these groups, the SPB mantle is found to be depleted in volatile elements, and strongly depleted in siderophile and chalcophile lements. For the Earth the element/element correlation method gives a mantle composition similar to previous estimates.

40|$|The {{composition}} of the Earth’s upper mantle {{is a function of}} melt depletion and subsequent metasomatism; the latter obscuring many of the key characteristics of the former, and potentially making predictions of Primitive Upper Mantle (PUM) composition problematic. To date, estimates of PUM abundances of highly siderophile element (HSE = platinum group elements (PGE) and Re) and the strongly chalcophile elements Se and Te, {{have been the subject of}} less scrutiny than the lithophile elements. Critically, estimates of HSE and strongly <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> abundances in PUM may have been derived by including a large number of metasomatized and refertilized samples whose HSE and <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> abundances may not be representative of melt depletion alone. Unravelling the effects of metasomatism on the S–Se–Te–HSE abundances in peridotite xenoliths from Kilbourne Hole, New Mexico, USA, potentially provides valuable insights into the abundances of HSE and strongly <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> abundances in PUM. Superimposed upon the effects of melt depletion is the addition of metasomatic sulfide in approximately half of the xenoliths from this study, while the remaining half have lost sulfide to a late S-undersaturated melt. Despite these observations, the Kilbourne Hole peridotite xenoliths have HSE systematics that are, in general, indistinguishable from orogenic peridotites and peridotite xenoliths used for determination of PUM HSE abundances. This study represents the first instance where Se-Te-HSE systematics in peridotite xenoliths are scrutinized in detail in order to test their usefulness for PUM estimates. Despite earlier studies attesting to the relative immobility of Se during supergene weathering, low S, Se, Os and Se/Te in peridotite xenoliths suggests that Se may be more mobile than originally thought, and for this reason, peridotite xenoliths may not be suitable for making predictions of the abundance of these elements in PUM. Removal of Se, in turn, lowers the Se/Te in basalt-borne xenolithic peridotites to subchondritic values. This is in contrast to what has been recently reported in kimberlite-borne peridotite xenoliths. Moreover, Te added to melt depleted peridotite in metasomatic sulfide is more difficult to remove in a S-undersaturated melt than the HSE and Se due to the generation of micron-scale tellurides. The effects of these processes in orogenic peridotites and xenoliths, from which PUM abundances have been calculated, require further scrutiny before unequivocal Se-Te-Re-PGE values for PUM can be derived...|$|E

High concentrations of particulate Fe oxyhydroxides result from the extremely high Fe concentration (~ 24 mM) and Fe/H 2 S ratio (~ 24) of the vent fluids, and persist to at least 10 km away from the vent site due to the advection of plume material with the ambient along-axis flow.

In addition, major silicate and oxide minerals were analyzed for Ni, Cu, and Re, and a systematic sulfide study was carried out to investigate the role of silicate, oxide, and sulfide minerals on <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> geochemistry of the BPZP. Mass balance calculation shows that the whole rock Cu budget hosted by silicate and oxide minerals is 70 wt %) is held in major silicate and oxide minerals.

Ovoid-shaped sulfide blebs occur at the boundary between pyroxene phenocrysts and neighboring interstitial phases or within interstitial minerals in the gabbro and the granodiorite. The blebs are composed of pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and S-bearing Fe-oxide, which contain total trace metals (Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Pb) up to ~ 16 wt %. The mineral assemblage, occurrence, shape, and composition of the sulfide blebs are a typical of magmatic sulfide. PGE concentrations in the BPZP vary by more than two orders of magnitude from gabbro (2. 7 – 7. 8 ppb Pd, 0. 025 – 0. 116 ppb Ir) to aplite (0. 05 ppb Pd, 0. 001 ppb Ir). Nickel, Cu, Re, and PGE concentrations are positively correlated with MgO in all the rock types {{although there is a}} clear discontinuity between the granodiorite and the granite in the trends for Ni, Rh, and Ir when plotted against MgO. Cu/Pd values gradually increase from 6, 100 to 52, 600 as the MgO content decreases. The sulfide petrology and <b>chalcophile</b> <b>element</b> geochemistry of the BPZP show that sulfide saturation occurred in the late gabbroic stage of magma differentiation. Segregation and distribution of these sulfide blebs controlled Cu and PGE variations within the BPZP rocks although the magma of each rock type may have experienced a different magma evolution history in terms of crustal assimilation and crystal fractionation. The sulfide melt locked in the cumulate rocks must have sequestered {{a significant portion of the}} chalcophile elements, which restricted the availability of these metals to magmatic-hydrothermal ore fluids. Therefore, we suggest that the roof rocks that overlay the BPZP were not prospective for magmatic-hydrothermal Cu, Au, or Cu–Au deposits...|$|E
50|$|However, {{because they}} formed {{volatile}} hydrides on the primitive Earth when the controlling redox reaction was the oxidation or reduction of hydrogen, the less metallic <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements</b> are strongly depleted on Earth {{as a whole}} relative to cosmic abundances. This is most especially true of the chalcogens selenium and tellurium (which formed volatile hydrogen selenide and hydrogen telluride, respectively), which for this reason are among the rarest elements found in the Earth's crust (to illustrate, tellurium is only about as abundant as platinum).|$|R
5000|$|The most {{metallic}} <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements</b> (of the copper, zinc and boron groups) may mix to {{some degree}} with iron in the Earth's core. They {{are not likely to}} be depleted on Earth as a whole relative to their solar abundances since they do not form volatile hydrides. Zinc and gallium are somewhat [...] "lithophile" [...] in nature because they often occur in silicate or related minerals and form quite strong bonds with oxygen. Gallium, notably, is sourced mainly from bauxite, an aluminum hydroxide ore in which gallium ion substitutes for chemically similar aluminum.|$|R
40|$|Bulk chondritic meteorites and {{terrestrial}} planets show a monotonic depletion in moderately {{volatile and}} volatile elements {{relative to the}} Sun's photosphere and CI carbonaceous chondrites. Although volatile depletion was the most fundamental chemical process affecting the inner solar nebula, debate continues as to its cause. Carbonaceous chondrites are the most primitive rocks available to us, and fine-grained, volatile-rich matrix is the most primitive component in these rocks. Several volatile depletion models posit a pristine matrix, with uniform CI-like chemistry across the different chondrite groups. To {{understand the nature of}} volatile fractionation, we studied minor and trace element abundances in fine-grained matrices of a variety of carbonaceous chondrites. We find that matrix trace element abundances are characteristic for a given chondrite group; they are depleted relative to CI chondrites, but are enriched relative to bulk compositions of their parent meteorites, particularly in volatile siderophile and <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements.</b> This enrichment produces a highly nonmonotonic trace element pattern that requires a complementary depletion in chondrule compositions to achieve a monotonic bulk. We infer that carbonaceous chondrite matrices are not pristine: they formed from a material reservoir that was already depleted in volatile and moderately volatile elements. Additional thermal processing occurred during chondrule formation, with exchange of volatile siderophile and <b>chalcophile</b> <b>elements</b> between chondrules and matrix. This chemical complementarity shows that these chondritic components formed in the same nebula region. 6 page(s...|$|R
