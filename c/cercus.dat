2500|$|C. megacephalas {{eggs are}} [...] "oval with one flat face and another convex". Adult flies reflect a {{metallic}} blue-green color on their thorax and abdomen and have yellow gena, or cheeks. Larvae vary in size according to instar and are shaped more thickly towards the rear. C. megacephala have large red eyes, those of males being close together, {{and those of}} females farther apart. The <b>cercus</b> of the male is longer {{than that of the}} female.|$|E
2500|$|Adult {{males are}} {{polymorphic}} in body weight and head width, {{as well as}} <b>cercus</b> length and width. The male forceps are very robust and broadened basally with [...] teeth. The female forceps are about 3mm long, and are less robust and straighter. The cerci are used during mating, feeding, and self-defense. Females also have tegmina of about 2mm in length. Third instar or older nymphs that have lost one branch of cerci are capable of regenerating it in form of a straight structure. Males with asymmetrical forceps are called gynandromorphs or hermaphrodites because they resemble females.|$|E

5000|$|However, the <b>cerci</b> of Asiodiplatys speciousus and Forficula auricularia differ greatly on {{one major}} front. Asiodiplatys speciousus had <b>cerci</b> {{that were more}} bead-like, or filiform, than the thicker <b>cerci,</b> {{specifically}} known as forceps, of most other earwigs. From the fossil, it can be noted that Asiodiplatys speciousus's <b>cerci</b> were thin, almost identical to their antannae, while Forficula auricularia's <b>cerci</b> are the opposite. One of the key characteristics of the Forficulina suborder is the existence of large, thick, [...] broadened and [...] forceps, which is notably absent on Asiodiplatys speciousus. The only species of earwigs with these uncharacteristically-thinner <b>cerci</b> are earwigs in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina, which are rare and contain few individuals.|$|R
50|$|The {{species name}} amplificatus (enlarged, extended) {{was given in}} {{reference}} to the presence of 13 flagellomeres in the female antennae. L. amplificatus is the only species of Ceratopogonidae to possess this many antennal flagellomeres as well as an elongate, slender <b>cercus.</b> Another species of Leptoconops discovered in the same piece of amber, Leptoconops antiquus, also possesses 13 flagellomeres, but is differentiated by a basally broadened <b>cercus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some insects such as mayflies, silverfish, and bristletails have an {{accompanying}} third central tail filament which {{extends from the}} tip of the abdomen. This {{is referred to as the}} terminal filament and is not regarded as a <b>cercus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Anisolabis is a genus of earwigs in the {{subfamily}} Anisolabidinae. It {{was cited}} by Srivastava in Part 2 of Fauna of India. The name Anisolabis {{stems from the}} asymmetry of the male cerci; the right <b>cercus</b> being more acute than the left.|$|E
50|$|Unlike its relative, Archidermapteron martynovi, Asiodiplatys speciousus had <b>cerci,</b> or rear {{appendages}} {{similar to}} antannae, that {{were less than}} the length of their abdomen. By contrast, Archidermapteron martynovi had <b>cerci</b> that were not only longer than their abdomen, but longer than their abdomen and thorax combined. The size of Asiodiplatys speciousus's <b>cerci</b> is much more similar to the <b>cerci</b> of modern-day earwigs, such as most male Common earwigs, or Forficula auricularia.|$|R
50|$|Crickets have {{particularly}} long <b>cerci</b> {{while other}} insects have <b>cerci</b> {{that are too}} small to be noticeable. However, it is not always obvious that small <b>cerci</b> are without function; they are rich in sensory cells and may be of importance in guiding copulation and oviposition.|$|R
50|$|Aphids have tube-like cornicles or siphunculi {{that are}} {{sometimes}} mistaken for <b>cerci</b> {{but are not}} morphologically related to <b>cerci.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cerci (singular <b>cercus)</b> are paired {{appendages}} on the rear-most {{segments of}} many arthropods, including insects and symphylans. Many forms of cerci serve as sensory organs, but some serve as pinching weapons or as organs of copulation. In many insects, they simply may be functionless vestigial structures.|$|E
50|$|Tridactylidae {{give the}} {{impression}} of having two pairs of cerci; thisis because, in addition to the true cerci, the two podical plates (comprising the divided sternum of the eleventh abdominal segment) are greatly elongated and each bears a terminal segment that looks like a stylus or <b>cercus.</b> The antennae are fairly short, typically filiform or moniliform, with eleven segments.|$|E

Fragments of arthropod cuticles are present in between the many palatal teeth of both skulls.
