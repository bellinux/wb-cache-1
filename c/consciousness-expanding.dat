In 1962 Leary set up a grassroots nonprofit group with Alpert (later known as Ram Dass) called the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF), in order to carry out studies in the religious use of psychedelic drugs. IFIF was subsequently disbanded and renamed the Castalia Foundation (after the intellectual colony in Herman Hesse's The Glass Bead Game), when Leary and Alpert set up a communal group in 1963 at the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York.

He wanted {{to arrange the}} frames to create multiple frequencies while balancing {{the number of black}} and white frames. He consulted William S. Burroughs's 1964 article [...] "Points of Distinction Between Sedative and <b>Consciousness-Expanding</b> Drugs" [...] while arranging the patterns. In June 1965, Conrad tested various flicker speeds with his friend Lew Oliver. They found that the strobe effect was most powerful between 6 and 16 Hz. Oliver suggested using slightly longer durations for black frames, so Conrad used an extra black frame when constructing cycles of odd length.|$|E

5000|$|Zielinski's dream since {{childhood}} {{has been to}} make films that can reach billions of people, that are both highly entertaining while simultaneously being deep and consciousness expanding - he is convinced that these three new projects {{have the potential to}} achieve these goals. I originally set out to make illuminating, <b>consciousness-expanding,</b> globally entertaining movies that would change the world, and I guess I was naive, because the universe challenged me instead with a lesser-two-fold path: on the one hand a series of low budget independent art house films that I had to end up producing myself and that went around the film festival merry-go-around…while on the other a string of works-for-hire, which I tried to elevate as much as possible within the limitations given. I hope to change all of that and get back to the original afore-mentioned goal, before it is not too late. Rafal Zielinski ...|$|E
5000|$|Young {{was also}} keen {{to pursue his}} musical endeavors {{with the help of}} psychedelics. Cannabis, LSD and peyote played an {{important}} part in Young's life from mid-1950s onwards, when he was introduced to them by Terry Jennings and Billy Higgins. He said that [...] "everybody he knew and worked with was very much into drugs as a creative tool as well as a <b>consciousness-expanding</b> tool". This {{was the case with the}} musicians of the Theatre of Eternal Music, with whom he [...] "got high for every concert: the whole group". He considers that the cannabis experience helped him open up to where he went with Trio for Strings, though sometimes it proved a disadvantage when performing anything which required keeping track of the number of elapsed bars. He commented on the subject: These tools can be used to your advantage if you're a master of them... If used wisely - the correct tool for the correct job - they can play an important role... It allows you to go within yourself and focus on certain frequency relationships and memory relationships in a very, very interesting way.|$|E
5000|$|In {{traditional}} {{rituals and}} ceremonies Imphepho is burnt in large quantities. It is usually burnt indoors and traditionally in a badly ventilated hut, the herb {{is used as}} incense but in such large quantities that it may resemble fumigation. Before and during consultations with the ancestors {{for the purposes of}} divination or otherwise, Sangomas will burn Imphepho. The areal parts of the plant (leaves, twigs and flowers if the plant is in flower) are collected and tied up in tight bundles which are dried. A bundle of Imphepho can smoulder {{for quite a long time}} producing a great deal of smoke.The herb is burnt to invoke, honour and to placate the ancestors, burning Imphepho is seen as a ritual offering. The plant is mainly used in traditional ceremonies and rituals as well as African traditional medicine, but it may be used privately by individuals from time to time to ward off evil, dispel negativity, for meditation or other such purposes. Despite its mild psychoactive properties the plant is not commonly used recreationally as a mind-altering or <b>consciousness-expanding</b> herb. Unlike many plants with magical properties ascribed to them which are used in traditional medicine and shamanism, Helichrysum species do not contain alkaloids, instead a mixture of flavanoids, volatile oils, sesquiterpenoids and acylated phloroglucinols seem to mimic the effects of alkaloid compounds on the central nervous system. In order to experience the effects of Imphepho a lot of smoke must be breathed in for a long time.Euphoria, ecstasy, uncontrolled giggling and sedation are commonly experienced by people inhaling Imphepho smoke. Violent mood swings, mental confusion and personality changes have not been reported. Other symptoms may be more rare and are normally seen in connection to the African traditional beliefs, mild hallucinations (such as seeing everything bathed in a gentle golden light) are seen as 'visions' and [...] "speaking in tongues" [...] has been known. Whether these are a result of the effects of the plant or of the psychological state of those involved in the rituals is uncertain. There is no evidence that even prolonged heavy use of Imphepho can lead to any sort of physical or psychological dependency and there is no evidence of any health problems arising from prolonged use (apart from those associated with smoke inhalation perhaps). Imphepho is an important part of African traditional medicine and rituals and the plant is revered, however little to no effort is made to protect areas in which the plant commonly grows. This may be because the plant is very common in Southern Africa. Although the use of Imphepho in rituals and ceremonies is normally associated with African traditional beliefs, it is often burned as incense in South African Christian churches. Here it is assumed that its use is similar to that of frankincense and not associated with honouring the ancestors. The plant is commonly available and seldom sold for much money, it is difficult to say whether it is seen as a 'holy' or 'sacred' plant. The plant is believed to increase the spiritual awareness and psychic abilities of those who use it.South African law protects the right of individuals to burn Imphepho as part of ceremonies and rituals associated with traditional beliefs. The dried bundle of Imphepho is usually burnt in the middle of a (typically badly ventilated) room or hut in a potsherd. Smoking Imphepho through a pipe or in a cigarette is unknown. The smoke has a smell which is not always liked by everyone, it has been described as being similar to mildew and camphor with fenugreek overtones.|$|E
40|$|Psychedelic or <b>consciousness-expanding</b> {{drugs have}} been studied by Western {{scientific}} researchers as adjuncts to psychotherapy while their plant-based equivalents are used in traditional ceremonial context for healing and spiritual practice. Plant extracts from tobacco, coca, coffee and cannabis, used as sacraments in indigenous cultures have become recreational drugs in contemporary society. Research with <b>consciousness-expanding</b> or entheogenic substances such as MDMA, LSD and psilocybin has focused on their value as adjuncts to psychotherapy. The worldwide underground culture has adopted the use of hallucinogenic plants and fungi, such as psilocybe mushrooms, ayahuasca, iboga and peyote, in small group hybrid therapeutic-shamanic ceremonies as well as large scale events such as raves. Core elements of such hybrid rituals are: {{the structure of a}} circle, a ritual space and altar of some kind, the presence of an experienced elder or guide, the use of eye-shades or semi-darkness and the cultivation of a respectful, spiritual attitude...|$|E

The impact of the OBE on the individual's life is described, with suggestions for a psychoeducational approach to the clinical management of the patient with an OBE to allow maximum growth from the <b>consciousness-expanding</b> effects of the experience...|$|E
