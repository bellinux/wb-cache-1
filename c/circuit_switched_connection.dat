40|$|The {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} is currently {{going through a}} shift of paradigm from <b>circuit</b> <b>switched,</b> <b>connection</b> oriented information transfer towards packet switched, connection-less transfer. For application independence and to decrease costs for transport and switching it is attractive to go IP {{all the way over}} the air interface to the end user equipment, i. e., to not terminate the IP protocols before the air interface. A major reason to avoid using voice over IP over the air interface has, up to now, been the relatively large overhead imposed by the IP/UDP/RTP headers of voice packets. This paper presents a novel header compression scheme, ROCCO, that can compress the large headers to a minimum of one octet and is robust against the errors imposed by cellular links. Its performance is excellent both in terms of robustness and compression efficiency. Moreover, system capacity simulations are presented, which show that ROCCO gives significantly higher system capacity than the other current header compression candidate, CRTP. Finally it is argued that with ROCCO voice over IP over wireless becomes feasible from a spectrum-efficiency point of viewGodkänd; 2000; 20080328 (ysko...|$|E

This paper concentrates on evaluating {{the performance of the}} GPRS coding scheme detection methods {{in the presence of a}} multipath fading channel with a single co-channel interferer as a function of various soft-bit data widths. It has been found that compressing the soft-bit data widths from the output of the equalizer to save memory can influence the likelihood decision of the coding scheme detect function and hence contribute to the overall performance loss of the system. Coding scheme detection errors can therefore force the channel decoder to either select the incorrect decoding scheme or have no clear decision which coding scheme to use resulting in the decoded radio block failing the block check sequence and contribute to the block error rate. For correct performance simulation, the performance of the full coding scheme detection must be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Packet {{switching}} is {{used extensively}} in Local Area Networks (LANs) for data communications, and {{is becoming increasingly}} important in the trend towards integrated services Wide Area Networks (WANs). As most existing speech codecs were designed with <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> <b>connections</b> in mind, they are vulnerable to packet loss, and are unable to fully exploit the variable capacity of packet <b>switched</b> <b>connections.</b> Consideration is therefore given in this thesis to the design and implementation of a speech codec specifically intended for use with packet switched networks. The thesis starts {{with a discussion of}} the general characteristics of local and wide area networks. Then a model for a packet voice terminal, consisting of a speech codec, network voice protocol, and access controller, is described. The way in which the network and the components of the packet voice terminal can affect the quality of speech communications is then discussed, and this leads to a detailed set of requirements for the codec itself. The codec design makes use of an 2 ̆ 2 embedded 2 ̆ 2 coding scheme, which allows rapid flow control of voice traffic to be performed, and enables the variable activity of the signal to be exploited for bandwidth compression purposes. The fundamental coding technique used is Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM), and particular attention is given to the design of the adaptive quantizer in this algorithm. A new structure for this device is developed, and the result is called the Generalized Hybrid Adaptive Quantizer (GHAQ). The GHAQ is easily optimized to the statistics of a particular signal by means of an iterative procedure, and is shown to yield improved signal-to-noise ratio over other well-known adaptive quantizers in Adaptive Delta Modulators and 2 -bit ADPCM coders. The codec is implemented on an IBM PC expansion card using a programmable digital signal processor. Associated interface hardware, designed to allow the packetization of coded speech with minimal processing overhead, is also included. This hardware/software system represents an economical means of adding voice traffic to an existing data LAN, and is a flexible vehicle for further research into packet voice communications...|$|R

The model is utilized for investigating how many packet data channels should be allocated for GPRS under a given amount of traffic in order to guarantee appropriate quality of service. The presented model constitutes a continuous-time Markov chain. The Markov model represents the sharing of radio channels by <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> GSM <b>connections</b> and packet <b>switched</b> GPRS sessions under a dynamic channel allocation scheme. In contrast to previous work, the Markov model explicitly represents the mobility of users by taking into account arrivals of new GSM and GPRS users as well as handovers from neighboring cells. Because of the employment of a numerical method for steady-state analysis, we can efficiently and accurately compute sensitive performance measures such as loss probabilities. To validate the simplifications necessary for making the Markov model amenable to numerical solution, we provide {{a comparison of the}} results of the Markov model with a detailed simulator on the IP level.

40|$|Technical {{advances}} have brought <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> {{back to the}} stage of interconnection network design for high performance computing. Although <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> has long <b>connection</b> establishment delays and the dedication of connections prevents other communicating nodes from sharing the network, it has simple control logic and significant cost advantage over packet or wormhole switching. With the proper assistance from compilers, <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> {{has the potential of}} providing significant performance benefits when connections can be established prior to the actual communication. This dissertation presents a novel compilation framework for achieving efficient communications in <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> interconnection networks. The goal of the framework is to identify communication patterns in Single-Program-Multiple-Data (SPMD) parallel applications and compile these patterns as network configuration directives. This can significantly reduce the communication overhead on <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> interconnection networks. A powerful representation scheme is developed in this research to capture the property of communication patterns and allow manipulation of these patterns. Based on the temporal and spatial localities of communications and the capability of the compiler to identify the communication patterns, we classify communication patterns into three categories - static, persistent, and dynamic. We target static and persistent communications, which are dominant in most parallel applications. To identify communication patterns, we develop a novel symbolic expression analysis. We develop certain compiler techniques for analyzing communication patterns. Since the underlying network capacity is limited, we develop an algorithm to partition the program into phases based on the communication requirements and network capacity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we implement an experimental compiler. The compiler identifies the communication patterns from the source code, partitions the program into phases, and inserts the network configuration directives at phase boundaries to achieve efficient communications. The compiler also can generate communication traces, which provides useful information about the communication pattern correlated to the structure of the source code. We develop a multiprocessor system simulator to evaluate our techniques. Our simulation-based performance analysis demonstrates that using our compiler techniques can achieve the same level, or even better level of communication performance than fast packet switching networks while using much less expensive <b>circuit</b> <b>switches...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the performance evaluation of third generation radio networks, in particular UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA). First, the performance evaluation methods are presented. The typical capacity of UTRA is estimated using those methods {{and a few}} solutions are evaluated to improve the capacity and coverage. The thesis further studies the effect of base station synchronization {{on the performance of}} UTRA time division duplex mode. The performance evaluation is based on the combination of theoretical calculations, link and system level simulations, and laboratory and field measurements. It is shown that these different evaluation methods give similar results and – when combined together – they can be used for the radio network development purposes. The simulation results indicate that the typical WCDMA, i. e. UTRA frequency division duplex mode, macro cell capacity is between 600 and 1000 kbps per sector per 5  MHz. The capacity is sensitive to the environment and to the transceiver performance. The results further show that user bit rates up to 2  Mbps can be provided locally for packet data with the basic Rake receiver, but not for full coverage <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> <b>connections</b> in macro cells. The following performance enhancement techniques are evaluated in this thesis: soft combining of packet retransmissions, base station multiuser detection and 4 -branch base station receiver diversity. The link level simulations show that soft combining can provide a gain up to 2. 0  dB, which can be used to increase the capacity up to 60  %. The performance of base station multiuser detection is evaluated with link and system level simulations. It is shown that the studied sub-optimal multiuser detector is able to remove 60 - 70  % of the intra-cell interference. That gain can be utilized to improve the uplink capacity by 50 - 100  % or the coverage by 1 - 2  dB. The performance of 4 -branch antenna diversity is evaluated in the simulations and in the field measurements. The results show that the average coverage gain of 4 -branch diversity with two separate cross-polarized antennas is 3  dB compared to 2 -branch diversity with one cross-polarized antenna. The synchronization requirements of UTRA time division duplex base stations are studied with system simulations. The results show that synchronization is a key requirement for time division duplex operation, especially for the uplink performance. The study indicates that co-location of different operators' base stations is feasible in time division duplex operation only if the two networks are synchronized and if an identical split between uplink and downlink is used. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of an Internet that uses <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> instead of, or in addition to, packet switching. On the face of it, this would seem a pointless exercise; the Internet is packet switched, and was deliberately built that way to enable the efficiencies afforded by statistical multiplexing, and the robustness of fast re-routing around failures. But link utilization is low, and falling, particularly {{at the core of}} the Internet, which means that statistical multiplexing is less important than it once was. And <b>circuit</b> <b>switches</b> today are capable of rapid reconfiguration around failures. There is also renewed interest in <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> because of the ease of building very high capacity optical <b>circuit</b> <b>switches.</b> While several proposals have suggested ways in which <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> may be introduced into the Internet, this paper is based on TCP Switching, in which a new circuit is created for each application flow. Here, we explore {{the performance of}} a network that uses TCP Switching, with particular emphasis on the reponse time experienced by users. We use simple M/G/ 1 and M/G/N queues to model application flows in both packet <b>switched</b> and <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> networks, as well as ns- 2 simulations. We conclude that because of high bandwidth long-lived flows, it does not make sense to use <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> in shared access or local area networks.

In order to accurately characterize the network, we present a bottom-up design methodology in which each of the components are designed using a hardware description language and synthesized to an FPGA for performance estimation of the final ASIC implementation. The components are then integrated to form a parallel computing network and simulated using a cycle-accurate simulator with network traffic described by command files. This enabled us to simulate various switching techniques, three of which are presented in this paper: wormhole <b>switching,</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> and a newly introduced technique called predictive <b>circuit</b> <b>switching.</b> In our experiments, four different representational traffics are generated for our simulation and, to show the flexibility of this model, we vary the cable lengths and thus their latency for all four test cases.
