40|$|<b>Cicletanine</b> {{was tested}} as an {{antagonist}} {{of the various}} actions of histamine in coronary artery rings isolated from old (mostly atherosclerotic) and young (non-atherosclerotic) patients. Histamine mainly induced concentration-dependent contractions in arteries from old patients. <b>Cicletanine</b> antagonized this effect with a pA 2 value of 6. 9 (slope factor of 0. 94), revealing in some cases a relaxant effect of histamine. In addition, <b>cicletanine</b> increased the threshold concentration of histamine required to trigger spastic, indomethacin-sensitive rhythmic contractions in (some) rings of the oldest patient. At variance with what occurred in coronary rings from old patients, the predominant effect of histamine in rings from young patients was relaxation. This relaxation remained unaltered by <b>cicletanine</b> (1 microM). As a whole, these results extend the histamine H 1 antagonistic activity of <b>cicletanine</b> to human coronary arteries. If histamine {{is involved in the}} promotion of vasospasm, then <b>cicletanine</b> could be of potential benefit to patients, without apparently affecting the relaxant response to histamine in non-cardiac patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Cicletanine</b> is an {{antihypertensive}} {{agent with}} vasorelaxant and diuretic properties. It {{has been widely}} used in European countries; however, cicletanine-associated electrolyte disturbances {{have yet to be}} defined. We investigated cicletanine-induced hyponatremia and hypokalemia in kidney transplant patients. Methods: Data from a total of 68 kidney transplant recipients who were treated for hypertension with <b>cicletanine</b> were retrospectively analyzed. Cicletanine-induced hyponatremia and hypokalemia were defined as serum sodium <  135  mmol/L and potassium <  3. 5  mmol/L, respectively, after the use of <b>cicletanine.</b> Results: The average patient age was 50 (± 11)  years, and 44 (65 %) were male. The daily dose of <b>cicletanine</b> was 171  ±  46  mg, and the duration of drug use was 215  ±  514  days. Hyponatremia occurred in 11 patients (16. 2 %), and hypokalemia occurred in 8 patients (11. 8 %). Three patients (4. 4 %) had hyponatremia and hypokalemia simultaneously. The duration of <b>cicletanine</b> administration was significantly longer in patients with hyponatremia than in those without hyponatremia (943  ±  958 vs. 74  ±  166  days, P <  0. 05). The occurrence of hypokalemia was not affected by either daily dose or duration of drug use. Among 11 patients with hyponatremia, 10 were corrected within 2  weeks after withdrawal of the drug and 1 was spontaneously corrected. Among 8 cases of hypokalemia, 7 were corrected after withdrawal of the drug and 1 was spontaneously corrected. Conclusion: We demonstrate that <b>cicletanine</b> may induce hyponatremia or hypokalemia in kidney transplant patients. Hyponatremia is more frequently associated with <b>cicletanine</b> than hypokalemia, and extended use of <b>cicletanine</b> may increase the risk of hyponatremia...|$|E
40|$|Terfenadine, a {{histamine}} H(1) receptor antagonist, {{has been}} associated with clinical ventricular arrhythmias and in vitro excitation-conduction blocks, whereas anti-ischemic and antiarrhythmic effects have been shown with <b>cicletanine,</b> a prostacyclin generation stimulator. We aimed at determining in vitro if <b>cicletanine</b> can protect the ischemic myocardium from excitation-conduction blocks and specifically those induced by terfenadine. In a double-chamber bath, isolated guinea pig ventricular strips were partly exposed to normoxia and partly to ischemic, then reperfused, conditions, in the presence of 10 microM terfenadine, 10 microM indomethacin (prostacyclin generation blocker) or the solvent (dimethylsulfoxide 1 : 100, control) randomly allocated, and thus either in the absence (n= 20) or presence (n= 21) of 10 microM <b>cicletanine</b> during the total protocol duration. The multivariate Cox's model was used to predict the excitation-conduction block events and to assess the estimated survival of preparations (excitation-conduction block-free rate). <b>Cicletanine</b> protected the preparations (relative risk= 0. 08, t=- 3. 28) from the ischemia-induced excitation-conduction blocks (estimated survival= 0. 83 versus 0. 30 in control), and this effect was abolished by indomethacin (estimated survival= 0. 35). Terfenadine enhanced 3. 58 -fold the risk of occurrence of excitation-conduction blocks during ischemia (t= 2. 10) and this effect was inhibited by <b>cicletanine</b> pretreatment (estimated survival= 0. 40 versus 0. 10 in untreated preparations). In conclusion, these in vitro findings have provided evidence for (1) protective effects of <b>cicletanine</b> against ischemia-induced excitation-conduction blocks, possibly related to its stimulating activity on local prostacyclin generation, and (2) efficacy of <b>cicletanine</b> to prevent excitation-conduction blocks induced by terfenadine in ischemic cardiac tissue...|$|E
40|$|The {{antagonism}} by <b>cicletanine</b> of contractile {{responses to}} histamine has been examined in vitro on ring preparations of rabbit mesenteric arteries. <b>Cicletanine</b> (10 (- 8) - 10 (- 6) M) caused a parallel rightward shift of histamine concentration response curve, with a pA 2 value of 7. 48 (slope = 0. 89 +/- 0. 19, {{not significantly different}} from unity). Histamine-induced contractions were nifedipine-sensitive and associated with cicletanine-sensitive increased 45 Ca uptake. Endothelium removal resulted in enhanced contractile responses to histamine, but did not significantly modify cicletanine-induced antagonism: KB (dissociation constant) values for <b>cicletanine</b> antagonism in {{the presence or absence of}} endothelium were: 3. 7 (+/- 0. 1) X 10 (- 8) M and 3. 6 (+/- 0. 3) X 10 (- 8) M, respectively. <b>Cicletanine</b> (greater than 10 (- 4) M) also significantly attenuated 10 mM caffeine-induced contractions in rings exposed to Ca-free 100 mM K+ depolarizing medium. The results suggest that cicletanine-induced antagonisms of histamine H 1 receptor-mediated contractions of rabbit mesenteric arteries is associated with interference with calcium entry as well as at high concentrations, release from intracellular stores...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Marinobufagenin (MBG), an {{endogenous}} ligand of - 1 Na/K-ATPase, becomes elevated {{and contributes}} to hypertension in NaCl-loaded Dahl-S rats (DS). Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates - 1 Na/K-ATPase and increases its MBG sensitivity. <b>Cicletanine,</b> an antihypertensive compound with PKC-inhibitory activity, reverses MBG-induced Na/K-ATPase inhibition and vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that increased PKC levels in sodium-loaded hyperten-sive DS would sensitize - 1 Na/K-ATPase to MBG and that PKC inhibition by <b>cicletanine</b> would produce an opposite effect. We studied the effects of <b>cicletanine</b> on systolic blood pressure, left ventricular PKC isoforms, cardiac - 1 Na/K-ATPase levels, and sensitivity to MBG in hypertensive DS. Seven DS received 50 mg · kg 1 · d 1 <b>cicletanine,</b> and 7 DS received vehicle during 4 weeks of an 8 % NaCl diet. Vehicle-treated rats exhibited an increase in blood pressure, left ventricular mass, MBG excretion (7411 vs 91 pmol/ 24 h, P 0. 01), myocardial - 1 Na/K-ATPase protein, and PKC 2 and. The sensitivity of Na/K-ATPase to MBG was enhanced {{at the level of}} high-affinity binding sites (IC 50, 0. 8 vs 4. 4 nmol/L, P 0. 01). Cicletanine-treated rats exhibited a 56 -mm Hg reduction in blood pressure (P 0. 01) and a 30 % reduction in left ventricular weight, whereas cardiac - 1 Na/K-ATPase protein and MBG levels were unchanged. In cicletanine-treated rats, PKC 2 was not increased, the sensitivity of Na/K-ATPase to MBG was decreased (IC 5020 mol/L), and phorbol diacetate–induced - 1 Na/K-ATPase phosphorylation was reduced versus vehicle-treated rats. In vitro <b>cicletanine</b> treatment of sarcolemma from vehicle-treated rats also desensitized Na/K-ATPase to MBG, indicatin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>cicletanine,</b> an {{antihypertensive}} drug, was studied in two in vivo models. It was {{demonstrated that the}} drug markedly affected the response of intravenously administered arachidonic acid in the rabbit. In this model a marked increase of 6 -oxo-PGF 1 alpha was observed when challenged by the intravenous injection of 50 micrograms/kg b. w. of arachidonic acid. In the rat model used {{for the study of}} platelet-vessel wall interaction, it was demonstrated that the inhibition of prostacyclin synthetase could be offset by <b>cicletanine.</b> These results indicate that the drug modulates the generation of prostacyclin and as such is capable of affecting the peripheral resistances which determine the level of the blood pressure.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{histamine}} were characterized and compared in the vascular smooth muscle of two human isolated blood vessels, the human internal mammary artery (HIMA) {{and the human}} saphenous vein (HSV). Segments of these vessels were obtained during aortocoronary bypass surgery and their intimal surface was rubbed in order to eliminate any possible influence of the endothelium. Histamine contracted both types of vessels in a concentration-dependent manner and this effect was antagonized by the H 1 receptor antagonists mepyramine and <b>cicletanine.</b> In the case of HIMA only this antagonism {{was found to be}} competitive (pA 2 values of 9. 3 and 7. 7 for mepyramine and <b>cicletanine,</b> respectively). Histamine-induced contractions were not significantly affected by phentolamine (0. 3 microM). In HSV, but not HIMA, indomethacin (5 microM) significantly depressed histamine-induced contractions (by about 30 %). In the presence of the H 2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (10 microM), concentration-response curves of histamine-induced contractions were significantly shifted to the left in both HIMA and HSV, suggesting the presence of H 2 receptors mediating relaxation. HIMA and HSV precontracted by noradrenaline could be partially and concentration dependently relaxed by histamine, only {{in the presence of a}} H 1 receptor antagonist. This relaxation was inhibited by cimetidine. The results show that in de-endothelialized HIMA and HSV histamine induced mainly contraction which is sensitive to the H 1 receptor antagonists. Only in HIMA, nevertheless, was competitive antagonism established. In addition, histamine-induced relaxation, antagonized by cimetidine, could be demonstrated in both precontracted vessels, indicating the presence of H 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we have {{investigated}} the response in P 19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells to histamine. We show that these cells, that resemble the pluripotent cells of an early mouse embryo, respond to histamine addition by a transient increase in intracellular Ca 2 +. The response is stereoselectively inhibited by the enantiomers of the H 1 -receptor antagonists chlorpheniramine and <b>cicletanine.</b> [3 H]-mepyramine was found to bind with high affinity (Kd 4 nM) to a membrane preparation of P 19 EC cells. The profile of these binding sites corresponded well {{with the results of}} the Ca 2 + measurements. A high affinity [3 H]-mepyramine binding site was also identified on intact cells. These data demonstrate that embryonal carcinoma cells express functional histamine H 1 -receptors and suggest that histamine might act as a regulatory factor in the early development of the mouse embryo...|$|E
40|$|Multivariate {{analysis}} of survival using Cox's {{proportional hazards model}} demonstrates that several clinically measurable covariates are determinants of life-threatening arrhythmias following left circumflex coronary artery occlusion-reperfusion in 107 dogs. These are heart rate, ST segment elevation and mean aortic pressure immediately (3 min) following occlusion, {{and the presence of}} early (0 - 10 min) post-occlusion sustained ventricular tachycardia. The risk of occlusion-reperfusion ventricular fibrillation was determined according to Cox's solution based on ST segment elevation, thus enabling quantification of the role of <b>cicletanine.</b> Since cicletanine-treated dogs had reduced mean ST segment elevation at 3 min post-occlusion, lower incidence of early post-occlusion (0 - 10 min) sustained ventricular tachycardia, and increased endogenous production of prostacyclin, and the latter was inversely correlated with the level of ST segment elevation, it is concluded that such favourable effects on the ischaemic myocardium were contributory to the improved outcome in these experiments. These effects on the ischaemic myocardium obtained in spite of a hypotensive action in the experimental setting might be regarded as desirable and it is therefore suggested that they should be further investigated by pharmacodynamic studies in human subjects...|$|E
40|$|Nicorandil (N) {{increases}} potassium conductance in vascular {{smooth muscle}} and so induces vasodilation; N also dose-dependently reduces action potential duration (APD). However, {{it is unclear}} whether increased potassium conductance, and concomitant APD shortening, might be arrhythmogenic, particularly when myocardial ischemia (where potassium efflux is increased) concurs. Data on the anti-arrhythmic effectiveness of N have also been published: N reduced the spontaneous discharge of sino-atrial node and so reduced heart rate, both in vitro and man. On the other hand, among other vasodilators, <b>cicletanine</b> (C) has been reported to increase potassium conductance, an effect which was advocated to explain its antiarrhythmic potency. In the present investigation the direct myocardial effects of N were compared to those following C in 63 experiments (from 13 Guinea-pigs), using atrial strips (containing sino-atrial node) superfused in 1 -compartment bath with normal Tyrode's solution. Using glass microelectrodes, standard electrophysiologic variables were recorded (APA, RMP, APD 50 %, Vmax) in spontaneously beating atrial tissue, either in Tyrode, dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO 1 : 100, as solvent), C 10 (- 5) M (in DMSO 1 : 100), and N 10 (- 3) M (in DMSO 1 : 100), whose respective perfusion periods (15 min) were randomized, always following 15 min of washout with Tyrode.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} (multivariate Cox's model) {{the relative risk}} of stable excitation-conduction block (ECB) in right ventricular myocardial strips (2 x 5 x 1 mm) from 26 female guinea-pigs, bathed in a 2 -compartment chamber (3 ml) on the anterior side of which modified Tyrode's solution (K+ 12 mM, HCO 3 - 9 mM, pH 7 +/- 0. 05, pO 2 80 +/- 10 mmHg and absence of glucose) is supraperfused (stimulation rate: 450 ms; wire in the posterior compartment), thus enabling simulation of electrophysiologic changes seen during acute myocardial ischemia. Using glass microelectrodes, action potential amplitude (APA), durations (APD 50 and 90 %), resting membrane potential (RMP) and upstroke velocity (Vmax) are investigated. The hypothesis was tested of prostacyclin and histamine involvement in the genesis of ischemia-induced ECB in this model. Either a weak prostacyclin stimulator (<b>cicletanine</b> 10 (- 5) M, IPSEN, Paris, F, in DMSO 1 : 100; n = 16) or a potent prostacyclin generation blocker (indomethacin 10 (- 5) M, Sigma, in DMSO 1 : 100; n = 10) and either DMSO alone (1 : 100; n = 16) or a specific histaminergic H 1 receptor antagonist (terfenadine 10 (- 5) M, Sigma, in DMSO 1 : 100; n = 10) were supraperfused using a randomization scheme. Each animal was used twice and either a first or a second occlusion (supraperfusing the modified Tyrode's solution for 30 min) period was performed and the randomized substances were supraperfused, thus enabling obtention of n = 52 experiments for analysis.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which <b>cicletanine</b> (CIC) exerts its antihypertensive effects has not been fully elucidated. The present study was undertaken {{to examine the effects}} of in vivo and in vitro treatment with CIC on the pressor response and noradrenaline (NA) overflow during periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) in perfused mesenteric arterial beds isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). CIC at a dose of 50 [*]mg kg− 1 day− 1 was administered orally to both SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) from the 6 th to 10 th week of age. At the 10 th week, the isolated mesenteric arterial bed was perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer and changes in perfusion pressure and NA overflow during PNS were measured. Chronic treatment with CIC suppressed the age-related elevation of systemic blood pressure in SHR but not in WKY. The PNS (20 [*]Hz) -induced mesenteric vasoconstrictor response and NA overflow were greater in SHR than in WKY. In the vasculature of SHR chronic treatment with CIC resulted in a significant attenuation of the vasoconstriction and the NA overflow during PNS, whereas it did not alter vasoconstrictor responses to bolus injections of KCl and phenylephrine. Treatment with 30 [*]μM CIC in vitro diminished the PNS-induced vasoconstriction and NA overflow but not the NA- and KCl-induced vasoconstriction in the vasculature of untreated SHR. In the vasculature of SHR PNS-induced NA overflow was attenuated by prostaglandin E 2 (0. 05 [*]μM), whereas it was augmented by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac-Na (30 [*]μM). In the presence of diclofenac, in vitro treatment with CIC did not attenuate the NA overflow during PNS. The results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of CIC in SHR is partially due to the presynaptic inhibition of NA release during sympathetic nerve activation. Transjunctional inhibition of NA release by prostaglandins may contribute to the inhibitory action of CIC on NA release in the vasculature of SHR...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} whether <b>cicletanine</b> (CIC), as a potential inhibitor of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, is able to restore glomerular response to atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in rats under conditions of diet deprived of sodium. We examined the effects of CIC on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), natriuresis and nephrogenous cyclic GMP excretion in response to ANF and the effects of both agents on intracapillary volume and cyclic GMP accumulation in isolated glomeruli of rats on normal and low sodium diets. CIC (0. 25 [*]mg[*]min− 1 [*]kg− 1 [*]BW) of ANF (0. 5 [*]μg[*]min− 1 [*]BW) alone, given in pharmacological doses, increased Cin significantly in normal sodium rats, whereas the effect of each agent was blunted in low sodium diet rats. Pretreatment with CIC restored the increase in Cin in response to ANF infusion in low sodium diet rats. In rats on either diet, there were no differences in the extent of diuresis and natriuresis induced by CIC or ANF alone. In contrast to FENa, combined effects of both agents on V and UNaV in rats on normal and low sodium diets were observed. In normal sodium diet rats, CIC 10 − 4 [*]M or ANF 10 − 6 [*]M alone inhibited angiotensin II 10 − 6 [*]M (AII) -induced decrease in intracapillary volume reflected by the glomerular [3 H]-inulin space (GIS). In contrast, CIC or ANF alone did not inhibit AII-induced decrease in GIS in low sodium diet rats. Both agents given together inhibited AII-induced decrease in GIS in low sodium diet rats. CIC both alone and in combination with ANF increased nephrogenous cyclic GMP excretion and cyclic GMP accumulation in isolated glomeruli of rats on normal and low sodium diets. In rats on either diet, CIC abolished the difference in ANF-stimulated increase in nephrogenous cyclic GMP excretion and cyclic GMP accumulation in glomeruli. These results suggest that CIC and ANF alone induce relaxation of glomeruli and a resultant increase in glomerular filtration rate in normal sodium diet rats; in contrast, these effects are blunted in the low sodium diet rats. CIC restores glomerular response to ANF in low sodium diet rats, apparently involving inhibition of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{effect of}} {{anti-hypertensive}} drugs depends on sodium diet in the excision remnant kidney model. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) {{are believed to}} protect remnant kidney, but all previous studies used the ligation model which causes severe hypertension, and very few have compared drugs in rats having similar control of blood pressure (BP). We compared rats with uremia obtained by 70 % excision of total renal mass, a model which causes mild, late hypertension. Study I compared the effects of enalapril (E), <b>cicletanine</b> (C) and placebo (P) in uremic (U) rats fed a 0. 50 % (normal-high) Na diet. Study II compared the effects of E, C, P, and guanfacine (G) in U rats fed a diet restricted to 0. 25 % Na (normal-low). In study I, UP rats developed progressive hypertension (140, 146, 160 and 166 mm Hg at 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks), proteinuria (240 mg/day at 9 and 12 weeks) which were not affected by E or C. The occurrence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) led to the sacrifice of all rats after three months. All three groups had similar severe renal lesions (over 25 % sclerosed glomeruli in 5 of 10 UP, 9 of 14 UE, 7 of 14 UC rats, with huge cystic tubular dilatations). In study II, rats could be sacrificed later (6 months) and had evidence of less severe renal disease. All the drugs tested prevented hypertension throughout the study (P < 0. 001), with lowest values in UE rats. E and G, but not C, reduced proteinuria. Renal damage was reduced with E and G, but not with C, despite similar BP in C and G rats. Thus, in contrast with what was obtained in the ligation model, ACEI affected neither the BP nor the renal lesions of rats made uremic by renal excision and fed a 0. 50 % Na diet. Moderate Na restriction improved the consequences of nephron loss and restored the anti-hypertensive effect of drugs. However, these drugs had a different effect on renal preservation: it was dramatic with E, good with G, and undetectable with C...|$|E
