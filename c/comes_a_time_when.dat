Of these, only Buttler {{appeared in the}} first-team during the season. They also signed David Stiff, a fast bowler capped at Under-19 level for England, on a two-month contract {{at the beginning of}} the season, which was later extended to the end of the season. Ian Blackwell, captain of the side in 2005 and 2006, left for Durham after coach Andy Hurry and captain Justin Langer made it clear that they regarded fitness as a priority. John Francis and Keith Parsons both retired at the end of 2008, Francis cited lack of first-team opportunities for his departure, while at the age of 35, Parsons declared that: [...] "There <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> your body tells you it's time to pack in professional sport." ...|$|E

It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E

500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club. He joined Kettering on a free transfer, having been out of {{contract}} at Stevenage — [...] "I got injured at {{the back end of}} last season and I was out of contract and because of all the deals that needed to be sorted at Stevenage, I wasn't a priority and I had to wait. There <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> you can't wait any longer and I needed to sort my future out so here we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E

[...] "It's not that I wasn't fond of Doctor Who, I simply felt that the time had come. It had been eighteen very concentrated months, something like seventy shows.

2500|$|Beaird {{announced}} {{the closure of}} The Journal on January 29, 1991, to give employees two months notice before the effective date of termination on March 30. He explained that the publication had lost circulation and advertising revenues during the preceding decade {{from a high of}} nearly 40,000 to barely 16,000. Beaird did not comment on the possibility that his liberal editorial views, new to the older readers, had been a factor in the decline in circulation. [...] "There just <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> it becomes uneconomical to go on. It was a very tough, sad decision," [...] he said.|$|E

On March 12, 1968, McCarthy, who was the only candidate on the ballot, came within 7 percentage points of defeating President Lyndon Johnson, a write-in candidate who was technically still exploring his candidacy and had not bothered to file. Just a few days later, on March 16, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy announced he was entering the race for President. Johnson subsequently withdrew from the election with this Shermanesque statement: [...] "I shall not seek, and will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{wrote of}} an apostle who didn't have the easiest time being a Christian. [...] "Now Paul! Did he {{live in the}} favor of the mighty so that it could commend his {{teaching}}? No, he was a prisoner! Did the wise hail his teaching so that their reputation could guarantee its truth? No, to them it was foolishness. Was his teaching capable of quickly supplying the individual with a supranatural power, did it offer itself for sale to people through legerdemain? No, it had to be acquired slowly, appropriated in the ordeal that began with the renunciation of everything." [...] Would Paul have become a Christian if he knew what was in store for him? Each single individual has a future and there <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> a decision is made that can have long-lasting effects. Paul wrote about his own experiences in his epistles and Kierkegaard thought this was a legitimate way to preach about Christianity. But he stressed indirect communication.|$|E
