In <b>Coulomb</b> <b>excitation</b> reactions, the inelastic scattering of the projectile transfers {{energy to the}} partner nucleus (and vice-versa) through a time-dependent electromagnetic field. At energies well below the Coulomb barrier, the particles interact solely through the well known electromagnetic interaction, thereby excluding nuclear excitations from the process.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>Coulomb</b> <b>excitation</b> and β decay offers very practical advantages {{in the study}} of nuclear shapes and collectivity.
