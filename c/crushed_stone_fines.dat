40|$|With {{a view to}} {{implement}} sustainability concepts (namely, use of locally available materials and industrial by-products) in the concrete construction industry, the possibility of use of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> <b>fine</b> aggregate as replacement to river sand is explored in this paper. Towards this, tests {{have been carried out}} on concrete cubes and concrete cylinders. The effect of variation in percentage replacement of river sand with <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> <b>fine</b> aggregate on the mechanical properties is studied. In order to popularize the locally available material for the construction of shear critical concrete structures (viz. flat slabs, foundation of heavy structures), the Mode - II fracture behavior of the considered concrete is studied using DCN (Double Central Notched) specimens with different notch to depth, (a/w), ratios of 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6. For each (a/w) ratio five different percentage replacements (viz. 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %) are considered. The study indicates that both cube compressive strength and split tensile strength increases with the increase in percentage replacement up to 50 % and then gradually decreases. A similar observation was made with respect to the Mode - II fracture energy also. It is noted that the strengths of concrete even with 100 % replacement are higher than the concrete with 0 % replacement suggesting that the locally available <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> <b>fine</b> aggregate can be considered {{as an alternative to the}} river sand...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the Republic of Belarus {{the roads}} {{with a high}} {{intensity}} of transport most widely employ expansion joints with rubber and steel compensators fastened to the reinforced concrete base with embedded therein studs. While operated expansion joints are exposed to various kinds of operational and climatic impacts causing their damage. Expansion joints destruction results in {{a sharp increase in}} dynamic effects of transport on the structural elements of a bridge with the pavement most affected {{in the area of the}} junction. Since the greatest stresses occur in the area of the expansion joints fastened to the concrete base leading to its destruction it is suggested using high-strength concrete able to receive elastically the dynamic loading. In this case the content of joints comes down to a timely tightening of nuts and their sealing. The article deals with obtaining high-strength concrete with activated <b>crushed</b> <b>stone,</b> <b>fine</b> fillers and fibers for expansion joints base.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{brought by}} Furnace Bottom Ash (FBA) incorporation on {{the properties of}} lightweight aggregate concrete was studied systematically. In total, six mixtures of concrete targeted at a 28 d compressive strength of 30 MPa were designed, including one control mix made with all normal weight aggregates and at a water/cement ratio (w/c) of 0. 6, and another five lightweight aggregate concrete mixes at a w/c of 0. 39 by using 0, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % FBA replacing natural <b>fine</b> aggregate (<b>crushed</b> <b>fine</b> <b>stone).</b> The testing results of the hardened concrete properties showed that, for the lightweight aggregate concrete using 100 % FBA to replace <b>crushed</b> <b>fine</b> <b>stone,</b> a 28 d oven-dried density of about 1500 kg/m 3 was obtained. The test results showed the lightweight aggregate concrete had lower strength and stiffness compared to the normal aggregate concrete. But {{in terms of the}} effectiveness of strength provided by unit weight of concrete indicated by compressive strength in MPa divided by saturated-surface dried (SSD) density in g/cm 3, fc/D, a satisfactory ratio can be obtained when not more than 50 % FBA was used to replace the <b>crushed</b> <b>fine</b> <b>stone.</b> The durability property indicated by the chloride ion penetration test shows the lightweight aggregate concrete with FBA had high chloride ion penetrability. The heat insulation property (thermal conductivity K-value) test demonstrated that by using the porous lightweight aggregate, the thermal conductivity could be lowered to around 70 % of the control. When more FBA was used to replace <b>crushed</b> <b>fine</b> <b>stone,</b> the thermal conductivity value could be further reduced. The results of this study demonstrated it is feasible to produce lightweight aggregate concrete with high volume of FBA incorporation for building insulation uses.

40|$|Low grade {{recycled}} aggregates {{obtained from a}} construction waste sorting facility were tested to assess the feasibility of using these {{in the production of}} concrete blocks. The characteristics of the sorted construction waste are significantly different from that of crushed concrete rubbles that are mostly derived from demolition waste streams. This is due to the presence of higher percentages of non-concrete components (e. g. > 10 % soil, brick, tiles etc.) in the sorted construction waste. In the study reported in this paper, three series of concrete block mixtures were prepared by using the low grade {{recycled aggregates}} to replace (i) natural coarse granite (10 mm), and (ii) 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % replacement levels of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> <b>fine</b> (<b>crushed</b> natural granite < 5 mm) in the concrete blocks. Test results on properties such as density, compressive strength, transverse strength and drying shrinkage as well as strength reduction after exposure to 800 °C are presented below. The results show that the soil content in the recycled fine aggregate was an important factor in affecting the properties of the blocks produced and the mechanical strength deceased with increasing low grade recycled fine aggregate content. But the higher soil content in the recycled aggregates reduced the reduction of compressive strength of the blocks after exposure to high temperature due probably to the formation of a new crystalline phase. The results show that the low grade recycled aggregates obtained from the construction waste sorting facility has potential to be used as aggregates for making non-structural pre-cast concrete blocks.

Cement mortars were prepared using fine aggregates obtained from six different sources. The influence of aggregate type on X-ray shielding properties was studied. The results showed that mortars prepared with barite and lead-laden recycled cathode ray tube funnel glass provided better shielding properties than mortars prepared with natural sand, natural <b>crushed</b> <b>fine</b> <b>stone</b> or <b>crushed</b> beverage glass. This is attributed to the use of dense aggregates being able to interact with X-ray radiation, thus reducing the depth of penetration.

40|$|Using {{sea sand}} and <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> is the {{distinctive}} feature of concrete in Okinawa Prefecture. The characteristics of such concrete has already published in many papers by the auther and others. There {{are two kinds}} of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> used in Okinawa Island. One is hard and called "Motobu" <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and has large density and small specific water content. So the static and dynamic Young's maduli of the concrete which uses Motobu <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> are much larger than ones which described in the specifications of AIJ and JSCE in the practical range of compressive strength between 150 and 400 kg/cm². The other is relatively soft and called Ryukyu lime <b>stone</b> <b>crushed</b> <b>stone.</b> The concrete using the relatively soft <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> has smaller Young's moduli than the concrete with Motobu <b>crushed</b> <b>stone,</b> but still lightly larger than specified values in the AIJ specification. There are many factors which affect the values of the Young's maduli of concrete. In this study, compressive strength and unit weight of concrete are the most affecting factors. Formulae for both static and dynamic Young's moduli are presented by using the method of the least square. The formulae are described in terms of compressive strength and unit weight of concrete. The increasing pattern of compressing strength of the concrete using hard <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> as the time passes is almost the same as described in common technical books. The rate of increase of Young's moduli as the time passes is much slower than ones of compressive strength. The concrete using larger maximum size <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> exhibits much larger Young's moduli than the concrete with small maximum size.

50|$|Transportation is a {{major factor}} in the {{delivered}} price of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone.</b> The cost of moving <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> from the plant to the market often equals or exceeds the sale price of the product at the plant. Because of the high cost of transportation and the large quantities of bulk material that have to be shipped, <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> is usually marketed locally. The high cost of transportation is responsible for the wide dispersion of quarries, usually located near highly populated areas. However, increasing land values combined with local environmental concerns are moving <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> quarries farther from the end-use locations, increasing the price of delivered material.

Two methods were used to design the concrete mixes: (i) fixed water-cement ratio (W/C) and (ii) fixed slump ranges. The investigation included testing of compressive strength, drying shrinkage and resistance to chloride-ion penetration of the concretes. The test results showed that, at fixed water-cement ratios, the compressive strength and the drying shrinkage decreased with the increase in the FBA content. FRA decreased the compressive strength and increased the drying shrinkage of the concrete. However, when designing the concrete mixes with a fixed slump value, at all the test ages, when FBA was used as the fine aggregates to replace natural aggregates, the concrete had higher compressive strength, lower drying shrinkage and higher resistance to the chloride-ion penetration. But the use of FRA led to a reduction in compressive strength but increase in shrinkage values. The results suggest that both FBA and FRA can be used as fine aggregates for concrete production.
