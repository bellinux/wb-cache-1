5|$|Adar is {{predominantly}} inhabited by the Dinka people, who mainly cultivate crops and raise cattle. Many of the Dinka use riverine pastures {{along the east}} bank of the White Nile, but in dry seasons <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> find alternative pasturage along the Khor Adal and Khor Wol and {{on the edges of}} the marshes.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{you open}} your mouth and you don't {{know what you are}} going to say, and {{whatever}} comes out is the starting point. If that happens and you are lucky, it <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be turned into a song. This song is a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it.|$|E

5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{variable in}} number: {{three or more}} small glands, and <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E
5|$|The third type, {{pancreatic}} mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) mainly {{occur in}} women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be successfully removed by surgery.|$|E
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E

5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> {{be dealt with}} effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in a review of}} fossil birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina. Finds included an early Miocene loon Colymboides minutus, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern royal tern Sterna maxima, {{and a member of the}} crow genus, one of the few fossil passerine birds from that period. The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Galaxy is set {{in outer}} space, where Mario travels through {{different}} galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by completing missions, defeating a boss, or reaching a particular area. Each galaxy contains planetoids and orbiting structures for the player to explore. Each astronomical object has its own gravitational force, allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the planetoids, walking sideways or upside down. The player <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in 3D, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2-dimensional plane.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean species Boletus poikilochromus {{somewhat}} resembles I.torosus, but <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> {{be distinguished}} by a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, B.poikilochromus does not feature the colour {{change of the}} stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I.torosus. Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of the former are red and the flesh of latter has a bitter taste.|$|E

5|$|The first {{shooting}} medals {{were struck}} {{in honor of}} the Officers' Shoot held in Langenthal, Bern, in 1822. They <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be distinguished from shooting thalers by their lack of denomination and difference in weight and often composition, though there is evidence that many of thaler-size did circulate amongst the legal tender coins of Switzerland. Shooting medals were minted in a variety of metals, including silver, bronze, goldene and white metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be distinguished by their difference {{in size and}} plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E
5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epsteinâ€“Barr virus.|$|E

5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon <b>can</b> <b>usually</b> be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
