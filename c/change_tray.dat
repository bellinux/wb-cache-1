Parts of this plant can be processed into useful products is Rosella flower petals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effective temperature and tray dryers which are effective for drying petals Rosella using recirculated tray dryer. These experiments used a temperature of 40, 50, and 600 C as well as the location of the variable <b>change</b> <b>tray</b> into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as a place to put Rosella flower petals. In this experiment, the drying rate constant (Constant Drying Rate) is not obtained, the obtained rate is falling rate. From the experimental results show that the greater the temperature, the greater the drying rate, so the time for the drying process is also faster. For the variable tray, Rosella flower petals are placed on tray 4 and 5 dry faster than those placed on the tray 1, 2, and 3...|$|E

These are common on most buses in the United Kingdom now, since they facilitate quick payment and also allow for the driver to have a screen protecting his cab, yet still securely collect <b>change</b> (the <b>tray</b> is placed with a small gap above it to allow room for the drivers hand to pass through).|$|R
5000|$|Six contestants between November 7 and December 29 had {{a chance}} to play for $2,000,000 with the same board seen as the September 2006 premiere week.

Only one contestant, Ashley Otte, would choose this higher top prize; she sold her tray (as for Thanksgiving Day, the cases were <b>changed</b> to <b>trays)</b> for $260,000, and her final hypothetical offer was $1,100,000.|$|R

This allowed the flexibility of an easy transition from above-froth wash water addition to the in-froth addition that might be necessary for high concentrate-grade operations.

40|$|In this report, {{the average}} holding time of gas in foaming layer {{and the number of}} {{transfer}} units based on gas-phase of the Rotational-current tray were considered experimentally. The {{average holding time}} was determined by water-air system. On the other hand, the number of transfer units was determined by water-ammonia-air system that gas-phase resistance controlled. The average holding time increases with gas and liquid velocities, and does not <b>change</b> with the <b>tray</b> dimensions clearly. From the experimental results of the number of transfer units, {{it was found that the}} tray can be operated at high efficiency up to larger gas and liquid flow rates than that of sieve trays...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} novel Retrofit Design Approach based on process simulation and the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Retrofit Design Approach comprises: 1) a diagnosis stage {{in which the}} variables are screened and promising variables to improve system performance are identified through a sensitivity analysis, 2) an evaluation stage in which RSM is applied {{to assess the impact}} of those promising variables and the most important factors are determined by building a reduced model from the process response behaviour, and 3) an optimisation stage to identify optimal conditions and performance of the system, subject to objective function and model constraints. All these stages are simulation-supported. The main advantages of the proposed Retrofit Design Approach using RSM are that the design method is able to handle a large industrial-scale design problem within a reasonable computational effort, to obtain valuable conceptual insights of design interactions and economic trade-off existed in the system, as well as to systematically identify cost-effective solutions by optimizing the reduced model based on the most important factors. This simplifies the pathway to achieve pseudo-optimal solutions, and simultaneously to understand techno-economic and system-wide impacts of key design variables and parameters. In order to demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the proposed design method, the proposed Retrofit Design Approach has been applied to two case studies which are based on existing gas processing processes. Steady-state process simulation using Aspen Plus TM® has been carried out and the simulation results agree well with the plant data. Reduced models for both cases studies have been obtained to represent the techno-economic behaviour of plants. Both the continuous and discrete design options are considered in the retrofitting of the plant, and the results showed that the Retrofit Design Approach is effective to provide reliable, cost-effective retrofit solutions which yield to improvements in the studied processes, not only economically (i. e. cost and product recovery), but also environmentally linked (i. e. CO₂ emissions and energy efficiency). The main retrofitting solutions identified are, for the first case, column pressure change, pump-around arrangement and additional turbo-expansion capacity, while for the second case, columns pressure <b>change,</b> <b>trays</b> efficiency, HEN retrofit arrangements (re-piping) and onsite utility generation schemes are considered. These promising sets of retrofit design options were further investigated to reflect implications of capital investment for the retrofit scenarios, and this portfolio of opportunities can be very useful for supporting decision-making procedure in practice. It is important to note that in some cases a cost-effective retrofit does not always require structural modifications. In conclusion, the proposed Retrofit Design Approach has been found to be a reliable approach to address the retrofit problem in the context of industrial applications.

5000|$|In 1993, the Private Eye {{was used}} in Thad Starner's wearable, based on Doug Platt's system and built from a kit from Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display on loan from Devon Sean McCullough, and the Twiddler chording {{keyboard}} made by Handykey. Many iterations later this system became the MIT [...] "Tin Lizzy" [...] wearable computer design, and Starner {{went on to become}} one of the founders of MIT's wearable computing project. 1993 also saw Columbia University's augmented-reality system known as KARMA (Knowledge-based Augmented Reality for Maintenance Assistance). Users would wear a Private Eye display over one eye, giving an overlay effect when the real world was viewed with both eyes open. KARMA would overlay wireframe schematics and maintenance instructions on top of whatever was being repaired. For example, graphical wireframes on top of a laser printer would explain how to <b>change</b> the paper <b>tray.</b> The system used sensors attached to objects in the physical world to determine their locations, and the entire system ran tethered from a desktop computer.|$|R
5000|$|The earlier {{models of}} the Jameson Cell used orifice plates to {{generate}} the downcomer jet. The new slurry lens design had a smooth, shallow entry angle that created an optimum flow regime over the ceramic, reducing wear and extending its life. The shape resulted in a decrease in power consumption by the feed slurry pump by up to 10% and resulted in better jet formation that improved air entrainment. For coal applications, the wash water addition system was <b>changed</b> from a <b>tray</b> to stainless-steel circular rings attached to a manual lifting system. This allowed the flexibility of an easy transition from above-froth wash water addition to the in-froth addition that might be necessary for high concentrate-grade operations. For metals applications, new design wash water trays consisting of removable rubber mats for easy maintenance were used. [...] The AISE valves were developed to prevent solids being sucked back into the air lines when individual downcomers become blocked. Solids depositing in the air lines and their build {{up in the air}} distributor decreases flotation performance as it prevents air from being efficiently entrained in the downcomers.|$|R
40|$|MARS {{greenhouse}} needs mobile robots with on-board arms, {{that are}} capable of navigating autonomously in the greenhouse, performing tasks such as carrying plant trays, farming, harvesting, plucking fruits and vegetables and so on. An adaptive neural network (NN) is employed for the coordinated motion control of a mobilebase with an on-board arm using Lyapunov’s approach and it is rigorously justified for MARS Greenhouse operation scenario wherein the load weight, due to plant <b>trays,</b> <b>change</b> considerably. A one-layer NN based controller is designed to estimate the unknown dynamics of the mobile base plus robot arm system after the incorporation of non-holonomic constraints. This adaptive NN approach provides an inner loop that accounts for possible motion of the on-board arm, with changing endeffector loads, while the base is carrying out a task. The case of maintaining a desired course and speed or tracking a desired Cartesian trajectory as the on-board arm moves to its desired orientation with an unknown endeffector load is considered. An outer loop is designed to avoid both stationary and moving obstacles. Finally, an additional outer tracking loop is constructed so as to navigate the mobile base with the onboard arm along the path. The net result is a base plus arm motion controller that is capable of achieving a coordinated motion of the base plus arm in the presence of uncertain dynamics, load and the environment. 1...|$|R
