2500|$|In {{printed circuit}} board {{assembly}} individual <b>connector</b> <b>pins</b> are sometimes pressed/swaged into place using an arbor press. [...] Some pins have a hollow end that is pressed over by the arbor's tool to form a mushroom-shaped retaining head. [...] Typical pin diameter range from 0.017 to 0.093 inches or larger. [...] The swaging is an alternative or supplement to soldering.|$|E

50|$|If one has {{specified}} wires {{within a}} cable (for instance, the colored Ethernet cable wires in TIA/EIA-568-B), then {{the order in}} which different color wires are attached to different <b>connector</b> <b>pins</b> defines the wiring scheme. Different ways of wiring numbered <b>connector</b> <b>pins</b> at the two ends of a cable creates different assemblies, which may appear identical but behave differently. The cross-reference between the contacts, or pins, of an electrical connector, and their functions is called pinout. There are many different pinouts for various connectors exists.|$|E
50|$|Pin headers {{are often}} {{associated}} with ribbon cable <b>connectors,</b> <b>pin</b> headers often also function as recipients for jumpers. The most common jumper spacing is 2.54 mm, though 2.0 mm is sometimes used in smaller products.|$|R
5000|$|Different {{manufacturers}} of 8P8C modular jacks arrange for the pins of the 8P8C modular connector jack {{to be linked}} to wire connectors (often IDC type terminals) that are in a different physical arrangement from that of other manufacturers: Thus, for example, if a technician is in the habit of connecting the white/orange wire to the [...] "bottom right hand" [...] IDC terminal, which links it to 8P8C modular <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> 1, in jacks made by other manufacturers this terminal may instead connect to 8P8C modular <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> 2 (or any other pin). Labels and manufacturer's documentation should be consulted whenever an unfamiliar connector is first encountered.|$|R
40|$|Soldering device, {{essentially}} modified spot welder, melts high-melting-temperature solders {{without damaging}} plastic insulation on flat electrical cables.

50|$|A {{general rule}} is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the {{provided}} clock (external clocking). D-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment. DTE devices usually transmit on <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 2 and receive on <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 3. DCE devices are just the opposite: <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 2 receives and <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 3 transmits the signals.|$|R
50|$|The {{definitions}} of the two ends of the link are asymmetric. This makes the assignment {{of the role of}} a newly developed device problematic; the designer must decide on either a DTE-like or DCE-like interface and which <b>connector</b> <b>pin</b> assignments to use.|$|R
50|$|The DDECIII ECM was {{thinner than}} the DDECII ECM, and had wiring {{connectors}} at both ends. The front end had two five <b>pin</b> <b>connectors</b> for the injectors, and a thirty <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> for the engine sensors. The rear end had a five <b>pin</b> Power <b>Connector,</b> six <b>pin</b> Communications <b>Connector,</b> and a thirty pin Vehicle Interface Harness Connector.|$|R
