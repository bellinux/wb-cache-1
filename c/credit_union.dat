The focus on growth and the desire on the part of <b>credit</b> <b>unions</b> to be treated like banks for regulatory purposes may compromise the ability of <b>credit</b> <b>unions</b> to contribute meaningfully to financial inclusion in Australia, with the exception of small, community-based <b>credit</b> <b>unions.</b> Those <b>credit</b> <b>unions</b> do {{have a role to}} play, but will need to be granted appropriate regulatory exemptions to enable them to both start up and continue to operate as mutual organisations, focused on providing services to their members rather than generating profits.
