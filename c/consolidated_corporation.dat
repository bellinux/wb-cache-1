5000|$|This new {{corporation}} did {{not come}} into existence until May 4, 1874. It came into existence as a corporation of the State of Arkansas in pursuance of its Constitution and laws, and subject in all respects to their restrictions and limitations. Among these was that one (Art. 5, sec. 48, of the Constitution of 1868) which declared that [...] "The property of corporations, now existing or hereafter created, shall forever be subject to taxation, the same as property of individuals." [...] This rendered it impossible in law for the <b>consolidated</b> <b>corporation</b> to receive by transfer from the Cairo and Fulton Railroad Company, or otherwise, the exemption sought to be enforced in this suit. The case is thus brought within the rule declared and applied in Louisville &c. Railroad Co. v. Palmes, 109 U. S. 244.|$|E
