40|$|In Asia, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is {{established}} generally by seedling transplanting in puddled soil. Generally, lands are prepared by 3 - 4 ploughing and <b>cross</b> <b>ploughing</b> operations followed by levelling in standing water. This traditional method is costly {{in terms of}} labour, fuel, time and irrigation water, and is detrimental to soil health (Islam et al., 2014). Adoption of non-puddled transplanting {{may be a good}} alternative to soil puddling which has potential to achieve savings in labour, energy, water and time during rice establishment (Islam et al., 2012). Retaining previous crop residues maintains soil microbial activity which can also lead to weed suppression by the biological agents leading to increases in crop yield (Kennedy, 1999). Considerable research work has been done on puddled transplanting, but there is a limited information on the effect of crop residue retention level on the performance of non-puddled transplanting of rice...|$|E

60|$|This {{last word}} {{does not suggest}} to a dweller in the {{wilderness}} that <b>crossing</b> of <b>ploughed</b> lands on horseback, and leaping of hedges, etcetera, which it conveys to the mind of an Englishman. The Cree chief's notion of spring-hunting was, getting into a birch-bark canoe, {{with or without a}} comrade, and going forth on the lakes and rivers of the wilderness with plenty of powder and shot, to visit the native home of the wild-goose, the wild-duck, the pelican, the plover, and the swan.|$|R

2500|$|The Order {{consisted}} of a white-enamelled badge, which had a golden Hammer and Sickle badge surrounded by two golden panicles of wheat on a Red Star, backed by <b>crossed</b> hammer, <b>plough,</b> torch, and a red flag bearing the motto Proletarians (Workers) of the World, Unite!. The whole was surrounded by two golden panicles of wheat; at the bottom were the letters [...] "SSSR" [...] (...) [...] Additional awards of the Order bore a white enamelled shield with a silver sequence number {{at the bottom of}} the obverse. [...] A recipient of multiple Orders of the Red Banner would wear a basic badge of the Order followed by the second award bearing a number [...] "2," [...] the third award bearing a number [...] "3," [...] etc.|$|R

At East Toft in North Yorkshire, 0.4 km of the dyke's length has completely vanished due to <b>ploughing.</b> <b>Cross</b> dykes situated on moorland often remain as notable earthworks, for example at Danby Rigg, also in North Yorkshire.|$|R

Much cider is made and drank; and in old times they got their wine from France in exchange for wax and honey, as they were famous bee-keepers. Great fields of buck-wheat still afford food for the 'yellow-breeched philosophers,' and in many cottage gardens a row of queerly shaped hives stand in sunny nooks.|$|R

How did those mile furrows come there, and who drove the road that takes the wheat out through the granite of the Superior shore? It is more than their appetites that impelled those men, my dear. Still, it is {{scarcely}} wise to expect too much when one meets them, for though one could feel it is presumptuous to forgive its deficiencies, the Berserk type of manhood is not conspicuous for its refinement." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, earthworms {{are often}} observed to burrow through compacted soil layers, {{leading to the}} general assumption that these animals {{play a significant role}} in regenerating compacted soils in agricultural plots. To demonstrate this role under field conditions, the abundance of earthworm macropores inside compacted zones was estimated on plots under reduced (RT) or conventional tillage (CT). Then, different types of compacted zones typically found in CT (plough pan and compacted clods) and RT plots (compacted volume under wheel tracks) were experimentally simulated in wooden boxes, buried in the field and inoculated with different earthworm species. After 6 weeks of incubation, the number of macropores inside the compacted zones was examined. Field observations showed that approximately 10 % and 30 % of the compacted zones were colonised by at least one macropore in CT and RT plots, respectively. A significantly greater number of anecics was found in RT plots, but we could not conclude that this ecological type of earthworm plays a more major role in the regeneration process in these plots since there were fewer compacted zones and these covered a smaller area in CT. The semi-field experiment provided evidence that earthworm-mediated regeneration of compacted zones is possible and its nature varies between ecological types of earthworm. Lumbricus terrestris, which makes individual burrows that are vertical and deep, was the main species to <b>cross</b> through the <b>plough</b> pan. The other three earthworm species (Aporrectodea giardi, A. caliginosa and A. rosea) did burrow inside the other types of compacted zones (“wheel tracks” and “compacted clods”). In every case, however, macropore density was far greater in non-compacted zones, illustrating that avoidance of compacted soil by earthworms is important and should be taken into account when extrapolating results from laboratory studies...|$|R
