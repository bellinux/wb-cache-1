5000|$|A valediction (derivation from Latin vale dicere, [...] "to say farewell"), or <b>complimentary</b> <b>close</b> in American English, is an {{expression}} used to say farewell, especially a word or phrase used to end a letter or message, or the act of saying parting words whether brief or extensive.|$|E

5000|$|A salutation is a {{greeting}} {{used in a}} letter or other written or non-written communication. Salutations can be formal or informal. The {{most common form of}} salutation in an English letter is [...] followed by the recipient's given name or title. For each style of salutation there is an accompanying style of <b>complimentary</b> <b>close,</b> known as valediction. Examples of non-written salutations are bowing (common in Japan) or even addressing somebody by their name. A salutation can be interpreted as a form of a signal in which the receiver of the salutation is being acknowledged, respected or thanked.Another simple but very common example of a salutation is a military salute. By saluting another rank, that person is signalling or showing his or her acknowledgment of the importance or significance of that person and his or her rank. Some greetings are considered vulgar, others [...] "rude" [...] and others [...] "polite".|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Polytechnic Kuching Sarawak. The {{theoretical}} framework used in the study was adapted from earlier work by Swales (1990, 1991), Bhatia (1993) and Halliday (1994). The research analyzed the chosen genre (job application letters) from two possible angles; the linguistic features and the rhetorical features analysis. The linguistic features analysis focused on the politeness strategies that appeared in the mini-corpus. Under this analysis, the research focused on four elements that reflect politeness in a job application letter, namely; the salutation, the positive and negative politeness strategies and the <b>complimentary</b> <b>close.</b> The rhetorical features analysis, on the other hand, focused on the rhetorical moves and the rhetorical move sequences that appeared in the mini-corpus. The materials used in the research were letters of application produced by the students. 166 students were selected based on convenient sampling; therefore, the mini-corpus consisted of 166 letters produced by the students. The findings revealed interesting information within the scope of the research. Firstly, under the linguistic analysis, the results indicate although a significant number of students employed linguistic features such as salutation, and <b>complimentary</b> <b>close,</b> there are instances where they are used inappropriately. In addition, the students also included different rhetorical moves in their letters to enable them to achieve the communicative purpose of the letter. The results from the rhetorical features analysis indicate that there are eleven moves that appear in the mini-corpus. Moreover, results of the analysis indicate that even though the sequence of moves may differ from one job applicant to another, in general, there are certain moves patterns that are commonly shared by the students. It {{is important to note that}} genre analysis is not meant to replace other approaches but instead complement them by providing an alternative way in teaching and learning. It is hoped that teachers/lecturers, students, educators and anyone who has interest in the education field may benefit from reading this thesis...|$|E

The study was designed (1) to determine the types of errors found in Nepali government and non-government letters and to compare between the 1975 and 1980 samples, and (2) to identify frequently used Nepali letter styles and formats. The sample consisted of 242 letters collected in 1975 and 204 letters collected in 1980. All letters were assessed by the same evaluator by using a Nepali Letter Evaluation Instrument, which was validated by a jury of judges. The reliability of the instrument was tested by evaluating the same 20 letters at two different time intervals. Twenty-four separate error categories classified as content, language, and mechanics were identified. Statistical comparisons were made assessing errors in each of 24 separate error categories between the 1975 and 1980 samples. Errors occurring in correspondence from different types of organizations were also compared. Eleven null hypotheses were tested by using Chi-square statistics and Fisher's Exact Test. Descriptive data concerning letter styles, formats, and stationery sizes were also evaluated. Based on the findings of the study, the following conclusions were made: (1) The quality of Nepali letters written in 1980 was approximately the same as the quality of those written in 1975. Of the 24 error categories compared, spelling and margin usages in 1980 improved, punctuation usages deteriorated, and the other 21 categories remained the same. (2) Within various type of organizations, letter writers in 1980 made about the same number of errors in their out-going letters as in 1975. Over 85 percent of the error categories remained unchanged. Fewer margin and spacing errors occurred. Punctuation usages deteriorated. Strikeovers and handwritten corrections occurred less frequently in letters from some types of organizations, but deteriorated in letters from other types of organizations. (3) When usage was compared between organizations, error categories differed in more categories than when it was compared within organizations. Some types of errors occurred more frequently in selected organizations. Letter writers from governmental agencies made more errors in their letter writing than writers from other organizations. Letter writers from semi-government corporations committed the next most frequent number of errors. (4) The ten most frequently occurring errors found in Nepali letters collected in 1975 and 1980 were margin errors, spelling errors, very long sentences, strikeovers, inappropriate words, stereotyped language, too many connectives, errors crossed out, and incorrect word-divisions. (5) Compared to content errors, language errors and mechanical errors occurred more frequently. (6) The typical and most frequently used letter style was the simplified style with salutation and <b>complimentary</b> <b>closing</b> omitted. This style also placed the writer's identification either {{in the middle of the}} paper or on the right hand side. Governmental agencies were the largest users of the Simplified letter style. (7) Salutations and complimentary closings were used by writers from banks, other non-profit organizations, and private businesses. The trend in 1980 was toward using salutations and complimentary closings. (8) Letter placement and margins suggested by Nepali typewriting textbooks were not followed by a majority of the Nepali letter writers. Left and right margins were too small and bottom margins were too wide. (9) The sizes of the stationery were widely diversified. The letter placement appeared awkward because of variations in paper size. Recommendations of this study, if implemented, should strengthen training programs for office personnel in Nepal...|$|R
