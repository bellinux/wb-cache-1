30|$|However, in this case, other {{themes of}} the INSPIRE {{seem to be very}} much related with the LADM. For example Addresses is {{considered}} an External class in LADM (Greek country profile) and it is expected that there exists a detailed model (data specification) and registration to which can be referred, that is the case of the Greek INSPIRE implementation of addresses. Within an SDI setting, the various registrations can refer to each other. This is also true for buildings and administrative units. For example, in the INSPIRE themes, the municipalities are considered part of the Administrative Units theme and therefore they are not repeated in the <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Zoning.</b> It is expected that the related datasets are harmonised with each other.|$|E
30|$|The {{application}} schema of {{cadastral parcels}} {{consists of four}} entities. The core –and always available– entity of the cadastral parcels schema is the Cadastral Parcel. The other three entities are <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Zoning</b> (the intermediary areas used to divide the national territory into cadastral parcels), Cadastral Boundary (part of {{the outline of a}} cadastral parcel) and Basic Property Unit (the basic unit of properties which may consist of one or more parcels), and are to be provided under certain circumstances. Each entity consists of three kinds of attributes: the obligatory, the voidable and the information about time (also voidable). The voidable characteristics in the INSPIRE context are ‘those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial datasets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world’.|$|E

Fault traces with associated Fault Avoidance Zones have been mapped to produce corridors surrounding the active fault traces at a scale suitable {{for the purposes of}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>zoning,</b> i. e. c. 1 : 5000. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} the urban areas of Otane, Waipawa and Waipukurau. Mapping of the Fault Avoidance Zones has been undertaken using a Geographic Information System (GIS) in conjunction with rectified aerial photographs, ortho-photographs and LiDAR imagery. Each of these media have a level of uncertainty for mapping. We found that a 5 -m pixel Shaded Relief LiDAR image produced particularly accurate micro-topography of the mapping areas, allowing us to map fault features to a level of accuracy not possible with the other more traditional methods...|$|E

This thesis {{describes}} {{research and}} development work which led to algorithms, procedures and computer programs which facilitate the cost effective and accurate capture of geometric data. The geometric data for a Geographical Information System (GIS) at a local authority or municipality consist {{of a number of}} different data sets. These include inter alia: the <b>cadastral</b> information, <b>zoning</b> information, servitudes, building lines, the outlines of improvements and the reticulation networks and the house connection points of the engineering services. The initial capture of the geometric data appears to be deceptively simple and is often not given the required consideration. The initial data capture phase of GIS projects is usually a difficult and time consuming process. This is even more so in the case of GIS for local authorities. The reason for this difficulty is the large volume of data coupled with the high accuracies required for the cadastral base map and the engineering services. Input facilities of most commercial GIS software packages generally do not provide the most efficient means of data capture. This problem warrants the development of techniques and procedures specific to local authority GIS applications which ensure that data capture can be done effectively and efficiently. The major benefit of these procedures is that they can be implemented on personal computers with low random access memory capacity. This eliminates the need for investment in costly equipment at the initial stage of data capture {{in the development of a}} GIS. It allows the capture of data on low cost technology and the postponement of the purchase of an expensive system or workstation until the data capture phase has been completed. The lowest personnel skills required are copy typing in contrast to the traditional methods of using CAD operators who command higher salaries and require more expensive training. The system developed by the author is more productive, both in quality and volume of work produced, than the CAD approach. It also permits the delay of purchase and training on expensive GIS software and hardware, which may be obsolete by the time the graphic database is established...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how Tagbanua responses {{to changes in}} conservation approaches have shaped forest access and use {{in relation to the}} political economy of a buffer zone village on Palawan Island, the Philippines. A recent shift from "fences and fines" to "devolved" conservation at Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Cabayugan has been lauded in government and non-governmental circles to support Tagbanua livelihoods while preserving the rain forest. Concurrently, however, the Tagbanua have adjusted to migrants dispossessing them of land, controlling the trade in forest products, and the means of agricultural production. Given that conservation and local resource access and use now intersect, this study asks whether "community-based" conservation can fulfill its own objectives while addressing older disparities in social relations of production and exchange. A history of national park and <b>cadastral</b> <b>zoning</b> has restricted Tagbanua access to forest resources while supporting settler migration onto public lands. The two-way process of park zoning and migrant control over trade and productive resources has become interrelated and shaped the evolution of conservation in Cabayugan from 1971 - 2001. Although older "fences and fines" criminalized traditional resource uses, such as swidden (kaingin), and supported state interests in expanding paddy rice cultivation (basakan), newer community-based approaches have carried on this agenda. Going against its purported benefits, such conservation has supported the livelihoods of dominant households, both politically and economically. Over time, these households have used political economic opportunities to build on and influence how projects support their livelihoods, which has exacerbated socio-economic differences between both social groups. As a result, conservation practitioners have continued to tie into and support wealthier households' production, while fulfilling the state's agenda of curbing swidden. Confined to unequal trade and restrictions over swidden, Tagbanua livelihoods remain vulnerable and have difficulty sustaining paddy rice. With few options to reinvest, they fail to access those socio-political and economic networks that enable participation in projects that support more lucrative cultivation. Despite good intentions, current attempts by state practitioners and non-governmental organizations at livelihood development for conservation have proven to be more divisive than effective...|$|E
