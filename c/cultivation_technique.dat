40|$|Vegetable {{production}} in sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous agronomic constraints {{that will have}} to be overcome to feed the increasing population and to fight malnutrition. Technology transfer and the adoption of low-tech protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> affordable for smallholders are believed to be able to meet this challenge. Protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> are a set of agricultural practices aimed at artificializing the crop environment through the use of soil covers and/or plant covers to control pests and climatic conditions. Although protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> may increase the yield and quality of vegetable crops and extend their production periods worldwide, the transfer of these techniques in sub-Saharan Africa raises questions about their agronomical performances, their profitability but also their environmental impacts. Are low-tech protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> adapted to the sustainable production of vegetables by smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa? To answer this question, we present an overview of the agronomic, economic, and environmental performances of low-tech protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> in sub-Saharan Africa as reported in the literature. The major conclusions that can be drawn from the review are (1) low-tech protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> are not suitable in all climatic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa and need to be combined with other methods to ensure adequate pest control, (2) the profitability of protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> relies on the capacity to offset increased production costs by higher yields and higher selling prices to be obtained with off-season and/or higher quality products, (3) breaking with existing cropping systems, the lack of technical support and skills, and the limited access to investment funding are major obstacles to the adoption of protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> by smallholders (4) life cycle assessments conducted in northern countries suggested that more efficient use of agricultural inputs would offset the negative impacts of protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> if they are properly managed, but further studies are required to be sure these results can be extrapolated to sub-Saharan Africa context.

50|$|White tea, {{like black}} and green tea, {{is made from}} the Camellia sinensis plant and {{contains}} polyphenols, a set of phytonutrients that {{are thought to be}} responsible for the health effects of tea.

50|$|Cultivated {{varieties}} were barley, {{which is}} the oldest cultivated grain, followed by rye and oat; all used for porridge and baking. When grain was scarce, people used {{many different types of}} tree bark such as birch and pine as a substitute to make bark bread. Around the 10th century, wheat became a more commonly used cultivated grain, but it did not overtake rye or oats. In the Early Middle Ages, the most commonly used <b>cultivation</b> <b>technique</b> was three-shift cultivation. This type of cultivation method involved using one third of the field for autumn grain (especially rye), one third for spring grain and the rest for fallow. This approach enabled good harvests and provided good pasture for cattle. The method also guaranteed crucial grain supplies for bread flour.|$|E

25|$|Bonsai can {{be created}} from nearly any {{perennial}} woody-stemmed tree or shrub species which produces true branches and remains small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai. Bonsai <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> are different from other tree <b>cultivation</b> <b>techniques</b> in allowing mature (though miniature) trees to grow in small containers, to survive with extremely restricted root and canopy structures, and to support comprehensive, repeated styling manipulations.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the third}} method the spat or seed {{are placed in}} a cultch within an {{artificial}} maturation tank. The maturation tank may be fed with water that has been especially prepared {{for the purpose of}} accelerating the growth rate of the oysters. In particular the temperature and salinity of the water may be altered somewhat from nearby ocean water. The carbonate minerals calcite and aragonite in the water may help oysters develop their shells faster and may also be included in the water processing prior to introduction to the tanks. This latter <b>cultivation</b> <b>technique</b> may be the least susceptible to predators and poaching, but is the most expensive to build and to operate. [...] The Pacific oyster C. gigas is the species most commonly used with this type of farming.|$|E
50|$|Compared with European, North American and Asian soils many sub-Saharan African {{soils are}} low in natural fertility, being poor in nutrients, low in organic matter and liable to erosion. The best <b>cultivation</b> <b>technique</b> for such soils {{involves}} 10 to 15 years of fallow between 2 or 3 years of cultivation, the system of shifting cultivation and fallowing that was common in Nyasaland {{as long as there}} was sufficient land to practice it. As more intensive agricultural use began in the 1930s, the amounts and duration of fallow were progressively reduced in more populous areas, which placed soil fertility under gradually increasing pressure. The Department of Agriculture's prediction that soil fertility would decline at a rapid rate is contradicted by recent research. This showed that the majority of soils in Malawi were adequate for smallholders to produce maize. Most have sufficient (if barely so) organic material and nutrients, although their low nitrogen and phosphorus favours the use of chemical fertilisers and manure.|$|E
50|$|The Microcosmic Orbit (小周天), {{also known}} as the Self Winding Wheel of the Law and the {{circulation}} of light is a Taoist Qigong or Taoist yoga Qi energy <b>cultivation</b> <b>technique.</b> It involves deep breathing exercises in conjunction with meditation and concentration techniques which develop the flow of qi along certain pathways of energy in the human body which may be familiar to those who are studying Traditional Chinese Medicine, Qigong, Tai chi chuan, Neidan and Taoist alchemy. The exercise can be performed usually at first in a sitting position, {{but it can also be}} practiced standing as in Zhan zhuang or with movements included as with Tai chi chuan. The clear understanding of the microcosmic orbit technique is very important not only because of its historical context in the story of Chinese alchemy but because it is at the heart of many Taoist forms of exercise performed throughout the world by many millions of people today.|$|E

5000|$|Historically the Kingdom of Tonga {{has been}} {{centered}} on cultivation and farming. Early explorers recorded accounts speak of beautiful gardens planted symmetrically and carefully cared for. Today much of Tonga, especially in remote {{rural areas and}} scattered on the many islands of Tonga, still rely on cultivation for livelihood. This <b>cultivation</b> <b>technique</b> historically and presently has revolved around the importance of women and their responsibility {{for much of the}} labor burden associated with it. [...] Tongan women's physical participation includes growing and marketing the agriculture produce. Although women have been pivotal in the cultivation and use of land, women still today, under the constitution of The Kingdom of Tonga cannot own land. If a woman in Tonga wishes to use land for any purpose, including for cultivation, they cannot buy land but must only lease land for its temporary use. One benefit to women in Tonga is that they cannot own land and therefore do not have to pay property taxes (this argument has been used in some writings as pro-women).|$|E
