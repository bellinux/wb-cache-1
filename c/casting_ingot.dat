The resultsfrom the balances give {{an overview of the}} waste heat sources and their total energy content, togetherwith the temperatures at which they are available. The total energy in the waste heatsources for PFA 2 was found to be 17. 8 GWh/year. The largest waste heat sources were localisedin connection to the cooling agent of the <b>casting</b> <b>ingot</b> machine. Here disappears 12. 32 GWh/year through cooling water within a temperature range of 10 to 30 &# 176;C as well as convectionand radiation to surrounding.

Furthermore the initialisation of liquid aluminiumalloy was revealed as a waste heat source with 5. 48 GWh/year. Here disappears 3. 34 GWh/year through the flue gas of the furnace within a temperature range of 288 to 1, 100 &# 176;C andcreates the most promising heat recovery potential at the furnace. The energy saving potential is divided into three groups: energy saving by existing equipment,optimising of equipment and waste heat recovery. Here energy saving by existing equipmentreveals 26. 4 MWh/year for an improved control quality of the melt temperature. The greatestpotential for energy saving by optimisation of the equipment was found to be 1. 98 GWh/year forthe implementation of regenerative burner. Furthermore effects an installation of a furnace pressurecontrol system 689. 14 MWh/year less energy consumption due to the avoided false air. Thegreatest energy saving potential for waste heat recovery was estimated to 1. 65 GWh/year for thepreheating of charged metals to 300 &# 176;C, instead of 20 &# 176;C. The preheating also leads to improvedsafety, because of the elimination of moist metal in the furnaces, and increases the process production,as a consequence of larger melt capacity. Furthermore, heat to power solutions revealedthe use of favourable electricity production by the generation of waste heat. Here the greatestgeneration potential was found to be in the flue gas from the furnace. A common Rankine cycle,with a direct heat recovery design and water as working fluid, was estimated with a recoverypotential of 1. 1 GWh/year. With the use of an organic Rankine cycle the potential can be recoveredto 489. 8 MWh/year for an indirect heat recovery design and pentane as working fluid.

40|$|Approximately 68 % of the {{aluminum}} {{produced in the}} United States is first cast into ingots prior to further processing into sheet, plate, extrusions, or foil. The direct chill (DC) semi-continuous casting process has been the mainstay of {{the aluminum}} industry {{for the production of}} ingots due largely to its robust nature and relative simplicity. Though the basic process of DC casting is in principle straightforward, the interaction of process parameters with heat extraction, microstructural evolution, and development of solidification stresses is too complex to analyze by intuition or practical experience. One issue in DC casting is the formation of stress cracks [1 - 15]. In particular, the move toward larger ingot cross-sections, the use of higher casting speeds, and an ever-increasing array of mold technologies have increased industry efficiencies but have made it more difficult to predict the occurrence of stress crack defects. The Aluminum Industry Technology Roadmap [16] has recognized the challenges inherent in the DC casting process and the control of stress cracks and selected the development of 'fundamental information on solidification of alloys to predict microstructure, surface properties, and stresses and strains' as a high-priority research need, and the 'lack of understanding of mechanisms of cracking as a function of alloy' and 'insufficient understanding of the aluminum solidification process', which is 'difficult to model', as technology barriers in aluminum casting processes. The goal of this Aluminum Industry of the Future (IOF) project was to assist the aluminum industry in reducing the incidence of stress cracks from the current level of 5 % to 2 %. Decreasing stress crack incidence is important for improving product quality and consistency as well as for saving resources and energy, since considerable amounts of cast metal could be saved by eliminating ingot cracking, by reducing the scalping thickness of the ingot before rolling, and by eliminating butt sawing. Full-scale industrial implementation {{of the results of the}} proposed research would lead to energy savings in excess of 6 trillion Btu by the year 2020. The research undertaken in this project aimed to achieve this objective by a collaboration of industry, university, and national laboratory personnel through Secat, Inc., a consortium of aluminum companies. During the four-year project, the industrial partners and the research team met in 16 quarterly meetings to discuss research results and research direction. The industrial partners provided guidance, facilities, and experience to the research team. The research team went to two industrial plants to measure temperature distributions in commercial 60, 000 -lb DC <b>casting</b> <b>ingot</b> production. The project focused on the development of a fundamental understanding of ingot cracking and detailed models of thermal conditions, solidification, microstructural evolution, and stress development during the initial transient in DC castings of the aluminum alloys 3004 and 5182. The microstructure of the DC casting ingots was systematically characterized. Carefully designed experiments were carried out at the national laboratory and university facilities as well as at the industrial locations using the industrial production facilities. The advanced computational capabilities of the national laboratories were used for thermodynamic and kinetic simulations of phase transformation, heat transfer and fluid flow, solidification, and stress-strain evolution during DC casting. The achievements of the project are the following: (1) Identified the nature of crack formation during DC casting; (2) Developed a novel method for determining the mechanical properties of an alloy at the nonequilibrium mushy zone of the alloy; (3) Measured heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) between the solidifying ingot and the cooling water jet; (4) Determined the material constitutive model at high temperatures; and (5) Developed computational capabilities for the simulation of cracking formation in DC <b>casting</b> <b>ingot.</b> The models and the database developed in this project have been used to predict crack formation and to determine the optimal conditions for DC casting.

40|$|A {{successful}} four-year {{project on}} the modeling and optimization of direct chill (DC) casting to reduce ingot cracking has been completed. The project involved close collaboration among private industries, national laboratories, and universities. During the four-year project, 16 quarterly meetings brought the industrial partners and the research team together for discussion of research results and research direction. The industrial partners provided guidance, facilities, and experience to the research team. The research team went to two industrial plants to measure temperature distributions in commercial 60, 000 -lb DC <b>casting</b> <b>ingot.</b> The collaborative research resulted in several major accomplishments or findings: (1) Surface cracks were {{shown to be a}} result of hot tearing rather than cold cracks, as was thought before this project. These cracks form on the surface of a DC cast ingot just above the impingement point of the secondary cooling water jets. The cracks form along dendrite and grain boundaries, where solute and impurity elements are highly segregated. This understanding {{led to the development of}} a new technique for determining the mechanical properties in the nonequilibrium mushy zone of alloys and to thermodynamic predictions of the hot tearing propensity of DC cast ingots. (2) The apparent heat transfer coefficient (HTC) at the ingot surface in the water cooling region during DC casting was determined on the basis of temperature measurements in commercial DC casting ingots and an inverse heat transfer analysis. HTCs were calculated as a function of temperature and time, and covered the different regimes of heat transfer expected during DC casting. The calculated values were extrapolated to include the effect of water flow rate. The calculated HTCs had a peak at around 200 C, corresponding to the high heat transfer rates during nucleate boiling, and the profile was consistent with similar data published in the literature. (3) A new method, termed the reheating-cooling method (RCM), was developed and validated for measuring mechanical properties in the nonequilibrium mushy zones of alloys. The new method captures the brittle nature of aluminum alloys at temperatures close to the nonequilibrium solidus temperature, while specimens tested using the reheating method exhibit significant ductility. The RCM has been used for determining the mechanical properties of alloys at nonequilibrium mushy zone temperatures. Accurate data obtained during this project show that the metal becomes more brittle at high temperatures and high strain rates. (4) The elevated-temperature mechanical properties of the alloy were determined. Constitutive models relating the stress and strain relationship at elevated temperatures were also developed. The experimental data fit the model well. (5) An integrated 3 D DC casting model has been used to simulate heat transfer, fluid flow, solidification, and thermally induced stress-strain during casting. A temperature-dependent HTC between the cooling water and the ingot surface, cooling water flow rate, and air gap were coupled in this model. An elasto-viscoplastic model based on high-temperature mechanical testing was used to calculate the stress during casting. The 3 D integrated model can be used for the prediction of temperature, fluid flow, stress, and strain distribution in DC cast ingots. (6) The cracking propensity of DC cast ingots can be predicted using the 3 D integrated model as well as thermodynamic models. Thus, an ingot cracking index based on the ratio of local stress to local alloy strength was established. Simulation results indicate that cracking propensity increases with increasing casting speed. The composition of the ingots also has a major effect on cracking formation. It was found that copper and zinc increase the cracking propensity of DC cast ingots. The goal of this Aluminum Industry of the Future (IOF) project was to assist the aluminum industry in reducing the incidence of stress cracks in DC castings from a current level of 5 % down to 2 %. This could lead to energy savings in excess of 6 trillion Btu by the year 2020 given full-scale industrial implementation of the results. The project indicates that ingot cracking can be minimized by reducing the casting speed or by controlling the composition of the alloy. These results can be incorporated into industrial applications to achieve significant energy savings...|$|E

The largest discovery was made by a farmer plowing his fields in Ribiškės (now within Vilnius) in 1930. Many items were looted by the locals before Povilas Karmaza made an inventory. In total, there were about 530 Lithuanian longs (semicircular <b>cast</b> <b>ingots),</b> 9 Novgorod and 19 Kiev grivnas - with a combined weight of about 60 kg.|$|R
40|$|The phases and microstructures of Al-Cu-Fe powders and {{coatings}} {{were investigated}} in this study. Powders were prepared by grinding a chill <b>cast</b> <b>ingot</b> and by high pressure gas atomization. The contrasting solidification rates {{of these two}} processes yielded very different solidification structures. The <b>cast</b> <b>ingot</b> was very inhomogeneous and contained icosahedral ([psi]), cubic ([beta]), monoclinic ([lambda]) and tetragonal ([theta]) phases. The gas atomized powder had a finer scale of phase segregation and consisted primarily of the [psi] and [beta] phase; {{a small fraction of}} the [lambda] phase was present as well;Plasma arc sprayed (PAS) coatings were formed using the above powders. The chemical uniformity of the starting powder was carried over into the PAS coatings. Evaluation of starting powder size during PAS revealed that small powder particles (e. g., 3 ̆c 45 [mu]m) tended to lose Al by vaporization. This mass loss brought the composition of the coating into a two-phase region of the Al-Cu-Fe phase diagram and produced less of the desired [psi] phase;Substitution of 1 at. pct. B for Al was done to study the effect on altering the solidification microstructure of Al 63 Cu 25 Fe 12 chill <b>cast</b> <b>ingots,</b> gas atomized powder and PAS coatings. Boron significantly altered the structure of the chill <b>cast</b> <b>ingot,</b> but had less impact on the solidification of the atomized powders or PAS coatings. Differential thermal analysis and electron microscopy indicated that B was modifying solidification by a solute-drag mechanism;Oxidation and tribological behaviors of PAS Al 63 Cu 25 Fe 12 coatings were examined. The coatings were resistant to catastrophic oxidation at 500 ∘ and 700 ∘C in flowing O 2 for up to 250 hours. The weight gain of oxidized samples followed parabolic kinetics. Pin-on-disc wear tests with a Al 2 O 3 pm against PAS Al 63 Cu 25 Fe 12 coatings showed brittle behavior at room temperature and increasing plastic behavior at temperatures up to 600 ∘C. Initial coefficients of friction between the ceramic pin and the quasicrystal coatings ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 6 at 25 ∘C and 600 ∘C, respectively. These values increased with sliding distance. The increase in frictional force was attributed to increased contact area between the pin and coating as sliding progressed...|$|R

40|$|Al- 20 si- 5 Fe ribbons were {{produced}} by melt spinning at the rotating speed of 20 and 40 m/s. The microstructure of ribbons and conventionally cast alloys were characterized using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) together with the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) method. The microhardness of the ribbons and as <b>cast</b> <b>ingots</b> was also measured. SEM observations showed that the wheel side of the ribbons exhibited a finer microstructure than those on the air side which exposed to the atmosphere. The phase constitution of the hypereutectic Al– 20 Si- 5 Fe alloy was considerably affected by rapid solidification. XRD {{results showed that the}} phases present in the as cast hypereutectic Al- 20 Si- 5 Fe alloy were identified to be α-Al, Si and intermetallic β-Al 5 FeSi phases while only α-Al and Si were identified in the melt spun ribbons. Moreover, the values of Vickers microhardness of melt spun ribbons were three times as high as those of conventionally <b>cast</b> <b>ingots</b> of the same alloy...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to recover a {{standard}} AlSi 12 Cu 1 alloy from machining chips inside the foundry plant, by using an environmentally friend technique to produce <b>cast</b> <b>ingots</b> with characteristics {{similar to those of}} the commercially available 2 nd melt raw material. The recyclability of aluminium swarf using different melting techniques and the influence of chips preparation in the aluminium alloy recovery rate and dross production was experimentally studied and evaluated. It is shown that the recycling efficiency depends on the swarf conditioning for melting, the melting technique and the metal treatment methodology. Chips moisture reduction, induction melting under protective atmosphere and a specially developed degassing technique were found the most important factors influencing the recycling process. By using the developed technique, <b>cast</b> <b>ingots</b> with microstructure, sanity and chemical composition similar to commercially available AlSi 12 Cu 1 2 nd melt rawmaterial were successfully obtained with minimum dross formation andmetal recovery rates around 90 %, without using traditional salts and fluxesADI - Agência de Inovaçã...|$|R

By introducing a variable ingot pulling algorithm allows to some extent to control the shape and location of the crystallization front and temperature field in the ingot cross section. The shape of the crystallization front, and its position relative to the crystallizer plays an important role in the continuous <b>casting</b> of iron <b>ingots</b> affecting the structure of the casting.
