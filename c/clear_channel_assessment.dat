Since IEEE 802. 15. 4 {{is a low}} power technology, the mitigation of interference is vital to conserve energy and to extend the lifetime of devices. Most of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 radios operate in the crowded 2. 4 GHz frequency band, which is also used by many other technologies. A complete study of the common sources of external interference, namely IEEE 802. 11 -based Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Bluetooth and microwave ovens, is provided. The effects of these coexisting technologies on IEEE 802. 15. 4 are investigated and the modeling of the interference is discussed. The possibilities of Energy Detection (ED) (the feature behind Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)) and certain <b>Clear</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Assessments</b> (CCAs) are evaluated. Based on the CCAs, a lightweight interference classi cation algorithm is presented to classify the common external sources of interference in the 2. 4 GHz frequency band without demodulation of the inteferers 2 ̆ 7 signals. As the classification algorithm relies on time patterns instead of spectral features, it has no {{need to change the}} channel. Thus, it allows the radio both to stay connected to the channel and to receive while the interferer is classified. Furthermore, interference mitigation strategies are reviewed and evaluated with respect to their effectiveness to overcome the three external sources of interference. By combining the interference classification algorithm and the chosen mitigation strategies, Interference-Aware, Self-Adapting (IASA) Medium Access Control (MAC) is developed. This smart interference-mitigating MAC protocol is implemented in ContikiOS and evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recently, tuning the <b>clear</b> <b>channel</b> <b>assessment</b> (CCA) {{threshold}} {{in conjunction}} with power control has been considered for improving the performance of WLANs. However, we show that, CCA tuning can be exploited by selfish nodes to obtain an unfair share of the available bandwidth. Specifically, a selfish entity can manipulate the CCA threshold to ignore ongoing transmissions; this increases the probability of accessing the medium and provides the entity a higher, unfair share of the bandwidth. We experiment on our 802. 11 testbed to characterize the effects of CCA tuning on both isolated links and in 802. 11 WLAN configurations. We focus on AP-client(s) configurations, proposing a novel approach to detect this misbehavior. A misbehaving client is unlikely to recognize low power receptions as legitimate packets; by intelligently sending low power probe messages, an AP can efficiently detect a misbehaving node. Our key contributions are: 1) We {{are the first to}} quantify the impact of selfish CCA tuning via extensive experimentation on various 802. 11 configurations. 2) We propose a lightweight scheme for detecting selfish nodes that inappropriately increase their CCAs. 3) We extensively evaluate our system on our testbed; its accuracy is 95 percent while the false positive rate is less than 5 percent.
