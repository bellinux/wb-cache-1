40|$|The {{role of the}} Arctic Ocean {{in global}} thermohaline {{circulation}} and climate change is not well understood. High resolution, physically realistic simulations of the Arctic Ocean, calibrated and validated with observations and paleo-climate data, may provide the spatial and temporal coverage and resolution to more accurately characterize Arctic Ocean circulation, large-scale inter-ocean exchanges and allow future conditions to be projected correctly. A 1 / 12 -degree (~ 9 km) resolution coupled ice-ocean model, optimized for massively parallel computers, was developed. The model employs the latest digital bathymetry and ocean climatology available. Decades of model integration using climatological and realistic daily varying atmospheric forcing were performed. Comparisons of model output with <b>climatic</b> <b>atlases</b> and observations indicate greatly improved representation of circulation, ocean and seaice characteristics, mass and property transports and water mass transformations. Areas where model physics and resolution improvements are needed are highlighted as well. Comparison with a 1 / 6 degree (~ 18 km) ice-ocean model quantifies improvements gained from doubling model resolution. A ten fold increase in eddy kinetic energy {{is seen in the}} 9 km model versus the 18 km model. Narrow shelf and slope boundary currents, absent in the latter, now appear and mass and property transports are closer to observed values...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. The main aim of {{this study}} was to analyse ships' drift data for the South West Indian and South East Atlantic Oceans in order to find out more about the general {{characteristics}} and seasonal flow patterns of the surface ocean currents in these regions. A ship's drift observation consists of the difference between a course steered between two positions (estimated arrival time is based on the speed of the ship through the water) and the course made good during the same period (figure 1. 1). The speed of the drift can be computed by dividing the vector difference by the time elapsed. Since the most important contributors to the drift of a ship are the surface ocean currents, ship's drift data can be analysed in order to provide information about the speeds and directions of flow of the surface ocean currents in a particular area. Data, showing the mean prevailing winds, were also obtained from oceanic <b>climatic</b> <b>atlases</b> in order to investigate the relationship between the winds and the surface ocean currents. The ships' drift data as well as the wind data were used to investigate the following characteristics of the ocean currents in the study area: Geographic location including their spatial and temporal variability Speeds and directions of flow including their spatial and temporal variability The relationship between the currents and the mean prevailing winds and The eddy kinetic energy (a measure of variability around the mean flow) associated with the currents. Additional features investigated included: The discontinuity of the Mozambique Current The source currents of the Agulhas Current, and The possible existence of an offshore branch of the Agulhas Current, known as the Mozambique Ridge Current. The geographical locations, as well as the speeds and directions of flow of the main surface ocean currents in the study area were successfully determined, with the exceptions of the Angola, South Atlantic, Agulhas Return, South Indian Ocean and Antarctic Circumpolar Currents. These exceptions can be traced to the lack of data in the regions in which these currents occur. A large seasonal difference in the speeds of flow of the South Equatorial (in the Indian Ocean), the East Madagascar and the northern Mozambique Currents was found. The southern Mozambique, the Agulhas and Benguela Current as well as the currents inshore of the Agulhas Current over the Agulhas Bank were shown to exhibit small seasonal differences in their speeds of flow. Owing to a lack of data, very little could be determined regarding the seasonal variability of the Angola, South Atlantic, Agulhas Return, South Indian Ocean and Antarctic Circumpolar Currents. A seasonal variability pertaining to the geographical location of the extreme northern Mozambique Current was determined, but no seasonal variability was found in relation to the geographical location of any of the other currents in the study area. In the northern parts of the South West Indian Ocean a strong relationship was found between the mean prevailing winds and the surface currents. The main driving force for the currents in this region would seem to be the winds. However, as these currents flow southwards and become stronger, as is the case for the Agulhas Current, the relationship between the winds and the currents appears to be somewhat weaker. This may be owing to the fact that the main driving force for these currents is not the winds but the inflow of water from the north. In regions where the currents are weak, such as the Benguela Current region and the Agulhas Bank area, the relationship between the winds and currents was also shown to be strong. The eddy kinetic energy gives a measure of the variability around the mean flow of a current. Often this variability is manifested by the presence of eddy features. Some regions exhibited high values of eddy kinetic energy. These areas included: Parts of the East-Madagascar Current Parts of the Mozambique Current The Agulhas Current, including the region of the Agulhas Retroflection, and Parts of the South Equatorial Current in the Indian Ocean. Two areas of special interest regarding the eddy kinetic energy are the regions of the Agulhas and Madagascar Currents Retroflections. In these areas values of eddy kinetic energy greater then 750 cm 2 /s 2 occur (figure 4. 34). This appears to reinforce the findings of previous researchers, that have postulated the existence of current retroflections in these areas and have indicated that these areas are regions for the formation of eddy features. Unfortunately the maps and charts generated from ships' drift data do not provide clear representations of the retroflections of the East Madagascar and Agulhas Currents. This is owing to the high degree of spatial and temporal variability of these current retroflections. Thus, despite the difficulty of providing conclusive evidence for the existence of these features from ships' drift data, this investigation into the eddy kinetic energy in this study may give additional evidence for the possible presence of the East Madagascar and Agulhas Current Retroflections. The Mozambique Current was found to be a discontinuous, ill-defined western. The Mozambique Current was found to be a discontinuous, ill-defined western boundary current. Both the Mozambique and the East Madagascar Currents were shown to be source currents for the Agulhas Current, but probably in a weak and intermittent manner. The source water from the East Madagascar Current may be in the form of eddies. The existence of an offshore branch of the Agulhas Current, could not be verified from ships' drift data. This study makes two significant contributions to the descriptive physical oceanography of the South West Indian and South East Atlantic Oceans. These are: A detailed analysis relating to the seasonal variability of the currents. In the case of the Benguela Current; the- investigation into the seasonal variability was more detailed than any previous study. A comprehensive investigation pertaining to the eddy kinetic energy associated with the currents. This was done on a one degree grid scale. The only other study which used ships' drift data to examine the eddy kinetic energy for these regions used a five degree grid scale, which could lead to the smoothing out of high values associated with narrow western boundary currents...|$|R

40|$|Evapotranspiration {{is a key}} {{component}} of the water and energy balance. Estimates of evapotranspiration are required for many applications. The Bureau of Meteorology and the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology released a set of Evapotranspiration Maps for Australia in July 2001 as part of the Bureau’s <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> series. The maps give average monthly and annual values of three evapotranspiration variables: point potential evapotranspiration, areal potential evapotranspiration and areal actual evapotranspiration. The evapotranspiration estimates are based on Morton’s complementary relationship model and are derived using climate data from over 700 locations throughout Australia. This paper presents an overview of the evapotranspiration maps, describes how the estimates are derived, and where the various evapotranspiration variables can be used...|$|E
40|$|Landscape {{classification}} tackles {{issues related}} to the representation and analysis of continuous and variable ecological data. In this study, a methodology is created in order to define topo-climatic landscapes (TCL) in the north-west of Catalonia (north-east of the Iberian Peninsula). TCLs relate the ecological behaviour of a landscape in terms of topography, physiognomy and climate, which compound the main drivers of an ecosystem. Selected variables are derived from different sources such as remote sensing and <b>climatic</b> <b>atlas.</b> The proposed methodology combines unsupervised interative cluster classification with a supervised fuzzy classification. As a result, 28 TCLs have been found for the study area which may be differentiated in terms of vegetation physiognomy and vegetation altitudinal range type. Furthermore a hierarchy among TCLs is set, enabling the merging of clusters and allowing for changes of scale. Through the topo-climatic landscape map, managers may identify patches with similar environmental conditions and asses {{at the same time the}} uncertainty involved...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{changes of}} mixed layer depth (MLD) {{can be related}} to the forcing by the net surface heating and wind speed. This is shown in this study by {{comparing}} the monthly mixed layer depth from temperature profiles in the Bauer-Robinson Numerical Atlas with monthly net surface heating and wind speed obtained from the Weare Marine <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> of the Tropical Pacific Ocean. Using a conceptual model based on mixed layer physics, ocean response and atmospheric forcing are examined using the Obukhov mixing length. A pattern in the seasonal variation of upwelling along the Equator is also examined. The model links the atmospheric and oceanic climatologies through the derived MLD (oceanic data) and Obukhov mixing lengths (forcing data). The results show a high degree of pattern similarity between the seasonal response of the ocean and the seasonal changes in atmospheric forcing. The pattern of seasonal influence on MLD at the Equator is very weak in comparison to that of the tropics and sub-tropics.

40|$|There are {{number of}} future {{projections}} of species' geographic ranges developed {{under conditions of}} ongoing climate change. However, only {{a few studies have}} assessed what are the characteristics of species explaining interspecific variability in the projected range shifts. Examination of such relationships is important for development of effective conservation strategies mitigating the effects of climatic changes. For this purpose, I calculated the predicted shifts of European ranges in Czech birds based on maps in A <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> of European Breeding Birds and explored relationships between these predicted shifts and several ecological traits. We found significant effects of the type of European distribution and habitat requirements. Concerning the type of European distribution, the largest shift is predicted in the central species and the northern species compared to widespread and southern species. According to the habitat type, the largest shift showed forest birds in contrast to the urban species which will shift slightly. The former pattern is probably attributable to spatial constrains different among these specific groups (central species are less limited compared to widespread species). The latter pattern could be explained by higher sensitivity of forest species to climatic changes [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} for spatial interpolating climatic variables available {{by means of}} point measurements, as precipitation and temperature, arises from different needs, ranging from their usage for hydrological models to the reconstruction of <b>climatic</b> <b>atlas</b> of spatially distributed data. In some areas the spatial distribution of these variables {{can be related to}} the extremely variable morphology of the area. While simple deterministic interpolation methods usually produce just the spatial distribution of the variable of interest, implicitly relying on the spatial autocorrelation and manually tuning a few parameters, more complex statistical models, are able to derive the uncertainty associated with the estimate and model its different components, like those related to the measurement error and the parameters selection. With reference to the area of Sicily (Italy), mean annual and monthly precipitation and temperature data have been modeled using a hierarchical bayesian spatial model considering both the univariate approach and the multivariate approach with the elevation data, provided by a Digital Elevation Model, as secondary information source. Comparison with traditional geostatistical methods is reported. Highlights about the insights provided by the hierarchical models are commented, in particular with reference to the uncertainty associated with the estimates and with the measurements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe climatic {{reconstruction}} of the Pliocene, based on pollen data, requires a new method of quantification {{because of the presence}} in pollen spectra, of temperate, warm-temperate but also subtropical plants. As no modern pollen spectra contain all these taxa, the best analogues method is inappropriate for this period. So, a new method is proposed: it corresponds to a climatic amplitude method modified to partially take into account some taxa abundances. The first step in this new method is to determine the present-day distribution of a few subtropical plants and some taxa still existing in the Mediterranean region with a good climatic signal. Then, the climatic parameters of the corresponding areas are defined, either by a <b>climatic</b> <b>atlas</b> or by personal knowledge. A test on a few pollen spectra, corresponding to different localities but of almost the same age (about 3. 4 Ma) is realised. The first results of climatic estimation confirm an increasing latitudinal gradient for annual temperatures from North to South, which is estimated as today, even if the temperatures were higher (about 2 to 6 degrees C more). We may confirm the same for the precipitations which were more important to the North than to the South of the Mediterranean. These latitudinal gradients are quantified...|$|E
40|$|A {{database}} {{has been}} created of digitized equal area distribution maps of 2, 401 phylogenetic species of songbirds endemic to the Palearctic Region. Geographic distribution of species richness delineated several hotspot regions in the Palearctic, mostly located in mountainous areas. The index of range-size rarity generally identified similar hotspot regions as that for species richness, although it de-emphasized the large central-Siberian hotspot. The hypothesis was tested that databases restricted to a non-natural biogeographic region, such as "Europe," will identify {{a different set of}} hotspots, as compared with a spatial analysis of a more natural biogeographic region such as the Palearctic. For that purpose, only those taxa from the dataset were selected that occur in the geographic region delimited by the EBCC atlas and the <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> of European Breeding Birds, in total 516 taxa. European hotspots of species richness were slightly more prominent in the Palearctic dataset as compared with the European dataset of 516 taxa. The index of range-size rarity indicated a more pronounced difference between the hotspots identified by the Palearctic dataset and the European dataset, with little or no differentiation in the latter. It is concluded that the present qualitative analysis suggests that it is important for hotspot and conservation studies to examine a natural biogeographic region, and not a geopolitical entity such as "Europe. ...|$|E
40|$|Climatically induced {{shifts of}} species’ {{geographic}} ranges can provide important {{information about the}} potential future assembly of ecological communities. Surprisingly, interspecific variability in the magnitude and direction of these range shifts in birds {{has been the subject}} of few scientific studies, and a more detailed examination of species’ ecological traits related to this variability is needed. Using maps in the <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> of European Breeding Birds (Huntley et al. 2007) we calculated the potential shifts of European breeding ranges in 298 bird species, and explored their relationships with breeding habitat, dietary niche, migration strategy, life history and geographic position of the current breeding range. Breeding habitat type showed the strongest relationship with the potential range shifts, with forest and wetland species showing the largest magnitude of shift. At the same time, ecological specialists showed a larger magnitude of shifts than generalists. In addition, we found that species with current ranges situated near continental borders and species with lower migratory capacity are more limited in their potential to shift due to climate change. Our analyses thus indicate which ecological groups of birds will be most likely forced to move their ranges under predicted climate change. This knowledge can help to adopt proper conservation actions. These actions will be particularly important in the case of specialist species, which have been shown to be the most sensitive to climate change impacts...|$|E
40|$|Engineering {{models of}} the {{atmosphere}} are used extensively by the aerospace community for design issues related to vehicle ascent and descent. The Earth Global Reference Atmosphere Model version 2007 (Earth-GRAM 07) {{is the latest in}} this series and includes a number of new features. Like previous versions, Earth-GRAM 07 provides both mean values and perturbations for density, temperature, pressure, and winds, as well as monthly- and geographically-varying trace constituent concentrations. From 0 km to 27 km, thermodynamics and winds are based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Upper Air <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> (GUACA) climatology. For altitudes between 20 km and 120 km, the model uses data from the Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP). Above 120 km, Earth-GRAM 07 now provides users with a choice of three thermosphere models: the Marshall Engineering Thermosphere (MET- 2007) model; the Jacchia-Bowman 2006 thermosphere model (JB 2006); and the Naval Research Labs Mass Spectrometer, Incoherent Scatter Radar Extended Model (NRL MSIS E- 00) with the associated Harmonic Wind Model (HWM- 93). In place of these datasets, Earth-GRAM 07 has the option of using the new 2006 revised Range Reference Atmosphere (RRA) data, the earlier (1983) RRA data, or the user may also provide their own data as an auxiliary profile. Refinements of the perturbation model are also discussed which include wind shears more similar to those observed at the Kennedy Space Center than the previous version Earth-GRAM 99...|$|E

GRAM- 99 uses either (binary) Global Upper Air <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> (GUACA) or (ASCII) Global Gridded Upper Air Statistics (GGUAS) CD-ROM data sets, for 0 - 27 km altitudes. As with earlier versions, GRAM- 99 provides complete geographical and altitude coverage for each month of the year. GRAM- 99 uses a specially-developed data set, based on Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP) data, for 20 - 120 km altitudes, and NASA's 1999 version Marshall Engineering Thermosphere (MET- 99) model for heights above 90 km. Fairing techniques assure smooth transition in overlap height ranges (20 - 27 km and 90 - 120 km). GRAM- 99 includes water vapor and 11 other atmospheric constituents (O 3, N 2 O, CO, CH 4, CO 2, N 2, O 2, O, A, He and H). A variable-scale perturbation model provides both large-scale (wave) and small-scale (stochastic) deviations from mean values for thermodynamic variables and horizontal and vertical wind components. The small-scale perturbation model includes improvements in representing intermittency ("patchiness"). A major new feature is an option to substitute Range Reference Atmosphere (RRA) data for conventional GRAM climatology when a trajectory passes sufficiently near any RRA site. A complete user's guide for running the program, plus sample input and output, is provided. An example is provided for how to incorporate GRAM- 99 as subroutines in other programs (e. g., trajectory codes) ...|$|E
40|$|Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM- 99) is an engineering-level {{model of}} the Earth's atmosphere. It {{provides}} both mean values and perturbations for density, temperature, pressure, and winds, as well as monthly- and geographically-varying trace constituent concentrations. From 0 - 27 km, thermodynamics and winds are based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Upper Air <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> (GUACA) climatology. Above 120 km, GRAM {{is based on the}} NASA Marshall Engineering Thermosphere (MET) model. In the intervening altitude region, GRAM is based on Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP) climatology that also forms the basis of the 1986 COSPAR Intemationa 1 Reference Atmosphere (CIRA). MAP data in GRAM are augmented by a specially-derived longitude variation climatology. Atmospheric composition is represented in GRAM by concentrations of both major and minor species. Above 120 km, MET provides concentration values for N 2, O 2, Ar, O, He, and H. Below 120 km, species represented also include H 2 O, O 3, N 2 O, CO, CH, and CO 2. Water vapor in GRAM is based on a combination of GUACA, Air Force Geophysics Laboratory (AFGL), and NASA Langley Research Center climatologies. Other constituents below 120 km are based on a combination of AFGL and h 4 AP/CIRA climatologies. This report presents results of comparisons between GRAM Constituent concentrations and those provided by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) climatology of Summers (NRL,/MR/ 7641 - 93 - 7416, 1993). GRAM and NRL concentrations were compared for seven species (CH 4, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, N 2 O, O 2, and O 3) for months January, April, July, and October, over height range 0 - 115 km, and latitudes - 90 deg to + 90 deg at 10 deg increments.

GRAM- 95 uses the new Global Upper Air <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> (GUACA) CD-ROM data set, for 0 - to 27 -km altitudes. As with earlier versions, GRAM- 95 provides complete geographical and altitude coverage for each month of the year. Individual years 1985 to 1991 and a period-of-record (1980 to 1991) can be simulated for the GUACA height range. GRAM- 95 uses a specially developed data set, based on Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP) data, for the 20 - to 120 -km height range, and the NASA Marshall Engineering Thermosphere (MET) model for heights above 90 km. Fairing techniques assure a smooth transition in the overlap height ranges (20 to 27 km and 90 to 120 km). In addition to the traditional GRAM variables of pressure, density, temperature and wind components, GRAM- 95 now includes water vapor and 11 other atmospheric constituents (O 3, N 2 O, CO, CH 4, CO 2, N 2, O 2, O, A, He, and H). A new, variable-scale perturbation model provides both large-scale and small-scale deviations from mean values for the thermodynamic variables and horizontal and vertical wind components. The perturbation model includes new features that simulate intermittency (patchiness) in turbulence and small-scale perturbation fields. The density perturbations and density gradients (density shears) computed by the new model compare favorably in their statistical characteristics with observed density perturbations and density shears from 32 space shuttle reentry profiles. GRAM- 95 provides considerable improvement in wind estimates from the new GUACA data set, compared to winds calculated from the geostrophic wind relations previously used in the 0 - to 25 -km height range. The GRAM- 95 code has been put into a more modular form, easier to incorporate as subroutines in other programs (e. g., trajectory codes).

40|$|Reference or {{standard}} atmospheric {{models have}} long been used for design and mission planning of various aerospace systems. The NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM) was developed {{in response to the}} need for a design reference atmosphere that provides complete global geographical variability, and complete altitude coverage (surface to orbital altitudes) as well as complete seasonal and monthly variability of the thermodynamic variables and wind components. A unique feature of GRAM is that, addition to providing the geographical, height, and monthly variation of the mean atmospheric state, it includes the ability to simulate spatial and temporal perturbations in these atmospheric parameters (e. g. fluctuations due to turbulence and other atmospheric perturbation phenomena). A summary comparing GRAM features to characteristics and features of other reference or standard atmospheric models, can be found Guide to Reference and Standard Atmosphere Models. The original GRAM has undergone a series of improvements over the years with recent additions and changes. The software program is called Earth-GRAM 2007 to distinguish it from similar programs for other bodies (e. g. Mars, Venus, Neptune, and Titan). However, in order to make this Technical Memorandum (TM) more readable, the software will be referred to simply as GRAM 07 or GRAM unless additional clarity is needed. Section 1 provides an overview of the basic features of GRAM 07 including the newly added features. Section 2 provides a more detailed description of GRAM 07 and how the model output generated. Section 3 presents sample results. Appendices A and B describe the Global Upper Air <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> (GUACA) data and the Global Gridded Air Statistics (GGUAS) database. Appendix C provides instructions for compiling and running GRAM 07. Appendix D gives a description of the required NAMELIST format input. Appendix E gives sample output.

Below 120 km, species represented also include H 2 O, O 3, N 2 O, CO, CH 4, and CO 2. At COSPAR 2002 a comparison was made between GRAM constituents below 120 km and those provided by Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) climatology. No current need to update GRAM constituent climatology in that height range was identified. This report examines GRAM (MET) constituents between 100 and 1000 km altitudes. Discrepancies are noted between GRAM (MET) constituent number densities and mass density or molecular weight. Near 110 km altitude, there is up to about 25 % discrepancy between MET number density and mass density (with mass density being valid and number densities requiring adjustment). Near 700 km altitude there is also up to about 25 % discrepancy between MET number density and mean molecular weight (with molecular weight requiring adjustment). In neither case are MET mass density estimates invalidated. These discrepancies have been traced to MET subroutines SLV (which affects 90 - 170 km height range) and SLVH (which affects helium above 440 km altitude). With these discrepancies corrected, results are presented to illustrate GRAM (MET) constituent mole fractions in terms of height-latitude cross sections from 100 to 1000 km altitude, and latitude-longitude 'maps' at 450 km (approximate height of International Space Station). Plans are discussed for an update of MET (and GRAM) to correct these constituent inconsistencies and to incorporate several new thermospheric model features...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} recent climatic change on bird species across Europe and develops robust indicators of ecosystem change at national and supra-national levels. The performance of three methods of species distribution modelling of European bird populations in relation to climatic change over the last 60 years is evaluated; the models being generalized additive models (GAM), climate response surface models (CRS) and maximum entropy models (MaxEnt). European breeding bird distributions were simulated using models that were parameterised using: (1) distribution data from the <b>Climatic</b> <b>Atlas</b> of European Breeding Birds and (2) augmenting these European data with distribution data from Turkey, Cyprus and North Africa. Including data from a wider geographical area improved the fit of SDMs; this was especially marked for some species with relatively poor fits based on the Europe-only dataset. Of the three SDM models tested CRS best simulated current species range data (mean AUC= 0. 982), closely followed by GAM (mean AUC= 0. 950), with MaxEnt performing worst (mean AUC= 0. 741). The most robust of the modelling techniques (CRS and GAM) were used to produce climate suitability trends (CST) for European breeding birds, using population data provided by the Pan European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme (PECBMS). Population trends in European breeding birds significantly correlated with SDM retrodicted trends in 5 of 11 countries considered. Biological variables were assessed to examine their impacts on recent abundance trends; of these, habitat preference was the only biological variable found to impact upon the relationship between CST and the PECBMS trends. We generated indicators {{of the impact of}} climatic change by contrasting species trends of those projected to increase versus those projected to decline from the SDMs based on regional and national level data. Indices were also produced for individual species based on their observed and simulated trends among countries. Monitoring duration had a substantial effect on the strength of the indicator; therefore, the continuous updating of monitoring schemes is vital to ensure the accuracy of such indicators. Downscaling the continental indicator produced informative and reliable indicators that can inform policy decisions at a national level, helping to preserve biodiversity. ...|$|E
