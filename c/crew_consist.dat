50|$|Operational {{training}} for fighter units followed the standard OTU-RTU pattern, but naturally differed {{from that of}} bombardment units. Only in night fighter planes (P-61) did the combat <b>crew</b> <b>consist</b> {{of more than one}} member, and the overwhelming proportion of fighter pilots served in the single-seater day fighters. Since the problem of crew teamwork did not exist in day fighter training, the program was directed toward maximum individual proficiency and precise coordination among the pilots of each squadron and group.|$|E
50|$|The M-80A is {{armed with}} one 20 mm gun, co-axial machine gun 7.62 mm and twin {{launcher}} for wire guided anti-tank missiles.

Max. speed at water is 7 km/h. <b>Crew</b> <b>consist</b> of three, driver, commander and gun operator {{and in the}} after compartment there is space for six fully equipped infantrymen who can engage the enemy with personal armament through six gun slits on both vehicle sides and back doors and one squad leader who commands infantry upon exiting the vehicle.

50|$|Estrella was confiscated by the Germans {{during the}} German {{occupation}} of Norway {{and was at}} the disposal of Reichkommisar Josef Terboven. King Haakon VII of Norway had been promised a Royal Yacht when he accepted the Norwegian throne in 1905, but this would not come through until 1947 when he was given the HNoMY Norge. In 1945 the Royal Court therefore acquired Estrella and named her Stjernen after the previous Stjernen I which had also been confiscated by the Germans but was returned as a wreck. The present Stjernen is still in use by the King and his family and, like Norge, Stjernen is manned by a crew from the Royal Norwegian Navy. The <b>crew</b> <b>consist</b> of three seamen and one junior officer who live aboard 14 days at a time.|$|E
50|$|The {{series is}} set in the year 2100, by which time the {{indigenous}} and autonomous civilizations on Earth, Mars and Venus have banded together to form the United Galactic Organization (UGO). Space Patrol is the UGO's military wing, and the series follows the actions of this interplanetary force, focusing on the missions of a tiny unit led by the heroic, bearded Captain Larry Dart. The humanoids in his <b>crew</b> <b>consist</b> of the elfin Slim from Venus, and the stocky, ravenously sausage-mad Husky from the Red Planet, Mars. The imperfect Slavic accent variants and six-pointed star chest emblems of these two may have been a sly nod to the Jewish-Russian heritage of the English series creator/writer. These men would regularly use one of two interplanetary space vehicles, the Galisphere 347 and the Galisphere 024.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crew</b> <b>consist</b> of four soldiers: driver, commander, gunner and bow machine gunner, two {{of which}} (commander and machine gunner) are {{included}} in the number of soldiers carried. The driver's station is located centrally {{in the front of the}} vehicle and has a hatch that is opened by raising it and rotating it to the right. The driver is provided with three periscope vision blocks, which allow him to view the outer environment when his hatch is closed. The center one can be replaced with a night vision device for use in night and bad visibility conditions or with an extended periscope for swimming with the trim vane erected. The commander's station is on the driver's left. It is provided with a hatch, one periscope vision block, an outer environment observation device and an R-123 radio set for communications. He also fires the left bow machine gun. The right one is operated by a bow machine gun gunner, who sits to the right of the driver. The gunner's station is located on the left side of the turret, like in the BMP-1, and has the same equipment (see Gunner's station section in BMP-1 article for details).|$|E

50|$|Most freight trains on most railroads {{today have}} {{a crew of}} two: one {{conductor}} and one engineer. Railroad companies continue to press for reduced operating and labor costs and this threatens to eliminate conductors. Railroads rationalize that since the engineer is already qualified as a conductor, he can easily assume the duties of a conductor. In fact, on most railroads, engineers begin as brakemen/assistant conductors, then become conductors, and finally engineers. Some railroads already implement such a strategy, notably the Montana Rail Link, and operate with an engineer, and an assistant engineer. However, most railroads are contractually obligated to employ at least one conductor {{in addition to the}} engineer, via <b>crew</b> <b>consist</b> agreements negotiated with the major rail unions, primarily the United Transportation Union (UTU). Therefore, eliminating the conductor position would require that the railroads and unions negotiate a new agreement. If the railroads were successful, conductors already trained and certified as engineers would be able to work as engineers. Those that have not yet progressed to engineer would have to be trained as engineers as positions became available. Others would have to accept other positions or possibly lose their jobs. The primary union for engineers, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers does not support this movement, claiming that requiring its members to operate trains alone would be unsafe. The conductors' union, the United Transportation Union, also opposes this initiative, despite historical differences with the engineers' union.|$|E
40|$|Tinycoxswain uses a {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN) to monitor crew performance. A <b>crew</b> <b>consist</b> of 2, 4, or 8 people arranged in a row. They must precisely coordinate and synchronize their strokes {{to ensure that the}} boat moves as efficiently and quickly as possible. Any technique for monitoring and detecting flaws in rowing technique is extremely useful. Existing methods fail to monitor each rower individually, is cumbersome and expensive, and often does not provide immediate feedback. WSNs can address all of these issues by allowing tiny inexpensive sensors to be installed throughout a boat. These sensors automatically form {{a wireless}} ad hoc network delivering sensing data in real-time to the coxswain and coach, who can then provide immediate feedback. This paper presents our experience with using a WSN to monitor a crew’s performance in terms of boat speed, set, and rower synchronization. Our system was tested through simulation, deployment on indoor ergometers, and deployment on an actual sweep boat during a St. Louis Rowing Club intermediate practice session. We learned that three key features are necessary for the practical deployment of a WSN for monitoring a crew include in-network processing, self-calibration, and adaptive sampling. I...|$|E
