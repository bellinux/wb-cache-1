40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{an explanation for}} the puzzling decoupling between the rate of growth of financial profits and GDP in the 2000 s. Drawing on the insights from Keynes, Minsky, and Hilferding, the paper identifies a peculiar type of profit – <b>capital</b> gain-like <b>revenues</b> that take the form of profits from underwriting, mergers and acquisitions, securitization, and trade in financial assets. These <b>capital</b> gain-like <b>revenues</b> come from the redistribution of monetary assets and lack a counterpart in current GDP. They {{can be thought of as}} wealth transfers. Based on an empirical analysis of revenues of U. S. bank holding companies, these <b>capital</b> gain-like <b>revenues</b> are shown to have contributed significantly to the decoupling between the rate of growth of financial profits and GDP. The paper identifies characteristics of these revenues that explain the puzzles around this decoupling – its very possibility, sustainability over long time, and lack of losses sufficient to offset the pre-crisis financial gains. These characteristics of <b>capital</b> gain-like <b>revenues</b> also allow one to reconcile two seemingly incompatible approaches to a rise in financial profits – as transfers (rent) and as an illusion (mirage) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{government}} for growth in 64 industrialized and developing countries, considering both expenditure and financing aspects of government. Recognizing that there are differences between the two country groups leading to severe heteroskedasticity, we use weighted least squared estimations. The general conclusion is that the means of financing matters more for growth than do government spending. We find that seigniorage and budget surplus are important for growth in LDCs but not in industrialized countries, while <b>capital</b> <b>revenue</b> matters only in the latter group. Moreover, the level of indebtedness is a negative determinant of growth in LDCs. Growth; government; public expenditure; public financing. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{we explain}} {{accounting}} systematically, {{we have to}} define concepts of the accounting elements (asset, liability, <b>capital,</b> <b>revenue,</b> expense and income) first.

Furthermore, these are not direct definitions of extension of the terms, but definitions of the intension of the terms. In the results of definitions of the accounting elements, if there are differences of language levels between the elements, we can not calculate corporate income truly which is the main purpose of accounting, nor can we indicate the corporate financial position logically. In order to define the concepts of accounting elements, we have to study accounts theories in Germany.
