5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species richness and endemism, which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E

25|$|In {{species such}} as the Coleopteran family Lampyridae, the males fly in the {{darkness}} and emit a species-species specific pattern of light flashes, which are answered by perching receptive females. The color and temporal variation of the flash <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> in attracting females. Acoustic signals are produced by many groups including several orthopeteran species, neuropterida, cicadas, flies, cave planthroppers, leaf hoppers, and tree hoppers. In crickets and other Orthopeterans, loudness and/or uninterrupted songs often attract more females. In other insects, females may choose a mate in relation to aspects of his songs. In any case, {{it is possible that}} females compare the songs of several males before making a choice.|$|E
25|$|The fifth Hope Bus was {{announced}} on 25 September, with the upcoming event {{to take place}} on 8 October. This date coincided with the opening weekend of the 16th Busan International Film Festival. In a joint press conference at Busan City Hall on 26 September, Busan mayor Hur Nam-sik and Busan City Council chairman Jae Jong-mo (제종모) announced {{their opposition to the}} fifth Hope Bus event. Hur and Jae's given reasoning was that the four prior buses were detrimental to solving the labor crisis, and had done great damage to the citizens of Busan. Furthermore, Hur and Jae asserted that stopping the Hope Bus event would <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of the film festival. The conservative Advancement Unification Party was against the fifth Hope Bus event as well. In a statement on 27 September, party spokesperson Yoon Hyeon-yeon (윤혜연) blamed government incompetence and the ignorance of Hope Bus participants towards the concerns of the local citizens of Busan for the ongoing Hanjin Heavy Industries crisis. Yoon maintained that the presence of a fifth Hope Bus event would present traffic dangers as well as a black mark on the international reputation of South Korea.|$|E

25|$|In June 1949, the House Committee on Armed Services {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} charges, emanating unofficially from Navy sources, of malfeasance in office against Secretary Johnson and Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington. The hearings also looked into the capability of the B-36, the cancellation of the supercarrier United States and JCS procedures on weapons development, and ultimately examined the whole course of unification. In addition to disparaging the B-36, Navy representatives questioned the current U.S. military plan for immediate use of atomic weapons against large urban areas when a war started. The Navy argued that such an approach would not harm military targets, and that tactical air power, ground troops, and sea power were the elements necessary to defend the United States and Europe against attack. The Air Force countered that atomic weapons and long-range strategic bombers would deter war, but that if war nevertheless broke out, an immediate atomic offensive against the enemy would <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of surface actions and reduce U.S. casualties. Strategic bombing, the Air Force contended, provided the major counterbalance to the Soviet Union's vastly superior ground forces.|$|E

An Indian king; a loving princess, and her attendant, in love with the British captain's servant; a traitor in the English fort; a brave Indian warrior, himself entertaining an unhappy passion for Pocahontas; a medicine-man and priest of the Indians (very well played by Palmer), capable of every treason, stratagem, and crime, and bent upon the torture and death of the English prisoner;--these, with the accidents of the wilderness, the war-dances and cries (which Gumbo had learned to mimic very accurately from the red people at home), and the arrival of the English fleet, with allusions to the late glorious victories in Canada, and the determination of Britons ever to rule and conquer in America, some of us not unnaturally thought might <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of our tragedy.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have other}} reasons for fearing that this logical ideal of {{evolutionary}} regimentation--this pigeon-fanciers' polity--is unattainable. In {{the absence of any}} such a severely scientific administrator as we have been dreaming of, human society [24] is kept together by bonds of such a singular character, that the attempt to perfect society after his fashion would run serious risk of loosening them. Social organization is not peculiar to men. Other societies, such as those constituted by bees and ants, have also arisen out of the advantage of co-operation in the struggle for existence; and their resemblances to, and their differences from, human society are alike instructive. The society formed by the hive bee fulfils the ideal of the communistic aphorism [...] "to each according to his needs, from each according to his capacity." [...] Within it, the struggle for existence is strictly limited. Queen, drones, and workers have each their allotted sufficiency of food; each performs the function assigned to it in the economy of the hive, and all <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of the whole cooperative society in its competition with rival collectors of nectar and pollen and with other enemies, in the state of nature without. In the same sense as the garden, or the colony, is a work of human art, the bee polity is a work of apiarian art, brought about by the cosmic process, working through the organization of the hymenopterous type.|$|E
6000|$|This {{second act}} of the plot was opened by a {{communication}} of Curll to Pope on the 22nd of March, {{three weeks after the}} letters had been withdrawn from the library of Lord Oxford. He invited the poet to close their differences, and, as a proof of his readiness to oblige him, sent him the old advertisement of P. T. Curll asserted that he took the step [...] "by direction."[31] When he republished this statement he volunteered another, which seems to be inconsistent with it, and says that the discovery of the advertisement, when arranging his papers, determined him to propose a cessation of hostilities.[32] As he was unconscious, however, of any contradiction in the double account, it is probable that he may have been influenced by some concurring advice. It strengthens this view that Pope, in an anonymous [...] "Narrative," [...] which he subsequently put forth, reports what Curll told a few days later, [...] "to persons who sifted him in the affair,"[33] which shows that the bookseller had people about him {{in the interest of the}} poet, and these sifters, as the critic in the Athenæum remarks, might, when needful, become prompters. The progress of events proved that the letter of Curll was at least singularly opportune, and if not written [...] "by direction," [...] was one of those fortunate chances which often <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> of the best laid schemes. Pope replied to it by inserting an advertisement in the [...] "Grub Street Journal," [...] the [...] "Daily Journal," [...] and [...] "The Daily Post Boy." [...] He stated in this manifesto, that Curll [...] "pretended that P. T. had offered him to print a large collection of Pope's letters," [...] that he would have no correspondence with Curll, that he knew no such person as P. T., that he believed the letters to be a forgery, and that he should not trouble himself in the matter.[34] The poet might not choose to have any intercourse with a former enemy of no good fame, but it was a strange return for his peace-offering that he should advertise an insult on him, and equally singular when he was incredulous, and had resolved not to trouble himself about the matter, that he should parade in the newspapers the contents of a private note. Yet extraordinary as was his conduct, if he had not any covert design, it was consistent enough if he was the agent in the plot for bringing his letters before the world. His advertisement would convey the impression that he could not have connived at the publication he was contriving; it would afford an opening for P. T. to come again upon the stage; and by infuriating Curll it would induce him to close at once with the proposal which was ready to be made to him. In conformity with this supposition P. T., who had not communicated with the bookseller for upwards of two years, saw the advertisement directly it appeared, and he lost not an instant in informing Curll that since their last negotiation he had printed the letters.[35] It was true that Curll had betrayed him to Pope, but P. T. was generous and would still give him the preference. The game required that Pope should be incapable of being conciliated, and P. T. of taking offence.|$|E
