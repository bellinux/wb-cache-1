In some cases, replacing digital units with analog equivalents allows similar computation to be performed at higher speed and lower power. The units that can most easily benefit from this approach are those whose results {{do not have to be}} precise, such as various types of predictors.

The limited spatial resolution of current devices results in indiscriminate stimulation of interleaved cells of different types, precluding veridical reproduction of natural activity {{patterns in the}} retinal output. Here we investigate the use of spatial patterns of current injection to increase the spatial resolution of stimulation, using high-density multielectrode recording and stimulation of identified ganglion cells in isolated macaque retina. As previously shown, current passed through a single electrode typically induced a single retinal ganglion cell spike with submillisecond timing precision. Current passed simultaneously through pairs of neighboring electrodes modified the probability of activation relative to injection through a single electrode. This modification could be accurately summarized by a piecewise linear model of <b>current</b> <b>summation,</b> consistent with a simple biophysical model based on multiple sites of activation. The generalizability of the piecewise linear model was tested by using the measured responses to stimulation with two electrodes to predict responses to stimulation with three electrodes.

We report that rat embryo organotypic spinal cultures contain the basic circuits responsible for pattern generation. In this preparation rhythmic activity can be recorded from ventral interneurons and is developmentally regulated. When chronically grown {{in the presence of}} an AMPA/kainate receptor blocker, this circuit expresses long-term plasticity consisting largely of increased frequency of fast synaptic activity and reduction in slow GABAergic events. We examined whether, once this form of homeostatic plasticity is established, the network could still exhibit rhythmicity with properties similar to controls. Control or chronically treated ventral interneurons spontaneously generated (with similar probability) irregular, network-driven bursts over a background of ongoing synaptic activity. In control cultures increasing network excitability by strychnine plus bicuculline, or by raising [K(+) ](o), induced rapid-onset, regular rhythmic bursts. In treated cultures the same pharmacological block of Cl(-) -mediated transmission or high-K(+) application also induced regular patterned activity, although significantly faster and, in the case of high K(+), characterized by slow onset due to postsynaptic <b>current</b> <b>summation.</b> Enhancing GABAergic transmission by pentobarbital surprisingly accelerated the high-K(+) rhythm of control cells (though depressing background activity), whereas it slowed it down in chronically treated cells. This contrasting effect of pentobarbital suggests that, to preserve bursting ability, chronic slices developed a distinct GABAergic inhibitory control on over-expressed bursting circuits. Conversely, in control slices GABAergic transmission depressed spontaneous activity but it facilitated bursting frequency. Thus, even after homeostatic rearrangement, developing mammalian spinal networks still generate rhythmic activity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} mode of action of type I {{pyrethroids}} on the voltage-dependent sodium current from honeybee olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), whose proper function in antenna is crucial for interindividual communication in this species. Under voltage-clamp, tetramethrin and permethrin induce a long lasting TTX-sensitive tail current upon repolarization, which {{is the hallmark of}} an abnormal prolongation of the open channel configuration. Permethrin and tetramethrin also slow down the sodium current fast inactivation. Tetramethrin and permethrin both bind to the closed state of the channel as suggested by the presence of an obvious tail current after the first single depolarization applied in the presence of either compounds. Moreover, at first sight, channel opening seems to promote tetramethrin and permethrin binding as evidenced by the progressive tail <b>current</b> <b>summation</b> along with trains of stimulations, tetramethrin being more potent at modifying channels than permethrin. However, a use-dependent increase in the sodium peak current along with stimulations suggests that the tail current accumulation could also be a consequence of progressively unmasked silent channels. Experiments with the sea anemone toxin ATX-II that suppresses sodium channels fast inactivation are consistent with the hypothesis that these silent channels are either in an inactivated state at rest, or that they normally inactivate before they open so that they do not participate to the control sodium current. In honeybee ORNs, three processes lead to a use-dependent pyrethroid-induced tail current accumulation: (i) a recruitment of silent channels that produces an increase in the peak sodium current, (ii) a slowing down of the sodium current inactivation produced by prolongation of channels opening and (iii) a typical deceleration in current deactivation. The use-dependent recruitment of silent sodium channels in honeybee ORNs makes pyrethroids more potent at modifying neuronal excitability...|$|R

A harmonic rejection filter is designed to filter FM square wave signal from 70 MHz to 110 MHz into FM sine wave signal.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the spin {{alignment}} in an adjacent ferromagnet is capable of suppressing superconductivity. In this project, devices incorporating cuprate/manganite heterostuctres were successfully fabricated to study the effects of spin transport on the high temperature superconductor, YBCO. Deposition of such oxide ferromagnet/superconductor (F/S) multilayers using the 'eclipse' pulsed laser deposition(PLD) technique was also examined. Reproducible multilayers with ultrathin repeats were deposited, which exhibited superconducting and magnetic properties to minimum thicknesses of 3 nm for both YBCO and LSMO. Using spin injection, via a ferromagnet, to create a spin imbalance in the superconductor, a suppression of superconducting critical current was observed with increasing injection current. However, the exact cause of this suppression could not be solely attributed to spin-induced nonequilibrium effects, as it proved difficult to eliminate the effects of localized heating, <b>current</b> <b>summation</b> and magnetic field. Interfacial studies of the device junction provided evidence of an alternative current path at the interface. The control of superconductivity was also examined using F/S proximity effects, which improves the understanding of how magnetic and superconducting materials coexist. We observed that oxide F/S samples deposited by high O 2 sputtering and 'eclipse' PLD were similar, and that Tc was clearly more suppressed in F/S compared to N(normal metal) /S systems. However, the magnetic moment and exchange coupling, two magnetic properties of significance in ferromagnets, did not, individually, have a major influence on the increased Tc suppression. The Curie temperatures of the multilayers were suppressed with increasing manganite thickness because of structural effects, and also with increasing thickness of the YBCO layer which reduced the coupling between manganite layers. To study the use of the spin-valve effect as a means to control high temperature superconductors, we fabricated an LSMO/YBCO/LC(0. 3) MO pseudo spin-valve structure, which is equivalent to a superconductor sandwiched within a spin valve where both parallel and antiparallel configurations of the F layers can be achieved within a single magnetic field sweep. Previous research involving a metallic F/S/F/AF structure, showed that the superconductivity was suppressed when the ferromagnets were in the parallel configuration. From the onset of superconductivity, when the normal metallic behaviour of YBCO switches to superconductivity, a magnetoresistance (MR) peak was observed when the F layers were antiparallel. The MR effect increased with decreasing bias current and temperature, characteristic of a pseudo-spin valve. The result is suggestive of spin transport across the YBCO spacer layer.

The d. c. action of the memristor is a current spike which imparts a short-term memory to the device. Here it is demonstrated that this short-term memory works exactly like habituation (e. g. in Aplysia). We elucidate the physical rules, based on energy conservation, governing the interaction of these <b>current</b> spikes: <b>summation,</b> `bounce-back', directionality and `diminishing returns'. Using these rules, we introduce 4 different logical systems to implement sequential logic in the memristor and demonstrate how sequential logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate, an XOR gate and a Full Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the memristor's short-term memory to add together three binary values and outputs the sum, the carry digit and even the order they were input in. A memristor full adder also outputs the arithmetical sum of bits, allowing for a logically (but not physically) reversible system. Essentially, we can replace an input/output port with an extra time-step, allowing a single memristor to do a hither-to unexpectedly large amount of computation. This makes up for the memristor's slow operation speed and may relate to how neurons do a similarly-large computation with such slow operations speeds.

However, it is not well understood how these periodic membrane potential fluctuations affect the integration of synaptic inputs. Here we used sinusoidal current injection to the soma of CA 1 pyramidal neurons in the rat brain slice to simulate background oscillations in the physiologically relevant theta and gamma frequency range. We used a detailed compartmental model to show that somatic current injection gave comparable results to more physiological synaptically driven theta rhythms incorporating excitatory input in the dendrites, and inhibitory input near the soma.

Under the different signal-to-noise ratio level, the <b>summation</b> leakage <b>current</b> was reconstructed by wavelet decomposition reconstruction algorithm. According to the characteristic of the slow change of the normal leakage current and the rapid change of the electric shock current within a short time, the electric shock current were extracted from the restructured <b>summation</b> leakage <b>current</b> signal by sliding window method. The mean square error and correlation analysis between the extracted signal and the actual testing results were studied. The analysis {{results show that the}} proposed method could identify electric shock <b>current</b> in the <b>summation</b> leakage <b>current</b> among noise, and its detection precision was superior to single sliding window method...|$|R
40|$|Several {{completely}} new approaches (such as spintronic, carbon nanotube, graphene, TFETs, etc.) to information processing and data storage technologies are emerging {{to address the}} time frame beyond current Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) roadmap. The high speed magnetization switching of a nano-magnet due to current induced spin-transfer torque (STT) have been demonstrated in recent experiments. Such STT devices can be explored in compact, low power memory and logic design. In order to truly leverage STT devices based computing, researchers require a re-think of circuit, architecture, and computing model, since the STT devices {{are unlikely to be}} drop-in replacements for CMOS. The potential of STT devices based computing will be best realized by considering new computing models that are inherently suited to the characteristics of STT devices, and new applications that are enabled by their unique capabilities, thereby attaining performance that CMOS cannot achieve. The goal of this research is to conduct synergistic exploration in architecture, circuit and device levels for Boolean and brain-inspired computing using nanoscale STT devices. Specifically, we first show that the non-volatile STT devices can be used in designing configurable Boolean logic blocks. We propose a spin-memristor threshold logic (SMTL) gate design, where memristive cross-bar array is used to perform <b>current</b> mode <b>summation</b> of binary inputs and the low power current mode spintronic threshold device carries out the energy efficient threshold operation. Next, for brain-inspired computing, we have exploited different spin-transfer torque device structures that can implement the hard-limiting and soft-limiting artificial neuron transfer functions respectively. We apply such STT based neuron (or ‘spin-neuron’) in various neural network architectures, such as hierarchical temporal memory and feed-forward neural network, for performing “human-like” cognitive computing, which show more than two orders of lower energy consumption compared to state of the art CMOS implementation. Finally, we show the dynamics of injection locked Spin Hall Effect Spin-Torque Oscillator (SHE-STO) cluster can be exploited as a robust multi-dimensional distance metric for associative computing, image/ video analysis, etc. Our simulation results show that the proposed system architecture with injection locked SHE-STOs and the associated CMOS interface circuits can be suitable for robust and energy efficient associative computing and pattern matching. ...|$|R
40|$|This licentiate thesis {{deals with}} the {{high-frequency}} distortion, 1 kHz and higher, introduced into the power grid by the numbers of power converters in use today. These devices can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference and equipment damage {{despite the fact that the}} equipment complies product-standards testing. The thesis discusses upcoming sources of emission, uncertainties in emission level and changing circumstances, with focus on the impact on the neutral conductor and the protective earth. The principles of three-phase power transmission and distribution are presented together with a description of small-signal distribution in order to show the similarity between the two, especially addressing conductive and radiated "signal losses". The response in neutral and protective earth to high-frequency harmonics and fundamental-frequency harmonics is studied separately using a combination of measurements and Matlab simulations and by using symmetrical components. This thesis also includes a description of voltage filters especially designed for measurement of high-frequency harmonic voltage as well as a description of the measurement of high-frequency harmonics in various buildings. The simulations confirmed the cancellations of symmetrical fundamental frequency <b>current</b> and the <b>summations</b> of the zero-sequence harmonics in the neutral wire. The high-frequency harmonic current increased when the number of loads symmetrically increased in the three phases, and there was almost no cancellation. Adding the effect of increasing impedance in wires resulting from increasing frequency, one origin of conductive high- frequency leakage current in the grid is shown.

40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedThe aim {{of these}} two {{experiments}} was to gain systematic data {{on the amount of}} loudness summation measured for dual-electrode stimuli with varying temporal and spatial separation of <b>current</b> pulses. Loudness <b>summation</b> is important in the implementation of speech processing strategies for implantees. However, the loudness mapping functions used in current speech processors utilize psychophysical data (thresholds and comfortable loudness levels) derived using single-electrode stimuli, and do {{not take into account the}} temporal and spatial patterns of the speech processor output. In the first experiment, the current reduction required to equalize the loudness of a dual-electrode stimulus to that of its component (and equally loud) single-electrode stimuli was measured for three electrode separations (0. 75, 2. 25, and 7. 5 mm), three repetition rates (250, 500, and 1000 Hz), and two loudness levels (comfortably loud, and mid-dynamic range). It was found that electrode separation had little effect on loudness summation, except for interactions with level and rate effects at the smallest separation. More current adjustment (in dB) was required for higher rates and lower levels of stimulation. The second experiment investigated the effects of mode (monopolar versus bipolar) and pulse duration on loudness <b>summation.</b> More <b>current</b> adjustment was required in bipolar mode than in monopolar mode at the lower level only. The main effects in both experiments, and their interactions, are consistent with a loudness model in which the neural excitation density is first obtained by temporal integration of excitation at each cochlear place, then converted to specific loudness via a nonlinear relationship, and finally integrated over cochlear place to obtain the loudness. The two important features which affect the loudness relationships in dual-electrode stimulation in this model are the shape of the excitation density function and the amount by which the neural spike probability per pulse is reduced in areas of overlapping excitation due to refractory effects.

6000|$|Eventually these {{experiences}} may be consciously generalized, {{and there may}} result a deliberate pursuit of sympathetic gratifications. There may also come to be distinctly recognized the truths that the remoter results, kind and unkind conduct, are respectively beneficial and detrimental--that due regard for others is conducive to ultimate personal welfare, and disregard of others to ultimate personal disaster; and then there may become <b>current</b> such <b>summations</b> of experience as [...] "honesty is the best policy." [...] But so far from regarding these intellectual recognitions of utility as preceding and causing the moral sentiment, I regard the moral sentiment as preceding such recognitions of utility, and making them possible. The pleasures and pains directly resulting in experience from sympathetic and unsympathetic actions, had first to be slowly associated with such actions, and the resulting incentives and deterrents frequently obeyed, before there could arise the perceptions that sympathetic and unsympathetic actions are remotely beneficial or detrimental to the actor; {{and they had to}} be obeyed still longer and more generally before there could arise the perceptions that they are socially beneficial or detrimental. When, however, the remote effects, personal and social, have gained general recognition, are expressed in current maxims, and lead to injunctions having the religious sanction, the sentiments that prompt sympathetic actions and check unsympathetic ones are immensely strengthened by their alliances. Approbation and reprobation, divine and human, come to be associated in thought with the sympathetic and unsympathetic actions respectively. The commands of the creed, the legal penalties, and the code of social conduct, unitedly enforce them; and every child as it grows up, daily has impressed on it by the words and faces and voices of those around the authority of these highest principles of conduct. And now we may see why there arises a belief in the special sacredness of these highest principles, and a sense of the supreme authority of the altruistic sentiments answering to them. Many of the actions which, in early social states, received the religious sanction and gained public approbation, had the drawback that such sympathies as existed were outraged, and there was hence an imperfect satisfaction. Whereas these altruistic actions, while similarly having the religious sanction and gaining public approbation, bring a sympathetic consciousness of pleasure given or of pain prevented; and, beyond this, bring a sympathetic consciousness of human welfare at large, as being furthered by making altruistic actions habitual. Both this special and this general sympathetic consciousness become stronger and wider in proportion as the power of mental representation increases, and the imagination of consequences, immediate and remote, grows more vivid and comprehensive. Until at length these altruistic sentiments begin to call in question the authority of those ego-altruistic sentiments which once ruled unchallenged. They prompt resistance to laws that do not fulfil the conception of justice, encourage men to brave the frowns of their fellows by pursuing a course at variance with customs that are perceived to be socially injurious, and even cause dissent from the current religion; either to the extent of disbelief in those alleged divine attributes and acts not approved by this supreme moral arbiter, or to the extent of entire rejection of a creed which ascribes such attributes and acts.|$|R
40|$|Esta tesis {{doctoral}} es una investigación cuantitativa y cualitativa, descriptiva y analítica, basada en el método de análisis de contenido, que tiene por objeto de estudio el contenido que los periodistas profesionales españoles difunden en Twitter. El propósito del estudio es describir ese contenido, analizarlo e inferir de ello determinadas tendencias. Se pretende hallar en tales tendencias indicaciones relativas a la consideración del papel de Twitter por parte de los periodistas en el proceso de cambio general que experimenta el periodismo en el marco de la Red. Ello podría ayudar a advertir indicios de actividad innovadora en la Red por parte de los autores de los tuits que forman el corpus de la investigación. En la investigación se utiliza el método de análisis de contenido desarrollado por Berelson, Holsti y Krippendorff introduciendo algunas adaptaciones metodológicas y técnicas al aplicarlo a un objeto de estudio que se da en una determinación tecnológica muy distinta a la usual {{en el momento}} que fue creado aquel método: las redes sociales de internet. Por ello, la tesis pretende aportar algunas innovaciones metodológicas al respecto que puedan ajustar las metodologías establecidas en el estudio de los medios de comunicación de masas a las nuevas y cambiantes realidades que presentan las redes sociales de internet en el contexto y evolución de la Web 2. 0. La hipótesis principal propone que los periodistas españoles publican en Twitter contenido de distinta naturaleza según trabajen en medios masivos o en cibermedios. La diferencia denota distintos posicionamientos respecto al papel de Internet en las tareas periodísticas. Tales tendencias implican prioridades distintas en el abordaje de la actualidad, así como determinadas concepciones de la profesión y la Red. El trabajo de campo alcanza el análisis de 3. 500 tuits y 350 portadas de periódicos, que corresponden, los primeros, a dos muestras formadas por 20 cuentas de Twitter de otros tantos periodistas, y las segundas, a una muestra compuesta de cinco diarios de referencia publicados en Barcelona y Madrid. El seguimiento de las muestras ha sido realizado durante siete días, no consecutivos y en semanas escalonadas, lo que supone un contexto de actualidad comprendido en el marco temporal de siete semanas. Las conclusiones de la tesis apuntan a la relación entre el periodismo español de ahora y las expectativas de innovación del mismo en los nuevos escenarios de la Red. The actual {{doctoral thesis}} is a quantitative and qualitative, descriptive and analytic research, based in the content analysis method, whose object is the content that professional spanish journalists spread through Twitter. The purpose {{of this research is}} describying that content, analyzing it and deduce from it certain tendences. The aim is to find in them data referring to the way how journalists considere Twitter’s role amid the general change process that journalism is suffering in the Web frame. Tendences and data could help to find traces of innovating activity in the Web shown by the senders of tweets analyzed from the research corpus. In this research the content analysis method developed by Berelson, Holsti and Krippendorff is used, introducing some methodological and technical adaptations {{due to the fact that}} the object of study is given in a dramatically different technological determination that the prevailing in the time when analysis content method was created: the internet’s social networks. For that reason this thesis would introduce some methodological innovations on that subject that could update the established methodologies used in the study of mass media communications and adapt them to the new and changing realities shown by the internet’s social networks in the frame and evolution of the Web 2. 0. Tha main hypothesis of the research proposes that the spanish journalists publish on Twitter diferent nature of content either they work in mass media or cybermedia. That difference indicates different stances concerning the role of Internet in newsmaking. These stances mean different priorities in the approach of current affairs, just like certain considerations on the journalism and the Net. The field work includes an analysis of 3. 500 tweets and 350 journals front pages, belonging either to two samples composed by 20 Twitter accounts corresponding to the same amount of journalists and one sample composed by five reference daily newspapers published in Barcelona and Madrid. The following of these samples has been carried out during seven days, non consecutive and in staggered weeks, what means a frame of seven weeks period of <b>current</b> issues. The <b>summation</b> of the thesis shows a relation between the current journalism as is practiced in Spain and the innovation expectations in the new scenes in the Net...|$|R
