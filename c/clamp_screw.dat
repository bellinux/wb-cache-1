50|$|A single {{nanotube}} {{experiences a}} change in electrical resistance when experiencing stress or strain. This piezoresistive effect changes the current flow through the nanotube, which {{can be measured in}} order to accurately quantify the applied stress. A semi-random positioning of many overlapping nanotubes forms an electrically conducting network composed of many piezoresistive nanotubes. If the variance of the tube lengths and angles are known and controllable during manufacture, an eigensystem approach can be used to determine the expected current flow between any two points in the network. The tube network is embedded within orthopedic plates, clamps, and screws and in bone grafts {{in order to determine the}} state of bone healing by measuring the effect of a load on the plate, <b>clamp,</b> <b>screw,</b> or other fixation device attached to the bone. A healed bone will bear most of the load while a yet unhealed bone will defer the load to the fixation device wherein the nanotube network may measure the change in resistivity. Measurement is done wirelessly by electrical induction. This allows the doctor to accurately assess patient healing and also allows the patient to know how much stress the affected area may safely tolerate. Wolff's law indicates that bone responds positively to safe amounts of stress, which may be necessary for proper healing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{latitude}} arc is {{that which}} is attached by screws to the plate. It stands nearly vertical to the plate. The hour arc lies partly horizontal over the levels, and the declination arc placed upon a revolving limb, above the plate, and other fixtures of the solar apparatus. On this revolving limb is placed another movable limb, which turns on a joint at one end, and the other end, with a vernier, moves over the declination arc, with a <b>clamp</b> <b>screw,</b> to clamp it to the sun's declination for the time being. At each end of this described limb, there is attached to it a small brass plate standing out {{at right angles with}} the limb, and into the upper side of one and the lower side of the other, is set a small convex lens. Opposite to each lens on the brass plates there is attached a small silver plate, by means of three small screws and on each of these, lines are drawn at a suitable distance apart to embrace the sun's image, which falls upon each from the lenses. It will be seen, by inspecting this part of the instrument, that it must be used one end towards the sun, when he has north declination, and the other end for south declination.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been made on the cam-clamping device. In this article, we consider specifically the calculations of cam geometry, calculations of clamping force and clamping torque, conditions for self-locking, and conditions for contact strength. Machine fixtures are essential {{in the process of}} mechanical manufacturing. There are many different types of fixtures, such as manual jig, pneumatic clamps, hydraulic fixtures, electric fixtures, etc. There are also many ways of clamping, such as incline <b>clamp,</b> <b>screw</b> clamp, eccentric circle clamp, hinge clamp [1], among which the eccentric circle clamp finds wide applications, especially in fast-clamping devices. Although the circular eccentric fixture possesses the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and low cost, it suffers the drawbacks of small clamping force, short clamping-surface travel distance, and unreliable self-locking mechanism. The cam-clamping device discussesed in this article involves replaceing the eccentric circle with a cam, as shown in Fig. 1. The cam profile curve can be designed according to any requirements. The advantages of this replacement are obvious, in addition to preserving the advantages of the circular eccentric fixture, the cam-clamping can be designed according to the actual needs of clamping paths and selection of the appropriate cam profile to improve the self-locking...|$|E

5000|$|For a sun sight, {{a filter}} {{is used to}} {{overcome}} the glare such as [...] "shades" [...] covering both index mirror and the horizon mirror designed to prevent eye damage. By setting the index bar to zero, the sun can be viewed through the telescope. Releasing the index bar (either by releasing a <b>clamping</b> <b>screw,</b> or on modern instruments, using the quick-release button), {{the image of the}} sun can be brought down to about the level of the horizon. It is necessary to flip back the horizon mirror shade {{to be able to see}} the horizon, and then the fine adjustment screw on the end of the index bar is turned until the bottom curve (the lower limb) of the sun just touches the horizon. 'Swinging' the sextant about the axis of the telescope ensures that the reading is being taken with the instrument held vertically. The angle of the sight is then read from the scale on the arc, making use of the micrometer or vernier scale provided. The exact time of the sight must also be noted simultaneously, and the height of the eye above sea-level recorded.|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{in metal}} cutting {{is a common}} problem in the {{manufacturing}} industry, especially when long and slender tool holders or boring bars {{are involved in the}} manufacturing process. Vibration has a detrimental effect on machining. In particular the surface finish is likely to suffer, but tool life is also most likely to be reduced. Tool vibration also results in loud noise that may disturb the working environment. The first part of this thesis describes the development of a robust and manually adjustable analog controller capable of actively controlling boring bar vibrations related to internal turning. This controller is compared with an adaptive digital feedback filtered-x LMS controller and it displays similar performance with a vibration attenuation of up to 50 dB. A thorough experimental investigation of the influence of the clamping properties on the dynamic properties of clamped boring bars is also carried out in second part of the thesis. In relation to this, it is demonstrated that the number of <b>clamping</b> <b>screws,</b> the <b>clamping</b> <b>screw</b> diameter size, the screw tightening torque and the order the screws are tightened, have a significant influence on a clamped boring barâ€™s eigenfrequencies as well as on its mode shape orientation in the cutting speed - cutting depth plane. Also, an initial investigation of nonlinear dynamic properties of clamped boring bars was carried out. Furthermore, vibration in milling has also been studied in relation to millingtool holders with a long overhang. A basic investigation concerning the spatial dynamic properties of the tool holders of milling machines, both when not cutting and during cutting, has been carried out. Also, active control of milling tool holder vibration has been investigated and a first prototype of an active milling tool holder was implemented and tested. The challenge of transferring electrical power while maintaining good signal quality to and from a rotating object is addressed and a solution to this is proposed. Finally, vibration is also a problem for the hydroelectric power industry. In Sweden, hydroelectric power plants stand for approximately half of Swedenâ€™s electrical power production and are also considered to be a so-called green source of energy. When renovating water turbines in small-scale hydroelectric power plants and modifying them to optimize efficiency, it is not uncommon that disturbing vibrations occur in the power plant. These vibrations have a negative influence on the production capacity and will wear various components quickly. Occasionally, these vibrations may cause severe damage to the power plant. To identify this vibration problem, experimental modal analysis and operating deflection shape analysis were utilized. To reduce the vibration problem, active control using inertial mass actuators was investigated. Preliminary results indicate a significant attenuation of the vibrations...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the present {{investigation}} [9], the dynamic behaviour of a rigid rotor supported on plain journal bearings was studied, focusing particular attention on its nonlinear aspects. In the present paper an experimental confirmation of the theoretical results is sought. The steel rotor of the experimental rig was given a constant circular cross section in order to fix in an easy way the two distances between supports corresponding, respectively, to the values of the parameter assigned in [9]. Two steel rings, each one with a series of holes and a <b>clamping</b> <b>screw,</b> were mounted onto the rotor with a small clearance. This arrangement made it possible to fix the positions of the rings and their holes respect to the rotor, so as to realize a pre-estabilished unbalance. The two bronze journal bearings were characterised by a relatively low length/diameter ratio, and a relatively high value of the radial clearance and were lubricated with oil delivered from a thermostatic tank. In this way, despite the relative lightness of the rotor, the dimensionless static eccentricity swas given the high values that were apt to realize the operating conditions assumed in the theoretical analysis. The rotor was driven by means of a d. c. motor connected to a toothed belt-drive. Varying the rotor speed in the range 1000 Ã· 10000 r. p. m., made it possible to assign the values of the modified Sommerfeld number assumed in the theoretical analysis. Three pairs of eddy-current probes were mounted in order to detect the trajectories of three points (C 1, C and C 2) suitably fixed along the rotor axis. These orbits were finally put in comparison with the corresponding ones previously obtained through numerical analysis. The comparison pointed out that the experimental data were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, despite the approximations that characterise the theoretical model and the unavoidable errors affecting measures in the course of the experimental test...|$|R
