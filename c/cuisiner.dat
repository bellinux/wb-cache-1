25|$|Liège waffles, {{the most}} popular {{contemporary}} Belgian waffle variety, are rumored to have been invented during the 18th century, as well, by the chef to the prince-bishop of Liège. However, there are no German, French, Dutch, or Belgian cookbooks that contain references to them in this period – by any name – nor are there any waffle recipes that mention the Liège waffle's distinctive ingredients, brioche-based dough and pearl sugar. It is not until 1814 that Antoine Beauvilliers publishes a recipe in l'Art du <b>Cuisiner</b> where brioche dough is introduced as {{the base of the}} waffle and sucre cassé (crushed block sugar) is used as a garnish for the waffles, though not worked into the dough. Antonin Carême, the famous Parisian pastry chef, is the first to incorporate gros sucre into several waffle variations named in his 1822 work, Le Maitre d'Hotel Français. Then, in 1834, Leblanc publishes a complete recipe for gaufres grêlées (hail waffles), where gros sucre is mixed in. A full Gaufre de Liège recipe does not appear until 1921.|$|E

40|$|The ancient way {{of cooking}} : Apicius in the Middle Ages - Assembled {{in the late}} fourth century, the {{cookbook}} which tradition has attributed to Apicius had a predominantly medieval destiny. Serving as a practical and living text until the sixth century, it became known from that time onward as a purely literary and dead work. This was notably the case during the Carolingian Renaissance, when the scriptoria of Tours and of Fulda produced manuscripts of the cookbook and where, it seems, Loup de Ferrières, {{as well as all}} those who were inspired by it, used Apicius' text. It was afterwards practically forgotten, until its rediscovery in the fifteenth century by the humanists. The credit for this is due not to Poggio, but to Enoch of Ascoli, who brought a manuscript back to Italy. The rediscovery, however, had only a limited influence, {{with the exception of the}} Roman Academy of Pomponio Leto, where Apicius was used notably by Platina to define his humanist gastronomy.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to French literature, male authors’ {{writings}} abound and we acknowledge that many contemporary writings are characterized by the staging of a hybrid subject, who lives an identity crisis. Indeed, the novels deal with {{the crisis of the}} subject that is in an in-between, between the culture of the home country and the culture of the host country. The male authors abound but, African women having now acquired the right to speak publish more. Especially given the current context of globalization, the concerns raised by these women have changed. They address issues such as immigration, {{the role of women in}} society and the hybrid culture. However, instead of a perpetual quest of the subject, these women put forward a female subject who is working to rebuild its identity in a country that is not his, to question the place of women in the society, to denounce social behavior and / or policies of the homeland and host country. The analysis of two women writers’ novels: Comment <b>cuisiner</b> son mari à l’africaine by Calixthe Beyala and Le ventre de l’Atlantique by Fatou Diome allows us to question the identity through various literary concepts and question the existence of an African feminism...|$|E
40|$|In their {{discussion}} - Professionalism and Ethics in Hospitality - by James R. Keiser, Associate Professor and John Swinton, Instructor, Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management, The Pennsylvania State University, Keiser and Swinton initially offer: “Referring to “the hospitality profession” necessitates {{thinking of the}} ethics of that profession and how ethics can be taught. The authors discuss {{what it means for}} the hospitality industry to be a profession. ” The authors will have you know, a cursory nod to the term or description, profession and/or professional, is awarded to the hospitality industry at large; at least in an academic sense. Keiser and Swinton also {{want you to know that}} ethics, and professionalism are distinctly unique concepts, however, they are related. Their intangible nature does make them difficult, at best, to define, but ethics in contemporary hospitality has, to some degree, been charted and quantified. “We have left the caveat emptor era, and the common law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and a variety of local ordinances now dictate that the goods and services hospitality offers carry an implied warranty of merchantability,” the authors inform you. About the symbiotic relationship between ethics and professionalism, the authors say this: The less precise a code of ethics goes, the general rule, the fewer claims the group has to professional status. ” The statement above may be considered a cornerstone principle. “However, the mere existence of an ethical code (or of professional status, for that matter) does not ensure ethical behavior in any group,” caution Keiser and Swinton. “Codes of ethics do not really define professionalism except as they adopt a group 2 ̆ 7 s special, arcane, exclusionary jargon. Worse, they can define the minimum, agreed-upon standards of conduct and thereby encourage ethical corner-cutting,” they further qualify the thought. And, in bridging academia, Keiser and Swinton say, “Equipped now with a sense of the ironies and ambiguities inherent in labeling any work 2 ̆ 2 professional, 2 ̆ 2 we can turn to the problem of instilling in students a sense of what is professionally ethical. Students appear to welcome this kind of instruction, and while we would like to think their interest comes welling up from altruism and intellectual curiosity rather than drifting down as Watergate and malpractice fallout, our job is to teach, not to weigh the motives that bring us our students, and to provide a climate conducive to ethical behavior, not supply a separate answer for every contingency. ” Keiser and Swinton illustrate their treatise on ethics via the hypothetical tale [stylized case study] of Cosmo <b>Cuisiner,</b> who manages the Phoenix, a large suburban restaurant. Cosmo is “…a typical restaurant manager faced with a series of stylized, over-simplified, but illustrative decisions, each with its own ethical skew for the students to analyze. ” A shortened version of that case study is presented.
