50|$|A <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Airworthiness (CofA), or an {{airworthiness}} certificate, {{is issued}} for an aircraft {{by the national}} aviation authority {{in the state in}} which the aircraft is registered. The airworthiness certificate attests that the aircraft is airworthy insofar as the aircraft conforms to its type design. Each airworthiness certificate is issued in one of a number <b>of</b> different <b>categories.</b> A <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> airworthiness is issued when the aircraft is registered {{in the name of the}} owner. Thereafter, a yearly currency fee is payable to renew the <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Airworthiness. If this fee is not paid when due, the certificate expires and the owner must apply again for this certificate to be issued. The <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Airworthiness can only be issued when a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> release to service from the maintenance facility declares that the maintenance due has been carried out and the aircraft is then certified as being airworthy.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was unstable and underpowered, and after just nine hours of test flying, it was grounded {{to try to}} solve some of the problems. Test flying resumed in August 1949 but the aircraft had further engine problems. Changes were made to the design of the tail unit including fitting a dorsal fin and increasing the fin area to improve the flying qualities. In October 1950, a limited <b>category</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Airworthiness was granted to allow the aircraft to carry non-fare paying passengers. One proving flight - between Baginton and Paris taking 1 hr 26 min - was carried out on 12 March 1951.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{the person}} in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority {{specifically}} for ballooning; {{this is known as}} the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport <b>category</b> C <b>of</b> A (<b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor's guests, and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required. For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In ad-hoc {{networks}} and other highly distributed and decentralized environments, authorization certificates {{can be used}} to control access. Moreover, it is possible to delegate rights listed in the certificate to another users. Several such subsequent delegations build a chain <b>of</b> <b>certificates.</b> Chains <b>of</b> delegation <b>certificates</b> can improve the capability and manageability of systems. Distributed group membership management, i. e. managing groups of users in a distributed environment, utilizes the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> chains. Adding, removing as well as authentication of users is managed by chains <b>of</b> delegation <b>certificates.</b> On the other hand, the size <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> chains could be too long to be usable. In this paper {{we take a look at}} distributed group membership management based on delegation certificates. Then we present a new kind <b>of</b> <b>certificate,</b> the implanted chain certificate, and its characteristics. With this new kind <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> the verification time <b>of</b> a <b>certificate</b> chain can be decreased without losing delegation information. Finally, we compare our verification method to reduce the time of verification...|$|R
