This led to accidents, a Board of Trade investigation, and cautions from Doxford on proper loading. The design also was inconvenient, as the narrowness of the turret made for smaller cargo hatches and restricted habitation spaces in the superstructure atop the turret.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a comparison with experimental {{data of the}} resistance of stiffened panels to penetration damage. It also carried out comparisons between numerical simulations and experiments investigating the grounding of ships. The finite element method and FEA software are used to predict penetration damage and this modelling simulation is then extended to investigate damage to a ship’s <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> structure in different grounding scenarios. The progressive failure of the <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> is investigated in terms of plastic deformation and also the evolution of damage including material rupture. Three different levels of complexity were used in modelling the <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> structure concerning {{the inner and outer}} shell plating; longitudinal stiffeners in the shell plating, and structures with stiffening in longitudinal floors. The analysis was carried out in the ABAQUS explicit code. The results presented include the crushing force as a function of time, an investigation of the energies involved in the plastic deformation and rupture of the <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> structure, and comparisons with experimental data where available...|$|R

40|$|Achieving the <b>Double</b> <b>Bottom</b> Line: A Framework for Corporations Seeking to Deliver Profits and Public Services {{argues that}} many people who object to for-profit {{corporations}} that deliver public services, such as kindergarten through 12 th grade education or foster care, have greatly exaggerated {{the extent to which}} the for-profit regime will compel such corporations to subordinate the delivery of those services to financial considerations. Because of this over-exaggeration, these opponents have not focused on designing a framework that would assist these entities in meeting their <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line—achieving profit for their shareholders while also delivering a high quality public service. The Article seeks to remedy this failure. The Article therefore proposes that <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line corporations be required to have an independent committee, similar to the audit committee, which would focus not on financial issues, but rather on issues pertaining to the attainment of the entities’ public goals. By providing for both committees within the corporate framework, this proposal makes it more likely that <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line corporations actually achieve their dual objectives...|$|R

50|$|The ship {{consisted}} of a steel hull with high bulwarks and a <b>double</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>bottom</b> four feet deep and used 1,000 tons of water ballast. She measured 5,218 gross register tons, could carry nearly 11,000 tons of coal, and was operated by a crew of 16 to 18 including captain, engineer, two helmsmen, and two stewards. Due to the shallow depth of the eastern ports except Newport News, VA, she could not enter them with her maximum load. As a result, she carried a reduced capacity of 7,400 tons {{in order to reduce}} her working draft. She had two continuous decks, poop and forecastle decks, a large superstructure on the poop deck including the captains rooms with fine furniture and leather seats, the officers mess and rooms, card room, and a separate rudder house. On the main deck were two deckhouses around mast no. 5 and behind mast no. 6, as well as six main hatches to access the holds between the masts. Two huge steam winches were built in under the forecastle and behind mast no. 6. on the main deck. Smaller electrically driven winches were installed beside each mast. The exhaust for the donkey engine boiler was horizontally installed. All seven lower steel masts were secured by five (foremast: six) shrouds per side, the wooden topmasts with four shrouds per side to the crosstrees. The two ships stockless anchors weighed five tons each.|$|R

A relative enhancement in short-circuit current approximately 68 % and 55 % is achieved with dual grating and <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> grating-based solar cells, respectively.
