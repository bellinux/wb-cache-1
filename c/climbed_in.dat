5|$|High on {{the eastern}} flank of Mount Rainier is a peak known as Little Tahoma Peak, , an eroded remnant of the earlier, much higher, Mount Rainier. It has a {{prominence}} of , and it is almost never <b>climbed</b> <b>in</b> direct conjunction with Columbia Crest, so it is usually considered a separate peak. If considered separately from Mt. Rainier, Little Tahoma Peak would be the third highest mountain peak in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, <b>climbed</b> <b>in</b> the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Raithel {{recovered}} from his wounds {{and had a}} career in agriculture after the war, working in South Africa for many years. He returned to Bavaria when he retired and earned a doctorate of history from the University of Munich. He continued with mountaineering and regularly <b>climbed</b> <b>in</b> the Alps into his seventies. He maintained contact with his former comrades from the 6th SS Division Nord and attended many reunions. On 12 September 1990 {{at the age of}} 82, he was returning home from the Semmering Pass in eastern Austria when he was killed in a traffic accident.|$|E

50|$|The hill is {{best known}} from cycling, where it is a regular <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> the Flemish races in spring, most notably the Tour of Flanders. It {{is one of the}} most iconic <b>climbs</b> <b>in</b> the region, because of its steep slopes and narrow badly-surfaced cobbled road. Its average {{gradient}} is 7% with its steepest point, 14.2%, in the middle of the <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> a right-hand bend.|$|R
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from Old Red Sandstone, {{it is one of the}} tallest stacks in Britain. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first <b>climbed</b> <b>in</b> 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and may soon collapse into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The valleys that delimit the massif {{were used}} as {{communication}} routes by the Romans until they left around the 5thcentury AD. The region has remained of some military importance through to the mid-20thcentury. A peasant farming economy operated within these valleys for many centuries until the glaciers and mountains were discovered by the outside world in the 18thcentury. Word of these impressive sights began to spread, and Mont Blanc was finally <b>climbed</b> <b>in</b> 1786, marking {{the start of the}} sport of mountaineering. The region is now a major tourist destination, drawing in over sixmillion visitors per year. It provides a wide range of opportunities for outdoor recreation and activities such as sight-seeing, hiking, rock climbing, mountaineering and skiing. Around one hundred people a year die across its mountains and, occasionally, bodies have been lost and entombed in its glaciers for decades.|$|E
25|$|Because Mount Everest is {{the highest}} {{mountain}} in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts.

25|$|Efforts {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s {{explored}} the other faces of El Capitan, {{and many of}} the early routes are still popular today. Among the early classics are Salathé Wall (1961, Royal Robbins, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost) on the southwest face, and the North America Wall (1964, Royal Robbins, Yvon Chouinard, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost) on the southeast face. Also <b>climbed</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s are routes such as: Dihedral Wall (1962, Ed Cooper, Jim Baldwin and Glen Denny); West Buttress (1963, Layton Kor and Steve Roper); and Muir Wall (1965, Yvon Chouinard and TM Herbert).|$|E
25|$|An Caisteal, which {{qualifies as}} a Munro, {{is located in a}} popular area for hill walking within a group of seven Munros and {{fourteen}} tops which stand on the eastern side of Glen Falloch in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The mountain reaches a height of 995 metres (3,264 feet) and is usually <b>climbed</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the neighbouring Munro of Beinn a' Chroin to which it is connected by a high col to the south east. The mountains name translates from the Gaelic as “the castle” and is believed to refer to the prominent castellated rocks close to the mountain's summit which serve as an easy way of identifying the mountain from a distance.|$|E
25|$|Loft Crag has an {{altitude}} of 2,238ft (682metres). It lies between Harrison Stickle and Pike o’ Stickle and is usually <b>climbed</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with these two peaks. The starting place for the direct ascent of the fell is The New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale. A path leads north-westerly across the hillside passing Dungeon Ghyll Force waterfall and going between Thorn Crag and Gimmer Crag to a col between Loft Crag and Harrison Stickle. From there it is a straightforward climb to the summit. A more circuitous ascent can be undertaken from the same starting point but taking the well trodden (and repaired) path up Stickle Ghyll to Stickle Tarn. From here the fells of Pavey Ark and Thunacar Knott can be climbed before tackling the three Langdale Pikes.|$|E
