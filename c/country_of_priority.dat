40|$|Angola is {{currently}} {{passing through a}} political, economic and social crisis deeper than in most other African countries. The MPLA government and the former rebel movement UNIT A signed a peace agreement in Lusaka in November 1994, but peace and reconstruction are still not secured. Whereas previous international involvement in Angola has had mainly negative effects through colonialism and Cold War, emergency and development aid has increased substantially after the renewed outbreak of war in 1992 when UNIT A lost in democratic elections. Also Norway's development aid to Angola has increased considerably. With NOK 182 million in 1995, Angola is the fourth largest recipient of Norwegian aid in Africa. This report outlines the political, economic and social situation in Angola, and discusses international and Norwegian aid to the country. It is argued that Norway should continue its involvement in Angola, also beyond the current emergency interventions, by making it a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority.</b> The report was commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Inge Tvedten is a social anthropologist and researcher at the Chr. Michelsen Institute. Re has worked in Angola for a total period of more than three years, and published extensively on the country. A book entitled "Angola. Towards Peace and Reconstruction" {{will be published by}} Westview Press in early 1997.

Brazilian population makes secular use of medicinal plants including andiroba, whose oil is used in folk medicine as febrifuge, pain-relieving, anti-parasitic, anti-allergic as well as insect repellant. The present study attempts to evaluate the profile of utilization of andiroba by analyzing the patenting trends based on information collected on the databases of the World Intellectual Property Organization, European Patent Office and Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property in the period from 1990 to 2011. The following parameters were analyzed: chronological aspect <b>of</b> the applications, <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority,</b> international patent classification, technologies and actors in the technological platform. The temporal analysis of the applications shows an evident increase despite a discontinuous evolution of the number of applications. Pharmaceutical, chemical and cosmetic areas were identified as the main areas for commercial application of the plant.

We profi le global and country progress against these recommendations between 2012 and 2015. Methods For 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that were off -track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for maternal and child survival, we reviewed key documents and reference data, and conducted interviews with ministry staff and partners to assess {{the status of the}} UNCoLSC recommendations. The RMNCH fund provided short-term catalytic fi nancing to support country plans to advance the commodity agenda, with activities coded by UNCoLSC recommendation. Our network of technical resource teams identifi ed, addressed, and monitored progress against cross-cutting commodity-related challenges that needed coordinated global action. Findings In 2014 and 2015, child and maternal health commodities had fewer bottlenecks than reproductive and neonatal commodities. Common bottlenecks included regulatory challenges (ten of 12 countries); poor quality assurance (11 of 12 countries); insuffi cient staff training (more than half of facilities on average); and weak supply chains systems (11 <b>of</b> 12 <b>countries),</b> with stock-outs <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> commodities in about 40...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze {{theoretical}} and practical aspects {{of the features of}} the IFI influence on transformation of national currency systems of such organizations’ member states. Defining features of interaction policy among national economies and IFI in the monetary sphere, considering countries’ socio-economic parameters of development, will allow monetary authorities to achieve the optimum level of development of its economy. Methodology. Theoretical base of the study are the provisions of general scientific theory of knowledge studied phenomena and processes, in particular: methods of induction and deduction (in determining classification criteria of IFIs impact on national currency system), analysis and synthesis (in determining the features and <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> national currency system), comparisons, associations and analogies (the justification of characteristics of advantages and disadvantages of IFI). The information base for scientific research is scientific papers and publications of domestic and foreign scientists-economists, materials of scientific-practical conferences, legislative and normative documents, the IMF, World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank materials. Results. Theoretical approaches to the definition of the national currency system and international financial organizations, including its classification, are proposed. It is proved that the IMF makes active impact on national currency policy formation through regulation and supervision, while the World Bank and AIIB are related in a passive way. The IFI regulation trends are to implement floating exchange regime, liberal currency transactions, cancel currency restrictions in member countries. Although it refers to all <b>countries,</b> some <b>of</b> them with large population, trading, underdeveloped institutions of democracy could avoid some IFI pressure. Practical implications. The study accents attention on the specifics of the IFI activity in terms of changing the currency policy <b>of</b> member <b>countries.</b> Comparison <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> among national currency policy and IFI recommendations could be applicable for national authorities in performing national currency policy. Value/originality.
