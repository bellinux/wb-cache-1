50|$|Liriodendron chinense is {{very similar}} to the American species, Liriodendron tulipifera, differing in the often {{slightly}} larger and more deeply lobed leaves, and in the shorter inner petals in the flowers, which lack the orange pigment of L. tulipifera. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>tulip</b> <b>tree</b> reaches about 40 m tall.|$|E

There {{they already have}} {{blooming}} and fruiting self-seeds. <b>Chinese</b> <b>tulip</b> poplar sometimes reaches here bigger sizes than in natural habitat. It resists winter temperatures very well. Both species can be jointly used along the Caucasian Black Sea coast as ornamental trees because there are the most favorable conditions for their vegetation. Due the great resistance American <b>tulip</b> <b>trees</b> can grow along the coastline as well as inland of Ajara...|$|R

5000|$|Liriodendron chinense (commonly {{known as}} the Chinese tulip poplar, <b>Chinese</b> <b>tulip</b> <b>tree</b> or Chinese whitewood) is Asia's native species in the Liriodendron genus. This native of central and {{southern}} China grows in the provinces of Anhui, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Yunnan, and also locally in northern Vietnam. Protected populations occur in the Tianmushan National Reservehttp://english.sepa.gov.cn/SOE/soechina1999/biod/biod.htm, Huangshanhttp://huangshancits.com/english/SmallClass.asp?typeid=16&BigClassID=18&SmallClassID=69, Wuyi Shanhttp://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/mt_wuyi.html, and Badagongshan Nature Reservehttp://www.sekj.org/PDF/anbf38/anbf38-305p.pdf.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} found in hill forests at {{elevations}} of 1000 - 3200 m above sea level, although {{it is the most}} common between 1500 - 2500 m; it can descent to low altitudes in winter. It is gregarious, active and quite tame. It keeps to lower forest and often joins other species, especially tits in mixed flocks. The flocks, while feeding, make a constant soft chatter. The call of the Taiwan yuhina is a sound somewhat like twi-MI-chiu, which resembles the phrase [...] "We MEET you". The yuhina's diet consists of mainly nectar, berries, flowers and small insects. Taiwan yuhina may sometimes be observed hanging upside down on cherry trees. These songbirds are particularly fond of the flowers of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>tulip</b> <b>tree</b> and the fruits of trees of the family Elaeagnaceae and the genus Idesia (Salicaceae).|$|E

Based on mycological characteristics, patho-genicity, and internal transcribed spacer sequence, the causal fungus was identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

40|$|A {{configuration}} {{space of}} homologous protein sequences (or CSHP) has been recently constructed based on pairwise comparisons, with probabilities deduced from Z-value statistics (Monte Carlo methods applied to pairwise comparisons) and following evolutionary assumptions. A Z-value cut-off is applied so as proteins {{are placed in}} the CSHP only when the similarity of pairs of sequences is significant following the Theorem of the Upper Limit of a score Probability (TULIP theorem). Based on the positions of similar protein sequences in the CSHP, a classification can be deduced, which can be visualized as <b>trees,</b> called <b>TULIP</b> <b>trees.</b> In previous case studies, <b>TULIP</b> <b>trees</b> where shown {{to be consistent with}} phylogenetic trees. To date, no tool has been made available to allow the computation of <b>TULIP</b> <b>trees</b> following this model. The availability of methods to cluster proteins based on pairwise comparisons and following evolutionary assumptions should be useful for evaluation and for the future improvements they might inspire. We developed a web server allowing the local or online computation of <b>TULIP</b> <b>trees</b> based on the CSHP probabilities. The input is a set of homologous protein sequences in multi-FASTA format. Pairwise comparisons are conducted using the Smith-Waterman method, with 100 - 1, 000 sequence shuffling to estimate pairwise Z-values. Obtained Z-value matrix is used to infer a tree which is then written to a file. Output consists therefore of a Z-value matrix, a distance matrix, a TULIP treefile in NEWICK format, and a <b>TULIP</b> <b>tree</b> visualisation. The <b>TULIP</b> server provides an easy-to-use interface to the TULIP software, and allows a classification of protein sequences based on pairwise alignments and following evolutionary assumptions. <b>TULIP</b> <b>trees</b> are consistent with phylogenies in numerous cases, but they can be inconsistent for multi-domain proteins in which some domains have been conserved in all branches. Thus <b>TULIP</b> <b>trees</b> cannot be considered as conventional phylogenetic trees, following the MIAPA (Minimum Information About a Phylogenetic Analysis) recommendations. A major strength of the TULIP classification is its statistical validity when analysing samples including compositionally unbiased and biased sequences (i. e. with biased amino acid distributions), like sequences from Plasmodium falciparum. The TULIP web server is a service of the Malaria Portal of the University of Pretoria, South Africa, and is available at [URL]...|$|R
