5|$|Egyptian forces {{attempted}} a surprise {{attack on the}} crusaders' camp on 9 October, but John discovered their movements.

The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only the <b>cooperation</b> <b>of</b> John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp.|$|E

As the Maceos reorganized vice in the city and made these businesses more respectable, the council became far more accepting of the criminal enterprises, particularly as they became linchpins of the local economy.
