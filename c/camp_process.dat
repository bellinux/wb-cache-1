40|$|We have {{identified}} two {{processes in the}} G 1 phase of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle that are required before nutritionally arrested cells are {{able to return to}} proliferative growth.

The ability of a nutritionally arrested cell to respond to cAMP is dependent on completion of the first process, and this is delayed in cells carrying a CLN 3 deletion. Mating pheromone blocks the cAMP response but does not alter the process upstream of Ras-cAMP. These results suggest a model linking the Ras-cAMP pathway with regulation of G 1 cyclin expression...|$|R

40|$|Cyclic AMP (<b>cAMP)</b> -dependent <b>processes</b> are pivotal {{during the}} early stages of {{adipocyte}} differentiation. We show that exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ras-like GTPases Rap 1 and Rap 2, was required for cAMP-dependent stimulation of adipocyte differentiation. Epac, working via Rap, acted synergistically with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A [PKA]) to promote adipogenesis. The major role of PKA was to down-regulate Rho and Rho-kinase activity, rather than to enhance CREB phosphorylation. Suppression of Rho-kinase impaired proadipogenic insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, which was restored by activation of Epac. This interplay between PKA and Epac-mediated processes not only provides novel insight into the initiation and tuning of adipocyte differentiation, but also demonstrates a new mechanism of cAMP signaling whereby cAMP uses both PKA and Epac to achieve an appropriate cellular response...|$|R

50|$|The Carter {{administration}} {{was characterized by}} very active US involvement in the Middle East peace process. With the May 1977 election of Likud's Menachem Begin as prime minister, after 30 years of leading the Israeli government opposition, major changes took place regarding Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. This led to friction in US-Israeli bilateral relations. The two frameworks included in the Carter-initiated <b>Camp</b> David <b>process</b> were viewed by right-wing elements in Israel as creating US pressures on Israel {{to withdraw from the}} captured Palestinian territories, as well as forcing it to take risks for the sake of peace with Egypt. Likud governments have since argued that their acceptance of full withdrawal from the Sinai as part of these accords and the eventual Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty fulfilled the Israeli pledge to withdraw from occupied territory. President Carter's support for a Palestinian homeland and for Palestinian political rights particularly created tensions with the Likud government, and little progress was achieved on that front.|$|R
