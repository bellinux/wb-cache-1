500|$|During World War I, Singh {{initially}} {{supported the}} Indian soldiers and Lascars {{working in the}} British fleets and joined a 10,000-woman protest march against the prohibition of a volunteer female force. She eventually wore a Red Cross uniform as a nurse, tending, at Brighton hospital, wounded Indian soldiers who had been evacuated from the Western Front. The Sikh soldiers <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> [...] "that the granddaughter of Ranjit Singh sat by their bedsides in a nurse's uniform".|$|E
500|$|... bout {{five minutes}} later, a most {{incredible}} scene took place. Into the hall sauntered {{about a dozen}} policemen. They were strolling at about the pace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park. They {{did not seem to}} be at all excited or concerned about the circumstances.I <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> my eyes. Here were New York City policemen, entering a room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet not one of them had his gun out! As a matter of absolute fact, some of them even had their hands in their pockets.|$|E

500|$|On August 3, 1907, Landis {{pronounced}} sentence. He fined Standard Oil {{the maximum}} penalty, $29,240,000, the largest fine imposed on a corporation to that point. The corporation quickly appealed; in the meantime, Landis was lionized as a hero. According to Pietrusza, [...] "much {{of the nation}} <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> a federal judge had finally cracked down on a trust—and cracked down hard". [...] President Roosevelt, {{when he heard the}} sentence, reportedly stated, [...] "That's bully." [...] Rockefeller was playing golf in Cleveland when he was brought a telegram containing the news. Rockefeller calmly informed his golfing partners of the amount of the fine, and proceeded to shoot a personal record score, later stating, [...] "Judge Landis will be dead a long time before this fine is paid." [...] He proved correct; the verdict and sentence were reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on July 22, 1908. In January 1909, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, and in a new trial before another judge (Landis recused himself), Standard Oil was acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1888 Test Match at the Oval, George Lohmann {{took what}} Pardon thought was [...] "the finest {{of all the}} catches at cover slip ever brought off by George Lohmann".

2500|$|On 8 April, the {{submarine}} surfaced in a downpour to continue patrols north of West Fayu Island. Later that day, {{she set her}} course to intercept a convoy reported to be southwest of Truk. At 22:28 on 9 April, she made radar contact with a formation less than three miles (5km) distant and went to four engines to maneuver into position for an attack. In a few minutes, the formation changed course, putting Tunny in position to slow down to two-thirds speed and head in, flooded down to decks awash to avoid detection. As the convoy became visible, Tunnys commanding officer, Commander James A. Scott, <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his luck. On the starboard bow was a large aircraft carrier, to port two auxiliary carriers, and on each bow of the formation, a destroyer. Given this perfect setup, Tunny maneuvered to swing the bow on twin targets, but her plans were disrupted when three small boats similar to motor torpedo boats appeared only [...] off her port bow. Tunny quickly dove to , turned right, ninety degrees, and launched four torpedoes from her stern tubes {{at one of the}} auxiliary carriers from a distance of [...] As she turned her attention to other targets, four torpedo explosions sounded through the night.|$|E

2500|$|When Milner was 10 years old, {{he joined}} the Leeds United Academy after being spotted by a scout while playing for Westbrook Juniors in Horsforth. At the academy, Milner played against contemporaries from other clubs in the north, {{including}} future Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. His role model was Leeds-born Alan Smith, who was then a Leeds United striker. Milner believed playing with Smith put him through a learning curve, as Smith had done what Milner aspired to do; that is, {{to come through the}} academy and play for the first team. Having made good progress at the Academy, Milner was taken on as a trainee after leaving school. However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to continue his education. Milner remarked later {{that he did not want}} to get excited and think that he had [...] "made it". He also said he <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> he was playing alongside first-team Leeds players such as David Batty and Olivier Dacourt. He continued to excel in the youth team, and played for England at under-15 and under-17 levels. He helped the England under-17 team win the 2002 Nationwide summer tournament against Italy, Czech Republic and Brazil, scoring a goal against the latter. Milner claims to have never consumed alcohol throughout his life, despite pressures from those around him when he was growing up.|$|E
2500|$|The MCC {{returned}} to Adelaide to play South Australia and {{were put in}} on Christmas Eve by Les Favell on a lively wicket freshened up by the rain that delayed the start. The old Australian fast bowler Tim Wall <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>believe</b> his eyes as the ball leapt up at the batsmen where normally it rarely rose above the stumps. Richardson, Watson, Cowdrey (the captain for this match) and Dexter were out for 34/4 to the long drag of Peter Trethewey (1/33) and Alan Hitchcox (3/48). Arthur Milton stuck in for 37, was hit repeatedly by the ball, broke his finger and Tom Graveney made 54. Tony Lock added 43 before he was out to a juggled caught and bowled by Leon Hill (2/55), which the umpire thought he had under control. Christmas Day was a rest day, but the MCC resumed on 180/7 on Boxing Day, and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman impressed with 41, having made several useful innings on the tour. Fred Trueman belted 39 and John Mortimore 17 of the last 20 runs when they were out for 276. With the wicket drying and better for batting Ted Dexter (2/45) had removed the openers Les Favell and Gavin Stevens after Frank Tyson left the field because of stomach trouble. They started the third day on 110/3, but John Lill (86) was the only man to pass 30 as [...] "Fiery Fred" [...] Trueman took 5/46 and they were out for 223. Wickets continue to tumble with the 19-year-old Brian Hurn taking 5/62 with Willie Watson holding the fort with 40, but the tourists were 110/7 {{at the end of}} the Saturday. With Sunday providing a second rest day Swetman (76) returned before a crowd of 12,000 to raise the total to 195/9 batting as if in a charity match. Cowdrey declared when he was out to leave South Australia 249 runs to win in 195 minutes. The started well with Les Favell (52) and David Harris (30) taking the score to 78/1 after Tyson and Swetman ran out Stevens for a duck, but collapsed to Trueman (4/33), who reduced them to 102/6, and the spinners Lock, Mortimore and Graveney ran through the overs to leave South Australia 138/9 at stumps.|$|E

60|$|The girl {{drew closer}} to the table, and glancing at Monks {{with an air of}} {{careless}} levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> have <b>believed</b> the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.|$|R
60|$|Harding {{shook off}} the girl's hand and, perhaps {{alarmed by the}} look he gave her, she left him and soon {{afterward}} disappeared, but {{when he returned to}} the table Beatrice and her mother had gone.

60|$|The {{heart of}} Barnet was {{sufficiently}} impressionable {{to be influenced}} by Downe's parting prophecy that he might not be so unwelcome home as he imagined: the dreary night might, at least on this one occasion, make Downe's forecast true. Hence it was in a suspense that he <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> have <b>believed</b> possible that he halted at his door. On entering his wife was nowhere to be seen, and he inquired for her. The servant informed him that her mistress had the dressmaker with her, and would be engaged for some time.|$|R
60|$|That {{theory is}} annihilated by M. Funck-Brentano.

Even persons greatly prejudiced in her favour {{might well have been}} deceived, and the people 'loveth to think the worst, and is hardly to be moved from that opinion,' as was said of the Scottish public at the date of the Gowrie conspiracy.|$|R
