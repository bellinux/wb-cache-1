5|$|Brezhnev {{was able}} to criticise Kosygin by {{contrasting}} him with Vladimir Lenin, whom Brezhnev {{claimed to have been}} more interested in improving the conditions of Soviet agriculture than improving the quality of light industrial goods. Kosygin's support for producing more consumer goods was also criticised by Brezhnev, and his supporters, most notably Konstantin Chernenko, for being a return to quasi First World policies. At the 23rd Party Congress Kosygin's position was weakened when Brezhnev's supporters were able to increase expenditure on defence and agriculture. However, Brezhnev did not have a majority in the Politburo, and <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on only four votes. In the Politburo Kosygin <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on Kiril Mazurov's vote, and when Kosygin and Podgorny were not bickering with each other, they actually had a majority in the Politburo over Brezhnev. Unfortunately for Kosygin this was not often the case, and Kosygin and Podgorny were constantly disagreeing on policy.|$|E
5|$|As al-Mansur's {{persecution}} intensified, pressure {{began to}} mount on the brothers to react. Kufa, the traditional Alid base, was kept under close surveillance by the Abbasid government, {{and the two}} brothers resolved to launch a simultaneous rebellion in Basra and Medina. Although the Alids <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on a large network of sympathizers throughout the Caliphate, the action was rushed and lacked organization.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, it {{was with}} Libyan support that Goukouni {{reassembled}} the GUNT, creating in October a National Peace Government in the Tibesti town of Bardaï and claiming itself the legitimate government {{by the terms of}} the Lagos Accord. For the impending fight, Goukouni <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on 3,000–4,000 men taken from several militias, later merged in an Armée Nationale de Libération (ANL) under the command of a Southerner, Negue Djogo.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo concluded a treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which <b>could</b> <b>count</b> against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|Despite Germany's reorganization, their {{manpower}} {{was still}} incomparable {{to that of}} the Western Allies. While Germany's Army Group B was able to increase their armored strength from 100 to 239 vehicles, these were opposed by 2,300 Allied tanks. Field Marshal Model reported that only 6,500 replacements had been sent to cover the 75,000 casualties suffered during the month of September. General Eisenhower commanded three army groups, totaling eight field armies with 55 divisions; these provided a two-to-one advantage in artillery guns and a twenty-to-one advantage in tanks, and <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on almost 14,000 combat aircraft, as compared to the Luftwaffe's 573.|$|E

5|$|In the Politburo Podgorny <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on {{the support}} of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Podgorny was {{constantly}} in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo. When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called {{for the expansion of}} Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|It was John's {{hope that}} the Pope would give him {{valuable}} legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared {{himself to be a}} papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on the Pope for help. John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict. In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{day after}} the fall of the town, Faya-Largeau was {{subjected}} to a sustained air bombardment, using Su-22 and Mirage F-1s from the Aouzou air base, along with Tu-22 bombers from Sabha. Within ten days, a large ground force had been assembled east and west of Faya-Largeau by first ferrying men, armor, and artillery by air to Sabha, Kufra and the Aouzou airfield, and then by shorter-range transport planes to the area of conflict. The fresh Libyan forces amounted to 11,000 mostly regular troops, and eighty combat aircraft participated in the offensive; however, the Libyans maintained their traditional role of providing fire support, and occasional tank charges, for the assaults of the GUNT, which <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on 3,000–4,000 men on this occasion.|$|E

5|$|The F-28s had {{the largest}} {{regularity}} problems, mostly due {{to the number of}} landings, which <b>could</b> <b>count</b> up to 16 per day. For instance, LN-SUO flew 36,000 hours with 76,000 landings. The last flight was made on 16 December 1986, and the aircraft sold for NOK45 million each. Although the F-28 was taken out of service, some of the routes on the West Coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the 737. The company made an agreement to wet lease Busy Bee F-27s one some of the routes, while the most trafficked ones would be taken over by 737s.|$|E
5|$|The {{second set}} of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their {{optimism}} was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the counterattack, Manstein <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on the Fourth Panzer Army, {{composed}} of XLVIII Panzer Corps, the SS Panzer Corps and the First Panzer Army, with the XL and LVII Panzer Corps. The XLVIII Panzer Corps was composed of the 6th, 11th and 17th Panzer Divisions, while the SS Panzer Corps was organized with the 1st SS, 2nd SS and 3rd SS Panzer Division. In early February, the combined strength of the SS Panzer Corps was an estimated 20,000 soldiers. The Fourth Panzer Army and the First Panzer Army were situated south of the Red Army's bulge into German lines, with the First Panzer Army to the east of the Fourth Panzer Army. The SS Panzer Corps was deployed along the northern edge of the bulge, on the northern front of Army Group South.|$|E

5|$|Despite its severe {{financial}} straits, by 1953, DuMont {{appeared to}} be {{on its way to}} establishing itself as the third national network. DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, but it <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on only seven primary stations – its three owned-and-operated stations ("O"), plus WGN-TV in Chicago, KTTV (channel 11) in Los Angeles, KFEL-TV (channel 2, now KWGN-TV) in Denver and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio. In contrast, ABC had a full complement of five O, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network (it was descended from NBC's Blue Network) from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty and a profit stream to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly overextended and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters (the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off {{as a result of the}} United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. antitrust decision), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period of turmoil, in February 865, that Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862–866) and two of the senior Turkish officers, Wasif and Bugha the Younger, fled Samarra to Baghdad, where they <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on the support of the Tahirids. The Turkish army in Samarra then {{selected}} al-Musta'in's brother al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869) as Caliph, and Abu Ahmad was entrusted with the conduct of operations against al-Musta'in and his supporters. The ensuing siege of Baghdad lasted from February to December 865, after which a negotiated settlement was reached. Contrary to the agreed terms, however, al-Musta'in was murdered. It was most likely during this time that Abu Ahmad consolidated his relationship with the Turkish military, especially with Musa ibn Bugha, who played a crucial role during the siege. Abu Ahmad further solidified these ties when he secured a pardon for Bugha the Younger.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January, US {{ambassador}} Peter Galbraith unsuccessfully {{tried to}} persuade Tuđman's aide Hrvoje Šarinić to accept another extension of the UNPROFOR mandate, explaining that the conflict would inevitably escalate once the UN force withdrew. This rebuff was followed by harsh French and UK diplomatic responses calling on the UN to ignore the Croatian decision, which resulted in Tuđman dismissing any extension of the mandate. The US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Richard Holbrooke, met Tuđman and suggested to him that if UNPROFOR was permitted to stay, Croatia <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on integration into the European Union and NATO. As {{a way out of}} the diplomatic row, Holbrooke proposed that UNPROFOR be replaced by a new mission using the same personnel and organisational structure. Following Croatian agreement, the UNSC adopted Resolution 981 establishing the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO), replacing UNPROFOR in the country. The new mission's name was devised by Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Shashi Tharoor.|$|E

5|$|The Poitevin had {{a slight}} {{increase}} in popularity {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, and <b>could</b> <b>count</b> approximately 100 farms perpetuating the breed. The association had around 300 members, as well as 83 stallions and 189 mares registered. However, by 2006, the Poitevin was still considered the most endangered French horse breed, with less than 100 births per year and a slightly decreasing population. There is almost no crossbreeding done with outside breeds, in order to maintain the numbers of purebred stock. In 2008, a second genetic study was conducted in partnership with the Institut national de la recherche agronomique; this study considered the Poitevin and four other French breeds to be endangered. It suggested making these breeds a conservation priority in order to maintain maximum genetic diversity among the French horse population.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} assumpsit had several {{advantages}} over a writ of debt; the plaintiff <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on always having a jury, while in writs of debt the defendant could rely on wager of law, where he produced twelve people to swear he did not owe the plaintiff money and had the case dismissed. In addition, it worked for executory agreements, not just normal contracts. In 1585 {{a new form of}} the Court of Exchequer Chamber was set up, an appellate court where the Common Pleas judges held a majority, and regularly began to reverse King's Bench judgments which were based on assumpsit. This, and the conflict between the King's Bench and the Common Pleas as a whole, was problematic; a plaintiff at assizes could not be sure which sort of judge his case would come before, lending uncertainty to the law. Boyer suggests that, in this environment, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench John Popham deliberately provoked the Common Pleas to resolve the matter, and did so through Slade's Case.|$|E
5|$|Asad {{arrived in}} Khurasan with 20,000 Syrian troops, and {{immediately}} took the offensive against Harith. Asad's campaign was costly, but {{after his first}} successes the Khurasani Arabs began to flock to him. Asad's success was aided by his long-standing personal relations with the local Arab tribal leaders, {{as well as by}} the continuing tribal rivalries: as a Yamani opposed to the Mudari Harith, he <b>could</b> <b>count</b> on the support of his fellow tribesmen—thus most of the Rabi'ah, the traditional enemies of Harith's Tamim tribe, son defected to him. Asad divided his forces, sending the Kufan and Syrian troops under Abd al-Rahman ibn Na'yum towards Marw Rudh, where Harith's main army was located, while he himself with the Basrans and remaining Khurasanis marched on the fortresses of Amul and Zamm. The rebel forces at Amul surrendered and were pardoned, and the garrison of Balkh followed soon after. Harith himself abandoned Marw Rudh and retreated across the Oxus before Abd al-Rahman, finding refuge with the princes of Tokharistan. With their aid, he laid siege to the major crossing point over the Oxus at Tirmidh. In the face of Harith's forces, Asad's troops dared not cross the Oxus but retreated to Balkh. However, the Tirmidh garrison managed to defeat Harith, who was weakened after a quarrel with the king of Khuttal, and who now retired eastwards to the mountains of Badakhshan. Asad followed up this success by persuading the garrison of Zamm to surrender on promises of amnesty and double pay, and by an unsuccessful expedition to recover Samarqand, which had been lost in the aftermath of the Defile.|$|E
