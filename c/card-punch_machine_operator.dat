50|$|The early flat ribbon cables {{were used}} in the mainframe-computer industry, on card readers, <b>card-punching</b> <b>machines,</b> and tape machines. Subsequently, ribbon cables were {{manufactured}} by a number of different companies, including 3M. Methods and materials were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of ribbon cables, by standardizing the design and spacing of the wires, and the thickness of the insulation, so that they could be easily terminated through the use of insulation-displacement connectors (IDC). Due to the simplicity of ribbon cables, their low profile, and low cost due to standardization, ribbon cables are used today in most computers, printers, and many electronic devices.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{confidence}} among forest <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> concerning the performance of the cutting planners. There is a need to investigate the reasons behind and the possible solutions for, the lack of trust between these two groups. Forest <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> in Ockelbo municipality where interviewed in October 2015. The <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> were asked to subjectively grade their level of trust on a scale of 1 to 10 were 1 was the lowest and 10 was the highest. The results showed the <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> trust in the cutting planners averaged 6. 9.

40|$|Reporting {{harvested}} and forwarded volumes {{are important}} for the forest industry as it provides information {{of the size of}} the stock and facilitates logistics. Figures from Holmen Skog show low reporting frequency. The purpose of this study is to investigate the reason and find suggestions for improvement. A total of 17 <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> were interviewed using a questionnaire combined with open questions. The results show that the majority of the <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> find it simple to use the reporting system, although, some of them reports that it doesn’t always work as supposed to. About 25 percent of the interviewed answered that the reason for low reporting frequency is the lack of timber order number. To solve this specific problem increased routine among production leaders is needed. Other suggestions of actions aiming to increase the reporting frequency are using a production technician for support of the production leaders make it possible for <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> to report service stops Finally, most of <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> sees the reporting as a natural part of their job and are positive concerning their relation to Holmen Skog...|$|R

30|$|We did not {{estimate}} separate gender-specific earnings {{functions for}} managers and for plant and <b>machine</b> <b>operators,</b> {{because the number}} of women in these two occupation groups was too small for meaningful analysis. Hence we could not calculate the aggregate contribution of the “explained’ and “unexplained” components of the within-occupation wage differences, in line with the methodology of Brown et al. (1980). However, when wage equations are estimated for all managers and for all plant and <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> with a dummy variable for women included in the list of independent variables, the coefficient on women is negative and significant: ceteris paribus, women in managerial jobs or working as plant and <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> have between 30  percent and 33 percent lower hourly earnings than men (see Appendix, Additional file 1 : Table S 1).|$|R
