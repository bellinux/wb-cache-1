40|$|In {{order to}} comply with the exhaust {{emission}} regulations that are becoming more severe every year, more advanced engine control is necessary. Engine engineers are concerned about the Hydrocarbons (HCs) that flow through the air-intake ports and that are difficult to precisely control. The main sources of such HCs are; the <b>canister</b> <b>purge,</b> PCV, and back-flow gas through the intake valves. And the Air/Fuel ratio (A/F) may be aggravated when such HCs flow into the combustion chambers. The influence that HCs have on the A/F may even increase further due to the; increasingly stringent EVAP emission regulations, more effective ventilation in the crankcase, and growth of the VVT-operated angle and timing. In order to more precisely control the A/F, it is important to estimate the amount of HCs that are difficult to manage, and seek suitable controls over fuel injection, etc. Therefore, the authors have developed a HC concentration measuring technology of the air-intake system using FID (of which the gas sampling performance has been significantly improved). The characteristics of this new system are as follows; (1) Applicable to each point of the intake system (2) Applicable to all engine operating conditions including the transition stage (3) Gas sampling with little influence on the A/F contro...|$|E

The objective is to maintain the in-cylinder FAR at a prescribed set point, determined primarily {{by the state of}} the Three-Way Catalyst (TWC), so that the pollutants in the exhaust are removed with the highest efficiency. The FAR controller must also reject disturbances due to <b>canister</b> vapor <b>purge</b> and inaccuracies in air charge estimation and wall-wetting (WW) compensation.

40|$|Marine {{brominated}} and iodinated halocarbons {{participate in}} catalytic ozone destruction and aerosol {{formation in the}} troposphere and {{they also have a}} significant impact on stratospheric ozone. While the tropical oceans are a known source of these very short lived substances (VSLS), including e. g. bromoform (CHBr 3) and methyliodide (CH 3 I), the tropical Western Pacific waters are largely uncharacterized for these compounds. Coastal macro algae, regionally enhanced phytoplankton abundance, photochemical reactions and local anthropogenic sources are expected to contribute to strong marine emissions. As high convective activity with fast efficient uplift takes place throughout the year, the western Pacific is projected to be a hot spot for oceanic VSLS supply to the stratosphere. In this study, we present first results from the SHIVA Sonne expedition to the South China Sea during November 2011. The research cruise was embedded within the framework of the EU-project SHIVA (Stratospheric ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere). During the cruise we investigated the large variability of the VSLS concentrations in both ocean and atmosphere using several methods, including in-situ atmospheric measurements, air <b>canister</b> sampling, <b>purge</b> and trap gas chromatography with electron capture and mass spectrometric detection. We will intercompare the results from various methods and present highlights from the expedition including atmospheric and oceanic VSLS data, as well as first estimates of emissions...|$|R
40|$|A {{physical}} model simulating canister adsorption and desorption processes on activated carbon was developed from experimental {{data obtained from}} repeated tests on a single carbon canister. The model is able to predict canister behaviour under different loading and purging conditions and is thus able to predict canister breakthrough emissions. The {{physical model}} can accurately simulate butane adsorption and desorption on activated carbon. An empirical model was then developed, using simpler expressions for describing adsorption and desorption. Based on the empirical model a full evaporative emissions test procedure was simulated, enabling the calculation of evaporative emissions from canister-equipped vehicles. The fair agreement between measured and modelled emissions verifies that the empirical model {{may be used for}} the estimation of evaporative emissions from modern gasoline vehicles. For the calibration of the model extensive testing was conducted on one vehicle and for the final validation a smaller number of targeted tests were performed on other vehicles. These tests covered a wide range of parameters having an effect on evaporative emissions, namely fuel volatility, ambient temperature, canister and fuel tank sizes, fuel system materials. The source of evaporative emissions depends largely on the canister condition. A well <b>purged</b> <b>canister,</b> e. g. after extensive driving on the road, results in effective adsorption of vapour generated in the fuel tank. Evaporative emissions in this case may be attributed to fuel permeation and/or leakage rather than the canister. When the canister is close to saturation, breakthrough emissions dominate the total evaporative emissions. The empirical model is applied {{for the development of a}} methodology for the calculation of evaporative emissions from a fleet of vehicles. The development of emission factors for various vehicle categories taking into account a large number of activity data facilitates emissions inventorying. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{adaptive}} control of time delay systems with applications to automotive control problems. The stabilization of systems involving time delays is a difficult problem since {{the existence of a}} delay may induce instability or poor performance for the closed loop system. A unique approach for controlling systems with known time delay was originated by Otto Smith in the 1950 s by compensating for the delayed output using input values stored over a time window of [t - [tau], t] and estimating the plant output using a model of the plant. Later, this idea was extended to include unstable plants as well, using finite-time integrals of the delayed input values thereby avoiding unstable pole-zero cancellations that may occur in Smith's controller. Adaptive versions of these delay compensating controllers were also developed with rather complicated adaptive rules which might not be practical to use in real applications. In this thesis, a simpler adaptive version of delay compensating controllers is developed, which has adaptive rules that are easily implementable and thus suitable for real life implementations. The developed controller is tested in two important automotive control problems that are idle speed control (ISC) and fuel-to-air ratio (FAR) control. These two applications, ISC and FAR control, constitute the experimental part of this research. In ISC, the objective is to regulate the engine speed to a prescribed set-point in the presence of accessory load torque disturbances such as due to air conditioning and power steering. The adaptive controller, integrated with the existing proportional spark controller, is used to drive the electronic throttle actuator. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrating the performance improvement by employing the adaptive controller are presented. Modifications and improvements to the controller structure, which were developed during the course of experimentation to solve specific problems, are also presented. In addition, the potential for the reduction in calibration time and effort which can be achieved with our approach is discussed. (cont.) The objective in FAR control is to maintain the in-cylinder FAR at a prescribed set point, determined primarily by the state of the Three-Way Catalyst (TWC), so that the pollutants in the exhaust are removed with the highest efficiency. The FAR controller must also reject disturbances due to <b>canister</b> vapor <b>purge</b> and inaccuracies in air charge estimation and wall-wetting (WW) compensation. Two adaptive controller designs are considered. The first design is based on feedforward adaptation while the second design is based on both feedback and feedforward adaptation.
