5|$|In the mid-1970s, a bootleg {{containing}} rare {{singles and}} B-sides entitled The Dark Side of the Moo appeared, {{with a similar}} cover. Like Atom Heart Mother, the cover had no writing on it, although {{in this case it}} was to protect the bootlegger's anonymity rather than any artistic statement. The album cover to The KLF's concept album <b>Chill</b> <b>Out</b> was also inspired by Atom Heart Mother.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several {{recording}} {{sessions at}} Cauty's studio, Trancentral. When offered an album deal by Big Life, the Orb found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that the Orb release their music through his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted {{to ensure that}} the group did not become a side-project of the KLF. Because of these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name the Orb. As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as Space on KLF Communications. Also out of these sessions came the KLF album <b>Chill</b> <b>Out,</b> on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.|$|E
5|$|Madness {{were not}} only running their own label at the time, but also had their own {{recording}} studio, Liquidator Studios.

The ground floor has always been an office and <b>chill</b> <b>out</b> area, while a room upstairs is used for song mixing. The band have recorded a number of demos and b-sides at Liquidator, as well as The Madness album in 1988. Other acts to use the studio include Feargal Sharkey, The Farm, Apollo 440, The Potato 5, The Nutty Boys, The Deltones and The Butterfield 8.

25|$|After {{the intense}} touring schedule, Bring Me the Horizon finally {{completed}} {{the promotion of}} their third album {{at the end of}} 2011. They returned to the UK for an extended break and eventually starting work on their next album. Much like their previous two albums, they wrote their fourth album in seclusion and isolation in order to stay focused. This time, they retreated to a house in the Lake District. In July, the band started to publish images of themselves recording at a 'Top Secret Studio Location,' and it was revealed that they are working with producer Terry Date for the recording and the production of the album. On July 30, the band announced they had left their label and signed with RCA, through which their fourth album would be released in 2013. Bring Me The Horizon only played three shows in all of 2012: Warped Tour 2012 on 10 November at the Alexandra Palace in London, which they headlined and was initially believed to be their only show the BBC Radio 1's Radio 1 Rocks show on 22 October, where they played a six-song set supporting Bullet for My Valentine and at a warm up show for Warped Tour in Sheffield the day before on 9 November. In late October it was announced that the fourth album will be called Sempiternal and it would be released tentatively in early 2013. On 22 November the band released the Draper collaborative album The <b>Chill</b> <b>Out</b> Sessions for free.|$|E
25|$|In the UK and Europe, {{the years}} 1987 to 1989 {{were marked by}} a {{large-scale}} revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 {{became known as the}} Second Summer of Love. Although the music favored by this movement was modern electronic music, especially house music and acid house, one could often hear songs from the original hippie era in the <b>chill</b> <b>out</b> rooms at raves. In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in Stroud Green, an area of north London located in Finsbury Park. In 1995, The Sekhmet Hypothesis attempted to link both hippie and rave culture together in relation to transactional analysis, suggesting that rave culture was a social archetype based on the mood of friendly strength, compared to the gentle hippie archetype, based on friendly weakness. The later electronic dance genres known as goa trance and psychedelic trance and its related events and culture have important hippie legacies and neo hippie elements. The popular DJ of the genre Goa Gil, like other hippies from the 1960s, decided to leave the US and Western Europe to travel on the hippie trail and later developing psychedelic parties and music in the Indian island of Goa in which the goa and psytrance genres were born and exported around the world in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E

500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{integrated}} the band's typical punk and funk style, but {{moved away}} from this with more melodically driven songs. Tracks like [...] "The Righteous and the Wicked", [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Funky Monks" [...] still incorporated use of heavy metal guitar riffs, but differed from Mother's Milk in that they contained less distortion. Flea, who had centered his bass playing around the slapping technique, downplayed on this {{in favor of more}} traditional and melodic bass lines. He also adopted a minimalist, [...] "less is more" [...] philosophy: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to <b>chill</b> <b>out</b> and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good." [...] Kiedis felt that the album would expand the Chili Peppers' musical horizons, and that it was a departure from their previous material. One of Blood Sugar Sex Magiks more melodic tracks, [...] "Breaking the Girl", was written about Kiedis' constantly shifting relationships. He feared that he was following in his father's footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer, rather than establishing stable and long-term relationships: [...] "...As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful girls can be, {{at the end of the}} day, that shit is lonely and you're left with nothing." [...] The track also featured a bridge in the middle, consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump.|$|E
500|$|Alex Paterson {{began his}} music {{career in the}} early 1980s as a roadie for the post-punk rock band Killing Joke, for whom his {{childhood}} friend Martin [...] "Youth" [...] Glover plays bass. After leaving Killing Joke in 1986, Paterson met future KLF member Jimmy Cauty and the duo began DJ-ing and producing music together under the name The Orb. Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 acid house anthem track, [...] "Tripping on Sunshine", released on the German record compilation Eternity Project One. The following year, the Orb released the Kiss EP, a four-track EP based on samples from New York City's KISS FM. It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label WAU! Mr. Modo Records, which they created out {{of a desire to}} maintain financial independence from larger record labels. After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as [...] "really shit drum sounds", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks. Paterson and Cauty began DJ-ing in London and landed a deal for the Orb to play the <b>chill</b> <b>out</b> room at London nightclub Heaven. Resident DJ Paul Oakenfold brought in the duo as ambient DJs for his [...] "The Land of Oz" [...] event at Heaven. Though the Orb's Monday night performances had only several hardcore followers initially, their chill-out room act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay {{to the point that the}} room was often packed with around 100people. The Orb's performances became most popular among weary DJs and clubbers seeking solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor. The Orb built up melodies using multitrack recordings linked to multiple record decks and a mixer. The group incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and BBC sound effects into the act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as [...] "Sueño Latino." [...] Though the group used a variety of samples, they avoided heavy rhythm and drums so that the intended ambient atmosphere was not disrupted. Most often, the group played dub and other chill-out music, which it described as ambient house for the E generation.|$|E
