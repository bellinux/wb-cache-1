50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 2008, Pakistan's economic outlook has taken a dramatic downturn. Security concerns stemming from the nation's role in the War on Terror have created great instability {{and led to a}} decline in FDI from a height of approximately $8 bn to $3.5bn for the current fiscal year. Concurrently, the insurgency has forced massive capital flight from Pakistan to the Persian Gulf. Combined with high global commodity prices, the dual impact has shocked Pakistan's economy, with gaping trade deficits, high inflation and a crash {{in the value of the}} Rupee, which has fallen from 60-1 USD to over 80-1 USD in a few months. For the first time in years, it may have to seek external funding as Balance of Payments support. Consequently, S&P lowered Pakistan's foreign currency debt rating to CCC-plus from B, just several notches above a level that would indicate default. Pakistan's local currency debt rating was lowered to B-minus from BB-minus. Credit agency Moody's Investors Service cut its outlook on Pakistan's debt to negative from stable due to political uncertainty, though it maintained the country's rating at B2.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this article}} are {{to carry out a}} comparative study <b>of</b> the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> downside <b>protection</b> for investors in the stock markets of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and to investigate the time diversification issue in these markets by examining the variation <b>of</b> this <b>cost</b> as the investment horizon is extended.

Long-horizon investment outcomes are generated using a bootstrapping technique. Results indicate that the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> downside <b>protection</b> differs from one country to another, but there is a common pattern <b>of</b> the <b>cost</b> decreasing as the investment horizon lengthens.

40|$|China was {{steeped in}} the {{concepts}} and ideology of a planned economy for 30 years until reforms began in 1978. Although the country is now {{well on its way}} to becoming a market economy, its trading system remains shackled by its centrally planned past. Measuring the <b>Costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Protection</b> in China analyzes some <b>of</b> the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>protection</b> and the corresponding benefits of liberalization for 25 highly protected sectors in China. The book begins with a description of the development of China's trade administration system, sketching the obstacles to and prospects for further liberalization. The authors analyze the structure <b>of</b> Chinese trade <b>protection</b> and present their estimates <b>of</b> its static <b>costs.</b> They then offer an in-depth analysis of the country's trade regime and of the administrative barriers to rationalization and liberalization. The final chapter presents the authors' recommendations for improving China's trade system. They conclude that the short-term <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> trade liberalization for goods examined in the study will be substantial in terms of lost domestic output and lost jobs. The long-term benefits, however, would provide some $ 35 billion worth of consumer benefits. Five appendices provide greater technical detail on the modeling and methodology applied in this study, as well as a brief description of some peculiarities of the Chinese trade regime-including copious levels of smuggling and monopolistic market structures. The study was conducted by a team of Chinese economists at the independent Unirule Institute in Beijing, whose president is the prominent reformer, Mao Yushi.
