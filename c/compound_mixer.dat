40|$|General purpose {{models of}} {{dynamical}} systems {{are based on}} extracting important information regarding the underlying processes directly from the measurable process data. Commonly used methods for system analysis and modeling are based on second order statistics. Lately, however, solutions exceeding its limitations have been proposed. Growing potential of contemporary computer systems has encouraged the use of methods originating from information theory in this field. The definitions of basic measures in information theory, i. e., entropy, divergence and average mutual information, are based on probability theory and statistics. Each of these measures in its own frame determines the quantity of information and uncertainty of random variables and can therefore be used also in the modeling. In the set of measured process data, {{some of them may}} be mutually dependent and they do not provide any new information about the system. Moreover, if this dependency is not detected, it results in larger and more complicated models. Therefore, applying feature extraction methods to input data prior to modeling is expected to result in simplifying the modeling procedure and improving the generalization properties of the obtained model. Average mutual information and divergence, which both measure mutual dependency among data, are most suitable as criteria in the process of feature extraction. Using mutual information it can be determined how much information about a given output is contained in each input set. In combination with optimization methods the most appropriate set of features can thus be found. Similarly, divergence may be used as a measure in the independent component analysis where features are obtained as linear combinations of inputs. Independent component analysis may also be used as method for localizing exceptional events, shocks, with a strong influence on the future behavior of the system. If we are dealing with a repeatable process, the results of such analysis are also applicable for prediction. Therefore, a method which uses inputs in times of shocks as features in further modeling was proposed and tested. Methods for feature extraction based on information theory were tested in combination with neural network modeling and compared to several classical approaches. The neural networks are general purpose models, comprised from identical simple units, called neurons, which map the weighted sum of its own inputs to output. Regarding the topology of connections among neurons, a variety of neural networks were proposed. In this work, only the multilayered perceptron is used. In this case, neurons are arranged in layers and each neuron is connected to all neurons in neighboring layer, but not to neurons in its own layer. The great advantage of this topology {{lies in the fact that}} very effective gradient learning techniques are available for setting the free parameters of the model. The learning is based on minimizing a selected criterion function. Most commonly, the mean squared error is used as the criterion function. However, it may be replaced by entropy of the error which measures the uncertainty of errors on the output of the model - the lower this uncertainty is the better model fits the data. The performance of measures originating from information theory in the feature extraction process and in learning process was tested on problems of time series prediction and on problem of building a model predictive control of rubber <b>compound</b> <b>mixer.</b> Time series prediction problem analyses have revealed that models including independent component analysis of feature extractions give the best prediction of future value. If the problem is slightly modified so that only classification of future value in one of the predefined classes in predicted, the method of maximally discriminative projections with the conditional entropy as a measure, has also performed well. Feature extraction based on mutual information yielded poorer results, mainly due to low number of data. At the same time, it was shown the learning using minimization of entropy of the error gives good results in case of future value prediction, while it is not suitable in case of classification prediction. In the rubber compound production the quality of the final product depends strongly on several parameters, such as quality of input materials, ambient temperature and chamber temperature. To reduce the deviations in the quality of the final product in spite of changes in the input and process parameters, a need for closed loop control has emerged. The closed loop control is based on the information about the viscosity of the compound, measured as the motor torque. A model predictive control was designed which gives a prediction of classification of the torque curve based on the time course of viscosity. According to this classification, the torque of the motor is changed by changing the rate of rotation. In this problem, the model using the proposed method of feature extraction based on shock detection performed well. The closed loop controller of the rubber compound mixing process has in fact reduced the variations of the quality of the final rubbed compound. ...|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} rebuild, IfS/DR mixer preheaters, pressure-compensating piston valves (Trofimoff valves) and new Stühren ash pans were installed. The wider outer firebox needed new front {{walls to}} the driver's cab, the front windows of which were {{equipped}} with demisting equipment. For the larger and heavier VMP 15-20 <b>compounded</b> <b>mixer</b> pump (Verbundmischpumpe) a new pump mount had to be built. This and the new mixer preheater apparatus required a different arrangement for the main air reservoir. The outside cylinders with a diameter of just 520 mm, originally designed for boiler pressures of 20 bar, were retained however. In {{the course of the}} rebuild, the brakes on the front carrying axle were removed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In cement industry, many {{grinding}} up systems are on operating now. The tradition process of tube mill grinding system is high energy consumption, so it’s low efficiency, {{especially in the}} final cement grinding process. The value and advantage of slag is recognized more and more, but it’s difficult to be grinded up. Furthermore, the disadvantage and shortages to grind up clinker compounded with slag to produce cement are obvious and adopted. The best process is to grind up slag, clinker separately. Then, these two kinds of powder are <b>compounded</b> by a <b>mixer.</b> Hereby, it introduces a design of the process to grind up clinker, slag by one roller mill. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe inter-relationship between {{processing}} {{conditions and}} fiber breakage {{has been studied}} for glass fiber-reinforcedpolyamide 12, prepared using (i) an internal batch mixer, (ii) a laboratory scale corotating twin screw extruder, and (iii) an industrial scale twin screw extruder. The average fiber lengths and fiber length distributions were measured for various compounding conditions (screw or rotor speed, mixing time, feed rate). Experimental results have shown that fiber breakage depends on both screw speed and mixing time, the later being controlled, in an extruder, by the feed rate. For a given <b>compounding</b> system (batch <b>mixer</b> or twin screw extruder), the energy input (specific mechanical energy, SME) during the compounding process {{is found to be}} a reliable parameter, which governs fiber length (average, minimal, and maximal) evolution.

40|$|International audienceAt present, wood {{particles}} (wood flour) with a low {{aspect ratio}} are mostly used as fillers in wood-plastic composites (WPC). Reinforcement of WPC and improved strength properties may {{be achieved by}} using real wood fibres with a high aspect ratio. WPC based on 70 % (wt.) refiner (TMP) wood fibres and mechanically processed hemp fibres were extruded in a two-step process. Eleven compounds based on the two natural fibre types were prepared using a thermokinetic mixer and extruded in a conical, counter-rotating twin-screw extruder. Additional formulation components were polypropylene fibres, maleic anhydride-modified polypropylene (MAPP) and lubricant. It was determined that <b>compounding</b> in a thermokinetic <b>mixer</b> is a useful step for processing of WPC with refiner and hemp fibres as little fibre damage occurred. However, during extrusion, both natural fibre types were severely shortened due to strong shear forces, and homogeneous dispersion of fibres in the matrix was not achieved. WPC based on hemp fibres displayed the best strength properties of the formulations tested. Current extruder screw and die configurations need to be modified to achieve improved fibre reinforcement and to create new, structurally demanding applications for WPC...|$|R

In this paper, fabrication of heat sink nanocomposite made of copper reinforced by multiwalled carbon nanotubes up to 10 Vol. % using metal injection molding technique is presented. A mixture of Cu-MWNTs was <b>compounded</b> using internal <b>mixer</b> machine for homogenous dispersion of the solid powder in the binder. To ensure a flow able feedstock during injection molding process, different binder systems and their Cu-MWNTs feedstocks were examined using capillary rheometer machine. In order to avoid binder degradation, TGA test was carried out. The TGA {{results showed that the}} processing temperature such as mixing and injection molding should be lower than 170 °C. The injection molding was carried out at low pressure. A combination of solvent and thermal debinding was used for binder removal, and then the samples were isothermally sintered at different sintering temperatures (900 - 1050 °C) in argon atmosphere. The results showed that the sintered samples experienced an isotropic shrinkage around 17 % with relatively homogeneous dispersion of MWNTs in the copper matrix which is expected to enhance the physical and mechanical properties of the final product...|$|R
40|$|This work {{studied the}} {{morphology}} and physical properties of nanocomposites of different ethylene copolymers and functionalized polyethylenes with {{two different types}} of organoclays, to assess the potential application of these fillers as reinforcing components in the design of polyethylene and other polyolefinic based nanocomposites with enhanced properties. A polyethylene-grafted-maleic anhydride (PEMA), a poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid), a poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), and an ionomer of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) containing a small fraction of polyamide 6 were used to prepare nanocomposites by melt <b>compounding</b> in internal <b>mixer.</b> Two different types of commercial clays were used to obtain nanocomposites with the same organoclay content (5 wt %), i. e., an organomodified montmorillonite and an organomodified kaolinite. The morphology was evaluated by wide angle X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and optical microscopy. The thermal, mechanical and barrier properties were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, tensile tests and oxygen transmission rate experiments, respectively. From the results, it was seen that PEMA and the ionomer are the best polymer matrices to disperse both organoclays under the conditions applied. Kaolinite and montmorillonite appeared to be dispersed in the nanorange, however, higher aspect ratio was observed for montmorillonite. The best improvements in thermal degradation and in mechanical reinforcement were shown for organomodified kaolinite nanocomposites. But the best improvements in thermo-oxidative degradation and in oxygen barrier were seen for the nanocomposites with organomodified montmorillonit...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the feasibility of direct melt-blending (intercalation) montmorillonite nanoclay to polyhydroxybutyrate along with vinyl acetate, at different weight percentages, to enhance plasticization using typical plastic processing equipment and typical processing methodology. The purpose was to determine and compare the specific mechanical properties of tensile strength and flexural strength developed as a result from this processing. Single screw and twin screw extrusion, Banbury <b>mixer</b> <b>compounding,</b> and compression molding were used to intercalate montmorillonite, and for sample preparation purposes, to test tensile and flexural strength of the resultant polymer clay nanocomposites (PCN). Results indicate Polyhydroxybutyrate and Ethylene vinyl acetate, and weight percentages of 70 %, 65 % and 60 % PHB, and 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % of EVA, respectively, influenced mechanical properties. The resultant materials remained in a mostly amorphous state. The nanoclay, at specific weight percentage of 10 %, acted as an antimicrobial and preservative for the materials produced during the research. The intention of the research was to promote knowledge and understanding concerning these materials and processes so technology transfer regarding the use, mechanical properties, manufacture, and process ability of these bio-friendly materials to academia, industry, and society can occur.

40|$|A {{key sector}} of the rubber {{processing}} industry deals with improving mixing processes in silica/silane technology and with the discontinuous batch production of the corresponding rubber compounds in the rubber internal <b>mixer</b> <b>compounding</b> process. To achieve the desired material properties in the respective end product, both producers of technical rubber products and tire makers {{are in need of}} a mixing process that is effective (in terms of both dispersion and distributive mixing efficiency). Major differences in polarity between nonpolar rubber and highly polar silica impede the incorporation and dispersion of silica, the active filler. This effect also influences the quality of distributive mixing of other compound ingredients and thus the compound homogeneity that is to be attained. Whereas the reflected-light microscopy method, with image processing, has been tested and fully developed for industrial grade use in analyzing filler particle macrodispersion, employment of Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) remains relatively unknown in rubber processing as a means of analyzing distributive mixing efficiency via determination of the homogeneous distribution of a specific marker across a batch volume. The results of this research activity have shown that under atmospheric conditions (with no vacuum), LIBS is a suitable method for analyzing the distributive mixing quality of components within a rubber compound batch. The method can be applied both in compounds free of carbon black fillers and in those containing carbon black fillers. Thanks to its very short measurement time (here: approx. 40 s for analysis of a roughly postage-stamp-sized specimen surface), it yields a statistically representative statement as to the distributive quality of a marker (like zinc) in the used compound...|$|R
40|$|Natural fibre {{is one of}} the {{potential}} candidates to be used with the thermoplastic as a composite. Kenaf fibre was mixed with Polypropylene (PP) in addition of maleic anhydride (MAPP). Kenaf were separated from the outer layer and bast fibre and were cut using crusher. The ash content is removed by sieving and washing the fibre. The fibre is then treated with alkaline treatment using three different concentrations of 5 wt%, 10 wt% and 15 wt% in three different time’s treatments which are 1 hour, 1. 5 hour and 2 hour. 10 wt% fibre and 1. 5 hour of time treatment were chose as an actual value for fibre loading of the composites which were 10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt%, and 40 wt%. MAPP was added with weight ratio 1 : 10 of fibre and finally PP was added to complete the sample. All of the samples were <b>compounded</b> using plastic <b>mixer</b> and palletized using plastic crusher. Samples were then molded by injection molding. An alternative method has been used to find a better solution for fibre treatment by using Ultrasonic for 10 wt% fibre and 1. 5 hour treatment. Some tests were done to analyze samples such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Melt Flow Index (MFI), water adsorption, density (Pcynometer), and tensile strength (Tensile Test). For feasibility study of alkaline treatment, the results showed that the best value is for 15 wt%, 1 hour of alkaline treatmen. For feasibility study of fibre loading, the best composite selected was sample with 40 wt% of fibre with tensile strength of 49. 1547 MPa and for comparison by using Ultrasonic for treatment; it was showed that this alternative method gave a better composite. From the data and supported theories by various authors, it can be concluded that alkaline treatment, fibre loading and treatment method {{have a significant effect on}} the composite...|$|R
