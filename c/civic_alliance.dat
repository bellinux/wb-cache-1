[...] The person who was the object of his criticism knew better: [...] Hall had published in the very journal that he had previously led ("East European Politics and Societies"). [...] So he picked up the telephone and yelled at Richard Hall's supervisor, in a scene that could have been included in [...] "Stalinism for All Seasons." [...] Michael Shafir detailed Tismăneanu's tactics more broadly in an article entitled suggestively, [...] "About Questionable Clarifications, Plagiarism, Being an Imposter, and Careerism." [...] In November 2013, Vasile Ernu told an interviewer how Editura Curtea Veche cancelled a book contract because among a handful of references to Tismăneanu one suggested that [...] "Tismăneanu employs two different discourses, one inside Romania and one outside." ...|$|E
