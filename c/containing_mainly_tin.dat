40|$|Vanga bhasma is an Ayurvedic {{formulation}} {{used for}} various diseases. An {{attempt was made}} to analyze it chemically which includes XRF, XRD, EDAX and ICP-MS techniques. Vanga Bhasma drug <b>contained</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>tin</b> as tin oxide. The content of tin was found to be 80 percent. XRF analysis revealed that the bhasma contained 17 elements at different levels of concentration. XRD studies exhibited that the major phase composition is cassiterite tin oxide in tetragonal structure. The crystallite size of the compound calculated from Scherrer’s formula was 52. 94 nm. ICP-MS studies revealed the presence of calcium, arsenic, iron, silicon, phosphorus, aluminium and chloride. A combination of XRF, XRD, EDAX-SEM and ICP-MS was very useful in concluding that vanga bhasma is in cassiterite form of tetragonal structure. It is possible that the practical clinical application of the drug {{may be due to the}} different trace level elemental spectra besides tin. Data generated in the present study can be considered for laying down the pharmacopoeial standards for Vanga bhasma...|$|R
30|$|Chinese bronze {{artefacts}} <b>mainly</b> <b>contain</b> copper, <b>tin</b> {{and lead}} and the corrosion products of these metals {{are to be}} expected. Malachite, cuprite, cassiterite and cerussite have frequently been reported in bronze corrosion products [2 – 9]. Malachite and cuprite are common corrosion products of copper alloys after long burial periods in soils [2]. Cuprite forms a red layer {{in contact with the}} metal core. In the presence of H 2 O and CO 2, cuprite will react to form malachite. Cerussite (PbCO 3) and cassiterite (SnO 2) are the common corrosion products of lead and tin in bronze.|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of bimetallic silver-cobalt clusters {{with less than}} 50 atoms is studied experimentally and their associated geometries are predicted by classical modeling. The clusters are created by laser vaporization and inert gas condensation. Their mass distribution is analyzed with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. For clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> silver, we find strong quantum size effects related to itinerant behavior of the silver and cobalt valence electrons. In the case of clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> cobalt, no pronounced size effects appear in the mass spectra. Photofragmentation experiments reveal that neutral silver atom evaporation is the favorable channel, suggesting that the Ag{single bond}Co bonds are weaker than the Co{single bond}Co bonds. Consistently, and for both sets of clusters, Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations predict these clusters to have icosahedral based structures that may depend on temperature. In clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> silver, cobalt sits at the cluster center and fragmentation proceeds by the evaporation of silver surface atoms. In clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> cobalt, silver atoms also locate at the periphery and are more weakly bound to the cluster than cobalt surface atoms. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.
