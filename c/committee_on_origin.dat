40|$|Obando Camino, Iván Mauricio. reprint author), Univ Talca, Talca, Chile. This is a historical, {{institutional}} study {{about the}} congressional committee {{system of the}} Chilean legislature from 1834 through 1924. This study uses a longitudinal perspective to focus <b>on</b> <b>committee</b> <b>origins,</b> functions, processes, and authority. It shows that the Chilean legislature developed a committee system early by taking stock of previous, short-lived congressional experiences and trial-and-error. Congressional committees dealt with bill drafting, housekeeping matters, and bureaucratic oversight therein with varying results. Congressional leaders presided over the committee appointment process by relying on majority support and persuasion. The impact of institutional design <b>on</b> <b>committee</b> performance, notwithstanding, the evidence shows that committees performed as specialized, authoritative agencies even before the emergence of modern political parties in the late 1850 s...|$|R
