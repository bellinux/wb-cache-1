30|$|The study {{evaluated}} the optimal weft inserting speed with two cases using Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> alone and Hanji paper yarn and {{core spun yarn}} in a 1 : 1 ratio. As a result, the optimal weft inserting speed (approximately 620  rpm) for the Hanji paper yarn was approximately 90 % of the cotton yarn with the same yarn count. This is because we believe the tensile strength of Hanji paper yarn and Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> is {{lower than that of}} ordinary cotton yarn.|$|E
30|$|The paper yarns {{used in the}} weft {{were made}} into two types, single yarn and <b>combination</b> <b>yarn.</b> First, in the {{manufacturing}} process of a single yarn, a paper sheet was cut to a pre-determined width to make a tape yarn, and after that the single yarn was produced by adding a proper twist to the tape yarn through a twisting machine. In other words, the Hanji paper sheet, {{with the weight of}} 13  g/m 2, was cut into the tape yarn in the width of 2.75 and 3.75  mm. Then, the Hanji paper yarns, count of 16 and 11  Ne, were produced after twisting 600 and 520  tpm (Z-twist), respectively, using a twisting machine (Murata® 363). The <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> was manufactured by combining paper yarn and core spun yarn. In this study, Hanji paper yarn of 16 or 30  Ne was plied in S-twist with the core spun yarn [cotton (sheath)/spandex (core)]. After that, the structures of Hanji combination yarns were stabilized through the steam setting for 14  min at 105  °C. With this process, the count of Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> produced was 10 and 15  Ne, respectively.|$|E
30|$|With {{the popular}} use of denim fabric {{and of the}} {{advantages}} of paper yarns, we aimed to develop the Hanji denim fabric with Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> or with the Hanji paper yarn and core spun yarn in a 1 : 1 ratio as the weft. As the warp yarn, chemical vat and natural dyestuffs were used. We tested the properties of the developed Hanji paper yarns, combination yarns, and Hanji denim fabrics. The summary and conclusions are as follows.|$|E
5000|$|Melitopol Knitting Factory Nadezhda is the {{manufacturer}} of knitwear products that meet the highest requirements. The company uses cloth of both local and foreign manufacturers in its production process.

30|$|It can therefore, be {{concluded}} that plated fabrics with <b>combination</b> of carded <b>yarn</b> in the outer layer and coarse polyester fibre in the inner layer may be suitable for cold and dry conditions owing to high thermal resistance, warm feel next to skin and high water absorbency.|$|R

30|$|This study aims {{to develop}} the Hanji denim fabric with Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> or with the Hanji paper yarn and core spun yarn in a 1 : 1 ratio as a weft. For the weft yarn, {{chemical}} indigo and natural indigo dyestuffs were used. The study developed four kinds of Hanji paper yarns and eight kinds of Hanji denim fabrics. In addition, the study tested {{the properties of the}} developed Hanji paper yarns, Hanji denim fabrics, and existing denim fabrics. In regard to the physical properties of yarns, the Hanji paper yarn showed a lower breaking stress but a relatively high breaking strain, and it remained a stable structure with no surface fluff. The Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> improved the weaving ability and had a stable structure form. In the resulting physical properties of the developed Hanji denim fabrics, they had a low apparent specific gravity, stability in dimensional change in washing and drying, a higher chance of commercialization in colorfastness to washing, medium stretchability, a similar drying velocity, and a fast absorption velocity compared to the existing denim fabrics. The study suggests that the Hanji denim fabrics are the good candidate materials for summer product development, since generally the Hanji denim fabrics have cool characteristics with the excellent absorption velocity, drying velocity, and low specific gravity.|$|E
30|$|In general, {{yarn count}} of the weft for {{commonly}} used cotton denim fabrics in summer and winter are respectively about 15 and 10  Ne. Taking this into consideration when calculating the count of final Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn,</b> a single paper yarn {{count of the}} summer and winter usage is appropriate with the count of 30 and 15  Ne respectively based on the core spun yarns 30  Ne. Thus, when weaving with the paper yarn and the core spun yarn in the weaving process, according to the season, it is also advised to select each weft yarn within a similar yarn count range compared to the preferred cotton yarn count.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, in this study, {{we aim to}} {{manufacture}} the Hanji denim fabric by using either of these two yarn types for the weft: of the Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> (combined Hanji paper yarn with core spun yarn) or by inserting the Hanji paper yarn and the core spun yarn in a 1 : 1 ratio. In the warp, we plan to use two kinds of existing yarns dyed with a chemical indigo dyestuff and a natural indigo dyestuff (blue color). After manufacturing Hanji denim fabrics, we plan to test {{the properties of the}} developed Hanji denim fabrics and the existing denim fabrics to compare them. This study also plans to suggest commercialization of denim fabric products utilizing the Hanji denim fabrics that have the improved properties such as light fabric weight, stretch, and comfort.|$|E

30|$|The tensile {{properties}} and yarn {{count of the}} Hanji single yarn and <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> were measured according to KSK ISO 2062 and KSK ISO 2060 (Skein method) respectively. The colorfastness to washing and the dimensional change in washing and drying of the fabric were measured by KSK ISO 105 -C 06 (A 2 S) and KSK ISO 5077, respectively. The elastic recovery and colorfastness to light were measured by KSK 0352 and KSK ISO 105 -B 02 (Xenon arc). Drying velocity and absorption velocity were measured by KSK 0815 (6.28. 1 -A) and KSK 0815 (6.27. 1 -B), respectively. The surface structures of Hanji paper yarns and combination yarns were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and those of Hanji denim fabrics were measured by a video microscope system (Sometech Inc.). Fabric specific gravity was determined by mass per unit volume commonly expressed, in grams per cubic centimeter.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, for the denim fabrics, the Hanji paper single yarn, core spun yarn, and Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> {{were used as}} the weft. As shown in Fig.  3, the twisted shape of Hanji paper yarn showed a stable {{structure}} with little fluff on the surface unlike that of cotton yarn. The core spun yarn had a slightly bulky structure because the cotton yarn enveloped a spandex filament (core yarn). In the existing denim fabrics, the use of core spun yarn as the weft began {{with the development of}} skinny denim products in recent years, and core spun yarns were commonly used to improve the surface properties of core yarns and to produce stretch fabrics. Also, the structure of Hanji combination yarns showed that two kinds of yarns, the Hanji single yarn and the core spun yarn, were combined in a stable form.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{physical}} properties of yarns, the breaking stress of Hanji paper yarn was {{lower than those of}} the cotton yarn and the core spun yarn, but the paper yarn maintained a relatively high breaking strain. The Hanji <b>combination</b> <b>yarn</b> has been improved the weaving ability by complementing the tensile strength of Hanji paper yarn. In the surface structure of the yarn, the rope-dyed cotton yarn showed a rather bulky structure while the cheese-dyed cotton yarn showed a compact structure. The structure of Hanji combination yarns showed that the Hanji single yarn and core spun yarn were tightly combined resulting in a stable form. The optimal weft inserting speed for the Hanji paper yarn was approximately 90 % of the cotton yarn with the same yarn count. Also, the appearance of most Hanji denim fabrics produced showed no significant difference from the existing stretchable denim fabrics indicating commercialization of Hanji denim fabrics as highly possible.|$|E
30|$|Incorporation of coarser {{polyester}} fibres in {{the inner}} layers of plated fabrics resulted in improved thermal resistance for both carded (RC 1.1 –RC 3.3) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 1.1 –RM 3.3) (Fig.  2). This {{may be attributed to}} the increase in fabric thickness and porosity (Table  4) with the increase in fibre linear density. High coefficient of determination (0.90) and (0.96) for carded and combed yarn fabrics respectively suggested positive linear relationship between fibre linear density and thermal resistance. The findings indicate that fibre and <b>yarn</b> <b>combination</b> that would result in high thermal resistance of plated fabrics are polyester fibre of high linear density and carded ring <b>yarns</b> compared to <b>combination</b> of polyester fibre of lower linear density and combed yarns.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop and refine new yarn and knit textile combinations using Nuyarn technology for a selected niche market. New Zealand’s Nuyarn is an industryconnected project with Massey University and Levana Textiles. Levana Textiles is a woolen mill based in Levin with over 50 years industry experience. Through the exploration of trend forecasting, iterative design process, market research as well as finding a gap in the market, this result in unique New Zealand products that can demand a premium price. Nuyarn technology is a new and innovative way of spinning yarn. The technology enhances the yarn performance by taking the twist out, and instead it lays the fibres along the same orientation {{as the rest of the}} yarn. Levana Textiles have purchased Nuyarn spinning technology. Through the use of this technology, Levana is producing and introducing innovative and newly improved products into the textile market. This technology is paramount in setting them apart from other textile mills as well as bringing a point of difference in the market. There is a need to achieve smarter performance in blended yarns for circular knitwear apparel. The wool industry endured hard times in previous years due to the rise in demand for synthetic fibres in the 1960 s. Wool is now re-emerging with companies focusing on new developments and innovation with the fibre. As a result of intensive research and development, cutting-edge design process and contemporary insight into the industry have enabled Levana to lead the way in the development of new <b>yarn</b> <b>combinations</b> and improved <b>yarn</b> performance through the use of new spinning technology.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{based on the}} embedded image processing principle is described to meas-ure the in-plane liquid spread in fabric {{as a function of}} time. The water spreading area recorded with a digital camera and the picture analysing process was automated by use of an image segmentation algorithm: background subtraction. Where commercial image analysing software fails due to the specific porous structure of textiles, the algorithm de-veloped succeeds in calculating the wicking area automatically.

40|$|IN {{view of the}} {{importance}} of the exact knowledge of stiffness in individualyarns and <b>yarn</b> <b>combinations,</b> a method has been developed for meas-uring these characteristics quantitatively. It consists essentially in de-termining the force necessary to bend a piece of yarn, held at one end, through various angles. For convenience in the application of the force, the yarn is formed into a U-bend, the load being applied at the center of the U. The bending angle is variable by means of a turning device. The instrument is used in conjunction with am analytical balance. The method described lends itself to a great many different applica-tions. Among others, the load-versus-deflection characteristics for various types of yarn have been determined. The influence of the number of fila-ments and proper sizing upon the stiffness is shown, as is the hysteresis effect. The method lends itself to the determination of the modulus of clasticity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the game}} of baseball, the bat-ball {{collision}} is {{of great interest to}} both the fan and the scientist. The performance of baseball bats has been investigated and while there are plenty of ways of changing their performance, bats do not perform significantly different under different climate conditions. Baseballs, being made of a <b>combination</b> of cowhide, <b>yarn</b> and rubber, can change weight when exposed to a different humidity, which in turn can result in a change in performance of its collision with a bat. Additionally, {{during the course of a}} year, baseballs are exposed to a variety of outdoor temperatures. This paper will discuss the effect of temperature on the performance of a standard collegiate baseball. Using standard- and high-speed COR testing methods, the effect of both heating and cooling of a baseball will be investigated. The results from the standard COR test show that there is only a slight increase in performance with the heating of a baseball to an elevated temperature beyond the extreme of what would be experienced in normal play. There is a much more significant change in performance when a baseball is cooled. The performance decrease can be as much as 4 % when the ball is subjected to subfreezing temperatures. The results of this study will help the scientific spectator understand how the game might change under different temperature conditions...|$|R
30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and <b>yarn</b> <b>combinations</b> in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and <b>yarn</b> <b>combination</b> in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|R
