Recently, carbon nanotubes {{have been reported to}} be an effective MALDI matrix for small molecules (Anal. Chem. 2003, 75, 6191), as it can eliminate the interfering matrix peaks as well as form a web morphology to fully disperse the analyte and allow strong ultraviolet absorption for enhanced pulsed laser desorption and ionization. In our study, to overcome the problem that the <b>carbon</b> nanotube <b>matrix</b> may fly off from the target, a type of polyurethane adhesive, NIPPOLAN-DC- 205, is introduced to immobilize carbon nanotubes on the target, which enables widespread application of <b>carbon</b> nanotubes as <b>matrix</b> for MALDI-MS analysis. At the same time, the properties of the carbon nanotubes as an efficient matrix remained after immobilization. The presence of NIPPOLAN-DC- 205 increases the time for analysis at a particular desorption spot by minimizing the time-consuming search for “hot spots” and facilitating experiments such as post source decay (PSD) which need longer-lasting signals. Moreover, NIPPOLAN-DC- 205 produces no interference peaks and can easily be cleaned with acetone. Fast evaporation technology may be used to enhance signal reproducibility in MALDI analysis using <b>carbon</b> nanotubes as <b>matrix.</b> Consequently, the applicability of the <b>carbon</b> nanotube as <b>matrix</b> for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis of low molecular mass analytes is highly improved.

Our group discovered the production of metal-nanostructured foams (NCFs) by laser ablation of triphenylphosphine (PPh 3)-containing organometallic targets [5]. We then demonstrated that organic ligands can act as efficient carbon sources for the laser ablation production of carbon nanomaterials. Metal-NCFs are three-component materials which consist of amorphous carbon aggregates, metal nanoparticles embedded in amorphous <b>carbon</b> <b>matrices,</b> and graphitic nanostructures. The metal-NCF composition, metal nanoparticle size, and dilution (i.e., metal and carbon content) within the <b>carbon</b> <b>matrices</b> can be tailored by conveniently choosing the metals (Au, Cu) and ligands of the ablated targets [6]. On the other hand, laser ablation of PPh 3 resulted in the production of metal-free NCFs consisting of graphitic nanostructures and P-containing amorphous carbon aggregates [6]. We report how our versatile ‘laser chemistry’ approach can be extended to the synthesis of a variety of other metal-NCFs, as well as to metal-free, P-free NCFs, proving that the synthesis of NCFs is not restricted to PPh 3 -based targets and therefore enabling envisioning the synthesis of metal-carbon hybrids by chemical design. Additionally, physicochemical studies have been performed on metal-free NCFs to evaluate their potential applications. We also show that NCFs can be easily chemically processed in the form of stable NCF dispersions in different solvents and NCF biocomposite fibers, which offer promise for NCF incorporation into different matrices and technological applications.|$|R
