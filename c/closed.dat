The empirical results show that the <b>closing</b> call has effectively reduced {{market volatility}} at <b>closing</b> and enhanced market efficiency by reducing noise in stock <b>closing</b> prices.

Because the limit order book is fully opaque for the five-minute call period, investors may <b>close</b> their position earlier than the <b>closing</b> period to avoid additional risk.
