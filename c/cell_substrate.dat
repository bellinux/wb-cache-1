50|$|In general inkjet {{solar cells}} {{are made by}} using an inkjet printer {{to put down the}} {{semiconductor}} material and electrodes onto a solar <b>cell</b> <b>substrate.</b> Both organic and inorganic solar cells can be made using the inkjet method. Inkjet printed inorganic solar cells are mainly CIGS solar cells. The organic solar cells are polymer solar cells. The inkjet printing of hybrid perovskite solar cells is also possible. The most important component of the ink is the functional material: a metal salt mixture(CIGS), a polymer fullerene blend (polymer solar cells) or a precursor of mixed organic and inorganic salts (perovskite solar cells). These components are dissolved in an appropriate solvent. Additional components might be added to affect the viscosity and the surface tension of the ink for improved printability and wetting on the substrate. The ink is contained in a cartridge from where it is transferred onto a substrate which can vary. The printing is accomplished usually by a piezoelectric driver in the nozzles of the printhead, that is programmed to apply pre-set patterns of pressure to eject droplets. In most cases several layers of functional materials are deposited {{on top of each other}} to generate a working solar cell. The entire printing process can be done in ambient conditions, though in most cases further heat treatments are needed. Important factors for the efficiency of inkjet printed organic solar cells are the inkjet latency time,the inkjet printing table temperature, and the effect of the chemical properties of the polymer donor.|$|E

40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{this study}} to design mouse {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs) that can inhibit the invasion of breast cancer cells in the host tissue. Therefore, MAbs were raised against epitopes on the extracellular domain of SK-BR- 3 human breast cancer cells, and biological assays were performed to test the capability of the MAbs to inhibit <b>cell</b> <b>substrate</b> adhesion. MAb 14 C 5 bound an extracellular plasma membrane antigen of SK-BR- 3 and MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells and inhibited the <b>cell</b> <b>substrate</b> adhesion of these cells in vitro. The MAb delayed the adhesion of MCF- 7 and SK-BR- 3 cells on precultured embryonic heart fragments (PHFS). It inhibited the destruction of the PHF by MCF- 7 cells and the invasion of the PHF by SK-BR- 3 cells. The MAb reacted with an epitope on the cell membrane of in situ and invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast in immunohistochemistry. Poorly differentiated, highly invasive ductal carcinomas show extensive staining of long plasma membrane extensions. Normal multilayered epithelia, normal connective tissue, and tumors derived from these tissues as well as normal breast tissue were negative. From both cell lines a protein complex consisting of two subunits with molecular weight of 50 and 90 kd, respectively, was immunoprecipitated.

Of 10 different cell lines (Vero, MDBK, HEK- 293, Hep-G 2, CV- 1, EBTr, WI- 38, R 9 ab, MDCK, and High Five) used in the study, only MDCK cell culture was found to support the efficient growth of all the tested mycoplasmas (Mycoplasma arginini, M. bovis, M. fermentans, M. gallinaceum, M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, M. hominis, M. hyorhinis, M. orale, M. salivarium, and Acholeplasma laidlawii) known to be most frequently associated with contamination of <b>cell</b> <b>substrates</b> and <b>cell</b> lines in research laboratories or manufacturing facilities. The infection of MDCK cells with serial dilutions of each mycoplasma species demonstrated that these common cell line contaminants can be detected reliably after 7 -day enrichment in MDCK cell culture at contamination levels of 0. 05 to 0. 25 CFU/ml. The High Five insect cell line was also found to be able to support the efficient growth of most mycoplasma species tested, except for M. hyorhinis strain DBS 1050. However, mycoplasma growth in insect cell culture was demonstrated to be temperature dependent, and the most efficient growth was observed when the incubation temperature was increased from 28 °C to between 35 and 37 °C.

40|$|Laminin- 5 {{is a major}} {{adhesion}} protein of {{the skin}} basement membrane and crucially involved in integrin-mediated <b>cell</b> <b>substrate</b> attachment of keratinocytes, which is important for hemidesmosomal anchorage {{as well as for}} keratinocyte migration during epidermal wound healing. To investigate its role in keratinocyte migration, we analyzed laminin- 5 -deficient cells of patients with a lethal variant of junctional epidermolysis bullosa. Normal migrating keratinocytes adopted monopolar morphology with a distinct front lamella and employed a continuous mode of translocation. In contrast, laminin- 5 -deficient cells assumed a stretched bipolar shape with two lamella regions and migrated in a discontinuous, saltatory manner characterized by significantly decreased directional persistence and reduced migration velocity. The distinct morphology as well as the migratory phenotype apparently resulted from a defect in the formation of <b>cell</b> <b>substrate</b> adhesions that were completely missing in the cell body and less stable in the lamella regions. Accordingly in normal keratinocytes, a bipolar shape and a saltatory migration mode were inducible by blocking laminin- 5 -mediated substrate adhesion.

Additional fatty acids, heptose, ketodeoxyoctoic acid, and phosphate were also detected.
