40|$|The {{tolerance}} to exogenous fats has been evaluated {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis. A three-stage lipid clearance test with continuous infusion (3 hr) of a triglyceride emulsion, Intralipid, was performed on 10 patients with well compensated liver cirrhosis and 10 normolipidemic volunteers. During the infusion, blood samples were collected for the measurement of particulate triglycerides (TG) by nephelometry; samples were also collected for total TG, free fatty acids (FFA) and free tryptophan (TRP) determinations. Plasma endogenous triglycerides were calculated as the total minus exogenous, particulate, TG. The fractional removal rate (K 2) and the maximal <b>clearing</b> <b>capacity</b> (K 1) for exogenous TG were lower in patients than in controls, though a significant difference (p less than 0. 05) was found only for K 1. Endogenous TG and FFA showed a comparable rise in patients and controls during Intralipid infusion. A significant increase in free TRP was noted in cirrhotics upon maximal infusion rate. It is concluded that: in patients with well compensated liver cirrhosis the maximal <b>clearing</b> <b>capacity</b> (K 1) for exogenous TG is impaired. Nonetheless, moderate amounts of fat may be removed at a normal rate from the bloodstream; a normal synthesis rate of exogenous TG may be maintained even in a severely damaged liver; considering the possible role of free TRP in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), the use of large amounts of lipids should be discouraged in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, or even avoided in those with impending or overt HE...|$|E

Methods The subjects consisted of 29 patients with EA (1 month to 19 years). Computerized esophageal manometry was conducted to investigate esophageal contractions at swallow. A topographic esophageal manometric analysis was conducted in each subject, providing 3 -dimensional displays to reveal the pressure continuum representing esophageal contractions. Results Significant contractions in the middle esophagus just below the anastomosis were absent in all subjects. Contractions in the distal esophagus were conspicuously absent in 17 subjects. Of these 17, 6 had already undergone fundoplication, and 9 had symptomatic GER requiring fundoplication subsequent to this study. The remaining 12 patients had contractions in the distal esophagus and did not require medical/surgical intervention. A lack of distal esophageal contractions was significantly correlated with the development of GER (P <. 001). There was a significant difference in esophageal acid exposure between the 2 groups (median, 38 % vs 4 %, P <. 001).

In the first visual synapse, this critical task is mainly undertaken by glutamate transporters (EAATs). Here we study the differential roles of the EAAT 1, EAAT 2 and EAAT 5 subtypes in glutamate (GLU) uptake at the photoreceptor-to-depolarizing bipolar cell synapse in intact dark-adapted retina. Various doses of EAAT blockers and/or GLU were injected into the eye before the electroretinogram (ERG) was measured. Their effectiveness and potency in inhibiting the ERG b-wave were studied to determine their relative contributions to the GLU clearing activity at the synapse. The results showed that EAAT 1 and EAAT 2 plays different roles. Selectively blocking glial EAAT 1 alone using UCPH 101 inhibited the b-wave 2 – 24 h following injection, suggesting a dominating role of EAAT 1 in the overall GLU <b>clearing</b> <b>capacity</b> in the synaptic cleft. Selectively blocking EAAT 2 on photoreceptor terminals had no significant effect on the b-wave, but increased the potency of exogenous GLU in inhibiting the b-wave.

40|$|Macrophages can be {{differentiated}} ex vivo from {{bone marrow}} hematopoietic stem cells, so-called bone marrow derived macrophages (BM macrophages), {{but also from}} embryonic stem cells resembling the embryonic/fetal development of macrophages, so-called ES macrophages. I hypothesized, that ES macrophages may represent a source of naïve macrophages resembling the embryonic macrophage subtype, which should be non-inflammatory, highly proficient in apoptotic cell clearing and tissue remodeling, and should facilitate scar-free wound healing. In contrast, BM macrophages are thought to represent a macrophage subtype predominantly mediating inflammation related immune responses and antigen presentation. ES macrophages were to be molecularly and functionally characterized in vitro in comparison to BM macrophages. To this end, I employed genome wide expression profiling, activation profiling, surface marker profiling, and functional assays testing endocytosis, adhesion, antigen presentation, and cell migration. Surface marker profiling and gene expression analysis revealed similar expression of the macrophage specific markers CD 14, CD 115, F 4 / 80, and CD 68 in BM and ES macrophages. In contrast, the two macrophage subtypes differed in {{the expression of the}} receptor repertoire involved in endocytosis of foreign body particles, calciprotein particles and apoptotic cells. This involved Toll-like receptors 4 and 6 and macrophage scavenger receptor 2, and resulted in higher <b>clearing</b> <b>capacity</b> in BM macrophages in comparison to ES macrophages. Developmental profiling revealed that ES macrophages resembled a liver hematopoietic embryonic or an adult macrophage subtype. Both macrophage subtypes were classified as resident macrophages that could be differentiated into prefusion osteoclasts, and showed differential activation properties concerning the classical and alternative activation pathway. BM macrophages were more sensitive to pro-inflammatory stimuli (classical activation), whereas ES macrophages showed stronger reaction to alternative activation and deactivation stimuli. Gene expression analysis revealed IL- 1 and IL- 3 -dependent differential expression of coagulation factors and MHC I and II molecules in BM and ES macrophages, but an inductor-independent up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase expression in the latter macrophage subtype. Functional analysis revealed that BM macrophages had a higher and more prolonged cross-presentation capacity in comparison to ES macrophages, whereas ES macrophages showed higher proteolytic activity in cell culture supernatant. The differential expression of integrins was associated with a higher adherence capacity of ES macrophages, e. g. on laminin and collagen types I and III. The transmigration properties of the two macrophage subtypes showed the complex network of the interplay between MMP secretion and integrin adhesion and was influenced by the interaction potential of the two macrophage subtypes with the endothelial monolayer. Macrophages are key players during all phases of wound healing, strongly associated with the severity of inflammation and the level of scar formation. Investigation of the influence of the two macrophage subtypes on wound healing in an in vivo-tail wound model showed diminished wound contraction, delayed eschar shedding and delayed wound closure in both macrophage-treated wound types compared to cell-free treated control wounds. Furthermore, macrophage-treatment of wounds resulted in prolonged neutrophil influx and prolonged inflammatory response. ES macrophage-treatment resulted in a higher cellularity of the wound after complete wound closure, mainly caused by fibroblast accumulation. These findings confirmed the hypothesis that BM macrophages resemble a macrophage subtype predominantly mediating inflammation related immune responses and tissue homeostatis, thus classified as M 1 macrophage according to Mantovani and colleagues (Mantovani et al. 2004). My original hypothesis held that ES macrophages should be non-inflammatory and predominantly involved in apoptotic cell clearing and tissue remodeling, resembling an embryonic/fetal macrophage subtypes, thus probably mediating scar-free healing. Contrary to this hypothesis, the present study showed that ES macrophages efficiently mediated inflammation related processes, showed less <b>clearing</b> <b>capacity</b> and were associated with fibroblast accumulation in tail wounds after complete re-epithelialization, eventually resulting in fibrosis. Consistent with the activation profiles, ES macrophages thus do not constitute an embryonic/fetal, but rather an alternatively activated macrophage subtype of the M 2 type according to current classification criteria (Mantovani et al. 2004) ...|$|E

Date: 7 October 2012 Kosi River {{starts from}} Tibet in China, gains {{momentum}} in Nepal, enters India {{to join the}} Ganges. Kosi is a young river. Chatara as nodal point, Kosi had shifted westward for about 120 km in past 250 years showing a cone (80 km long and 150 km wide alluvial fan) building activity, prior to its embankment in 1959. The major aim of Kosi barrage was to control flood in Bihar; irrigation, hydroelectricity generation, land reclamation, fishing and navigation were less important. Although it prevented major floods in Bihar for about 50 years, the Project was disputed. Some scholars also raised environmental and safety concerns. Kosi is a heavy sediment carrying river (80 million m 3 /year). So far no effective method has been developed to avoid siltation upstream of the barrage. The riverbed continued to rise at about 0. 05 m per year leading to a situation when it was 4 – 5 m above the land outside the embankments. Due to sloping landscape, Kosi breached eastern bank in its weakest part and followed some of its old channels. The 2008 flood took 527 lives, inundated 116, 000 ha of land and left 234, 000 people homeless. The 2008 Kosi flood has been considered as manmade for failure to address the sedimentation problem upstream of the barrage with effective counter measures, no regular repair and maintenance work of the upstream embankments and delay in opening the barrage gates. As a solution, India is lobbying for Kosi 269 m high dam 40 km north of present barrage. The proposal first suggested in 1937 has been opposed by Nepalese scholars.

40|$|BACKGROUND Post {{surgical}} adhesion {{formation is}} still an unsolved problem and occurs {{when there is an}} imbalance between fibrin deposition and fibrin <b>clearing</b> <b>capacity</b> in the abdominal cavity. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is associated with fibrosis and hyaluronan has in several studies been showed to reduce adhesions. There are limitations to study mechanisms in humans, thus experimental models are needed. This work used in vivo and in vitro models to study effects of TGF-β and hyaluronan, and may further elucidate their involvement in peritoneal repair. MATERIAL & METHODS TGF-β 1 and fibrinolytic components were measured in peritoneal tissue in patients (I). In models response to increased levels of TGF-β 1 on fibrinolytical components in cultured mesothelial cells (MC) were investigated (II). Measurements of fibrinolytic components and proliferation by hyaluronan were investigated in MC (III & IV). TGF-β isoforms and fibrinolytic components were assessed in peritoneal fluid and plasma during surgery, together with mesothelial proliferation in vitro (V). RESULTS Increased TGF-β 1 levels in adhesion tissue were associated with adhesion formation and TGF-β 1 correlated to plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1). Increasing levels of TGF-β 1 decreased production of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and increased PAI- 1 release into the culture media dose dependently in cultured MC. The in vitro studies of hyaluronan on MC indicated an increase in fibrinolytic capacity and an increase in proliferation when added. In peritoneal fluid during surgery elevated fractions of TGF-β 1 - 2 were found compared to plasma. The levels of TGF-β 1 in peritoneal fluid correspond to the levels found to increase MC proliferation in vitro. CONCLUSION Increased levels of TGF-β 1 in peritoneal tissue seem to be associated with adhesions, which in part might be explained by local decrease in fibrinolytic response from mesothelial cells. The clinical anti-adhesion effect of hyaluronan is unclear, but might partially be explained by increased fibrinolytical capacity and increased mesothelial proliferation. Low levels of active TGF-β 1 might increase mesothelial regeneration in vivo in combination with remained local fibrin degradation capacity found in the abdominal cavity during surgery. These findings might be of importance in the understanding of peritoneal repair...|$|E
40|$|Elevated plasma {{triglyceride}} (TG) is a {{major and}} independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is generally recognized that apolipoprotein (apo) A-V, a low abundance protein secreted solely by the liver, plays {{a critical role in}} TG metabolism. Studies with human APOA 5 transgenic (Tg) and gene disrupted mice (apoa 5 -/-) revealed profound metabolic effects: APOA 5 Tg mice exhibited a two-thirds decrease in plasma TG concentration whereas apoa 5 -/- mice had a four-fold elevation in plasma TG. Given the very low concentration of apoA-V in plasma, we hypothesized that apoA-V may influence plasma TG levels by affecting the assembly and/or secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. When apoA-V was overexpressed in cultured Hep 3 B cells, neither the amount of apoB secreted nor the density distribution of apoB-containing lipoproteins was affected. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that apoA-V has a unique association with cellular lipid droplets and may be involved in storage or mobilization of intracellular lipids. It was also confirmed in vivo that intrahepatic apoA-V was associated with lipid droplets isolated from livers of wild type and APOA 5 Tg mice. To define the structural requirements for apoA-V lipid droplet association, hepatoma cells were transfected with a series of C-terminal truncated apoA-V variants. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that apoA-V-(1 - 146) did not associate with lipid droplets. Ultracentrifugation of conditioned medium revealed that, unlike full-length apoA-V which associates with lipoproteins, apoA-V-(1 - 146) was present solely in the lipoprotein deficient fraction. These data suggest that the C-terminus of apoA-V is essential for lipid droplet association in transfected hepatoma cells and lipoprotein association in conditioned medium. On the other hand, we determined whether parenteral delivery of apoA-V is sufficient to lower plasma TG levels in apoa 5 -/- mice. Intravenous injection with apoA-V was found to substantially reduce TG in apoa 5 -/- mice but alterations to the putative heparin binding region of apoA-V attenuated its TG <b>clearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> In addition, parenteral apoA-V had no effect on plasma TG levels in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP 1) deficient mice.

40|$|Abstract: Three {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} investigate visual processing of global and local dimensions of hierarchical stimuli in fish (Xenotoca eiseni). In the first experiment, fish were trained to discriminate between a circle made of circle elements and a cross made of cross elements (consistent stimuli) and tested with a, circle made of crosses and a cross made of circles (inconsistent stimuli) to asses their global/local encoding preferences. Fish were also tested {{for their ability to}} discriminate single-element shapes. The second and the third experiments manipulated the density of the local elements (Experiment 2) {{and the size of the}} global and local shapes of the stimuli (Experiment 3) to assess whether these variables could affect global or local perception of hierarchical visual patterns in fish. In all the experiments, fish showed a global preference irrespective of the density and the size of the stimuli. This preference was not because of an inability to perceive the local constituents of the stimulus, since both fish trained with consistent and fish trained with inconsistent figures showed a <b>clear</b> <b>capacity</b> to discriminate between single-element shapes. Overall, these results suggest that a global preference is not a unique trait of human beings and that differences among different vertebrate species in the global/local strategies of stimulus encoding may be because of different ecological adaptations making initial elaboration of a visual scene in a global or local way more likely...|$|R

40|$|Standardized {{surveys are}} an {{integral}} part of most fish stock assessments. Ship time is expensive and new demands set by the ecosystem approach challenge present survey and sampling strategies with respect to coverage of all components of an ecosystem. Surveys are normally designed to cover the stock distribution and to estimate relative abundance with acceptable precision. Taking ecosystem considerations means more attention to non-commercial species and ecosystem processes including predator – prey interaction and biophysical interactions. In this paper we explore alternative use of survey effort based on data from the Barents Sea winter survey. Will a drastic reduction of survey effort reduce its consistency and will consistency change with sampling strategies? We explore the efficiency of combining minimalistic surveys with standard hydrographical sections. We analyse data of cod which is the main target species of our survey. Precision of abundance indices is reduced roughly according to reduced number of hauls. Observed trends in population abundance and overall mortality appear to be similar and so are also the variability bands around the average cohort trend. But the minimalistic surveys are more susceptible to year to year variability. There are systematic bias effects related to both age and mortality which are independent of effort and design and this represents a larger problem then sampling variability. A distribution of trawls along hydrographical sections reflects the standard survey well. We suggest that a reduced survey, e. g. carried out along hydrographical transects every second year, might <b>clear</b> <b>capacity</b> for essential ecosystem investigations including studies of unresolved year effects in surveys otherwise not funded.

5000|$|To {{establish}} that DeForte had standing, Harlan turned to previous cases. While the Fourth Amendment referred {{only to the}} right to be secure in houses, earlier Court decisions had extended that to include businesses as well. Other decisions, even before Jones, had held that that protection applied to even those individuals who did not hold legal title to a property. Finally, there was Katz, which [...] "also makes it <b>clear</b> that <b>capacity</b> to claim the protection of the Amendment depends not upon a property right in the invaded place, but upon whether the area was one in which there was a reasonable expectation of freedom from governmental intrusion", Harlan wrote, echoing his concurrence in that case.

40|$|HCV {{is mainly}} {{transmitted}} {{between people who}} inject drugs in developed countries. In this population, HCV prevalence is high and incarceration is recognised to be an independent risk factor for infection. This thesis integrates epidemiology, molecular epidemiology, and computational modelling to investigate HCV transmission among inmates in NSW prisons. In the first study, HCV incidence and associated risk behaviours were calculated in a prospective cohort of inmates in NSW prisons. Thirty-eight HCV incident cases were identified in 269. 94 person-years of follow-up yielding an estimated HCV incidence of 14. 08 (95 % CI: 9. 96 - 19. 32) per 100 person-years. Indigenous identity, injecting daily or more often, and injecting heroin {{were found to be}} associated with an increased risk of HCV infection. The second study integrated virus sequences with risk behaviour and spatio-temporal data in order to reveal transmission clusters among inmates in NSW. Three clusters of recent HCV transmission were detected consisting of four in-custody transmission events involving drug injecting and sharing between source/recipient pairs located in the same prison at the same time. Despite a large background population of prisoners with chronic HCV, transmission events from recently infected individuals were identified in the prison setting. In the third study, a computational model was developed to simulate the ongoing HCV epidemics in the NSW prisons. The model was used to predict future epidemiological trends and investigate scenarios of altered risk affecting the epidemic. The projected incidence of HCV was stable at 9. 72 (95 % CI: 9. 36 - 10. 08) per 100 person-years until 2020. The potential impact of changes in incarceration rates, and HCV prevention strategies to reduce HCV transmission in NSW prisons were explored. This approach of integrated epidemiological, molecular epidemiological and modeling methods to study HCV transmissions has <b>clear</b> <b>capacity</b> to inform policy and public health practice in the prison setting. Future work includes consideration of social network information, assessment of new antiviral treatment strategies in NSW prisons, and enhancing linkage with community-based research...|$|R
