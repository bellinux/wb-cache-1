40|$|Abstract Forty to {{eighty percent}} of {{melanoma}} tumors have activating mutations in BRAF although the clinical importance of these mutations is not clear. We previously reported an analysis of BRAF mutations in metastatic melanoma samples from 68 patients. In this study, we correlated patient baseline characteristics, prognostic factors, and/or clinical outcomes {{with the presence of}} BRAF mutations. No significant differences were observed in age, gender, location of primary melanoma, stage at the diagnosis, and depth of primary tumor between patients with and without BRAF mutations. Melanomas harboring BRAF mutations were more likely <b>to</b> <b>metastasize</b> <b>to</b> liver (P = 0. 02) and <b>to</b> <b>metastasize</b> <b>to</b> multiple organs (P = 0. 048).

30|$|The {{complexity}} of tumors and their sophisticated interactions with their environment call for imaging methods capable of detecting {{a diversity of}} tumor hallmarks [1, 2]. Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18 [*]F] 2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-d-glucose (FDG), the most efficient imaging method to detect cancer, is an indicator of tumor energy metabolism dominated by aerobic glycolysis in both cancer and tumor-associated inflammatory cells [3]. However, FDG-PET carries no information about other cancer hallmarks such as angiogenesis, replicative immortality, evasion of growth suppressors, <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize,</b> and yields at best indirect information on resistance to apoptosis and proliferation [1]. PET imaging with other radiotracers can complement FDG but cannot be performed in the same imaging session. It also increases radiation exposure. As far as experimental molecular imaging is concerned, multiple PET sessions are difficult to envision {{on a large scale}} because of high cost and low practicability.|$|E
40|$|Melanomas {{are among}} the {{aggressive}} tumor types because of their notorious resistance to treatment and their high <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize.</b> ATF 2 is among transcription factors implicated in the progression of melanoma and its resistance to treatment. Here we demonstrate that {{the expression of a}} peptide spanning amino acids 50 – 100 of ATF 2 (ATF 250 – 100) reduces ATF 2 transcriptional activities while increasing the expression and activity of c-Jun. Altering the balance of Jun/ATF 2 transcriptional activities sensitized melanoma cells to apoptosis, an effect that could be attenuated by inhibiting c-Jun. Inhibition of ATF 2 via RNA interference likewise increased c-Jun expression and primed melanoma cells to undergo apoptosis. Growth and metastasis of SW 1 and B 16 F 10 mouse melanomas were inhibited by ATF 250 – 100 to varying degrees up to a complete regression, depending on the mode (inducible, constitutive, or adenoviral delivery) of its expression...|$|E

40|$|Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of {{the head}} and neck are {{malignant}} tumors with high <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> invade and <b>metastasize.</b> We have examined expression of the new collagenase, collagenase- 3 (MMP- 13), in SCCs {{of the head}} and neck. MMP- 13 mRNAs were detected in 22 of 29 SCC cell lines: in 14 of 15 primary SCC cell lines and in 8 of 14 SCC cell lines from recurrent tumors or metastases. MMP- 13 mRNAs were expressed by all 6 cell lines from highly invasive primary tumors and in all 4 cell lines from small aggressive tumors. Using in situ hybridization, MMP- 13 mRNAs were detected in 15 of 17 SCC tumor samples. In most tumors, MMP- 13 was expressed by tumor cells at the invading front of the tumors, but in a subset of SCCs, MMP- 13 mRNA was also expressed by stromal fibroblasts. No MMP- 13 expression was detected in intact skin or oral mucosa. MMP- 13 mRNA levels in SCC cells were enhanced by transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-alpha, and keratinocyte growth factor. Specific expression of MMP- 13 by SCC cells in vitro and in vivo strongly suggests a role for MMP- 13 in the high invasion capacity of SCC cells...|$|R

40|$|Carcinoma {{of unknown}} primary (CUP) is an {{intriguing}} clinical finding that {{is defined as}} biopsy-proven metastasis from a malignancy {{in the absence of}} an identifiable primary site after a complete clinical work-up.

Notable advances have been made over the past years in the treatment of well-defined clinical subgroups of CUP, such as women with peritoneal carcinomatosis and young adults with poorly differentiated carcinomas of midline distribution, but for the majority of patients, the prognosis still remains poor. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CUP syndrome, and emphasize the importance of identifying several favorable subsets of CUP, amenable to specific treatment options. In addition, we will point out novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which will hopefully improve both our understanding and the prognosis of this more or less neglected disease...|$|E
40|$|Hyalinizing {{spindle cell}} tumor with giant rosettes" (HSCTGR) is a {{recently}} described tumor, which {{is regarded as}} an unusual variant of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. Proof of a metastatic potential was lacking. The patient in the report was a 35 -yr-old woman who showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with massive pleural effusion in the right side.

Two years before this presentation, the patient received a routine chest radiograph which demonstrated bilateral multiple pulmonary nodules. A lobectomy of the left upper lung was performed. The histological findings revealed a well-circumscribed nodule that was characterized by a spindle-shaped fibrous to hyalinized stroma with criss-crossing short fascicles and giant collagen rosettes surrounded by a rim of spindle-shaped cells. Electron microscopy confirmed the fibroblastic nature of the tumor. This case, in addition to at least two other cases reported in the literature, demonstrates that the HSCTGR is a malignant neoplasm with the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize</b> after a long hiatus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) {{is a well-known}} prerequisite for cancer cells to acquire the migra-tory and invasive <b>capacity,</b> and <b>to</b> subsequently <b>metastasize.</b> Bufalin {{is one of the}} major active components of the tradi-tional Chinese medicine Chan Su, and accumulating evidence has shown its anticancer effect in multipe types of cancer. However, the role of bufalin in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) -induced EMT and migration remains unclear. In the present study, the effect of bufalin on TGF-β-induced EMT and migration was investigated in human lung cancer A 549 cells. TGF-β induced EMT in A 549 cells and increased their migratory ability, which were markedly suppressed by bufalin. Additionally, TGF-β-induced upregulation of Twist 2 and zinc finger E‑box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB 2), as well as the phosphorylation of Smad 2 and Smad 3 were also inhib-ited by bufalin. However, the Smad-independent signaling pathways were not affected. Further analysis showed that the TGF-β receptor I (TβRI) and TGF-β receptor II (TβRII) were downregulated in the presence of bufalin. Pretreatment with SB 431542, a potent inhibitor of the phosphorylation of TβRI, significantly attenuated TGF‑β-induced EMT, mimicking the effect of bufalin on A 549 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that bufalin suppresses TGF-β-induced EMT and migration by downregulating TβRI and TβRII in A 549 cells...|$|R

40|$|Giant Cell tumors (GCT) are benign tumors with {{potential}} for aggressive behavior and <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize.</b> Although rarely lethal, benign bone tumors {{may be associated}} with a substantial disturbance of the local bony architecture that can be particularly troublesome in peri-articular locations. Its histogenesis remains unclear. It is characterized by a proliferation of mononuclear stromal cells and the presence of many multi- nucleated giant cells with homogenous distribution. There is no widely held consensus regarding the ideal treatment method selection. There are advocates of varying surgical techniques ranging from intra-lesional curettage to wide resection. As most giant cell tumors are benign and are located near a joint in young adults, several authors favor an intralesional approach that preserves anatomy of bone in lieu of resection. Although GCT is classified as a benign lesion, few patients develop progressive lung metastases with poor outcomes. Treatment is mainly surgical. Options of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are reserved for selected cases.

40|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} is able {{to detect}} subtle changes to the surface chemistry of cells. We have previously shown that high-resolution 1 H NMR methods can identify tumor cells with the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize,</b> and we now report that the long T 2 relaxation value (500 – 800 ms) observed in metastatic rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells is removed by treatment with fucosidase. Two-dimensional scalar-correlated NMR (COSY) spectra of fucosidase-treated cells show that a cross peak, consistent with scalar coupling between the methyl and methinè groups on fucose and usually associated with malignancy and metastatic ability, is absent. Metastases were observed in only two out of ten rats injected subcutaneously with enzyme-treated cells compared to eight out of ten with untreated cells. NMR studies on isolated cellular lipids identified the long T 2 relaxation value only in the ganglioside fraction. This fraction accounts for 51 % of the total 14 C-labelled fucose incorporated into the cells. We propose that fucogangliosides are an indicator of metastatic potential in rats. The observation that a cell surface metastasis marker has an NMR signal with a characteristically long relaxation value has important consequences for the future use of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy in the cancer clinic...|$|E
40|$|Apoptotic {{cell death}} is {{involved}} in development and tissue homeostasis in numerous organisms, {{and changes in the}} apoptotic pathways are associated with many diseases, including cancer. The fi rst evidence for an association between apoptosis and cancer was the discovery that the oncogene bcl- 2 was involved in cell survival in lymphoma. Since then, alterations in the expression of genes that participate in cell survival pathways and resistance to apoptosis have become a hallmark of cancer. A failure to trigger apoptosis properly is an essential requirement during tumor progression and contributes to tumor resistance to radioor chemotherapy. Melanoma, one of the most aggressive cancers, is characterized by an elevated <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize</b> and by a high resistance to drugs. The strategies used by melanoma cells to avoid apoptosis often differ from those in other cancer cells. For example, in contrast to many tumors that frequently show a loss of p 53 expression, melanoma maintains p 53 expression but alters the p 53 pathways. In this review, we summarize various aspects of melanocyte biology and consider the genetic alterations exploited by melanoma cells to escape apoptosis. We also discuss recent fi ndings that have extended our understanding of the resistance of melanocytes to apoptosis during tumor progression...|$|E

40|$|Hypoxia-inducible {{transcription}} factor 1 (HIF- 1) and HIF- 2 α regulate {{the expression of}} an expansive array of genes associated with cellular responses to hypoxia. Although HIF-regulated genes mediate crucial beneficial short-term biological adaptations, we hypothesized that chronic activation of the HIF pathway in cardiac muscle, as occurs in advanced ischemic heart disease, is detrimental. We generated mice with cardiac myocyte-specific deletion of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), {{an essential component of}} an E 3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for suppressing HIF levels during normoxia. These mice were born at expected frequency and thrived until after 3 months postbirth, when they developed severe progressive heart failure and premature death. VHL-null hearts developed lipid accumulation, myofibril rarefaction, altered nuclear morphology, myocyte loss, and fibrosis, features seen for various forms of human heart failure. Further, nearly 50 % of VHL−/− hearts developed malignant cardiac tumors with features of rhabdomyosarcoma and the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize.</b> As compelling evidence for the mechanistic contribution of HIF- 1 α, the concomitant deletion of VHL and HIF- 1 α in the heart prevented this phenotype and restored normal longevity. These findings strongly suggest that chronic activation of the HIF pathway in ischemic hearts is maladaptive and contributes to cardiac degeneration and progression to heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Aim and background. In breast cancer, as {{in almost}} all {{neoplastic}} diseases, the prog-nosis is strictly related to the invasive capacity, local and distant, that characterizes the growth of all tumors. Since the mechanisms that regulate replication of the neo-plastic cells, with consequent <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize,</b> are not completely known, identification of new markers represents the gold standard {{of research in the}} stratifi-cation of patients with such a pathology. Osteopontin, a specific phosphoglycopro-tein isolated from extracellular bone matrix and actively involved in mechanisms of bone reabsorption, appears to {{play a key role in}} osteoclastogenesis at the level of the skeleton in some pathologic situations. It has been found that patients with metasta-tic bone lesions from breast or prostate cancer present, with respect to subjects with-out repetitive bone lesions, elevated serum levels of the protein, indicating that os-teopontin could play an important role in the development and progression of the neoplastic disease at the bone level. Methods and study design. The authors studied 26 patients with breast cancer, eval-uating as a marker also serum osteopontin levels. Results and conclusions. The results, although obtained on a small number of patients, showed that osteopontin evaluation in breast cancer patients can be a particularly in-teresting method of research in staging of the disease as well as in the prognosis, there-by attributing a role of a biotumoral marker also in the follow-up of the therapy...|$|E

Infections and inflammations have the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>metastasize</b> and despite the localized nature of periodontal disease, infection of the sulcus/periodontal pocket can lead to inflammatory responses beyond the periodontium. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is primarily a non-specific marker of inflammation with multiple pro-inflammatory properties and some studies have noted its concurrent reduction and CVD following periodontal therapy. A 12 year old Nigerian girl presented clinically with simultaneous occurrence of aggressive periodontitis, periodontal and skin abscesses with eventual teeth loss. Pre-operative quantitative analysis of plasma CRP was 1500 mg/l, moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Porphyromonas gingivalis were isolated from the skin and periodontal pus respectively and basic heamatological values were within normal range. Intensive non-surgical periodontal therapy was done at intervals of two months complemented with high dose of Amoxicillin and Metronidazole for seven days. The periodontal condition resolved, skin abscesses healed with scarring and the removable acrylic partial dentures delivered improved the patient’s appearance and eventual overall quality of life. This case may suggest a possible link between periodontal and skin disease because of the resolution of these conditions and concurrent lowering of the serum level of CRP following periodontal therapy.
