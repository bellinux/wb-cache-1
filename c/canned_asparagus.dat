30|$|We {{emphasize}} {{that it is}} not the use of calorie value and nutrition value is inappropriate or unsophisticated; it is that the adoption of calorie and nutrition measures may differentiate food commodities unnecessarily, and adds levels of complexity to the entire estimating process. For example, equivalent weight measures of fresh asparagus, frozen asparagus, cooked asparagus, and <b>canned</b> <b>asparagus</b> will have varying levels of calorie and nutrition. It is possible to make the same argument for the different varieties of asparagus (white, green, purple, and wild). Furthermore, other researchers have argued that where and how the produce is grown (in fertile versus arid lands; using various cultivation practices), processed, transported, stored, and prepared will influence calorie and nutrition values.|$|E

2500|$|Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is {{naturally}} present in most wines, probably from {{the breakdown of}} sulfur containing amino acids.

40|$|Although Iowa {{has never}} ranked high {{among the states}} as a {{producer}} of asparagus for market or <b>canning,</b> the <b>asparagus</b> acreage planted, particularly by canners, is increasing. No exact information is available concerning {{the effect of the}} cutting season’s length upon yields over a period of years. Market gardeners usually stop cutting asparagus in Iowa between June 1 and June 15. The demand for asparagus at this time decreases and the prices drop too low for profitable harvesting. To prevent damage to future yields, June 15 also appears to be the latest safe harvest date, though no substantiating experimental data have been available. Canners, however, could harvest asparagus later than June 15 profitably if such treatment did not injure the yield and quality of the future harvests...|$|R
50|$|Field crops yield {{almost two-thirds}} of the gross {{agricultural}} income of the province. Animal products contribute a further 30%, with the balance generated by horticulture. Ninety percent of the country's cherry crop is produced in the Ficksburg district, which {{is also home to}} the country's two largest <b>asparagus</b> <b>canning</b> factories. Soya, sorghum, sunflowers and wheat are cultivated in the eastern Free State, where farmers specialise in seed production.

50|$|Asparagus, a light {{chicken or}} {{vegetable}} stock and milk or cream are primary ingredients. The cooked asparagus may be puréed or pulped in its preparation, and some preparations may combine both puréed and solid forms of asparagus, such as cooked asparagus tips. Puréed versions may be strained through a sieve to remove stray stringy asparagus matter. The use of thick pieces of <b>asparagus</b> <b>can</b> enhance {{the flavor of}} puréed versions of cream of <b>asparagus</b> soup, as <b>can</b> the use of fresh asparagus while it is in season (during spring).|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} Abensberg, the {{so-called}} sand belt between Siegburg, Neustadt an der Donau, Abensberg and Langquaid, {{is used for}} the intensive farming of asparagus, due to the optimal soil condition and climate. 212 hectares of land <b>can</b> produce ninety-four <b>asparagus</b> plants. Abensberg asparagus enjoys a reputation among connoisseurs as a particular delicacy. In addition to asparagus, the production of hops plays a major role locally, the region having its own label, and there are still three independent breweries in the area. The town of Abensberg marks the start of the Deutsche Hopfenstraße (German Hops Road), a nickname given to the Bundesstraße 301, a German federal highway which runs through the heartland of Germany's hops-growing industry, ending in Freising.|$|R
40|$|The {{bargaining}} {{process and}} its role in price discovery within the Pacific Northwest asparagus industry is analyzed using a general empirical bargaining model. Growers' and processors' inverse supply and demand functions define boundaries for the negotiated prices. OLS and Heckman's two-stage estimation procedures are used to estimate a stochastic bargaining model of price determination. The results indicate that basic supply and demand forces exert substantial influences on the bargaining process. In particular, expected levels of supply play a paramount role in the level of prices offered, while past prices also influence current offers. The general framework of analysis used in relation to <b>asparagus</b> <b>can</b> be generalized to other commodities where bargaining plays a role in price discovery. The model can be used to investigate the extent to which major economic forces impact bargaining behavior. Crop Production/Industries, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the effects of}} cooked whole asparagus and its purified bioactive, rutin, on colitis symptoms and disease progression in mice using a chemically-induced model of colitis. This model mimics active colitis and recovery states of ulcerative colitis. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed a basal diet supplemented with 2 % asparagus or 0. 025 % rutin for 3 weeks. Colitis was induced by 2 % dextran sodium sulfate in drinking water for 7 days. Asparagus diet was determined to contain higher antioxidant capacities than rutin diet through antioxidant assays. During active colitis, consumption of asparagus alleviated some clinical symptoms (stool consistency, stool blood, and spleen hypertrophy) of colitis. In recovery, asparagus-fed mice were improving in terms of regenerating crypts, surface epithelial, and goblet cells, potentially due to its rutin content. Overall, these findings advocate that <b>asparagus</b> <b>can</b> be therapeutic in treating symptoms during active colitis and recovery phases of ulcerative colitis.

40|$|Background : Herbal drugs used {{to treat}} illness {{according}} to Ayurveda are often misidentified or adulterated with similar plant materials. Objective: To aid taxonomical identification, we used DNA barcoding to evaluate authentic and substitute samples of herb and phylogenetic relationship of four medicinal plants of family Asparagaceace and Asclepiadaceae. Materials and Methods : DNA extracted from dry root samples of two authentic and two substitutes of four specimens belonging to four species were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Primers for nuclear DNA (nu ITS 2) and plastid DNA (matK and rpoC 1) were used for PCR and sequence analysis was performed by Clustal W. The intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence were calculated using MEGA V 4. 0. Statistical Analysis : Kimura′s two parameter model, neighbor joining and bootstrapping methods were used in this work. Results: The result indicates the efficiency of amplification for ITS 2 candidate DNA barcodes was 100 % for four species tested. The average interspecific divergence is 0. 12 and intraspecific variation was 0. 232 {{in the case of}} two Asparagaceae species. In two Asclepiadaceae species, average interspecific divergence and intraspecific variation were 0. 178 and 0. 004 respectively. Conclusions: Our findings show that the ITS 2 region <b>can</b> effectively discriminate <b>Asparagus</b> racemosus and Hemidesmus indicus from its substitute samples and hence can resolve species admixtures in raw samples. The ITS 2 region may be used as one of the standard DNA barcodes to identify closely related species of family Asclepiadaceae but was noninformative for Asparagaceae species suggesting a need for the development of new markers for each family. More detailed studies involving more species and substitutes are warranted...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "U. S. asparagus imports increased in the 1990 s and now comprise nearly one-half of the asparagus consumed in the United States. Peru is the second largest source of imported asparagus and benefits from duty-free treatment under the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA). ATPA is estimated to have displaced between two and eight percent {{of the value of}} domestic production from what it would have been without the act. Although the supply of fresh asparagus from imports has increased since ATPA's enactment, consumer demand has been strong, and prices have risen. In addition, an apparent increase in consumer preference for fresh asparagus has contributed to a downward shift in the domestic demand for processed asparagus. Most of the decline in the domestic production of processed asparagus occurred in Michigan and Washington, the two states that produce most <b>canned</b> and frozen <b>asparagus.</b> If ATPA is reauthorized, domestic producers of asparagus and, in particular, asparagus for processing, will likely face continued displacement, but consumers can expect continued benefits from the year-round availability of fresh asparagus. However, some of this displacement will likely occur even if ATPA is not reauthorized and the normal tariff is imposed. If ATPA is not reauthorized, consumers would likely have decreased availability and pay higher prices to the extent that tariff increases reduce Peruvian asparagus imports and hence total asparagus supplies. Domestic industries can petition the U. S. International Trade Commission to investigate whether increased imports under the ATPA have caused them serious injury or threat of serious injury. If the Commission finds serious injury, it may recommend relief options to the President, including suspending duty-free treatment for imports. ...|$|R
