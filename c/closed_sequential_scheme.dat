40|$|Abstract—Sequential pattern mining {{algorithms}} developed so far {{provide better}} performance for short sequences but are inefficient at mining long sequences, since long sequences generate {{a large number}} of frequent subsequences. To efficiently mine long sequences, <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern mining algorithms have been developed. These algorithms mine <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns which don’t have any super sequences with the same support. <b>Closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns are more compact comparing to the patterns produced by the sequential pattern mining algorithms. In this paper, we propose a framework for mining <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns by integrating the best features of SPAM and CHARM. Our algorithm is the first method that utilizes vertical bitmap data structure for <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern mining...|$|R

40|$|Local distinguishability of bipartite unitary {{operations}} {{has recently}} received much attention. A nontrivial and interesting question concerning this subject {{is whether there}} is a <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> for locally discriminating between two bipartite unitary operations, because a <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> usually represents the most economic strategy for discrimination. An affirmative answer to this question was given in the literature, however with two limitations: (i) the unitary operations to be discriminated were limited to act on d⊗ d, i. e., a two-qudit system, and (ii) the inverses of the unitary operations were assumed to be accessible, although this assumption may be unrealizable in experiment. In this paper, we improve the result by removing the two limitations. Specifically, we show that any two bipartite unitary operations acting on d_A⊗ d_B can be locally discriminated by a <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme,</b> without using the inverses of the unitary operations. Therefore, this paper enhances the applicability and feasibility of the <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> for locally discriminating unitary operations.

40|$|Feature Extraction is {{significant}} for determining security vulnerabilities in software. Mining <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns provides complete and condensed information for non-redundant frequent sequences generation. In this paper, {{we discuss the}} feature interaction problem and propose an efficient algorithm to extract features in vulnerability sequences. Each <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern represents a feature in software vulnerabilities. We explore how to efficiently maintain <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns in vulnerability sequences. A compact structure WClosedTree is designed to keep <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns, and its nice properties are carefully studied. Two main pruning strategies, backwards super pattern condition and equivalent position information condition, are developed to remove frequent but non-closed sequential patterns in WClosedTree. During the process of maintaining WClosedTree, the weight metric of each feature sequence is calculated to better {{meet the needs of}} decision makers. Thus, the proposed algorithm can efficiently extract features from vulnerability sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the runtime efficiency for mining <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns, and the feature interaction framework implements feature extraction in software vulnerabilities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Discovery of Sequential pattern mining is an {{important}} data mining mission with wide applications.

There is no model that used multithreading techniques for parallel mining of <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns. In this paper an algorithm called MTMCSP (multi-thread mining of <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns) is recommended to conduct parallel mining of <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns on a multi-processor system as a multi-threading technique. MTMCSP divides the works among the tasks by using the divide-and-conquer property.

Actually, all these force elements are independent from each other, i. e., determination {{of each one}} does not require inputs from others. This independent feature makes LTD feasible for parallel computing. A parallel scheme has been proposed and compared with the conventional <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> in regard to computational efficiency. The parallel scheme is tested as not suitable for LTD; computing time of the parallel scheme is about 165 % of the <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> on a four-CPU personal computer (PC).

40|$|International audienceMining <b>closed</b> {{contiguous}} <b>sequential</b> patterns {{has been}} {{addressed in the}} literature only recently, through the CCSpan algorithm. CCSpan mines a set of patterns that contains the same information than traditional sets of <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns, while being more compact due to the contiguity. Although CCSpan outperforms <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern mining algorithms in the general case, it does not scale well on large datasets with long sequences. Moreover, {{in the context of}} noisy datasets, the contiguity constraint prevents from mining a relevant result set. Inspired by BIDE, that has proven {{to be one of the}} most efficient <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern mining algorithm, we propose CCPM that mines <b>closed</b> contiguous <b>sequential</b> patterns, while being scalable. Furthermore, CCPM introduces usable wildcards that address the problem of mining noisy data. Experiments show that CCPM greatly outperforms CCSpan, especially on large datasets with long sequences.

40|$|Discovery of {{sequential}} patterns is {{an essential}} data mining task with broad applications. Among several variations of <b>sequential</b> patterns, <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern is the most useful one since it retains all the information of the complete pattern set but is often much more compact than it. Unfortunately, there is no parallel <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern mining method proposed yet. In this paper we develop an algorithm, called Par-CSP (Parallel <b>Closed</b> <b>Sequential</b> Pattern mining), to conduct parallel mining of <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns on a distributed memory system. Par-CSP partitions the work among the processors by exploiting the divide-and-conquer property so that the overhead of interprocessor communication is minimized. Par-CSP applies dynamic scheduling to avoid processor idling. Moreover, it employs a technique, called selective sampling, to address the load imbalance problem. We implement Par-CSP using MPI on a 64 -node Linux cluster. Our experimental results show that Par-CSP attains good parallelization efficiencies on various input datasets...|$|R

Comparing to frequent sequential pattern mining, frequent Max, or <b>Closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern mining generates less number of patterns, and therefore improves the efficiency and effectiveness of these tasks. This thesis first gives a formal definition for frequent Max, and <b>Closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern mining problem, and then proposes two efficient programs MaxSequence, and Closedsequence to solve these problems.

40|$|Sequential pattern mining aims to find {{frequent}} patterns (guarded by {{a minimum}} support) in {{a database of}} sequences. As the support decreases the number of sequential patterns will increase rapidly. Therefore, a new trend is to mine <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns, i. e. patterns which have no super-patterns with the same support in the database. Since mining <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> pattern has the same capability as mining the complete set of sequential patterns while reduces redundant patterns to be generated and stored, it is much economical and beneficial. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel approach which extends a frequent sequence with closed itemsets instead of single items. The motivation is that <b>closed</b> <b>sequential</b> patterns are composed of only closed itemsets. Hence, unnecessary item extensions which generates non-closed sequential patterns can be avoided. Furthermore, we propose LayerPruning which removes unnecessary enumeration by comparing candidate prefixes in the same layer rather than comparing one prefix against historical ones.

40|$|Under the {{assumption}} that spatially homogeneous image textures are modelled by Gibbs random fields with multiple pairwise pixel interactions, parallel and <b>sequential</b> <b>schemes</b> of learning a characteristic interaction structure are compared. The learning can {{be based on a}} comparison of relative interaction energies or other integral characteristics of each interaction, for instance, chi-square distances between certain grey level difference or cooccurrence histograms collected over a given training sample. Parallel thresholding selects a basic structure of stronger, that is, more energetic or distant, interactions that is sufficient to model a specific class of stochastic textures introduced in [3, 4]. In many cases the basic structure is larger than is required because it contains not only the strong primary interactions but also the su ciently strong secondary interactions obtained by a statistical interplay of the primary ones. Empirical sequential learning proposed by Zalesny [6, 7] tends to exclude the secondary interactions so that the basic structure can be reduced in size and complemented with affine structure that describes minor but visually important repetitive details of a texture. The empirical <b>sequential</b> <b>scheme</b> that involves a great body of computations can be approximated by less complex analytical and combined analytical-empirical <b>sequential</b> <b>schemes.</b> Experiments show that the sequential learning results in more precise Gibbs models of non-stochastic regular textures but does not improve (and sometimes may even deteriorate) the basic structure of stochastic textures...|$|R

It is shown that the bound can be attained both pointwise and sequentially for any model family in the reference class and without any prior knowledge of its order. This is achieved by a universal scheme based on a mixing approach. The bound and its sequential achievability establish a completely deterministic significance to the concept of predictive MDL.
