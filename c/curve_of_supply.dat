40|$|The aim of {{the essay}} is to clarify a number of ambiguities that the debates on capital theory of the 1960 s and 1970 s left open and to {{underscore}} new lines of analysis within which the possibility of ‘perverse cases’ can be studied. The essay is developed around three points. The first {{is to show that}} reswitching and capital reversal have no particular role in the critique of the aggregate neo-classical theory of distribution. The translation <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> and demand for capital in one-good models into n-good models runs into conceptual difficulties such as to make these curves a meaningless construction in n-good models, whatever the behaviour of the demand for capital may be and, thus, independently of whether ‘perverse cases’ occur or not. The second point is the assessment of the importance of ‘perverse cases’ {{on the basis of the}} probability analysis of such cases. The results obtained so far offer strong support for the consideration of capital reversal as a paradoxical or perverse case. The third point regards recent contributions that analyse the possibility and characteristics of ‘perverse cases’ within general equilibrium models. Within this context, a paradox of thrift (a decrease in steady state per capita consumption as the propensity to save increases) appears as a quite new result. In conclusion, the three points underscore both an interesting broadening of the focus of the analysis of capital theory and significant differences with respect to the debates of the 1960 s...|$|R

Settlement of the problem, and its connection with important scientific and practical tasks. According to its nature, the market economy is unstable and is in constant movement. Economy has an effective instrument for explanation of changes in economic environment; this tool is called the modelling of economic processes. The modelling of economic processes depends first and foremost on the building of economic model which is the base for the formalization of economic process, that is, the building of mathematical model. The effective means for formalization of economic process {{is the creation of}} the model of hypothetic or imaginary economy. The building of demand model is significant for the market of goods and services. The problem includes the receiving (as the result of modelling) definite functional properties <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing feasibilities and demand according to which one can determine their mathematical model. Another problem lies in obtaining majorant properties <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> joint demand on the market of goods and services. Analysis of the latest researches and publications. Many domestic and foreign scientists dedicated their studies to the researches and building of the models <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing feasibilities and demand.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{operation}} of the labor market, and a <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> aggregate <b>supply</b> is derived, for the cases of closed and open economy, in the short, medium and long term. In an open economy, {{an important part of the}} production costs is derived of the use of imported inputs in the fabrication of the products. Therefore, the domestic price level, besides depending on the level of the nominal wage, is also associated to factors like the exchange rate or to the international price of imported inputs. In the short term, since the nominal wage and the exchange rate are independent of the activity level, the price level is constant and therefore the aggregate supply is perfectly elastic. In the medium term, an increment of the level of economic activity, reduces the unemployment rate and produces an increment of the wages, that elevates the costs of production of the companies and the price level of the economy. Therefore, firms are willing to offer a larger production but at a higher price level. In the long term, prices do not affect the level of economic activity, which implies that the aggregate supply is perfectly inelastic. After presenting the different versions <b>of</b> the aggregate <b>supply,</b> we carry out exercises of comparative static to show the effects on aggregate <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> a technological change and an increment of the international price of petroleum. ...|$|R

40|$|Power {{industry}} has restructured in last decades {{and now it}} has become a commodity rather than a utility with the maximization of profit as its main purpose. Peak ripples in the electricity demand curve could disturb the economic generation. In developing countries, Electric Supply Companies are unable to meet the existing power demand due to unfeasible and unjustified fuel burning. Therefore, they are left with load shedding as the only Demand side solution. It is a well-known fact that the Light Emitting Diodes (LED) Lighting could be used to conserve electricity.
