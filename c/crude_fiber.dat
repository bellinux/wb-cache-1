Samples of carrot jam were prepared by replacing 0, 25, 50 and 75 % of sugars with date paste from Sukary "second grade " and Wannanah varieties. The jam samples were evaluated for physical, chemical and sensory characteristics. The obtained results indicated that replacing sugars with date paste increased jam ash, protein, <b>crude</b> <b>fibers</b> and minerals (Ca, Mg, K, Mn, Fe and Zn), while it decreased sodium contents. The sensory properties were also improved as the proportion of date paste were increased up to 50 % of sugars, while beyond that (50 %) a noticeable decrease in the overall acceptability of jam was noticed, especially with Wannanah variety. Therefore, from the results, one may recommend the use of date paste of some date varieties, such as Sukary as a sugar substitute in jam production to increase its nutritional value and sensory characteristics.

Furthermore, one sample was analysed six times {{over a period of}} approximately one year. The statistical evaluation showed that no single step in the sampling procedure contributed with excessive variance and that the variance caused by the sampling procedure was approximately the same as the variance in the chemical analysis observed over a year.
