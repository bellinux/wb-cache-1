40|$|The {{community}} {{structure in}} relation to habitat type was studied in a Mediterranean <b>community</b> of <b>snakes</b> from Canale Monterano, central Italy. Habitat data for snakes were analysed both overall and divided by season, i. e. spring (April&ndash;June) and summer (July&ndash;September). Community analyses were performed using null models (RA 2 and RA 3 algorithms) and Monte Carlo simulations on habitat niche overlap estimates. Null models suggested that the community was assembled non-randomly (according to RA 2 but not RA 3), indicating that the generalist-specialist nature (the number of resource states, but not necessarily the types) used by each species in the assemblage reduced ecological similarity. Similar results were reached also performing the same null model procedures on the spring datasets, whereas no structure emerged during summer either by RA 2 or RA 3 algorithms. In general, {{this study suggests that}} the <b>community</b> structure of <b>snakes</b> during spring may be shaped by the different eco-physiological needs of the various species (probably, the differential tolerance to cold and the consequent needs of finding suitable hibernacula), whereas the lack of structure during summer may be caused by the between-species similar foraging needs...|$|R

It {{is not surprising that}} studies of the biology of rarity have grown tremendously during the past two decades, with particular emphasis on patterns observed in insects, birds, mammals, and plants. I analyse the patterns of the biology of rarity by using a novel model system: <b>snake</b> <b>communities</b> worldwide. I also test some of the main hypotheses that have been proposed to explain and predict rarity in species. I use two operational definitions for rarity in snakes: Rare species (RAR) are those that accounted for 1 % to 2 % {{of the total number of}} individuals captured within a given community; Very rare species (VER) account for &le; 1 % of individuals captured. I analyse each community by sample size, species richness, continent, climatic region, habitat and ecological characteristics of the RAR and VER species. Positive correlations between total species number and the fraction of RAR and VER species and between sample size and rare species in general were found. As shownin previous insect studies, there is a clear trend for the percentage of RAR and VER snake species to increase in species-rich, tropical African and South American communities. This study also shows that rare species are particularly common in the tropics, although habitat type did not influence the frequency of RAR and VER species. This analysis also confirms the commonly accepted ecological hypothesis that body size and rarity are clearly and widely correlated in natural animal <b>communities.</b> However, in <b>snake</b> <b>communities</b> there is often an association between large and small species among the rare species, and a tendency for ophiophagous species to be rare. In addition, there was no support for the hypothesis that rare species should be typically phylogenetically primitive. The hypothesis that species with narrower realized ecological niches are more likely to be rare or very rare is supported by the evidence presented here on <b>snake</b> <b>communities.</b> In general, this study shows that snakes may make &rdquo;model organisms&rdquo; for studies on the biology of rarity...|$|R

Space alone affects species immigration from the regional species pool, whereas habitat filters affect species distribution and inter-specific interactions. This study aimed {{to understand how}} the interplay between environmental and geographical processes influenced the structure of Neotropical <b>snake</b> <b>communities</b> in different habitat types. We selected six studies that sampled snakes in forests, four conducted in savannas and two in grasslands (the latter two are grouped in a non-forest category). We used the net relatedness and nearest taxon indices to assess phylogenetic structure within forest and non-forest areas. We also used the phylogenetic fuzzy-weighting algorithm to characterize phylogenetic structure across communities and the relation of phylogenetic composition patterns to habitat type, structure, and latitude. Finally, we tested for morphological trait convergence and phylogenetic niche conservatism using four forest and four non-forest areas for which morphological data were available. Community phylogenetic composition changed across forest and non-forest areas suggesting that environmental filtering influences community structure. Species traits were affected by habitat type, indicating convergence at the metacommunity level. Tail length, robustness, and number of ventral scales maximized community convergence among forest and non-forest areas. The observed patterns suggested environmental filtering, indicating that less vertically structured habitats represent a strong filter. Despite the fact that phylogenetic structure was not detected individually for each community, we observed a trend towards communities composed by more closely related species in higher latitudes and more overdispersed compositions in lower latitudes. Such pattern suggests that the limited distribution of major snake lineages constrained species distributions. Structure indices for each community were also related to habitat type, showing that communities from non-forest areas tend to be more clustered. Our study showed that both environmental filtering and spatial gradients play important roles in shaping the composition of Neotropical <b>snake</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bromus tectorum L., {{commonly}} called cheatgrass, is considered undesirable on rangelands {{due to its}} invasive nature {{and its ability to}} alter the environment, thereby increasing wildfire frequency (Whisenant, 1990). Land managers consider native perennial bunchgrasses, such as Stipa spp., desirable for the restoration and maintenance of healthy rangelands. Stipa spp. refers to Stipa comata Trin. 2 ̆ 6 Rupr. 2 ̆ 2 needle and thread grass 2 ̆ 2 and Stipa thurberiana Piper 2 ̆ 2 Thurber 2 ̆ 7 s needlegrass 2 ̆ 2 throughout the rest of this thesis. Domestic livestock grazing has changed the plant <b>communities</b> of the <b>Snake</b> River Plain by reducing the density of native perennial grasses and increasing the density of native shrubs and exotic annuals (Miller et al., 1991). Trampling by livestock also reduces the density and biomass of microbiotic crusts (Beymer 2 ̆ 6 Klopatek, 1992;) which are an integral component of ecological <b>communities</b> on the <b>Snake</b> River Plain. Microbiotic crusts are primarily non-vascular plant corrununities which grow on or in the top 1 cm of the soil profile (Brotherson and Rushforth, 1983; Dunne, 1989). A reduction in the density of native perennial grasses has been correlated with a decrease in microbiotic crust cover (Beymer 2 ̆ 6 Klopatek, 1992). This decrease in microbiotic crusts and native perennial grasses potentially creates an environment suitable for Bromus tectorum establishment. Consequently, in the past twenty years, there has been increased interest in the role that microbiotic crusts play in ecosystems of semi-arid and arid lands (St. Clair and Johansen, 1993). Are microbiotic crusts important for the recovery of native plant communities? Thus far, there has been little research into the effects of microbiotic crusts on the germination and establishment of seedlings (Eldridge and Greene, 1994). The present study examines the effects of varying degrees of microbiotic crust cover on the germination and establishment of three range grasses, Bromus tectorum, Stipa thurberiana, and S. comata, as well as the effects of microbiotic crusts on soil moisture and soil nutrients. In addition, germination rates for these three grass species are determined for the southern Snake River Plain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Plants have {{traditionally}} {{been used as a}} source of medicine in India by indigenous people of different ethnic groups inhabiting various terrains for the control of various ailments afflicting human and their domestic animals. The indigenous <b>community</b> of <b>snake</b> charmers belongs to the 'Nath' community in India have played important role of healers in treating snake bite victims. Snake charmers also sell herbal remedies for common ailments. In the present paper an attempt has been made to document on ethno botanical survey and traditional medicines used by snake charmers of village Khetawas located in district Jhajjar of Haryana, India as the little work has been made in the past to document the knowledge from this community. Methods Ethno botanical data and traditional uses of plants information was obtained by semi structured oral interviews from experienced rural folk, traditional herbal medicine practitioners of the 'Nath' community. A total of 42 selected inhabitants were interviewed, 41 were male and only one woman. The age of the healers was between 25 years and 75 years. The plant specimens were identified according to different references concerning the medicinal plants of Haryana and adjoining areas and further confirmation from Forest Research Institute, Dehradun. Results The present study revealed that the people of the <b>snake</b> charmer <b>community</b> used 57 medicinal plants species that belonged to 51 genera and 35 families for the treatment of various diseases. The study has brought to light that the main diseases treated by this community was snakebite in which 19 different types of medicinal plants belongs to 13 families were used. Significantly higher number of medicinal plants was claimed by men as compared to women. The highest numbers of medicinal plants for traditional uses utilized by this community were belonging to family Fabaceae. Conclusion This community carries a vast knowledge of medicinal plants but as snake charming is banned in India as part of efforts to protect India's steadily depleting wildlife, this knowledge is also rapidly disappearing in this community. Such type of ethno botanical studies will help in systematic documentation of ethno botanical knowledge and availing to the scientific world plant therapies used as antivenin by the Saperas community. </p...|$|R
