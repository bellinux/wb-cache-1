5|$|Chesma (Russian: Чесма, {{sometimes}} transliterated as Tchesma) was {{the second}} ship of the s built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her waterline armor belt was submerged. Russian <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> not produce the most advanced armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff, so they were imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium. Chesma spent her career {{as part of the}} Black Sea Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The OT {{supplied}} {{supervisors and}} labour {{as well as}} organising supplies, machinery and transport to supplement the staff and equipment of construction companies, {{many of them were}} German however construction companies in occupied counties bid for contracts. <b>Companies</b> <b>could</b> apply for OT work or could be conscripted. Companies failing to complete their work on time, which was always possible as the OT controlled the material and manpower of each firm, could find themselves closed down, or more likely fined, or taken over or merged with another firm to make a more efficient larger unit, successful firms however could make attractive profits.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E

5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913. The resulting act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1919. In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time to carry out the works for its own 1913 act. Although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.|$|E
5|$|The first lorry made in Vanaja was a Sisu S-22 prototype, which {{rolled out}} of the factory door on 1 August 1945. After a short and {{intensive}} testing period, serial production began on 29 October 1945 but because of a shortage of materials and component quality problems, the first vehicles were not ready until early 1946. The capabilities of the domestic suppliers proved to be very limited and the company was dependent on imported gearboxes, steering components, drive shafts and electrical systems until domestic <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> {{set up their own}} production. The Finnish suppliers were unable to meet the requirements with the available materials and experienced severe quality problems. Total production in 1946 was 147 Sisu S-22 vehicles, which was far below the target of 2,000 vehicles. The original, calculated price per vehicle had been 765,000marks but the eventual cost was 800,000marks.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} New Paltz station {{burned down}} around 4:45 A.M. on April23, 1907, damaging freight and killing station agent E. J. Snyder's dog. The fire {{originated in the}} office stove, and spread rapidly before local fire <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> arrive. A passenger car {{was used as a}} temporary station while the building was rebuilt. By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely rebuilt by December31, 1907, and in active use by February7, 1908. While the original station had a gabled roof, the rebuilt station was hipped. The direction of the new station's battens was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot.|$|E

5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E
5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E

25|$|The killing was {{the result}} of a new policy which Trujillo called the 'Dominicanisation of the frontier'.

25|$|In the 1940s, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) {{appointed}} INA President John A.

25|$|Merkel {{supported}} a substantial reform agenda for Germany's {{economic and social}} system, and was considered more pro-market than her own party (the CDU). She advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week. She argued that existing laws made the country less competitive, because <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> not easily control labour costs when business is slow.|$|E
25|$|Unions have {{recently}} been engaged in a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects. They worry that these codes could have legitimizing effects on companies that do not actually live up to good practices, and that <b>companies</b> <b>could</b> use codes to excuse or distract attention from the repression of unions.|$|E
