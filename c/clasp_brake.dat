5000|$|The term {{drum brake}} usually means a brake in which shoes press {{on the inner}} surface of the drum. When shoes press {{on the outside of}} the drum, it is usually called a <b>clasp</b> <b>brake.</b> Where the drum is pinched between two shoes, similar to a {{conventional}} disc brake, it is sometimes called a pinch drum brake, though such brakes are relatively rare. A related type called a band brake uses a flexible belt or [...] "band" [...] wrapping around the outside of a drum.|$|E

50|$|Under TOPS, the {{remaining}} wagons were allocated codes MCO and MCV {{for those with}} <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> (two shoes per wheel), and from 1981 code MXV for those with push brakes (one shoe per wheel).|$|R
50|$|Freight cars (and some {{passenger}} cars like multiple-unit cars whose traction motors do not yield room on axles {{to allow the}} placement of disk brakes) are equipped with <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> which directly grab the rolling surface of the wheels (much like the old horse buggy brakes of yesteryear). Such brakes are an external-shoe drum brake; but unlike band brakes and many internal-shoe drum brakes, there is no self-assist/self-servo effect, {{and so they are}} far less susceptible to locking than self-assist brakes. Due to high stiffness and relatively low power, these <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> are even less prone to lockup than many disc brakes, and so freight cars using them are not equipped with anti-lock systems.|$|R
50|$|Three 4-6-4 tender {{locomotives}} {{were built}} for the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) by Borsig in 1935. Designated Class 05, they were designed for high speed running. They were three-cylinder locomotives with giant 90+1/2 in driving wheels and powerful <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> on all wheels.|$|R
50|$|Four vacuum {{cylinders}} operated <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> on all tender {{wheels and}} a hand brake was included.

The mechanical stoker's engine was mounted on the tender.|$|R
500|$|The {{spaces between}} driving wheels housed steam-powered <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes,</b> that gripped the wheels {{by way of}} a [...] "scissor" [...] action. The two middle brake hangers held two brake blocks each, whilst the two outside hanger on the leading and rear driving wheels held one block each. These were {{connected}} together by outside rodding for ease of access, and the whole system was operated from the footplate.|$|R

50|$|Brakes {{are used}} on the cars of railway trains to enable deceleration, control {{acceleration}} (downhill) or to keep them standing when parked. While the basic principle is familiar from road vehicle usage, operational features are more complex {{because of the need}} to control multiple linked carriages and to be effective on vehicles left without a prime mover. <b>Clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> are one type of brakes historically used on trains.|$|R
25|$|The trams had {{a primary}} dynamic braking {{controlled}} through 12 stages. There are also pnumatic drum brakes, {{although they are}} only used for parking, braking form the back end and for a passenger-induced emergency brake. The MO units were instead equipped with <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> controlled by pneumatics. Trailers were equipped with solenoid brakes, but lacked a parking brake as {{it was found that}} the motor unit's holding brake was sufficient., In addition all units had an emergency rail brake. The trams were connected with Albert couplers.|$|R
50|$|The {{bodyshell}} is 75 ft long, almost 10 ft {{longer than}} the Mark 2, of full monocoque construction with an all-welded mild steel stressed skin, and {{has a reputation for}} its exceptional strength and crashworthiness. An important advance over its predecessor was the adoption of secondary air suspension between the body and the bogies, giving an exceptionally smooth ride. The bogies, classified BT10 (BT5 on the prototype vehicles), were designed specifically for the Mark 3 and have coil-spring primary suspension with hydraulic dampers, enabling a maximum speed of 125 mph - the Mark 2 is limited to 100 mph. Disc brakes in place of the Mark 2 <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> completed the engineering package enabling - in conjunction with wheel slip protection (WSP) - efficient deceleration from 125 mph and almost silent brake operation.|$|R

5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered <b>clasp</b> <b>brakes</b> and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|R

50|$|The mill {{may have}} started life with two Common sails and two Spring sails carried on a wooden windshaft as the wooden <b>clasp</b> arm <b>Brake</b> Wheel has had to be fitted with packing pieces to enable it to fit the current windshaft, which being of iron is a smaller {{diameter}} than a wooden one would be. The Wallower is of cast iron, carried on a wooden upright shaft. This carries the Great Spur Wheel, which is of iron with wooden cogs and drove the two pairs of millstones underdrift.
