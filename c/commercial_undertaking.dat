2500|$|An {{entrepreneur}} {{has been}} defined as, [...] "a person who starts, organizes and manages any enterprise, especially a business, usually with considerable initiative and risk; running a small business with all the risk and reward of any given business process". Entrepreneurs tend {{to be good at}} perceiving new business opportunities and they often exhibit positive biases in their perception (i.e., a bias towards finding new possibilities and seeing unmet market needs) and a pro-risk-taking attitude that makes them more likely to exploit the opportunity. An entrepreneur may be in control of a <b>commercial</b> <b>undertaking,</b> directing the factors of production – the human, financial and material resources – that are required to exploit a business opportunity. Entrepreneurs act as managers and oversee the launch and growth of an enterprise. Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. The exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include: ...|$|E

60|$|On casting {{back our}} eyes over {{the series of}} events we have recorded, we {{see no reason to}} {{attribute}} the failure of this great <b>commercial</b> <b>undertaking</b> to any fault in the scheme, or omission in the execution of it, {{on the part of the}} projector. It was a magnificent enterprise; well concerted and carried on, without regard to difficulties or expense. A succession of adverse circumstances and cross purposes, however, beset it almost from the outset; some of them, in fact, arising from neglect of the orders and instructions of Mr. Astor. The first crippling blow was the loss of the Tonquin, which clearly would not have happened, had Mr. Astor's earnest injunctions with regard to the natives been attended to. Had this ship performed her voyage prosperously, and revisited Astoria in due time, the trade of the establishment would have taken its preconcerted course, and the spirits of all concerned been kept up by a confident prospect of success. Her dismal catastrophe struck a chill into every heart, and prepared the way for subsequent despondency.|$|E

60|$|As a canal-maker, Telford {{was hardly}} less {{successful}} {{than as a}} constructor of roads and harbours. It is true, his greatest work in this direction was in one sense a failure. He was employed by Government for many years as the engineer of the Caledonian Canal, which runs up the Great Glen of Caledonia, connecting the line of lakes whose basins occupy that deep hollow in the Highland ranges, and so avoiding the difficult and dangerous sea voyage round the stormy northern capes of Caithness. Unfortunately, though the canal as an engineering work proved {{to be of the}} most successful character, it has never succeeded as a <b>commercial</b> <b>undertaking.</b> It was built just at the exact moment when steamboats were on the point of revolutionizing ocean traffic; and so, though in itself a magnificent and lordly undertaking, it failed to satisfy the sanguine hopes of its projectors. But though Telford felt most bitterly the unavoidable ill success of this great scheme, he might well have comforted himself by the good results of his canal-building elsewhere. He went to Sweden to lay out the Gotha Canal, which still forms the main high-road of commerce between Stockholm and the sea; while in England itself some of his works in this direction--such as the improvements on the Birmingham Canal, with its immense tunnel--may fairly be considered as the direct precursors of the great railway efforts of the succeeding generation.|$|E

You take advantage of her inexperience to bind her by this iniquitous contract, knowing {{that the end of}} it will be that you will advance her a little money and get her into your power, and then will send her down there to the Hutches, where all the spirit and originality and genius will be crushed out of her work, and she will become a hat-writer like the rest of them--for Meeson's is a strictly <b>commercial</b> <b>undertaking,</b> you know, and Meeson's public don't like genius, they like their literature dull and holy!--and it's an infernal shame! that's what it is, uncle!"

30|$|In particular, {{processes}} {{connected to}} innovation {{of products or}} processes {{are linked to the}} great effort, whether scientific, technological, organizational, financial or <b>commercial,</b> <b>undertaken</b> to achieve a substantially improved version in terms of function or content, when compared to previous versions or to alternative methods for solving the same issues, or to the effort needed to place the improved version on the market (Dewar and Dutton 1986). It follows that a new or different game system put in place to solve organizational problems on the football pitch can be seen as an innovation to the production function of professional football clubs. According to Borland (2006), this process can be expressed through a formula in which performance is in function of a series of variables, which include the quality of the players in the team {{and the quality of the}} coach or manager. It follows that coaches/managers are the people who introduce innovation and, focusing on the aim of this research work, it is first necessary to concentrate on their role.|$|R

50|$|The {{desire to}} connect new pits, and {{get access to}} {{existing}} ones, drove the Caledonian to get powers for more new lines by Act of 1896.
