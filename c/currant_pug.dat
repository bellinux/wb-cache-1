50|$|The <b>currant</b> <b>pug</b> (Eupithecia assimilata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is found across the Nearctic and Palearctic regions and the Near East.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 21-23 mm and the forewings {{are warm}} brown with two black spots along the costa {{with a black}} discal spot completing a distinctive triangle. There is a narrow pale line near the fringe with a distinct whitish spot near the tornus, although this is not as prominent as in the rather similar <b>currant</b> <b>pug.</b> The hindwings are greyish brown. The species flies at night in June and July and is attracted to light.|$|E
40|$|After {{an absence}} of 50 years, the <b>currant</b> <b>pug</b> moth, Eupithecia assimilata Doubleday (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), has reappeared as an {{important}} pest of hops, Humulus lupulus L. (Cannabaceae), in the UK. Pheromone gland extracts from virgin female E. assimilata moths were shown to contain (3 Z, 6 Z) -cis- 9, 10 -epoxyheneicosadiene (3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 21 :H) by gas chromatography linked to mass spectrometry. (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) -heneicosatriene (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 21 :H) was also found as a minor component {{in one of two}} extracts. In field experiments, significant numbers of male E. assimilata moths were caught in traps baited with the (9 S, 10 R) -enantiomer of 3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 21 :H but not in those baited with the (9 R, 10 S) -enantiomer or racemic mixture. Addition of 3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 21 :H at the ratio present in gland extracts greatly reduced the attractiveness of the epoxydiene...|$|E
