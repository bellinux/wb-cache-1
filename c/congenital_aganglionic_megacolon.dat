It is a clinical entity that can simulate pediatric gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as gastroparesis, megacolon and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and presents more frequently in children with mental retardation. Early recognition and diagnosis of functional aerophagia or pathologic aerophagia is required to avoid unnecessary, expensive diagnostic investigations or serious clinical complications. Functional aerophagia is frequent in the adult population, but rarely discussed in the pediatric literature.

40|$|Hirschsprung {{disease is}} a <b>congenital</b> form of <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon</b> that results from cristopathy. Hirschsprung disease usually occurs as a {{sporadic}} disease, {{although it may be}} associated with several inherited conditions, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET have been reported in up to 50 % of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and in 15 - 20 % of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease. The prevalence of Hirschsprung disease in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 cases was recently determined to be 7. 5 % and the cooccurrence of Hirschsprung disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 has been reported in at least 22 families so far. It was initially thought that Hirschsprung disease could be due to disturbances in apoptosis or due to a tendency of the mutated RET receptor to be retained in the Golgi apparatus. Presently, there is strong evidence favoring the hypothesis that specific inactivating haplotypes {{play a key role in}} the fetal development of congenital megacolon/Hirschsprung disease. In the present study, we report the genetic findings in a novel family with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 : a specific RET haplotype was documented in patients with Hirschsprung disease associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, but it was absent in patients with only medullary thyroid carcinoma. Despite the limited number of cases, the present data favor the hypothesis that specific haplotypes not linked to RET germline mutations are the genetic causes of Hirschsprung disease...|$|R

In the mouse, the dilated portion showed an abrupt increase in adrenergic fibers. These findings are related to the pathophysiology of the disorder.

Radioligand binding assays revealed undetectable levels of functional EDNRB in tissues from homozygous sl/sl rats. We conclude that EDNRB plays an essential role in the normal development of two neural crest-derived cell lineages, epidermal melanocytes and enteric neurons, in three mammalian species [...] humans, mice, and rats.

To test this hypothesis, complex segregation analysis was performed on data on 487 probands and their families. Demographic information on probands and the recurrence risk to relatives of probands are presented. An increased sex ratio (3. 9 male:female) and an elevated risk to sibs (4 %), as compared with the population incidence (0. 02 %), are observed, with the sex ratio decreasing and the recurrence risk to sibs increasing as the aganglionosis becomes more extensive. Down syndrome was found at an increased frequency among affected individuals but not among their unaffected sibs, and the increase was not associated with maternal age. Complex segregation analysis was performed on these family data. The families were classified into separate categories by extent of aganglionosis. For cases with aganglionosis beyond the sigmoid colon, the mode of inheritance is compatible with a dominant gene with incomplete penetrance, while for cases with aganglionosis extending no farther than the sigmoid colon, the inheritance pattern is equally likely to be either multifactorial or due to a recessive gene with very low penetrance.

The sl and ls phenotypes are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the Endothelin-B receptor (Ednrb) and Endothelin 3 (Edn 3), respectively. The identification of Sox 10 as the gene mutated in Dom mice (B. H. et al., manuscript submitted) prompted us to analyse the role of its human homologue SOX 10 in neural crest defects. Here we show that patients from four families with WS 4 have mutations in SOX 10, whereas no mutation could be detected in patients with HSCR alone. These mutations are {{likely to result in}} haploinsufficiency of the SOX 10 product.

Here, we report heterozygous EDNRB missense mutations (G 57 S, R 319 W and P 383 L) in isolated HSCR.

40|$|Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or <b>{{congenital}}</b> <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon,</b> is {{the most}} common cause of congenital bowel obstruction with an incidence of 1 in 5000 live births. Recently, linkage of an incompletely penetrant, dominant form of HSCR was reported, followed by identification of mutations in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. To determine the frequency of RET mutations in HSCR and correlate genotype with phenotype, we have screened for mutations among 80 HSCR probands representing a wide range of phenotypes and family structures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of RET's 20 exons for mutations among probands revealed eight putative mutations (10 %), Sequence changes, which included missense, frameshift and complex mutations, were detected in both familial and isolated cases, among patients with both long- and short-segment HSCR and in three kindreds with other phenotypes (maternal deafness, talipes and malrotation of the gut, respectively). Two mutations (C 609 Y and C 620 R) we identified have previously been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 A (MEN 2 A), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and, on rare occasions, HSCR. Thus, while HSCR family members may be at risk for developing neuroendocrine tumors, it follows that identical mutations in RET may be able to participate in the pathogenesis of distinct phenotypes.

The approach of single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis established for all the 20 exons of the RET proto-oncogene, and previously used to screen for point mutations in Hirschsprung patients allowed us to identify seven additional mutations among 39 sporadic and familial cases of Hirschsprung disease (detection rate 18 %). This relatively low efficiency in detecting mutations of RET in Hirschsprung patients cannot be accounted by the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity, which is {{not supported by the}} results of linkage analysis in the pedigrees analyzed so far. Almost 74 % of the point mutations in our series, as well as in other patient series, were identified among long segment patients, who represented only 25 % of our patient population.

Materials and Methods: We studied all HIV perinatal exposed children routinely followed up in the Paediatric Department of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, since January 1 st 2006 till December 31 st 2012. The analyses consisted of describing the birth defects and association with certain risk factors: gender, mother's age at birth and exposure to antiretrovirals in the first trimester of pregnancy. Results: We analyzed 244 children born to HIV-infected mothers. The incidence of HIV infection was 16. 39 %. The rate of birth defects was 39. 34 % (96 / 244 cases). The most frequent findings were cardiac malformations (47 / 96), followed by musculoskeletal defects (24 / 96), neurologic defects (20 / 96), urogenital malformations (13 / 96), digestive tract defects (3 / 93), metabolic disorders (2 / 96) and genetic disorders (2 / 96). We found nine cases of severe congenital anomalies: complex heart defect, total <b>congenital</b> <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon,</b> anal imperforation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, gangliosidosis, Niemann-Pick syndrome, Down syndrome, true hermaphroditism and cleft palate. Two children died during first year of life due to severe malformations. 9 % of cases had associated malformations. The gender rate was in favour of males in group with birth defects (58 / 38) and with no birth defects (82 / 66). The median age at birth in mothers was 22 years, similar in both groups. The highest mean age at birth was in offspring's mothers with neurologic congenital defects 25, 15 years old, but is not statistically significant (p= 0. 1). In the studied period the highest number of birth defects were found in 2012, 37 children, compared with less than 15 in previous years (not statistically significant, p= 0. 07). In our studied patients the risk of birth defects was not statistically associated with HIV transmission or with exposure to antiretrovirals before and in first trimester of pregnancy (p= 0. 88).

Despite the multifactorial determination of HSCR {{in the vast majority}} of cases, there is a monogenic subgroup for which private rare RET coding sequence mutations with high penetrance are found (45 % of HSCR familial cases). An asymmetrical parental origin is observed for RET coding sequence mutations with a higher maternal inheritance. A parent-of-origin effect is usually assumed. Here we show that a differential reproductive rate for males and females also leads to an asymmetrical parental origin, which was never considered as a possible explanation till now. In the case of HSCR, we show a positive association between penetrance of the mutation and parental transmission asymmetry: no parental transmission asymmetry is observed in sporadic RET CDS mutation carrier cases for which penetrance of the mutation is low, whereas a parental transmission asymmetry is observed in affected sib-pairs for which penetrance of the mutation is higher. This allows us to conclude that the explanation for this parental asymmetry is that more severe mutations have resulted in a differential reproductive rate between male and female carriers. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Editors: Ramón Núñez and Maria Angelica Fabbro (C/ Fco. Vaca Morales, Badajoz, Spain, and others). Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, OMIM: 142623), or <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon,</b> is a {{developmental}} disorder characterised {{by the absence}} of intramural ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses (Meissner and Auerbach plexuses, respectively) along a variable length of the distal gastrointestinal tract, leading to {{the most common form of}} functional intestinal obstruction in neonates and children [1]. The disorder was first reported in 1888 by the Danish pediatrician Harald Hirschsprung in two unrelated boys treated until 7 and 11 month of age for severe constipation and abdominal distension resulting in congenital megacolon [2]. But was not till the 1940 s, when histological studies revealed the absence of ganglion cells downstream of the dilated part of the colon [1]. HSCR is regarded as a failure of neural crest cells to migrate, proliferate, differentiate or survive in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract between the fifth and 12 th week of gestation to form the enteric nervous system (ENS) [3]. The classification of HSCR is according to the length of the aganglionic segment [4]. While the internal anal sphincter is the constant inferior limit, patients could be classified as short-segment HSCR (S-HSCR: 80...|$|R
40|$|Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR, <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon),</b> is a <b>congenital</b> {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} the absence of enteric ganglia in variable portions of the distal intestine. Besides the major HSCR gene, RET, and other implicating genes (e. g. EDNRB), existing evidence suggests that additional loci contributing to sporadic HSCR exist. To identify these loci, we conducted a genome-wide association study on 200 Chinese HSCR patients and 408 ethnically matched controls. Apart from SNPs in RET, the strongest overall associations were found for two SNPs (rs 16879552 and rs 7835688) located in intron 1 of the neuregulin 1 gene (NRG 1) on 8 p 12. Replication was carried out on an independent set of 190 HSCR case and 510 control subjects, yielding the combined odds ratios of 1. 68 (p= 1. 80 x 10 - 8) and 1. 98 (p= 1. 12 x 10 - 9) for the heterozygous risk genotypes of rs 16879552 and rs 7835688 respectively under the additive model. Significant interaction was also found between RET and NRG 1 (p= 0. 0095), which further increased the odds ratio 2. 3 -fold to 19. 53 for the RET rs 2435357 risk genotype (TT) {{in the presence of the}} NRG 1 rs 7835688 heterozygote.

40|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) of {{the coding}} regions of {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} gene (RET) are associated with Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR, <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon).</b> These SNPs, individually or combined, may act as a low penetrance susceptibility locus and/or be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with another susceptibility locus located in RET regulatory regions. Because two RET promoter SNPs have been found associated with HSCR, in LD with HSCR-associated RET coding region haplotypes, their implication in the transcriptional regulation of RET is of major interest. Analysis of 172 sporadic HSCR patients also revealed the presence of HSCR-associated RET promoter SNPs in LD with the main coding region RET haplotype observed in Chinese patients. By using a weighted logistic regression approach, we determined that of all SNPs tested in our study, the promoter SNPs are the most correlated to the disease. Functional analysis of the RET promoter SNPs {{in the context of}} additional 5 0 regulatory regions demonstrated that the HSCRassociated alleles decrease RET transcription. These SNPs overlap a TTF- 1 binding site and TTF- 1 -activated RET transcription is also decreased by the HSCR-associated SNPs. Moreover, we identified an HSCR patient with a Gly 322 Ser TTF- 1 mutation that compromises activation of transcription from HSCR-associated RET promoter haplotypes. Interestingly, we show that the pattern of RET and TTF- 1 expression is coincident i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Panda (s) is an {{autosomal}} recessive mutation, which displays overall white plumage color with spots of wild-type plumage in the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). In a previous study, the s locus {{was included in}} the same linkage group as serum albumin (Alb) and vitamin-D binding protein (GC) which are mapped on chicken (Gallus gallus) chromosome 4 (GGA 4). In this study, we mapped the s locus on the microsatellite linkage map of the Japanese quail by linkage analysis. Results Segregation data on the s locus were obtained from three-generation families (n = 106). Two microsatellite markers derived from the Japanese quail chromosome 4 (CJA 04) and three microsatellite markers derived from GGA 4 were genotyped in the three-generation families. We mapped the s locus between GUJ 0026 and ABR 0544 on CJA 04. By comparative mapping with chicken, this locus was mapped between 10. 0 Mb and 14. 5 Mb region on GGA 4. In this region, the endothelin receptor B subtype 2 gene (EDNRB 2), an avian-specific paralog of the mammalian endothelin receptor B gene (EDNRB), is located. Because EDNRB is responsible for <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon</b> and spot coat color in mouse, rat and equine, EDNRB 2 is suggested to be a candidate gene for the s locus. Conclusion The s locus and the five microsatellite markers were mapped on CJA 04 of the Japanese quail. EDNRB 2 was suggested to be a candidate gene for the s locus. </p...|$|R
40|$|Waardenburg {{syndrome}} (WS) is an auditory-pigmentary {{disorder that}} exhibits varying combinations of {{sensorineural hearing loss}} and abnormal pigmentation of the hair and skin. Depending on additional symptoms, WS is classified into four subtypes, WS 1 –WS 4. Absence of additional features characterizes WS 2. The association of facial dysmorphic features defines WS 1 and WS 3, whereas the association with Hirschsprung disease (<b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon)</b> characterizes WS 4, also called “Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease. ” Mutations within the genes MITF and SNAI 2 {{have been identified in}} WS 2, whereas mutations of EDN 3, EDNRB, and SOX 10 have been observed in patients with WS 4. However, not all cases are explained at the molecular level, which raises the possibility that other genes are involved or that some mutations within the known genes are not detected by commonly used genotyping methods. We used a combination of semiquantitative fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization to search for SOX 10 heterozygous deletions. We describe the first characterization of SOX 10 deletions in patients presenting with WS 4. We also found SOX 10 deletions in WS 2 cases, making SOX 10 a new gene of WS 2. Interestingly, neurological phenotypes reminiscent of that observed in WS 4 (PCWH syndrome [peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central dysmyelinating leukodystrophy, WS, and Hirschsprung disease]) were observed in some WS 2 -affected patients with SOX 10 deletions. This study further characterizes the molecular complexity and the close relationship that links the different subtypes of WS...|$|R

40|$|Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon)</b> is {{a complex}} genetic {{disorder}} of the enteric nervous system (ENS) characterized {{by the absence of}} enteric neurons along a variable length of the intestine. While rare variants (RVs) in the coding sequence (CDS) of several genes involved in ENS development lead to disease, the association of common variants (CVs) with HSCR has only been reported for RET (the major HSCR gene) and NRG 1. Importantly, RVs in the CDS of these two genes are also associated with the disorder. To assess independent and joint effects between the different types of RET and NRG 1 variants identified in HSCR patients, we used 254 Chinese sporadic HSCR patients and 143 ethnically matched controls for whom the RET and/or NRG 1 variants genotypes (rare and common) were available. Four genetic risk factors were defined and interaction effects were modeled using conditional logistic regression analyses and pair-wise Kendall correlations. Our analysis revealed a joint effect of RET CVs with RET RVs, NRG 1 CVs or NRG 1 RVs. To assess whether the genetic interaction translated into functional interaction, mouse neural crest cells (NCCs; enteric neuron precursors) isolated from embryonic guts were treated with NRG 1 (ErbB 2 ligand) or/and GDNF (Ret ligand) and monitored during the subsequent neural differentiation process. Nrg 1 inhibited the Gdnf-induced neuronal differentiation and Gdnf negatively regulated Nrg 1 -signaling by down-regulating the expression of its receptor, ErbB 2.

40|$|Background: Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is one {{the most}} common {{congenital}} intestinal disease. It leads to <b>aganglionic</b> <b>megacolon</b> in the early childhood. Several susceptibility genes have been identified: RET protooncogene and its ligand, glial cell derived neutrophic factor (GDNF), Sox 10, Endothelin- 3 (EDN 3) and its receptor B (EDNRB). EDNRB mutations are found in 5 % of familial or sporadic HSCR. Only few EDNRB mutations found in HSCR have been explored {{and some of them}} seem to be non fonctional variants. Materials and Methods: The properties of three mutant human endothelin B receptor (hET B) (G 57 S, R 319 W and P 383 L) in isolated HSCR were analyzed. Stable recombinant cells expressing the three mutants and the wild-type (WT) were established. The hET B receptors were characterized for 125 I ET- 1 binding, ET- 1 induced signaling: calcium transient, AP- 1 transcriptional factor activation and cAMP accumulation. Results: Immunofluorescence experiments showed normal cellular distributions of the mutant G 57 S, R 319 W and WT hET B receptors. In contrast, the P 383 L hET B mutant receptor was concentrated near the nucleus and essentially no ET- 1 binding was detected. The two other mutants (G 57 S and R 319 W) bound ET- 1 normally, induced calcium transients and activated the AP- 1 pathway {{in the same way as}} wild type, but did not inhibit adenylate cyclase. The G 57 S hET B mutant even stimulated cAMP accumulation which was blocked by pertussis toxin. Conclusion: The absence of the P 383 L mutant receptor from the membrane clearly indicates that this mutation could be involved in HSCR. The G 57 S and R 319 W mutant receptors, despite their normal coupling to G �q, have a defect in the G �i signaling pathway and the G 57 S mutation couples to G �s.
