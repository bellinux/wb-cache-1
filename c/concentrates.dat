The experimental results indicate that, in the flotation system of natural pH of pulp, mixed reagent of xanthate and aerofloat, sodium hexametaphosphate has the best effect on chalcopyrite separation, and the dosage range is 1. 5 - 1. 5 kg/t, it can improve the <b>concentrate</b> recovery as well as <b>concentrate</b> grade. In the range of 0. 5 - 2. 5 kg/t, sodium silicate can improve the <b>concentrate</b> grade and <b>concentrate</b> recovery, but the amplitude is small.
