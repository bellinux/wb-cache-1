5|$|Sale is {{a diverse}} {{community}} with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations. The church buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th <b>century</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the population boom created {{by the arrival of}} the railway in 1849, although records show that the Church of St Martin in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304. Before the English Reformation, the inhabitants of Sale were predominantly Catholic, but afterwards were members of the Church of England. Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th <b>century</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Irish immigrants. Two of the three Grade II* listed buildings in the town are churches. The Church of St Martin, which was probably originally an early 14th-century timber framed structure, was rebuilt in 1714 after the church had been destroyed in a storm. The Church of St John the Divine was built in 1868, to the design of Alfred Waterhouse. There are three Grade II listed churches in Sale: the Church of St Anne; the Church of St Mary Magdalene; and the Church of St Paul.|$|E
