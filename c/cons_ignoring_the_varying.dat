40|$|In {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET), attenuation correction is typically done based on information obtained from transmission tomography. Recent studies show that time-of-flight (TOF) PET emission data allow joint estimation of activity and attenuation images. Mathematical analysis revealed that the joint estimation problem is determined up to a scale factor. In this work, we propose a maximum likelihood reconstruction algorithm that jointly estimates the activity image together with the sinogram of the attenuation factors. The algorithm is evaluated with 2 -D and 3 -D simulations as well as clinical TOF-PET measurements of a patient scan and compared to reference reconstructions. The robustness of the algorithm to possible imperfect scanner calibration is demonstrated with reconstructions of <b>the</b> patient scan <b>ignoring</b> <b>the</b> <b>varying</b> detector sensitivities. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{regulatory}} programs impose uniform {{requirements on}} all of the persons or firms within designated categories subject to the program. For example, in the context of land use, communities generally issue zoning regulations that rigidly divide land into categories such as residential and commercial, and they impose a set of restrictions {{on all of}} the land within each category. Similarly, many air and water pollution control laws require all sources within particular categories to comply with identical schedules that designate limits on discharges or emissions of specified pollutants. Because all sources face a rigid ceiling, firms have no incentive to reduce discharges below the prescribed limits. The result {{is a great deal of}} waste because policymakers <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>varying</b> potential for sources to reduce their discharges of pollution. Moreover, firms regulated by programs embodying this approach have little or no economic incentive to reduce their discharges below the permitted level...|$|R
30|$|Timing {{recovery}} as {{a process}} of sampling at the right time are critical in digital communication receivers. The problem is formulated through maximum likelihood (ML) [1]. In direct application of ML method, message symbols and timing offset are estimated jointly. However, this solution conveys the exhaustive search methods that imposes a lot of computations and it makes the solution impractical. To avoid the complexity due to the exhaustive search in ML problem, iterative solutions are introduced [2 – 4]. The general idea of iterative timing recovery scheme is to improve the timing estimation accuracy by multiple exploiting the timing information provided by a set of samples and application of this estimation to regenerate a new set of samples that iteratively approaches to the local maximum of the likelihood function. ML-based timing recovery methods usually <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> time <b>varying</b> timing offsets and proceed under the assumption of fixed synchronization parameter estimation [5 – 7]. However in practice, the timing offset may vary with time, due to the different clock frequencies in transmitter and receiver, caused by fractional error in baud rate estimation, manufacturing imperfection, and etc [8].|$|R
40|$|Research has {{produced}} a range of subsidiary classifications indicating various ways in which subsidiaries can be distinguished. There are, however, still concerns {{that many of the}} critical contingencies remain unexplored. It is, for example, argued that the existing subsidiary types are either multinational enterprise (MNE) strategy-based or process-based, rather than based on the subsidiary’s own strategy. The frameworks are: two-dimensional (Enright & Subramanian, 2007; Morschett, Schramm-Klein, & Zentes, 2015); lack theoretical basis; and, their dimensions are arbitrary (Schmid, 2004; Schmid, Dzedek, & Lehrer, 2014). They are also disconnected to the previous frameworks (Hoffman, 1994). MNE management structure is one such contingency. Subsidiary studies mostly focus on the corporate headquarters (CHQ) as the subsidiary developmental driver, but <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>varying</b> developmental influences. Namely, the structures (i. e., lateral or formal) placed on subsidiaries. Most of <b>the</b> <b>ignored</b> contingencies are contextual (Enright & Subramanian, 2007; Meyer, Mudambi, & Narula, 2011). Little is known about how various subsidiaries configure with these contexts. Putting subsidiary development to the fore, these issues are integrated and two research objectives are set. One issue concerns developing a subsidiary classification, and the other concerns subsidiary and context configuration. This thesis’s empirical context is foreign subsidiaries in New Zealand. Data from 429 subsidiaries are obtained. Cluster analysis and variance analysis are the key techniques used. Grounded in the resource-based view, resource dependence theory, and network theory, an overarching subsidiary classification framework is produced. The framework follows a contingency approach and draws on critical dimensions from the various subsidiary literature streams. From this framework a new three-part subsidiary developmental classification (entrepreneurial, constrained autonomous, constrained) is produced. By applying a configurational approach, various linkages are explored between the three subsidiary types and their developmental contexts. A number of developmental contingencies are identified; such as MNE management structures, expatriation, internationalisation motives, and internal isolation. Key findings include the lateral structure as the one under which subsidiaries develop the most, and the CHQ, the least. Individual developmental paths for the three subsidiary types are proposed. Theoretical implications are subsequently made, mainly identifying factors through which subsidiaries can develop resources and form internal resource dependencies. The novelty of the findings is discussed and subsidiary management and public policy implications are made.

40|$|In {{the vast}} {{majority}} of genetic algorithm implementations, the operator probabilities are fixed throughout a given run. However, it may be useful to adjust these probabilities during the run, according to the ability of the operators to produce children of increased fitness. Cost Based Operator Rate Adaptation (COBRA) periodically re-ranks operator probabilities according to a measure of operator performance. The effect upon genetic algorithm performance of COBRA upon both well-studied theoretical and practical problems is examined. 1 Introduction It has long been acknowledged that the choice of operator probabilities have a significant impact upon GA performance. However, finding a good choice is somewhat of a black art. The appropriate choice depends upon the other GA components, such as the population model, the problem to be solved, its representation, and the operators used. <b>The</b> above also <b>ignores</b> <b>the</b> case for <b>varying</b> operator probabilities {{during the course of a}} GA run.

40|$|California’s green {{sturgeon}} and white sturgeon support a popular sport fishery in the San Francisco Estuary and Sacramento-San Joaquin River System and a lesser fishery in the ocean. Green sturgeon and white sturgeon {{are prone to}} overfishing due to their life-histories and behavior. Their numbers are also subject to decline attributable to habitat loss and habitat degradation. White sturgeon (in particular) are subject to organized poaching and illegal commercialization of their highly-valuable eggs and flesh. Current fishing regulations for these two sturgeon species provide a year-round fishery, a daily bag and possession limit of one fish, a size limit of 46 to 72 inches total length, and area and seasonal closures. These regulations do not differentiate between different life histories and population status, <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> populationeffects of <b>varying</b> production of young sturgeon, can not manage the boom-and-bust character of the fishery, and {{make it difficult to}} deter poaching and illegal commercialization. 1 The Department of Fish and Game (Department) is proposing regulations which will facilitate existing efforts to improve California’s sturgeon populations and protect the sturgeon fishery by improved habitat, better fish passage, increased population and fishery monitoring, effective enforcement, and comprehensive coordination with the public. The proposed regulations include a size limit for white sturgeon of 46 to 60 inches total length, no retention o...|$|R
