500|$|In February 1687, the Queen, at {{the time}} irritated by the King's affair with Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, moved into new apartments in Whitehall; Whitehall had been home to a Catholic chapel since December 1686. Her apartments were {{designed}} by Christopher Wren {{at the cost of}} £13,000. Because the palace's renovation was thus far unfinished, the King received ambassadors in her rooms, much to the Queen's chagrin. Five months later, shortly after the marriage talks with Tuscany collapsed, the Queen's mother, Duchess Laura, died. Therefore, the whole English court went into mourning. Duchess Laura left Mary [...] "a considerable sum of cash" [...] and some jewellery. William III of Orange, James's son-in-law, sensed popular discontent with James's government; he used the death of Mary's mother as a guise to send his half-uncle, Count Zuylestein, to England, ostensibly to <b>condole</b> Queen Mary, but in reality as a spy.|$|E
2500|$|All {{the monks}} of the Ramakrishna Order form the {{democratic}} {{base of the}} administration. They form the counterpart to the Organization of what is Parliament to the Nation. A representative meeting of all monks is held every three years, at Belur Math, during October–November. This meeting {{has come to be}} known as 'Monks' Conference'. The Conference is for the duration of three days. A few months prior to the conference all the monks are notified about the dates and are asked to suggest subjects for discussion and to send Resolutions to be taken up for discussion. The Agenda is finalized based on the suggestions received. On the first day of the Conference, [...] The General Secretary on behalf of all elected Trustees, places the report of all the activities that had taken place in the Organisation, during the years that had gone by since they met last. The accounts are then placed before the Conference by the monk in-charge of accounts. The Conference passes the accounts and discusses the Report of activities. The Minutes of the earlier Conference too is passed. The monks also <b>condole</b> the deaths that had occurred in their ranks in the years between successive Conferences. The proposals of monks are voted upon if necessary.|$|E
