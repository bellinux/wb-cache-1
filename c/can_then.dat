5|$|Double-dipping {{involves}} {{taking a}} bite of a chip and then re-dipping it into a dip, which some people disapprove, while others are indifferent. Double-dipping transfers bacteria from a person's mouth into a dip, which <b>can</b> <b>then</b> be transferred to other consumer's mouths.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} of Africa, hives of African honeybees (A. mellifera scutellata) are being {{destroyed}} by parasitic workers of the Cape honeybee, A. m. capensis. These lay diploid eggs ("thelytoky"), escaping normal worker policing, leading to the colony's destruction; the parasites <b>can</b> <b>then</b> move to other hives.|$|E

5|$|A {{crowdsourcing}} {{project called}} Condor Watch (CW) was started on April 14, 2014, {{hosted by the}} web portal Zooniverse. Volunteers are asked to examine motion-capture images of California condors associated with release sites managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service and Ventana Wildlife Society. The tasks on the website include identifying tagged condors and marking the distance to feeding sources such as animal carcasses. Biologists <b>can</b> <b>then</b> use this data to deduce which birds {{are at risk of}} lead poisoning.|$|E
5|$|After being invaded, a queen may {{be forced}} to leave her nest. If a {{satellite}} has not been established, the queen may usurp another queen in a different nest. Thus not having to invest any valuable resources, the queen <b>can</b> <b>then</b> use these resources on reproducing a new brood.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator <b>can</b> <b>then</b> navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E

5|$|Although often inconspicuous, fungi {{occur in}} every {{environment}} on Earth and play very {{important roles in}} most ecosystems. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore {{play a critical role}} in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, they play an essential role in nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which <b>can</b> <b>then</b> re-enter anabolic metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which <b>can</b> <b>then</b> be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|Another modern {{development}} (in {{use in the}} Netherlands) is {{the creation}} of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures, restrained in position by vertical pylons. Such wetlands <b>can</b> <b>then</b> be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.|$|E

5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that <b>can</b> <b>then</b> support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys <b>can</b> <b>then</b> use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E
