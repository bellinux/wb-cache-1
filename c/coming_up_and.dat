5|$|What {{this phrase}} meant to {{the maker of}} these riddles is {{impossible}} to say. In Hávamál 160 {{it is said that}} the dwarf Thjódrørir sang before Delling's doors, which (in {{view of the fact that}} Delling is the father of Dag (Day) in Vafþrúðnismál 25) may mean that he gave warning to his people that the sun was <b>coming</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> they must return to their dark houses; the phrase would then virtually mean 'at sunrise.' As regarding dǫglings for Dellings in H, and Dǫglingar were the descendants of Dagr (according to SnE. 183).|$|E
5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E

5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E

It is a good combination of vernacular Xitsonga and Sepedi and English lyricism. It was formed in the 1990s and only became popular around 2015. There are vernacular rappers like DNP, Dj Snake and English lyrics from Ironic, Savanna and Gratitude Moruti. It all began in Limpopo, Tzaneen.

25|$|Austin {{lost his}} title to Angle at Unforgiven by {{submitting}} to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch after claiming {{his hand was}} under the ropes (which it was). Austin received that rematch on the October 8 episode of Raw and won the title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance. Austin then began feuding with Alliance member Rob Van Dam, who was {{the only member of}} the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at No Mercy later that month and won by pinning the latter. On the October 29 episode of Raw, Angle joined the Alliance and became the second most powerful wrestler in the group. Survivor Series was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> it was ultimately decided to have a winner-take-all Survivor Series tag match with the winning team becoming the surviving entity. Austin was chosen to captain team Alliance, which consisted of Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam and Booker T, against Team WWF which was captained by The Rock, who had returned the week following Austin's betrayal of the WWF at InVasion. The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and Big Show. Before Survivor Series, Austin and Rock rekindled their rivalry at the UK-only pay-per-view Rebellion and Austin successfully defended his WWF title with help from Angle.|$|E

The first part of Lessons includes simple statements such as: [...] "Ink is black, and papa's shoes are black. Paper is white, and Charles's frock is white." [...] The second part increases in difficulty: [...] "February is very cold too, but the days are longer, {{and there is a}} yellow crocus <b>coming</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> the mezereon tree is in blossom, and there are some white snow-drops peeking up their little heads." ...|$|E

It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this." ...|$|E
500|$|The main cast of The Matty Johns Show was {{initially}} {{not invited to}} the 2010 Dally M Awards night (an annual ceremony to honour the best NRL players of the year), while the cast of The Footy Show was invited.

[...] Matty Johns and his team were belatedly invited. Johns reacted to the incident by appearing at the awards night in character as Harry Hardman, and attempting to interview Footy Show regulars for his program, in spite of the fact that they were contractually forbidden from appearing on his show.|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and I was excited for [...] I love to see the creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when I was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> she was doing her Control thing, I loved it.

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Maurissa Tancharoen {{stated the}} production team was not ruling out creating crossover episodes with Agent Carter or Guardians of the Galaxy during the season, with executive producer Jed Whedon adding {{that any such}} episodes would not equal the scale seen in the [...] crossover from the first season, saying, [...] "In terms of game-changers, [...] hard to beat." [...] Bell later said [...] "is <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> we know what's going on with that {{and look forward to}} seeing it, but it's pretty cool to find ways to tie-in stuff and connect things." [...] In December 2014, ABC confirmed the series would tie-in with Avengers: Age of Ultron, with Whedon saying, [...] "You should expect something. The Avengers is the big tent that all the franchises play under. Obviously, we're included in that." [...] The episodes [...] "The Frenemy of My Enemy" [...] and [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] feature [...] "Easter eggs, plot threads and other connective tissue leading into the opening scene of Avengers: Age of Ultron" [...] while [...] "Scars" [...] explores the aftermath of the film.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E

500|$|Although his co-stars Attwater and Kenny were axed {{from the}} cast in May 2010, Norwood {{revealed}} his contract had {{been extended to}} December 2010, saying that the producers saw [...] "some future in Fatboy". In January 2011 {{it was reported that}} due to the character's popularity, producers were planning to expand Fatboy's family and {{were in the process of}} casting his father, Ashley Chubb. An EastEnders insider is reported to have said [...] "Fatboy has been a real hit with viewers and the bosses have decided that it's now time to bring in his dad so people can see what Fatboy is really all about." [...] Norwood's contract was once again renewed in late 2013 for another year, by the new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who promised [...] "juicy storylines" [...] for the character. One source from the programme said [...] "Fatboy is a popular character and appeals to all ages. He's not had a decent storyline for a while but always provides much-needed humour in Albert Square.
