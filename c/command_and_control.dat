5|$|After the {{initiation}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial campaign against North Vietnam that had begun on 5 March 1965, the Barrel Roll area of operations was divided on 3 April.

5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with <b>command</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> and loitering capabilities.

5|$|Rolling Thunder exposed many {{problems}} within the American military services committed {{to it and}} tended to exacerbate others. A key interservice issue (and one which was not solved until 1968) was the <b>command</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> arrangement in Southeast Asia. The Air Force's 2nd Air Division (replaced by the Seventh Air Force on 1 April 1966) was ostensibly responsible for aerial operations over North and South Vietnam. It was subordinate, however, to MACV and its commander, U.S. Army General William C. Westmoreland, who tended to see his problems centered in the south. The U.S. Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force, based in Thailand (which carried out {{the majority of the}} Air Force's strikes in North Vietnam), had a dual command structure. It reported to the Seventh on operational matters and to the Thirteenth Air Force (whose headquarters was in the Philippines) for logistical and administrative concerns. These <b>command</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> complexities grew even more tangled with the division of the aerial effort into four competing operational areas (those in South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and Laos (both north and south).|$|E

5|$|The 1915 mutiny was a {{watershed}} {{event in the}} way that the British viewed security in their Malayan colonies.
