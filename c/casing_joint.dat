50|$|Casing collar locator tools, or CCL's, {{are among}} the {{simplest}} and most essential in cased hole electric line. CCL's are typically used for depth correlation and can be an indicator of line overspeed when logging in heavy fluids. A CCL operates on Faraday's Law of Induction. Two magnets are separated by a coil of copper wire. As the CCL passes by a <b>casing</b> <b>joint,</b> or collar, the difference in metal thickness across the two magnets induces a current spike in the coil. This current spike is sent uphole and logged as what's called a collar kick on the cased hole log.|$|E
40|$|A {{thermal barrier}} for {{extremely}} high temperature applications {{consists of a}} carbon fiber core and one or more layers of braided carbon fibers surrounding the core. The thermal barrier is preferably a large diameter ring, having a relatively small cross-section. The thermal barrier is particularly suited for use {{as part of a}} joint structure in solid rocket motor casings to protect low temperature elements such as the primary and secondary elastomeric O-ring seals therein from high temperature gases of the rocket motor. The thermal barrier exhibits adequate porosity to allow pressure to reach the radially outward disposed O-ring seals allowing them to seat and perform the primary sealing function. The thermal barrier is disposed in a cavity or groove in the <b>casing</b> <b>joint,</b> between the hot propulsion gases interior of the rocket motor and primary and secondary O-ring seals. The characteristics of the thermal barrier may be enhanced in different applications by the inclusion of certain compounds in the <b>casing</b> <b>joint,</b> by the inclusion of RTV sealant or similar materials {{at the site of the}} thermal barrier, and/or by the incorporation of a metal core or plurality of metal braids within the carbon braid in the thermal barrier structure...|$|E
40|$|Plug and {{abandonment}} (P&A) of subsea wells {{often involves}} removal of steel casing. In {{some parts of}} the well the casing is cemented in place making the operation of retrieving the casing more complex. The conventional methods for retrieving casing are unpredictable in terms of time consumption and consequently cost. This thesis has investigated the current guidelines and regulations that apply for P&A. Further, the conventional methods for removing cemented casing have been analyzed and compared to alternative approaches that have not yet been field proven. A case study on a Cut and Pull operation performed by Statoil was assessed to identify key operational issues. The case study suggested {{that there is a need}} for new approaches for freeing cemented casing. An alternative method for removal of cemented casing has been proposed, namely the Spiral Cut Approach (SCA). Laboratory testing of small scale spiral cut specimens were performed, and it was found that the spiral cut allows the cement to debond successively along the surface of the specimen exposed to torsional loading, thus freeing the casing. FE-analysis were performed to investigate the criticality of the spiral cut pitch and the required torque for a fullscale casing. The method is based on debonding one joint of casing from the cement before moving on to the next <b>casing</b> <b>joint.</b> After the spiral cut has been made between the casing couplings, each <b>casing</b> <b>joint</b> is exposed to sufficient torque to overcome the cement bond between each <b>casing</b> <b>joint</b> (approximately 12 m). Finally, a drillstring deployed pulling tool is connected to the upper section of the casing string and the casing is retrieved in one go. Operational steps and tools necessary to perform the SCA have been assessed. The laboratory testing, FE-analysis and operational assessment indicated that a significant higher number of casing joints can be pulled in one go using the SCA. A time comparison based on the case study and an assessment of the SCA, indicated that a total time saving of 2 days can be made by using the SCA to retrieve 100 m of cemented casing. However, more work will have to be carried out for more detailed verification of the SCA. This includes development of a effective tool for spiral cutting of casing, a combined tool for applying torque and pull for retrieval of cemented casing and lastly an assessment on the effects of using extended diameter couplings. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{study on}} tension {{behavior}} of <b>casing</b> and dowel <b>joint</b> of square steel tube {{was carried out}} by using finite element analysis software ANSYS/LS-DYNA with consideration of geometric nonlinearity, material nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity. On this basis, the effects of inside tube wall thickness, main tube wall thickness, and inserting depth on failure mode, ultimate tensile load and deformation of <b>casing</b> and dowel <b>joint</b> of square steel tube was discussed. The results show that there are three types of failure modes, i. e., bolt failure, inside tube failure and main tube failure, when the joints are subjected to axial tension force. Compare to the joint with the same wall thickness of inside tube and main tube, the reduction of wall thickness of inside tube or main tube will weaken greatly the ultimate tensile load of the joint. The ultimate tensile load of <b>casing</b> and dowel <b>joints</b> is proportional to bolt shear strength, tube wall thickness, inserting depth, and tube edge length. The fruits are useful to the design and application of <b>casing</b> and dowel <b>joints</b> of square steel tube...|$|R

30|$|For the {{straight}} {{part of the}} well, the ground compaction would cause large, plastic, and compressive strain in the casing connections in the pay zone. Once the reservoir compacts, the displacement {{at the top of}} the reservoir can cause significant tensile strain along the casing above the pay zone. If the connection between casings is not as strong as the <b>casing</b> body, <b>joint</b> failure can occur in compression in the pay zone. In a reservoir, compressive strain will quickly yield the <b>casing</b> and <b>joints,</b> while the tensile strain in the overburden generally will stay elastic, but can exceed the joint strength if the connection is weak in tension. A huge axial load from casing body can also cause the joint failure. So, the joints need to be as good as the casing body in both tension and compression within the pay zone and for a few hundred feet above the pay zone. It is always good to meet this criterion during the casing design to avoid unnecessary risks for the well.|$|R
40|$|The Strategic Petroleum Reserve site at West Hackberry, Louisiana has {{historically}} experienced casing leaks. Numerous West Hackberry oil storage caverns have wells exhibiting {{communication between the}} interior 10 3 / 4 x 20 -inch (oil) annulus and the ''outer cemented'' 20 x 26 -inch annulus. Well 108 in Cavern 108 exhibits this behavior. It is thought that one, if not the primary, cause of this communication is casing thread leaks at the 20 -inch casing joints combined with microannuli along the cement casing interfaces and other cracks/flaws in the cemented 20 x 26 -inch annulus. An operation consisting {{of a series of}} nitrogen leak tests, similar to cavern integrity tests, was performed on Cavern 108 in an effort to determine the leak horizons and to see if these leak horizons coincided with those of casing joints. Certain leaky, threaded casing joints were identified between 400 and 1500 feet. A new leak detection procedure was developed {{as a result of this}} test, and this methodology for identifying and interpreting such <b>casing</b> <b>joint</b> leaks is presented in this report. Analysis of the test data showed that individual joint leaks could be successfully identified, but not without some degree of ambiguity. This ambiguity is attributed to changes in the fluid content of the leak path (nitrogen forcing out oil) and possibly to very plausible changes in characteristics of the flow path during the test. These changes dominated the test response and made the identification of individual leak horizons difficult. One consequence of concern from the testing was a progressive increase in the leak rate measured during testing due to nitrogen cleaning small amounts of oil out of the leak paths and very likely due to the changes of the leak path during the flow test. Therefore, careful consideration must be given before attempting similar tests. Although such leaks have caused no known environmental or economic problems to date, the leaks may be significant because of the potential for future problems. To mitigate future problems, some repair scenarios are discussed including injection of sealants...|$|E
40|$|Experimental modal data is {{extensively}} used {{to validate}} finite element models. These models are typically linear, even though real structures often exhibit amplitude dependent non-linear behaviour which is disregarded in the finite element models. The reason for non-linear behaviour can frequently {{be found at}} joints between otherwise linear substructures of overall assembled structures. Hence, finite element models can only accurately predict the dynamic behaviour of the underlying linear system if joint non-linearities are disregarded. The accuracy of response predictions for large excitation force levels can be inaccurate. This report is concerned with improving the prediction capabilities of finite element models by taking into account local non-linear stiffness and damping effects at the joints between substructures of overall assembled structures. This {{can be achieved by}} applying a computational model updating approach which minimizes the differences between measured non-linear frequency response functions and those simulated with a non-linear finite element model according to the Harmonic Balance method. In {{the first part of this}} report, a modelling approach for bolted flange joints is proposed, which aims at a more realistic modelling of the load path. In the second part of this report, different methods for non-linear frequency response analysis are described, which are based on the Harmonic Balance method. The theory of a non-linear computational model updating approach is presented in the third part of the report. This non-linear model updating approach uses the differences between experimental and analytical non-linear frequency response functions to improve the initial parameters of non-linear spring and damper elements introduced at the joints of the finite element model. Applications to analytical systems are presented, together with the application to an aero-engine subassembly with the objective to identify non-linear stiffness- and damping parameters of a bolted flange <b>casing</b> <b>joint</b> from measured non-linear frequency response functions. This report is supplemented by a literature review, which gives an extensive overview about computational model updating methods, non-linear parameter identification, non-linear response analysis, and model reduction techniques. Furthermore, additional chapters describe different approaches for the generation of damping matrices and the application of order reduction techniques to finite element models with concentrated non-linearities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Increasing {{population}} growth {{and the impact of}} global climate change continue to place heavy demands on water quantity and quality. As such, there is growing concern about the availability of drinking water from clean, reliable sources. This concern is heightened due to the occurrence of karst topography and unconfined sand aquifers in the State of Tennessee. In such environments, the structural stability of groundwater sources, such as water wells, can be at greater risk of failing and allowing contaminants to infiltrate the water. These contaminants can be from either rural or urban areas, including agro and petrochemicals usage. Water wells (n= 18) were selected at random from three counties in Middle Tennessee and observed with a down well camera, an emerging technology in water well design and construction. The down well camera was used to check for structural stability or emergent leaks and cracks in the well casing. Our results showed no sign of leaks at the <b>casings</b> or <b>casing</b> <b>joints.</b> However, bio-organisms were sighted in some wells. There was also an abundance of particulate matter as evident in the video, suggesting a biologically active ground water. Other chemotropic matter dissolved from soil minerals was also observed.

The law of load-carrying capability and stiffness of joint are separately gained by changing the ratio of length and diameter (R/L) and {{the ratio of the}} casing length and the main tube length (l/L). The influence of the casing thickness on the load-carrying capability and stiffness are also discussed. The results indicated that the load-carrying capability and stiffness of the joints both increase with the ratio(R/L) increment and the ratio of the casing length and main tube length (l/L). When the main tube thickness is equal to casing thickness, the load-carrying capacity of joints achieves the most...|$|R

40|$|The {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of individual components of aircraft engine casings provides high accuracy and a good agreement with the measured response data. However, when these components are assembled, the accuracy of such predictions can significantly deteriorate since models describing stiffness and friction properties of joints are linearized. A full nonlinear analysis of the casing flanges is required to fully include {{the influence of the}} bolted joints, model the flexibility in the contact interface, and consider the nonlinear behavior of the contact due to partial slip and separation. In this paper different nonlinear models of casings are investigated with an available nonlinear analysis tool: A parametric study of the contact interface meshes is conducted to identify a satisfying analysis approach. The dynamic flange behavior is analyzed in detail, including effects of the bolt and normal load distribution. A comparison of the introduced nonlinear modeling with more traditional rigid or linear-elastic flange joint models is carried out to evaluate the effect of the nonlinear approach. The study demonstrates the nonlinear nature of a <b>casing</b> flange <b>joint</b> and highlights the need to include them in the analysis. The detailed modeling of the contact interaction of joints gives an insight in the nonlinear contact behavior of flanges of aircraft engine casings, and the predictive capabilities for the nonlinear analysis of gas turbine engine...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{application}} of optical televiewing (OPTV) to the uppermost 630 m of the North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) deep ice borehole, Greenland. The resulting log reveals numerous natural and drilling-related properties, including {{the integrity of the}} borehole <b>casing</b> and its <b>joints,</b> the presence of drill-tooth scoring on the ice wall of the borehole and the presence of regularly repeated layering, interpreted to be annual, to a depth approaching 200 m. A second OPTV log was acquired from a nearby shallow borehole. With the exception of the uppermost 10 m, this log shows a gradual decrease in luminosity with depth, interpreted as a decrease in light scattering with firnification. This shallow log also clearly images annual layers, allowing the construction of an age?depth scale. Comparing this with an independent core-based scale reveals that the OPTV record yields an age of 1724 at the deepest common point of both scales (80 m), 13 years older than the core-based record at 1737. However, all of this deviation accrues in the uppermost 30 m of the OPTV record where highly reflective snow saturates the luminosity of the borehole image, an artefact that can be reduced by further adaptation of the OPTV system.

The reaction control system is employed in the missile to provide roll control to the second stage after separation of the first stage. The thruster is subjected to temperature and pressure loads during its operation. It is essential for a flight vehicle to have low weight and high velocity to overcome the gravity. In order to develop compact size thruster, it is required to carry out structural analysis for SS 321 material. The present report deals with analysis of Rocket Thruster <b>casing</b> and flange <b>joint.</b> The Rocket Thruster casing is designed as per ASME pressure vessel code and NASA SP 125 design report. The proposed model is a modification from the conventional joint between L-dome and injector plate. Thermo-structural analysis is performed to evaluate the new design which eliminates use of welded joint. Analysis is carried out to estimate stresses especially in the modified region to ensure less stresses are developed compared to the original design. Analysis {{has been carried out}} considering the external injector pressure for shell and then the temperature loads are applied on the thruster to estimate the deformations and stresses. The Thruster is then subjected to a thermo-structural load and then von Mises stresses are estimated...|$|R
