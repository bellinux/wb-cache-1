5|$|Raised bogs {{are most}} common in the Shannon basin. They formed when {{depressions}} left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer {{at the bottom of}} the water. This eventually <b>choked</b> the lakes and raised above the surface, forming raised bogs.|$|E
5|$|The new cent {{was issued}} in {{exchange}} for the worn Spanish colonial silver coin that had circulated in the U.S. until then, as well as for its larger predecessor. So many cents were issued that they <b>choked</b> commercial channels, especially as they were not legal tender and no one had to take them. The eagle design did not strike well, and was replaced in 1859 by Longacre's Indian Head cent.|$|E
50|$|The barrels come {{threaded}} with a Tru-Choke thread {{pattern and}} two flush-mount spreader <b>choke</b> tubes. There are two optional <b>chokes</b> from the manufacturer, the doorbuster tactical <b>choke</b> and stiletto <b>choke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|D'arce <b>choke</b> [...] - [...] the D'Arce <b>choke,</b> {{also known}} as the Brabo <b>choke,</b> is similar to the {{anaconda}} <b>choke,</b> the main divergence being the <b>choking</b> arm is threaded under the near arm, in front of the opponent's neck, and on top of the far arm.|$|R
50|$|The MP-153 is {{manufactured}} with fixed <b>choke</b> {{available as}} Cylinder, Modified or Full variants, or with screw in <b>chokes</b> with Cylinder, Improved Cylinder, Modified, Improved Modified, Full and Extra Full variants available. Normally there are 3 or 4 <b>chokes</b> included with multi <b>choke</b> variants of the shotgun and a spanner that duplicates as a <b>choke</b> extractor and gas screw adjustor. Screw in <b>chokes</b> come as lead or steel proofed versions.|$|R
5|$|The next match, between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, was a nightstick on a pole match. A nightstick was {{suspended}} above {{the ring and}} {{could be used as}} a weapon once it was retrieved. Nailz began the match by attempting to get the nightstick, but Boss Man stopped him. Nailz <b>choked</b> Boss Man before making another unsuccessful attempt to climb the pole and obtain the nightstick. Boss Man punched Nailz and then tried to climb the pole. Nailz stopped him, performed a back body drop, and <b>choked</b> Boss Man again. Boss Man regained control but missed a splash, which gave Nailz another chance to retrieve the nightstick. Both men clotheslined each other, but Boss Man recovered first and got the nightstick. He hit Nailz with it, but Nailz took it and used it against Boss Man. Boss Man performed the Boss Man slam, his finishing move, before pinning Nailz to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys is {{beginning}} to gain confidence in her new role as Drogo's wife and gains {{the respect of the}} exiled knight Ser Jorah Mormont, but her relationship with her brother Viserys becomes strained when he angrily assaults her under the assumption that she is giving him commands. As punishment, Viserys is <b>choked</b> and nearly killed by Daenerys's bloodrider Rakharo and is forced to walk back to camp after Daenerys intervenes to spare his life.|$|E
5|$|Despite Langdale's {{attempt to}} counter-charge, the Royalists were soon outflanked. With the Parliamentarian musketeers firing {{into the rear}} of Langdale's force, the Royalists broke, some {{escaping}} via Holt Bridge and others running towards Chester. On Hoole Heath these retreating soldiers met with part of Gerard's force and made an initially successful counter-attack before being forced back to the walls of Chester. There the retreating cavalry <b>choked</b> up the streets, allowing the Parliamentarian musketeers to fire into the confused mass of horsemen and leading to a rout.|$|E
50|$|A <b>choke</b> {{connection}} is formed by mating one <b>choke</b> flange and one cover (or gasket/cover) flange. The central {{region of the}} <b>choke</b> flange face is very slightly recessed {{so that it does}} not touch the face of the cover flange, but is separated from it by a narrow gap. The recessed region is bounded by a deep <b>choke</b> trench (or ditch or groove) cut into the face of the flange. <b>Choke</b> flanges are only used with rectangular waveguide, and are invariably pressurizable, having a gasket groove encircling the <b>choke</b> ditch. The presence of these two concentric circular grooves makes <b>choke</b> flanges easily recognizable. The left-hand flange in figure 2 is a <b>choke</b> flange.|$|R
5000|$|The D'Arce <b>choke,</b> or Brabo <b>choke,</b> {{is similar}} to the Anaconda <b>choke.</b> The {{difference}} is that the <b>choking</b> arm is threaded under the near arm, in front of the opponent's neck, and on top of the far arm. The <b>choke</b> gets its name from Joe D'Arce, a third-degree Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt under Renzo Gracie. Though not the inventor of the <b>choke,</b> D'Arce performed this <b>choke</b> often and with great success in many Jiu-Jitsu and submission grappling tournaments. During a sparring session with Jason Miller, the <b>choke</b> surprised Miller, who gave it the name and pronunciation [...] "Darce" [...] rather than the proper [...] "D-Arsee," [...] when D'Arce did not have a title for the technique.|$|R

5|$|From {{within the}} pocket, German {{formations}} seeking an escape route were filtering through {{gaps in the}} Allied lines between Trun and Chambois, heading towards the ridge from the west. The Poles could see the road from Chambois <b>choked</b> with troops and vehicles attempting to pass along the Dives valley. A number of columns moving down from the northeast that included tanks and self-propelled artillery were subjected to an hour-long bombardment from the 1st Armoured Regiment's 3rd Squadron, breaking them up and scattering their infantry.|$|E
5|$|Joe, Shelley, Styles, and Williams {{advanced}} to the semifinals. The first match {{took place on the}} August5 episode of Impact! between Joe and Shelley. Joe slammed Shelley back-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then <b>choked</b> him unconscious with the Coquina Clutch at 9 minutes and 4 seconds to win and advance to the finals. In the second semifinal match on August10, Styles defeated Williams with a small package pin at 9 minutes and 19 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Kaminsky {{stands up}} Incanto while he waits at a restaurant. He leaves, murdering a {{slightly}} overweight prostitute who injures {{him in a}} struggle. Incanto is forced to flee before he can fully dissolve the body. At the autopsy, Scully finds that the body's airways are <b>choked</b> with the same substance that dissolved Lauren. The State Genetic Lab report reveals that the skin under the victim's nails contains no oils or fatty acids, convincing Mulder that the killer is sucking body fat from his victims.|$|E
5000|$|Chokeholds can {{be divided}} into two primary categories: [...] "blood chokes" [...] and [...] "air chokes". A blood <b>choke</b> {{disrupts}} blood circulation to the brain, while an air <b>choke</b> disrupts breathing. Blood <b>chokes</b> can be applied to efficiently cause loss of consciousness, i.e. a choke-out, while air <b>chokes</b> do not usually cause loss of consciousness without prolonged application (though air <b>chokes</b> are used to cause discomfort).|$|R

5000|$|In firearms, a <b>choke</b> is a tapered {{constriction}} of {{a shotgun}} barrel's bore at the muzzle end. <b>Chokes</b> {{are almost always}} used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Its purpose is to shape {{the spread of the}} shot in order to gain better range and accuracy. [...] <b>Chokes</b> are implemented as either screw-in <b>chokes,</b> selected for particular applications, or as fixed, permanent <b>chokes,</b> integral to the shotgun barrel.|$|R
5|$|On 2 August 1917, while {{performing}} trials, Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup, {{believed to have}} been N6453, successfully on board Furious, becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship. On 7 August, he made one more successful landing in the same manner, but on his third attempt, in Pup N6452, the engine <b>choked</b> and the aircraft crashed off the starboard bow, killing him. The deck arrangement was unsatisfactory because aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land.|$|E
5|$|The cap {{was pulled}} down, {{and while he}} was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not instantaneous. Louis Riel's pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the rope around his neck slowly strangled and <b>choked</b> him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows' enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was {{accordingly}} done that night.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the event was a Hell in a Cell bout between Batista and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Triple H <b>choked</b> Batista with a chain and {{hit him in the}} back with a steel chair wrapped with barbed wire. Batista regained the {{momentum}} by grabbing Triple H's sledgehammer and hitting him with it. Batista performed a spinebuster onto the steel steps on Triple H, which was followed with a Batista Bomb for the win to retain the title. After the Hell in a Cell match, Triple H was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E
40|$|<b>CHOKe,</b> xCHOKe and RECHOKe are {{preferential}} dropping {{schemes that}} have been proposed for detection, control and punishment of malicious flows at routers in IP networks. They use <b>CHOKe</b> hits, <b>CHOKe</b> misses and/or CHOKe-RED drops to carry out these tasks. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of malicious flow detection by using these hits, misses and drops (using ns- 2). We also point out the unreliability of <b>CHOKe</b> hits and misses, when compared to CHOKe-RED drops, as they affect TCP-friendly flows adversely. By doing so, we present two variations of <b>CHOKe</b> called Half 1 and Half 2 to improve <b>CHOKe</b> and compare them with <b>CHOKe.</b> Half 1 and Half 2 outperform <b>CHOKe</b> when the combined rates of malicious flows are less or greater than the link capacity respectively...|$|R
5000|$|An air <b>choke</b> or {{tracheal}} <b>choke</b> specifically {{refers to}} a [...] "true" [...] <b>choke</b> that compresses the upper airway (trachea, larynx or laryngopharynx), hence interfering with breathing, and leading to asphyxia. Although less effective at inducing unconsciousness than its vascular counterpart, the air <b>choke</b> causes excruciating pain and air hunger, and in combat sports a fighter will usually submit to such a submission hold. Air <b>chokes</b> {{have been associated with}} fractures of the larynx or hyoid bone, and are considered less safe than blood <b>chokes</b> to practice. The arm bar <b>choke</b> is an air <b>choke</b> done by placing the forearm across the front of the neck from behind. The free hand grabs the wrist and pulls back the forearm, hence driving the forearm (usually the radius bone) into the front of the neck.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Choking</b> is a preventable, but {{common cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the pediatric population, with children younger than 3 years at greatest risk. A number of factors place children at higher risk for <b>choking,</b> including narrower airways, immature dentition, underdeveloped chewing and swallowing ability, and high levels of activity and distractibility. Candy, meat, and bone are responsible {{for more than half of}} nonfatal food-related <b>choking,</b> while the hot dog is the most common food associated with <b>choking</b> fatalities. Coins, button batteries, small toys, and toy parts are the leading causes of nonfatal <b>choking</b> not due to food, while latex balloons are the leading cause of nonfood-related <b>choking</b> fatalities. Pediatric <b>choking</b> is an important public health concern that needs to be addressed during well-child visits and through increased public education. Parents and child caregivers should receive training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and <b>choking</b> rescue maneuvers. Increased efforts are also needed in the areas of public policy, <b>choking</b> surveillance, and food design and labeling...|$|R
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Gene Snitsky and Kane (with Lita). The match was a Weapons of Choice match, {{for which a}} steel chain gained 41% of the vote. The match began with Kane using a chain on Snitsky. Snitsky grabbed the chain and <b>choked</b> Kane with it. The match ended when Snitsky came off the second rope onto a steel chair that was wrapped around Kane's neck and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Mickie James and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women's Championship. The match had {{escalated}} outside the ring. When Stratus delivered punches to Mickie, {{who was on}} the second turnbuckle, Mickie threw her over the top rope, causing Stratus to land on her right arm. Afterwards, Mickie <b>choked</b> Stratus with a wristband she was wearing that fell off during the match, therefore giving the win to Stratus by disqualification, but per WWE regulations, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission therefore Mickie retained the Championship.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was closely}} {{associated}} with the court of Charles I, Hare's fortunes went into decline during the English Civil War. His castle at Longford and his house in Totteridge were seized by Parliamentary forces, and returned upon the Restoration in a severe state of disrepair. Records of Tottenham from the period are now lost, and the ownership and condition of the Lordship House during the Commonwealth of England are unknown. Hugh Hare died at his home in Totteridge in 1667, having <b>choked</b> to death on a bone eating turkey while laughing and drinking, and was succeeded by his son Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine.|$|E
50|$|For older {{shotguns}} {{having only}} one fixed <b>choke,</b> intended primarily for equally-likely use against rabbits, squirrels, quail, doves, and pheasant, an often-chosen <b>choke</b> is the improved cylinder, in a 28 in barrel, making the shotgun {{suitable for use}} as a general all-round hunting shotgun, without having excess weight. Shotguns having fixed <b>chokes</b> intended for geese, in contrast, are often found with full <b>choke</b> barrels, in longer lengths, and are much heavier, being intended for fixed use within a blind against distant targets. Defensive shotguns with fixed <b>chokes</b> generally have a cylinder bore <b>choke.</b> Likewise, shotguns intended primarily for use with slugs invariably also are found with a <b>choke</b> that is a cylinder bore.|$|R

5|$|During {{this period}} Argentina's economy {{continued}} to grow, on average, but {{more slowly than}} {{the world as a}} whole or than its neighbours, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to ridiculous specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), <b>choked</b> economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, redistribution of income from the agrarian to the industrial sector, and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina's GDP per capita accounted just nearly half of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} holding in captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only polar bear. The zoo had initially planned to retire their polar bear exhibit after Mercedes died. When zoo officials {{announced plans to}} create a new attraction, citing their responsibility to ensure the survival of the species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who <b>choked</b> on a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans {{to create a new}} exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, moving her to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a young male polar bear named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic, the Allies waged a long {{battle with}} German {{submarines}} which was termed the Battle of the Atlantic. Navy aircraft flew from bases in Greenland and Iceland to hunt submarines, {{and hundreds of}} escort carriers and destroyer escorts were built which were specifically designed to protect merchant convoys. In the Pacific, in an ironic twist, the U.S. submarines fought against Japanese shipping in {{a mirror image of}} the Atlantic, with U.S. submarines hunting Japanese merchant ships. At {{the end of the war}} the U.S. had 260 submarines in commission. It had lost 52 submarines during the war, 36 in actions in the Pacific. Submarines effectively destroyed the Japanese merchant fleet by January 1945 and <b>choked</b> off Japan's oil supply.|$|E
50|$|Arm {{triangle}} <b>choke,</b> side <b>choke,</b> or {{head and}} arm <b>choke</b> are generic terms describing blood chokeholds {{in which the}} opponent is strangled in between {{his or her own}} shoulder and the practitioner's arm.
