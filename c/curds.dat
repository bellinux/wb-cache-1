Milk used for experiments was heat-treated at 87 ºC/ 10 min, during which the chemical complex between casein and whey proteins (milk protein co aggregates) was formed. It is shown that the applied drying temperatures of 42 ºC (<b>curd</b> A) and 45 ºC (<b>curd</b> B) do not have significant influence on the <b>curd</b> composition. The <b>curd</b> A and B gained without washing of the <b>curd</b> had 50. 91 % and 50. 60 % of moisture, respectively. If the <b>curd</b> washing process is applied after removing 1 / 3 of whey, the resulting <b>curd</b> has higher moisture content, 52. 27 % and 52. 63 %, respectively for the <b>curd</b> A and B. The highest moisture content in the <b>curd</b> is noted in the <b>curd</b> gained when 1 / 2 of whey is replaced by water during washing treatment.

5|$|Zebu, {{a form of}} humped cattle, were {{introduced}} to the island around 1000CE by settlers from east Africa, who also brought sorghum, goats, possibly Bambara groundnut, and other food sources. Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture, they were eaten only rarely, typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals. Fresh zebu milk and <b>curds</b> instead constituted {{a major part of the}} pastoralists' diet. Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west, but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced, a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands. Merina oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King Ralambo (ruled 1575–1612), who is credited with the discovery, although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo's time. It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period, which corresponds with the emergence of complex, structured polities in the highlands.|$|E

40|$|Factors {{regulating}} <b>curd</b> initiation in {{the summer}} cauliflower were examined with special attention given to responses to change in environment. Low temperature treatments of four weeks at 5 °C accelerated <b>curd</b> initiation, {{reducing the number of}} leaves initiated before the <b>curd.</b> A reduction in vegetative growth was associated with earlier <b>curd</b> initiation. The extent of the low temperature effect was dependent on genotype, temperature, treatment duration and the plant's stage of development when low temperature treatments commenced. A distinct juvenile phase was observed when plants were incompetent to perceive chilling as a vernalization stimulus. Phase transition from the juvenile to the mature, competent form was associated with the initiation of a specific number of leaves. These were 14 and 18 leaves for cvs Perfection and White Fox respectively, leaf number being higher in the later season cultivar. The duration of phase change itself was short, lasting approximately two plastochrons. Increase in leaf initiation rate was associated with phase transition. Rate of leaf initiation increased with increasing temperature. Duration of the juvenile phase, measured chronologically, was therefore shorter at higher temperatures. Shoot dry weight was linearly related to leaf number in plants examined here; this characteristic would also be a stable marker for phase transition. Chilling imbibed seed proved ineffective in accelerating <b>curd</b> initiation. Reduction in total irradiance receipt delayed <b>curd</b> initiation in plants grown under warm conditions. Associated with this delay were reductions in rate of leaf initiation and stem dry weight increment. Photoperiods of 16 h following sub-optimal vernalization allowed faster <b>curd</b> initiation than photoperiods of 8 hand 24 h. A minimum stem dry weight at <b>curd</b> visibility was achieved under this regime. Reciprocal of leaf number subtending the <b>curd,</b> denoting the rate of progress towards <b>curd</b> initiation, was shown to be linearly related to temperature under controlled environment conditions. <b>Curd</b> initiation rate in. cv Perfection increased after treatment in the temperature range - 1. 2 SoC to 5. 5 °C and decreased after treatment over the range 5. 5 °C to 23. 5 °C. Similarly, in cv White Fox, <b>curd</b> initiation rate increased following treatments at temperatures of - 3. 0 °C to 8. 6 °C and declined over the range 8. 6 °C to 31. 5 °C. Linear regressions also adequately described the relationship of rate of <b>curd</b> appearance on temperature. Rate of <b>curd</b> appearance in cv Perfection increased following treatment at temperatures of - 4. 5 °C to 12 °C and declined over the range 12 °C to 29. 5 °C. In cv White Fox rate of <b>curd</b> appearance was shown to increase following treatment over the range - 3. 5 °C to 15. 8 °C and decline from 15. 8 °C to 28. 3 °C. The different cardinal temperatures from those established for <b>curd</b> initiation were probably the result of examining not one process but two: <b>curd</b> initiation and early <b>curd</b> growth. Their two distinct optimum temperatures would account for the observed parabolic trend. The relationship between leaf number subtending the <b>curd</b> and thermal time established under controlled environment conditions was extrapolated to predict <b>curd</b> initiation time in the field. Thermal times of vernalization for plants grown under field conditions showed close agreement with controlled environment figures at early transplantings, but not for late transplantings. This drift was probably due to irradiance receipt whereby increasing irradiance would partially SUbstitute for low temperature in accelerating <b>curd</b> initiation. <b>Curd</b> growth and morphology were clearly influenced by post-chilling temperature conditions. Linear functions adequately described regression of Loge <b>curd</b> diameter or <b>curd</b> weight on thermal time. Thermal requirement for a specified <b>curd</b> diameter could therefore be calculated. Increasing supply of mineral nitrogen accelerated <b>curd</b> initiation in unchilled plants. <b>Curd</b> initiation in chilled plants, however, was not affected by nitrogen applications. Increasing nitrogen increased both leaf area and dry weight. A minimum leaf dry weight below which <b>curd</b> initiation could not occur was indicated. Both larger module size for plant growth and increased nitrogen levels increased the number of leaves initiated during propagation. Increased nitrogen during propagation accelerated <b>curd</b> initiation in the field. Severe water stress also accelerated <b>curd</b> initiation and reduced leaf growth. Application of GA 4 + 7 to unchilled plants accelerated <b>curd</b> initiation more. than applications of GAS. GA 4 + 7 generally increased stem dry weight and decreased leaf dry weight. The hypothesis was proposed that GA 4 + 7 accelerated <b>curd</b> initiation by redirecting assimilates to apical regions of the stem. <b>Curd</b> initiation under field conditions was also accelerated by GA 4 + 7...|$|R
