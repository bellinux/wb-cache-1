And solar radiation intensity is lower {{in comparison with the}} average European values. The average solar radiation intensity reaches 1100 kWh/m 2 per year in Baltic region. Therefore, there is a particular need to optimize the solar thermal system in the Baltic region. Solar collector’s operation methods investigated on the IPE solar energy polygon according different parameters. The most common types of solar collector’s operation were investigated and compared: by the time, by the heat carrier temperature differences of input and output, by the solar radiation intensity and operation control methods in various combinations. Theoretical and practical advantages and disadvantages of using each control methods were analyzed. Solar collector’s operation system could be regulated in accordance with the solar radiation intensity, by the boiler lower temperatures and by the outdoor air temperature to determine precisely the solar collector efficiency of the parameter changes. This may help to avoid the previous operation systems testing regime deficiencies. The precision of solar collectors operation depends on the type of operation systems: heat losses and the collector efficiency calculation accuracy, the sensor is accuracy, the time between the regulation regimes, and the range of heat carrier pumps action operation sensors.

40|$|Nanostructured {{synthetic}} carbon allotropes {{are considered}} good candidates for applications in electronics and energy storage devices {{due to the}} unique combination of their physical and chemical properties. In this thesis, synthesis of nanostructured carbon materials including pillared CNT and graphene nanostructures (PGN), cone-shape CNT clusters (CCC), and graphene and CNT (GM) hybrid foam have been developed. Potential applications in electrochemical energy storage devices including supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been demonstrated. 	The seamlessly connected graphene and CNT pillars in PGN provide a relatively strong active material-current <b>collector</b> <b>connection</b> integrity, which facilitates conduction of electrons in the system. LIB based PGN electrode shows a reversible capacity of 900 mAh g- 1. Moreover, with a subsequent inductively coupled plasma (ICP) treatment on PGN, an CCC structure is achieved. The cone-shape nature can be advantageous due to a decrease in homogeneity and in surface area of the array which provides interpenetrating channels and minimizes the effects of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation during lithiation and delithiation. LIBs based on Si-CCC architecture demonstrates high reversible capacity of 1954 mAh g- 1. 	Furthermore, a three-dimensional (3 D) GM foam is grown on industrial grade metal foam foils and applied as electrodes for SCs. SC based on GM foam demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 286 F g- 1 which leads to an energy density of 39. 72 Wh kg- 1 and a superior power density of up to 154. 67 kW kg- 1. Improved functionality of carbon materials via a non-invasive, high-throughput, and inexpensive UV generated ozone (UV-ozone) treatment has been developed and systematically studied. This process allows precise and continous tuning of the transition of GM foam from ultrahydrophobic to hydrophilicwithin 60 sec. Hydrothermally synthesized &# 945;-MnO 2 nanowires are integrated onto the GM foam by a simple bath deposition which yields a monographical graphene foam conformally covered with intertwined, densely packed CNT/MnO 2 nanowire nanocomposite network. SC based on GMM show an extended operational voltage window of 1. 6 V in aqueous electrolyte. A high specific capacitance (1108. 79 F g- 1) is also achieved. The SC based 3 D chrysanthemum-like carbon nanofiber (CNF) foam architecture demonstrates a high areal capacitance of 1. 37 F/cm 2 (gravimetric specific capacitance: 23. 83 Fg- 1), which leads to superior values for per-area energy density (0. 19 Wh cm- 2) and power density (141. 77 W cm- 2) ...|$|E

Except the manual operation system the worst solar collector’s operation system is the operation system by time. Usually equipments of the operation system are primitive and those could not used for individual program for each day, so one program is used for all days of the solar collector’s operation time. Thereby the fact that the weekly average value of solar radiation is changes, and changes the sun sunshine hours, then it is not possible fully use the obtaining solar energy in sunny days and fully use the solar collectors operation time of spring and autumn periods, in this time the heat storage tank will be more cooled than heated. The solar collector operation system by the flow and return temperature is one type of solar collectors for operational system. Through this system can provide instantaneous accession and if it is necessary can regulate solar collector operation system; by this operation the system can get instantaneous maximum efficiency. It is necessary to find the optimal speed of heat carrier flows speed.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the great measures of progress and welfare of society. The concept of "energy crisis" occurs when energy sources from which people supply are exhausted. An economic model like the actual, whose operation depends on continued growth, also requires a growing demand for energy. As sources of fossil and nuclear energy are finite, it is inevitable that at some point the application cannot be supplied and the whole system collapses, unless new methods of energy are discovered and developed: these would be alternative or renewable energies. For all these reasons, large companies and major institutions are devoting efforts in re-search and development the so-called renewable energy which are naturally replenished. Although some of these energies are still under development, others can be found today in fields such as transport fuels, power generation, heating systems [...] . One of these energies is the solar energy. Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies. One of the most common uses of solar energy is the solar thermal energy a technology for harnessing solar energy for thermal energy (heat) using solar thermal collectors. Along this document, the use of solar thermal energy will be studied and analyzed in a specific case; a heating water system in an apartment building in Madrid (Spain).

The whole system was named as compression/absorption heat transformer (CAHT). The VCHP {{was used to}} recover rejected heat at the AHT condenser which was transferred back to the AHT evaporator at a higher temperature. The AHT unit took solar heat from a set of flat-plate solar <b>collectors</b> in parallel <b>connection.</b> R- 134 a and R- 123 were refrigerants in the VCHP cycle. From the simulation, the total cycle coefficient (COP) of the solar-CAHT was 0. 71 compared with 0. 49 of the normal solar-AHT. From the experiment, the total cycle COPs of the solar-CAHT and the solar-AHT were 0. 62 and 0. 39, respectively. The experimental results were {{lower than those of}} the simulated models due to the oversize of the experimental compressor. The annual expense of the solar-CAHT was found to be 5113 USD which was lower than 5418 USD of the solar-AHT.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{behaviour}} of diaphragms in multi-storey timber buildings by providing methods for {{the estimation of}} the diaphragm force demand, developing an Equivalent Truss Method {{for the analysis of}} timber diaphragms, and experimentally investigating the effects of displacement incompatibilities between the diaphragm and the lateral load resisting system and developing methods for their mitigation. The need to better understand the behaviour of diaphragms in timber buildings was highlighted by the recent 2010 - 2011 Canterbury Earthquake series, where a number of diaphragms in traditional concrete buildings performed poorly, compromising the lateral load resistance of the structure. Although shortcomings in the estimation of force demand, and in the analysis and design of concrete floor diaphragms have already been partially addressed by other researchers, the behaviour of diaphragms in modern multi-storey timber buildings in general, and in low damage Pres-Lam buildings (consisting of post-tensioned timber members) in particular is still unknown. The recent demand of mid-rise commercial timber buildings of ten storeys and beyond has further highlighted the lack of appropriate methods to analyse timber diaphragms with irregular floor geometries and large spans made of both light timber framing and massive timber panels. Due to the lower stiffness of timber lateral load resisting systems, compared with traditional construction materials, and the addition of in-plane flexible diaphragms, the effect of higher modes on the global dynamic behaviour of a structure becomes more critical. The results from a parametric non-linear time-history analysis on a series of timber frame and wall structures showed increased storey shear and moment demands even for four storey structures when compared to simplistic equivalent static analysis. This effect could successfully be predicted with methods available in literature. The presence of diaphragm flexibility increased diaphragm inter-storey drifts and the peak diaphragm demand in stiff wall structures, but had less influence on the storey shears and moments. Diaphragm force demands proved to be significantly higher than the forces derived from equivalent static analysis, leading to potentially unsafe designs. It is suggested to design all diaphragms for the same peak demand; a simplified approach to estimate these diaphragm forces is proposed for both frame and wall structures. Modern architecture often requires complex floor geometries with long spans leading to stress concentrations, high force demands and potentially large deformations in the diaphragms. There is a lack of guidance and regulation regarding the analysis and design of timber diaphragms and a practical alternative to the simplistic equivalent deep beam analysis or costly finite element modelling is required. An Equivalent Truss Method for the analysis of both light timber framed and massive timber diaphragms is proposed, based on analytical formulations and verified against finite element models. With this method the panel unit shear forces (shear flow) and therefore the fastener demand, chord forces and reaction forces can be evaluated. Because the panel stiffness and fastener stiffness are accounted for, diaphragm deflection, torsional effects and transfer forces can also be assessed. The proposed analysis method is intuitive and can be used with basic analysis software. If required, it can easily be adapted for the use with diaphragms working in the non-linear range. Damage to floor diaphragms resulting from displacement incompatibilities due to frame elongation or out-of plane deformation of walls can compromise the transfer of inertial forces to the lateral load resisting system as well as the stability of other structural elements. Two post-tensioned timber frame structures under quasi-static cyclic and dynamic load, respectively, were tested with different diaphragm panel layouts and connections investigating their ability to accommodate frame elongations. Additionally, a post-tensioned timber wall was loaded under horizontal cyclic loads through two pairs of collector beams. Several different connection details between the wall and the beams were tested, and no damage to the <b>collector</b> beams or <b>connections</b> was observed in any of the tests. To evaluate the increased strength and stiffness due to the wall-beam interaction an analytical procedure is presented. Finally, a timber staircase core was tested under bi-directional loading. Different connection details were used to study the effect of displacement incompatibilities between the orthogonal collector beams. These experiments showed that floor damage due to displacement incompatibilities can be prevented, even with high levels of lateral drift, by the flexibility of well-designed connections and the flexibility of the timber elements. It can be concluded that the flexibility of timber members and the flexibility of their connections {{play a major role in}} the behaviour of timber buildings in general and of diaphragms specifically under seismic loads. The increased flexibility enhances higher mode effects and alters the diaphragm force demand. Simple methods are provided to account for this effect on the storey shear, moment and drift demands as well as the diaphragm force demands. The analysis of light timber framing and massive timber diaphragms can be successfully analysed with an Equivalent Truss Method, which is calibrated by accounting for the panel shear and fastener stiffnesses. Finally, displacement incompatibilities in frame and wall structures can be accommodated by the flexibilities of the diaphragm panels and relative connections. A design recommendations chapter summarizes all findings and allows a designer to estimate diaphragm forces, to analyse the force path in timber diaphragms and to detail the connections to allow for displacement incompatibilities in multi-storey timber buildings...|$|R
