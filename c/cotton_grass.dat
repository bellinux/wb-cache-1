5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess <b>Cotton</b> <b>Grass),</b> published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Grass hedges and no-till {{cropping}} systems reduced soil losses on standard erosion plots in ultra narrow-row (20 cm) cotton during a four-year study (1999 - 2002). No-till <b>cotton</b> with <b>grass</b> hedges, no-till <b>cotton</b> without <b>grass</b> hedges, conventional-till <b>cotton</b> with <b>grass</b> hedges, and conventional-till <b>cotton</b> without <b>grass</b> hedges produced four-year average annual soil losses of 1. 8, 2. 9, 4. 0, and 30. 8 t/ha, respectively, and produced four-year average runoff amounts of 226, 364, 338, and 738 mm, respectively. The ratio of annual soil loss with grass hedges to without hedges averaged 0. 62 for no-till. The ratio of annual soil loss with grass hedges to without hedges was 0. 13 for conventional-till. Averaged over all plots (with and without grass hedges), no-till plots reduced soil loss from conventional-till plots by 86 %. No-till plots without grass hedges had 90 % less soil loss than conventional-till plots without grass hedges. Grass hedges effectively reduced soil loss on erosion plots with similar cropping practices {{as compared to}} plots without hedges. Other studies of contoured grass hedges on field-sized areas are being conducted to determine their applicability on larger areas with greater concentrations of runoff...|$|R

Alpine and sub-alpine species include mountain ash, <b>cotton</b> <b>grass,</b> sheep laurel, mountain sandwort, and the mountain cranberry. Krummholz, trees stunted by harsh weather, are found on Mount Monadnock, as are several alpine bogs. Lower elevations on Mount Monadnock are clad in northern hardwood forest species; middle elevations support stands of red spruce. Before the fires, Mount Monadnock was totally covered in a red spruce forest. Since the summit has been barren of soil cover, red spruce have been slowly ascending back towards the top in a process known as ecological succession.|$|E

It did find however a relationship between the depth of the water table and the rate of decomposition (R 2 =- 0. 3220). It also found high DOC and TDN concentrations at low water tables (R 2 =- 0. 634 and R 2 = [...] 0. 566 respectively) and high DOC in areas of high decomposition (R 2 = 0. 554).

It was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white <b>cotton</b> <b>grass.</b> In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end, until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but {{it was easy to see}} that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a wide}} {{source of}} {{vegetation}} in the polar region but there are few species in common in the southern and northern polar regions. The Arctic consists of desert and tundra vegetations. The desert vegetation consists of algae, lichens, and mosses. Lichens are the most dominant plants. The ground is bare with patchy cover of lichens and mosses. Flowering plants are also seen but not as common. It only contains 60 species of flowering plants. The Arctic tundra vegetation also consists of lichens and mosses, but it includes shrubs, grasses and forbs as well. The amount of vegetation in the tundra consists on how much sun, or snow cover is in the area. The vegetation in this area may grow as tall as 50 cm. In {{the southern part of}} the Arctic there tend to be more shrubs whereas the northern parts there is less plant cover.

Measurements were made {{for a period of}} four years (water tables) and five years (vegetation) in the inter-ditch areas of three experimental treatments: (i) open ditches, (ii) ditches blocked with closely-spaced dams and (iii) ditches partially infilled with peat and blocked with dams. It is often assumed that ditch blocking will lead to an increase in the abundance of Sphagnum and, potentially, a reduction in the abundance of sedges, particularly the <b>cotton</b> <b>grasses.</b> However, our data show no treatment effects on the abundance of either group. We did find an effect of time, with the abundance of both sedges and Sphagnum spp. varying significantly between some years.

6000|$|And now I come {{rapidly to}} the {{conclusion}} of this singular narrative, in which I have {{tried to make the}} reader share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton {{to the point where they}} had found a pathway through the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this woman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband's track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of <b>cotton</b> <b>grass</b> which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land again.
