5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan.

Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who <b>cured</b> him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, {{and both of them}} were involved in the actual renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby making it difficult to identify the right king.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the <b>cure</b> kinetics and <b>cure</b> modelling of an ambient <b>curing</b> unsaturated polyester (UP) resin system for its <b>cure</b> simulation in the vacuum infusion (VI) process.

The results of the <b>cure</b> kinetics study, the <b>cure</b> model, the material properties and the boundary conditions were the inputs in PAM-RTM software for the simulation of the degree of <b>cure</b> and the exothermic temperature during the infusion and the room temperature <b>curing</b> stages.

5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that {{he was looking for a}} horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and <b>cured)</b> the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and <b>cured</b> him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E

For the rapid progression of polymerization reaction in ultrasonic <b>curing,</b> a preheating temperature of 100 C {{was found to be}} sufficient.

The experimental results show that: The characteristics temperature of <b>curing</b> reaction is closely related to the β. With the increase of β, the initial and peak temperature is moving to the high-temperature, the <b>curing</b> time became shorter; the range of <b>curing</b> temperature became much wider. At the same time, the <b>curing</b> peaking temperature was decreased and the Enthalpy integral of <b>curing</b> reaction was reduced first then increased with the increased of the amount of <b>curing</b> agent. When the amount of <b>curing</b> agent occupied 4. 0 %- 6. 0 % of the MUF resin, the pH was decreased mostly, and the <b>curing</b> reaction rate run up quickly Along with the increasing of n (F) : n (U 1), the To, Tp and Ti are going ahead distinctly after hardening.

5000|$|The 1990s {{presented}} great {{improvements in}} light <b>curing</b> devices. As dental restorative materials advanced, so too did {{the technology to}} <b>cure</b> these materials; the focus was to improve the intensity {{in order to be}} able to <b>cure</b> faster and deeper. In 1998 the plasma arc <b>curing</b> light was introduced. [...] It uses a high intensity light source, a fluorescent bulb containing plasma, in order to <b>cure</b> the resin-based composite, and claimed to <b>cure</b> resin composite material within 3 seconds. In practice, however, while the plasma arc <b>curing</b> light proved to be popular, negative aspects (including, but not limited to, an expensive initial price, <b>curing</b> times longer than the claimed 3 seconds, and expensive maintenance) of these lights resulted in the development of other <b>curing</b> light technologies.|$|R

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not <b>cured</b> - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E
