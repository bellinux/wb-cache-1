Four early childhood centers combine to serve close to 2000 preschoolers per year, with slots available to about 99 % of children who apply. There are no exclusion <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> <b>applicants.</b> Centers range in capacity from ten classrooms serving 180 children to 34 classrooms serving 612 preschoolers. Eighteen students are assigned to each classroom, along with a certified teacher who is endorsed in early childhood education and an instructional assistant. All four centers teach the same curriculum. Funds are contributed from the Title I program, from the State, and from the school district’s budget. Collaborative special education classrooms are provided at each site and ESL is available.|$|E
40|$|The studies {{described}} in this thesis aim to assess the importance of normal colour vision in visually demanding, colour-related tasks that are often safety-critical and aim to improve {{our understanding of how}} congenital deficiencies can affect the processing of colour signals and the corresponding changes in visual performance. The first study compares the colour vision requirements within different professional environments. 519 subjects were tested: 141 normal trichromats, 268 deutans and 110 protans. All subjects carried out the Ishihara 38 -plate test, the CAD test and the Nagel anomaloscope, and sub-populations were examined with the AO-HRR plates, the Farnsworth D 15, the City University test (2 nd Ed.), the Holmes-Wright type A and B lanterns. Inconsistencies of outcome amongst the various tests and potential alternative practices are discussed. The second study focuses on understanding the discrepancies in performance observed on lantern tests when the subject’s task is to report the colour of small signal lights presented against a dark background field. These conditions were simulated using a psychophysical luminance pedestal technique. Variations in the measurement of chromatic sensitivity over the visual field, as well as the detection of targets where colours are combined with luminance contrasts, are discussed and explanations considered with regard to underlying retinal physiology. The last study investigates the use of colour signals in ATC (air traffic control) applications. The work carried out addresses current failings in acceptance <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> <b>applicants,</b> and provides alternative methods of assessing suitability. The chromatic discrimination thresholds of normal trichromats and colour deficient subjects were related to performance on a set of visual search tasks selected to be more representative of typical colour usage in large field visual displays. Display parameters under which the performance of colour deficient observers could be comparable to that of normal trichromats are examined with regard to updating occupational acceptance criteria...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to determine the}} extent of the conformity of the Croatian energy sector with the conditions for membership in the EU. According to a comparative analysis an identification is made of the state of affairs in the energy sector in the EU, in the Republic of Croatia and in the applicant countries, the level at which the conditions for membership are fulfilled and the necessary measures that have to be implemented during the reform. The main conclusion is that the legal system itself in the area of the Croatian energy system is already mainly harmonised with the EU system. However, concrete application of the rules departs from the way rules are applied in the EU. Since these rules obtain their final form only during application, and the manner of interpretation and application is much harder to change than the rules themselves, particular attention needs devoting to practice in the process of adjustment. energy, market liberalisation, single energy market, <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> membership,Croatia, <b>applicants,</b> EU...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} medical evidence in homelessness applications in England. It does so by examining the decision-making practices in three different local authorities: London Borough, Northern City and Eastern Town. Background to the study The safety-net for assistance for homeless persons in the UK is highly legalised. In England and Wales it is governed by the Housing Act 1996, part 7. In order to qualify <b>for</b> assistance homeless <b>applicants</b> must satisfy the local authority that they fall within a number of criteria. One of these is that the applicant is in “priority need”. This is a particularly key <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> single <b>applicants</b> (i. e. {{those who are not}} pregnant or with dependent children). This is set out in s. 189 (1) of the Housing Act 1996. The 1996 Act provides no further assistance as to what is meant by “vulnerable ” but there has been a number of cases where it has been considered by the courts. Decisions on vulnerability often turn on the use of medical evidence, as demonstrated by the significant amount of litigation on this issue. A number of cases have been critical of the way that local authorities use medical evidence, particularly when referring to external advisors such as a company called NowMedical (see e. g. Shala v. Birmingham C. C. [2007] EWCA Civ 62; [2008] HLR 8), although in other...|$|R

Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed admissions policies utilized in 2003, 2004 - 2005, and 2006 in the PA Department at WSU. This project targeted applicants and matriculates into the WSU PA Program. Specifically, the study measured the relationship of minority applicants to matriculates into the class of 2005 (paper-based applicant criteria heavily weighted toward GPA), classes of 2006 and 2007 (expanded criteria with race-neutral factors, still heavily weighted toward GPA), and class of 2008 (expanded criteria with race-neutral factors, with equalization of GPA with other factors). Results: Overall the classes of 2005 and 2008 had more minority applicants than matriculates. The classes of 2006 and 2007 had more minority matriculates.

40|$|Major {{changes in}} the Ontario {{secondary}} school system over the last 15 years have increased the concerns within some universities {{about the use of}} Grade 13 marks as the principal <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> evaluating <b>applicants.</b> These concerns focus on grade inflation, variability of marks among schools, and how appropriate some subjects are for university admission. This paper reports on a study of these issues conducted at McMaster University. The relationship between Grade 13 admission and Year I university averages was examined. Two issues that have received little attention elsewhere were also examined: how Year I performance varied by applicant status, and the relationship between individual Grade 13 subjects and Year I performance. The results indicate that Grade 13 marks, which are the only measure of a student's achievement available, continue to be a rea-sonable predictor of subsequent performance in Year I. Grade 13 subjects were identified that were more consistently associated with Year I performance than others. There was also evidence that some Grade 13 subjects may be contributing to an "inflated " admission average. The results of this study should be useful in evaluating existing admission policies and {{in the development of the}} new Ontario Academic Courses. * A working paper of the same title containing complete data may be obtained from th...|$|R

40|$|This article {{critically}} analyses a {{range of}} issues relating to the so-called ‘anticipatory’ or ‘speculative’ ill-treatment in expulsion cases under Article 3 ECHR. It seeks to ascertain whether the approach of both the European Court and the Commission for Human Rights (the Strasbourg organs) to those issues has provided any coherent and predictable <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> individual <b>applicants.</b> The dynamic jurisprudence has considerably extended the scope of application of this absolute right with the consequence that the responsibility of a Member State may arise even from the acts of non-State actors in an extra-territorial context. This assertive stance can also be revealed in the Strasbourg organs’ assessment of the minimum standard of ill-treatment in expulsion cases. Yet the author argues there exists some oscillations in the Strasbourg organs’ dynamic policy, disclosing inconsistency on certain issues. There seems to be a hidden double standard between expulsion and non-expulsion cases with more onerous evidentiary standards imposed on the individual applicants challenging speculative ill-treatment. The Strasbourg organs’ tacit recognition of the notion of proportionality in the earlier decisions also contradicts the unconditional nature of the right under Article 3. Despite these flaws, the author concludes that assertive policy underpinning the Strasbourg organs’ decision-making has carved out various potentially workable principles designed to enhance the effective guarantee of this non-derogable right...|$|R

Test requirements for doctoral programmes vary, some IIMs require candidates to make a presentation of a broad research idea or take a 'Research Aptitude Test (RAT)' followed by round(s) of interview while all compulsorily accept scores from standardised tests such as the CAT, GATE, GMAT and GRE. The overall profiles of candidates including past academic and professional accomplishments are considered for all programmes along with valid standard test scores. Some programmes require essays and academic and/or professional recommendations. The final round of admission evaluations involve an interview, before which some IIMs conduct other evaluation processes like written assessment tests and group discussions.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{creating}} SEAL Team Six, Marcinko was given six months to get SEAL Team 6 up and running, or the whole project would come to an end. This meant that there was a timing issue and Marcinko had little time to create a proper selection course, similar to that of Delta Force, and as a result hand-picked the first plankowners of the unit after assessing their Navy records and interviewing each man. It has been said that Marcinko regretted not having enough time to set up a proper selection process and course. Originally applicants only came from the east and west coast SEAL teams and the UDTs. Although much of the ST6/DEVGRU training pipeline is classified there are some requirements and training exercises that are public knowledge. The requirements to apply for DEVGRU states that applicants must be male and come from the SDV teams, the Navy explosive ordnance disposal teams or EODs and East and West Coast SEAL teams, be 21 years old or older, and have at least served 2 combat tours on their previous assignments. Although, due to the combat experience requirement, it isn't uncommon for a candidate to be in his early 30s. Marcinko's <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> recruiting <b>applicants</b> was combat experience so he would know they could perform under fire; language skills were vital, as the unit would have a worldwide mandate to communicate with the local population if needed; union skills, to be able to blend in as civilians during an operation; and finally SEAL skills.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn recent years, non-defense related industries and high-reliability organizations alike have emphasized positive teamwork traits {{as a part}} of their <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> hiring high-quality <b>applicants</b> to maximize workplace efficiency. As a result of targeting these high-quality applicants and creating more efficient leadership training programs, these organizations have surpassed their competitors in their respective industries. Although the U. S. Navy is already considered to be a high-reliability organization, which is known for exceptionally high safety standards and performance, small inefficiencies in the areas of teamwork and leadership exist in the workplace. This thesis conducts a gap analysis to gauge the applicability of the Navy's current accessions testing measures to its future recruiting needs. We found that the Navy is inadequately assessing applicant skills and attributes through its primary use of cognitive testing. Personality traits or non-cognitive traits testing may be used to help the Navy identify the appropriate recruits to compose high-performance teams, particularly in the enlisted ranks. Additionally, personality traits testing may be used for Navy officer accessions to help improve the quality of leaders. Lieutenant Junior Grade, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study was conducted}} to ascertain the recollections of seasoned business faculty members regarding memorable individuals who were hired during their tenure. The participants were purposefully selected from eight Southern Baptist postsecondary institutions in the Midwest. Interview questions covered (a) their perceptions of the memorable hires (either positive or negative); (b) the recruitment processes and criteria; and (c) methods of faculty retention. ^ Three themes were developed from the interview transcripts. The first theme encompassed the corporate and individual elements of the Christian beliefs and values of these institutions and their memorable hires. Corporately, the institutions requested varying degrees of information from faculty candidates regarding their personal Christian faith. Individually, one negative and four positive hires were described as modeling an active Christian life. ^ The second theme emerged from the participants 2 ̆ 7 recollections and thoughts concerning: (a) the recruitment and selection processes; (b) traits of their memorable hires; and (c) the characteristics of the ideal new hire. ^ Of the four positive hires, three were recruited through some form of networking; the four negative hires responded to position advertisements. A caring attitude was ascribed to the four positive hires. Three of the four negative hires were remembered primarily for their lack of teaching ability. The participants identified professional qualifications as the minimum <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> an <b>applicant.</b> The stated primary selection <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> future candidates was the individual 2 ̆ 7 s spirituality. ^ The third theme reflected consideration of: (a) the prominence of teaching at these institutions; (b) the organizational culture of the departments; and (c) how the business faculty interfaced with various university policies and constituencies. Effective teaching skills were mandatory at these institutions. The cultures of the departments at the eight institutions were classified as either congenial or strained. Departments with congenial cultures had a higher incident of positive hires than did departments with strained cultures. Human resource policies and interactions with those in leadership positions varied somewhat among the eight institutions. In essence, the general profile of a positive hire was a spiritual individual with a caring attitude, effective teaching skills, and a desire to serve others. ...|$|R
