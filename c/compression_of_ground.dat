40|$|The {{two main}} sources of biomass for energy {{generation}} are purpose-grown energy crops and waste materials. Energy crops, such as Miscanthus and short rotation woody crops (coppice), are cultivated mainly for energy purposes and {{are associated with the}} food vs. fuels debate, which is concerned with whether land should be used for fuel rather than food production. The use of residues from agriculture, such as barley, canola, oat and wheat straw, for energy generation circumvents the food vs. fuel dilemma and adds value to existing crops. In fact, these residues represent an abundant, inexpensive and readily available source of renewable lignocellulosic biomass. In order to reduce industry’s operational cost as well as to meet the requirement of raw material for biofuel production, biomass must be processed and handled in an efficient manner. Due to its high moisture content, irregular shape and size, and low bulk density, biomass is very difficult to handle, transport, store, and utilize in its original form. Densification of biomass into durable compacts is an effective solution to these problems and it can reduce material waste. Upon densification, many agricultural biomass materials, especially those from straw and stover, result in a poorly formed pellets or compacts that are more often dusty, difficult to handle and costly to manufacture. This is caused by lack of complete understanding on the natural binding characteristics of the components that make up biomass. An integrated approach to postharvest processing (chopping, grinding and steam explosion), and feasibility study on lab-scale and pilot scale densification of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was successfully established to develop baseline data and correlations, that assisted in performing overall specific energy analysis. A new procedure was developed to rapidly characterize the lignocellulosic composition of agricultural biomass using the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In addition, baseline knowledge was created to determine the physical and frictional properties of non-treated and steam exploded agricultural biomass grinds. Particle size reduction of agricultural biomass was performed to increase the total surface area, pore size of the material and the number of contact points for inter-particle bonding in the compaction process. Predictive regression equations having higher R 2 values were developed that could be used by biorefineries to perform economic feasibility of establishing a processing plant. Specific energy required by a hammer mill to grind non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw showed a negative power correlation with hammer mill screen sizes. Rapid and cost effective quantification of lignocellulosic components (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) of agricultural biomass (barley, canola, oat and wheat) is essential to determine the effect of various pre-treatments (such as steam explosion) on biomass used as feedstock for the biofuel industry. A novel procedure to quantitatively predict lignocellulosic components of non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was developed using Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Regression equations having R 2 values of 0. 89, 0. 99 and 0. 98 were developed to predict the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin compounds of biomass, respectively. The average absolute difference in predicted and measured cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in agricultural biomass was 7. 5 %, 2. 5 %, and 3. 8 %, respectively. Application of steam explosion pre-treatment on agricultural straw significantly altered the physical and frictional properties, which has direct significance on designing new and modifying existing bins, hoppers and feeders for handling and storage of straw for biofuel industry. As a result, regression equations were developed to enhance process efficiency by eliminating the need for experimental procedure while designing and manufacturing of new handling equipment. Compaction of low bulk density agricultural biomass is a critical and desirable operation for sustainable and economic availability of feedstock for the biofuel industry. A comprehensive study of the compression characteristics (density of pellet and total specific energy required for <b>compression)</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> non-treated and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw obtained from three hammer mill screen sizes of 6. 4, 3. 2 and 1. 6 mm at 10 % moisture content (wb) was conducted. Four preset pressures of 31. 6, 63. 2, 94. 7 and 138. 9 MPa, were applied using an Instron testing machine to compress samples in a cylindrical die. It was determined that the applied pressure (60. 4 %) was the most significant factor affecting pellet density followed by the application of steam explosion pre-treatment (39. 4 %). Similarly, the type of biomass (47. 1 %) is the most significant factor affecting durability followed by the application of pre-treatment (38. 2 %) and grind size (14. 6 %). Also, the applied pressure (58. 3 %) was the most significant factor affecting specific energy required to manufacture pellets followed by the biomass (15. 3 %), pre-treatment (13. 3 %) and grind size (13. 2 %), which had lower but similar effect affect on specific energy. In addition, correlations for pellet density and specific energy with applied pressure and hammer mill screen sizes having highest R 2 values were developed. Higher grind sizes and lower applied pressures resulted in higher relaxations (lower pellet densities) during storage of pellets. Three compression models, namely: Jones model, Cooper-Eaton model, and Kawakita-Ludde model were considered to determine the pressure-volume and pressure-density relationship of non-treated and steam exploded straws. Kawakita-Ludde model provided the best fit to the experimental data having R 2 values of 0. 99 for non-treated straw and 1. 00 for steam exploded biomass samples. The steam exploded straw had higher porosity than non-treated straw. In addition, the steam exploded straw was easier to compress since it had lower yield strength or failure stress values compared to non-treated straw. Pilot scale pelleting experiments were performed on non-treated, steam exploded and customized (adding steam exploded straw grinds in increments of 25 % to non-treated straw) barley, canola, oat and wheat straw grinds obtained from 6. 4, 3. 2, 1. 6 and 0. 8 mm hammer mill screen sizes at 10 % moisture content (wb). The pilot scale pellet mill produced pellets from ground non-treated straw at hammer mill screen sizes of 0. 8 and 1. 6 mm and customized samples having 25 % steam exploded straw at 0. 8 mm. It was observed that the pellet bulk density and particle density are positively correlated. The density and durability of agricultural straw pellets significantly increased with a decrease in hammer mill screen size from 1. 6 mm to 0. 8 mm. Interestingly, customization of agricultural straw by adding 25 % of steam exploded straw by weight resulted in higher durability (> 80 %) pellets but did not improve durability compared to non-treated straw pellets. In addition, durability of pellets was negatively correlated to pellet mill throughput and was positively correlated to specific energy consumption. Total specific energy required to form pellets increased with a decrease in hammer mill screen size from 1. 6 to 0. 8 mm and also the total specific energy significantly increased with customization of straw at 0. 8 mm screen size. It has been determined that the net specific energy available for production of biofuel is a significant portion of original agricultural biomass energy (89 - 94 %) for all agricultural biomass...|$|E

40|$|In {{geotechnical}} {{and road}} engineering, {{it is quite}} common to encounter ground represented by a layered system consisting of a thin upper subgrade layer overlaying a deep natural soil deposit. Structures built on such type <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> usually experience low bearing capacity and, consequently, large settlement. In order to achieve better results, the subgrade layer is compacted using the conventional techniques. The level of the densification achieved is influenced {{not only by the}} compacting effort applied on soil surface, but also by the strength of the underlying soil deposit. In the literature, several reports can be found dealing with the subject matter.

40|$|Freqüentemente a adoção do sistema plantio direto está associado ao surgimento da compactação ou adensamento da superfície do solo, quer pelo seu não revolvimento, quer pelo tráfego de máquinas e equipamentos agrícolas e de transporte. Com o objetivo de estudar alguns fatores que interferem na compactação do solo em plantio direto e seus efeitos na cultura do milho, foi instalado um experimento em Latossolo Vermelho Distroférrico Típico, na região sudoeste do Paraná, município de Dois Vizinhos, no ano agrícola de 1999. A superfície do solo foi trabalhada para atingir quatro níveis de possíveis compactações: (1) tráfego de colheitadeira carregada com peso de 12. 000 kgf; (2) tráfego de um trator agrícola com peso de 4. 000 kgf; (3) descompactação com subsolador de 4 hastes a 0, 40 m; (4) uma parcela testemunha. Avaliou-se o desenvolvimento do sistema radicular do milho em perfis através de trincheiras em todas as parcelas, efetuando a contagem do número de raízes e sua distribuição em profundidade no perfil, correlacionando com o rendimento de grãos de milho. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que: (1) o tratamento que sofreu tráfego do trator agrícola apresentou efeito negativo da compactação do solo demonstrada pela menor produtividade obtida; (2) os tratamentos que não sofreram compressão do solo (subsolador e testemunha) apresentaram maiores produtividades e também maior densidade de raízes, com sua distribuição mais homogênea no perfil do solo. Foram observados efeitos negativos da possível compressão do solo pelo trabalho {{artificial}} produzido pelas máquinas agrícolas nas parcelas trabalhadas, o que comprometeu a distribuição e quantidade de raízes no perfil do solo, bem como o rendimento de grãos de milho. Frequently {{the adoption}} of the system of no tillage is associated with the appearance of the compacting or thickness <b>of</b> the <b>ground</b> surface, either by not revolving or by the traffic of machines, trucks and wagons. With the objective of studying the factors that interfere in the compacting <b>of</b> the <b>ground</b> in the no tillage and its effects in the culture of the maize, this experiment was installed, in a Typical Red Distroférrico Latossolo, in the southwestern region of Paraná, Dois Vizinhos County, in the agricultural year of 1999. The surface <b>of</b> the <b>ground</b> was worked to reach four levels of possible compacting: (1) traffic of loaded harvester with weight of 12. 000 kgf; (2) traffic of an agricultural tractor with weight of 4. 000 kgf; (3) subsoiling with subsolador of 4 chainses at 0, 40 m; (4) one parcel out witness. The development of the radicular system in profiles through trenches opened in all the parcels was evaluated, by counting the number of roots and their depth in the profile, comparing to the productivity. In the end, the analyzed data demonstrated that: (1) the treatment which had suffered traffic from the agricultural tractor presented a compacting <b>of</b> the <b>ground</b> shown by lower productivity; (2) the treatments which had not suffered <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ground,</b> the case <b>of</b> the subsoil and the witness, presented higher productivity and density of roots, with more homogeneous distribution in the profile <b>of</b> the <b>ground.</b> Thus, one can conclude that the compacting <b>of</b> the <b>ground</b> through the artificial work produced by the agricultural machines in the parcels had negative effects...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> visual space occurs near the saccade goal when visual stimuli are briefly flashed at various {{locations}} on a visual reference just before a saccade. We investigated how presaccadic <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> visual space affected the apparent size of an object. In the first experiment, subjects were instructed to report the apparent number of multiple bars briefly presented around the time of saccade onset. The reported number of four bars began to decline at the 50 ms mark before a saccade and reached a minimum near the saccade onset. This confirms that the <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> visual space occurs just before saccades. In the second experiment, subjects judged the apparent width of a rectangle (a single element) or four bars (four elements) presented just before saccades. The apparent width of the four-bar stimulus was compressed just before saccades, but that of the rectangle stimulus was not compressed. Experiment 3 shows that the width <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> the four-bar stimulus is consistent with the width change predicted by <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> position. These findings indicate that the shape of a single object is not distorted at the saccade goal during presaccadic <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> visual space. In addition, experiment 4 indicates that the apparent width of a flashed stimulus just before saccades depends on the processing of global shape. This extends the definition of a visual object during presaccadic <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> visual space to not only a solid element but also a constellation of multiple elements. Furthermore, the results from these experiments suggest that presaccadic <b>compression</b> <b>of</b> visual space does not prevent object recognition underlying an attentional mechanism in generating saccadic eye movements. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
