5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the staging of Ballo, Verdi was approached by several opera companies seeking a new work or making offers to stage one of his existing ones, but refused them all. But when, in December 1860, an approach was made from Saint Petersburg's Imperial Theatre, the offer of 60,000 francs plus all expenses was doubtless a strong incentive. Verdi <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of adapting the 1835 Spanish play Don Alvaro o la fuerza del sino by Angel Saavedra, which became La forza del destino, with Piave writing the libretto. The Verdis arrived in St. Petersburg in December 1861 for the premiere, but casting problems meant {{that it had to}} be postponed.|$|E

Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E
