40|$|Background and objectives: Hemin is a {{porphyrin}} compound {{derived from}} hemoglobin, the precursor of other porphyrin hemoglobin derivatives and {{the raw material}} of Hematin. Since hemin is widely used in medicine, we decided primarily to synthesize this substance in Laboratory and {{to determine the best}} way of hemin extraction from untransfused and expired blood units. Materials and Methods: In the first method, Glacial acetic acid and sodium chloride were added to <b>citrated</b> blood and hemin crystals were extracted by means of cooling. Finally, the obtained product, by visible spectrophotometer and Infrared Spectrophotometer, was compared to standard samples. Fur thermore, <b>citrated</b> blood, <b>citrated</b> blood hemolysed by distilled water and <b>citrated</b> blood washed by normal saline were used comparatively as a raw material to produce Hemin. The second method was performed by adding Strontium, acetic acid and acetone to blood samples and then after precipitating Hemin crystals they were washed and dried with acetone. Results: The presence of functional groups in Hemin samples, analyzed by infrared Spectrophotometer, indicates the production of this compound. The results of visible Spectrophotometer in comparison with control samples and the results of samples weighting demonstrates high efficiency of extraction stages and the purity of obtained compound. Conclusion: The use of intact <b>citrated</b> blood produces more Hemin than the other kind of <b>Citrated</b> blood samples. Moreover, acetic acid with <b>citrated</b> blood, without any processing on blood, is the best way for Hemin production.

5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. <b>citrate,</b> iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by <b>citrate</b> synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E

40|$|Platelets are {{important}} for effective hemostasis and considered {{to be involved in}} pathophysiological processes, e. g. in cardiovascular diseases. Platelets provided for research or for therapeutic use are frequently separated from <b>citrated</b> whole blood (WB) stored for different periods of time. Although functionally intact platelets are required, the stability of platelet integrity, e. g. adenosine diphosphate (ADP) mediated responsiveness, has never been thoroughly investigated in <b>citrated</b> WB under ex vivo conditions. Platelet integrity was evaluated at different time points in <b>citrated</b> WB units, collected from healthy donors and stored for 5 days at ambient temperature. The analysis included the measurement of activation markers, of induced light transmission aggregometry and of purinergic receptor expression or function. Inhibitory pathways were explored by determination of basal vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) -phosphorylation, intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels and the content of phosphodiesterase 5 A. Fresh peripheral blood (PB) samples served as controls. On day 5 of storage, thrombin receptor activating peptide- 6 (TRAP- 6) stimulated CD 62 P expression and fibrinogen binding were comparable to PB samples. ADP induced aggregation continuously decreased during storage. Purinergic receptor expression remained unchanged, whereas the P 2 Y 1 activity progressively declined in contrast to preserved P 2 Y 12 and P 2 X 1 function. Inhibitory pathways were unaffected except for a slight elevation of VASP phosphorylation at Ser 239 on day 5. After 5 days of storage in <b>citrated</b> WB, platelet responsiveness to TRAP- 6 is sufficiently maintained. However, ADP-mediated platelet integrity is more sensitive to deterioration, especially after storage for more than 2 days. Decreasing ADP-induced aggregation is particularly caused by the impairment of the purinergic receptor P 2 Y 1 activity. These characteristics should be considered in the use of platelets from stored <b>citrated</b> WB for experimental or therapeutic issues...|$|R

Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium <b>citrate</b> (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone chelate complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es3+ ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd3+ ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate {{during the period of}} 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es3+ was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es3+ ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.|$|E

We compared the results of <b>citrated</b> whole-blood coculture with those obtained by the standard AIDS Clinical Trials Group PBMC semiquantitative culture method and reverse transcription-PCR quantitation of plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels. PBMC cocultures were also set up with added erythrocytes (RBCs) to determine if the presence of RBCs affects the replication of HIV- 1 in vitro.

The PBMC culture in the presence of added RBCs was more sensitive than PBMC coculture alone. The <b>citrated</b> whole-blood coculture was simple to perform, produced a reliable diagnosis of HIV infection in adult volunteers, was more sensitive than previously reported techniques even in half the culture time, and showed less variability than the PBMC coculture. <b>Citrated</b> whole-blood coculture may be a useful and efficient tool for diagnosing infection with HIV- 1...|$|R
