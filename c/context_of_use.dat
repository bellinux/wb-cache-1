500|$|The {{semantic}} {{study of}} meaning assumes that meaning {{is located in}} a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> An important example of this is the process called deixis, which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, [...] "I" [...] (which designates the person speaking), [...] "now" [...] (which designates the moment of speaking), and [...] "here" [...] (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis {{is an important part of}} the way that we use language to point out entities in the world. Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of [...] "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of [...] "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called speech acts, although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing.|$|E

40|$|Adapting User Interfaces (UI) {{while in}} {{mobility}} remains challenging as <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> identification and changes can obviously not be finely envisioned at design time. However, user’s tasks, habits and preferences may be context dependent. As a result, {{there is a}} need for managing context-aware adaptation at runtime. This paper describes EMMA (Embedded Manager for Mobile Adaptation), a running system that gathers data in mobility, learns key <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> and provides the end-user with relevant adaptation. The process is based on a bayesian user model embedded on a Smartphone running under Windows Mobile operating system. It is placed under the end-user’s control through a dedicated UI, called meta-UI. Besides this end-user’s partner role, EMMA can serve as a designer’s partner tool for identifying the key <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in the wild...|$|R
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{does not}} limit the {{application}} of his concept of language games to word-meaning. He also applies it to sentence-meaning. For example, the sentence [...] "Moses did not exist" [...] (§79) can mean various things. Wittgenstein argues that independently of use the sentence does not yet 'say' anything. It is 'meaningless' {{in the sense of}} not being significant for a particular purpose. It only acquires significance if we fix it within some <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> Thus, it fails to say anything because the sentence as such does not yet determine some particular use. The sentence is only meaningful when it is used to say something. For instance, it can be used so as to say that no person or historical figure fits the set of descriptions attributed to the person that goes by the name of [...] "Moses". But it can also mean that the leader of the Israelites was not called Moses. Or that there cannot have been anyone who accomplished all that the Bible relates of Moses, etc. What the sentence means thus depends on its <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of Modern LanguagesJanice McGregorThe {{current study}} investigates phrase-initial {{parts of speech}} as found in {{intermediate}} German textbooks and compares these findings to utterance-initial parts of speech as found in spontaneous speech in German-language interactions. This is important, because learning and using German word order {{appears to be a}} struggle for German learners whose first language is English. Research has shown that possible word order realizations in a language are partly restricted by the parts of speech system of that language (Hengeveld, Rijkhoff, & Siewierska, 2004; Vulanovic & Köhler, 2009). This is important because English and German have different parts of speech systems (Hengeveld et. al., 2004; Hengeveld & van Lier, 2010). Doherty (2005) analyzed English to German translations of an international science magazine and found that almost every second sentence begins differently. Instead, this study looks at talk in <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and compares these findings with textbook language because, in recent years, communicative approaches to language teaching have been adopted by a large number of US German language programs. One would thus expect that textbooks used in these classrooms would contain at least some input with constructions that are typical to <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> The results <b>of</b> the study indicate that construction-initial parts of speech in textbooks and in <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> are quite different. These differences imply that if it is a communicative approach that is being promoted, textbook authors and German educators would do well to expose students to actual talk from <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> so that they might learn to make meaning based on considerations <b>of</b> <b>context...</b>|$|R
