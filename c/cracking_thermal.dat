Smaller molecules such as isobutane and propylene or butylenes can be recombined to meet specific octane requirements by processes such as alkylation, or more commonly, dimerization. The octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by catalytic reforming, which involves removing hydrogen from hydrocarbons producing compounds with higher octane ratings such as aromatics. Intermediate products such as gasoils can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of cracking such as fluid catalytic <b>cracking,</b> <b>thermal</b> cracking, and hydrocracking. The final step in gasoline production is the blending of fuels with different octane ratings, vapor pressures, and other properties to meet product specifications.

30|$|Generally, various {{reactions}} such as catalytic <b>cracking,</b> <b>thermal</b> cracking, hydrogen transfer, isomerization and condensation reactions {{occur in}} the FCC reactor. Catalytic cracking is preferred over thermal cracking for maximum propylene production. As {{the severity of the}} FCC increases, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and propylene production increase as well. Therefore, maximum propylene production in FCC units is achieved by operating at high reaction temperature, short residence time and high catalyst-to-oil (C/O) ratio for a given feed and catalyst system. Catalyst back-mixing occurs in conventional FCC up-flow reactor systems, where the catalyst rises upwards by drag forces of the vaporized hydrocarbons, thereby allowing for the production of undesirable by products [2].|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The thermal {{properties}} of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars {{particularly in the}} transverse direction are {{higher than those of}} hardened concrete and steel bars. The difference in transverse thermal characteristics between FRP bar and concrete generates radial tensile stresses within concrete at the interface of FRP bars/concrete under low temperatures. These thermal stresses may cause circumferential cracks in concrete at the interface and eventually the reduction of the bond that can affect significantly the serviceability of reinforced concrete structures. This paper presents a nonlinear numerical simulation of thermal stresses in prismatic concrete beams reinforced with glass FRP (GFRP) bars submitted to low temperatures when the confining action of concrete is asymmetric. The non linear numerical analysis shows that the first circumferential cracks start to develop within concrete at FRP bar/concrete interface at a temperature decrease Tcr varied between- 30 °C and- 25 °C for prismatic concrete beams reinforced with GFRP bars having a ratio of concrete cover thickness to FRP bar diameter (c/db) varied from 1. 0 to 3. 2. Furthermore, the depths of circumferential cracks propagated from the interface through the concrete cover increase with the decrease of the thermal load T (from- 25 °C to- 50 °C). These depths did not reach the outer surface of the concrete cover under low temperatures up to- 50 °C. Also, the radial tensile stress at FRP bar/concrete interface increases with the increase in the ratio c/db.

The present article provides a systematic examination of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of karanja oil (KO) in a semi-batch reactor over supported (γ-Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, and HZSM- 5) nickel catalysts. The catalysts were associated with both dispersed and bulk nickel/nickel oxide depending {{on the extent of}} nickel loading and nature of the support.

This process can produce polyimide foams with varying properties from a large number of monomers and monomer blends.

40|$|Moisture {{damage of}} the asphalt mixture {{is defined as}} the loss of strength, {{stiffness}} and durability due to the presence of moisture (in a liquid or vapour state) leading to adhesive failure at the aggregate-bitumen interface and/or the cohesive failure within the bitumen or bitumen-filler mastic. The presence of moisture can accelerate the distress of asphalt pavement in several different modes, such as rutting, fatigue <b>cracking,</b> <b>thermal</b> cracking and the formation of potholes. In the field, the moisture damage normally happens first at the interface of two pavement layers or at the bottom of pavement layers and develops gradually upward. Once moisture has come into contact and interacted with the asphalt mixture, moisture damage could be developed by the following mechanisms: detachment, displacement, spontaneous emulsification, pore pressure, and hydraulic scour. It should be mentioned that moisture damage is not limited to only one mechanism but {{is the result of a}} combination of several mechanisms. As mentioned previously, the common modes of moisture damage of asphalt mixtures are a loss of adhesion between the aggregate and bitumen and/or a loss of cohesion in the mixture. Among these two failures, the adhesive failure is recognised as the main mode of moisture damage. Hence, the physico-chemical interactions between aggregates and bitumen in the presence of moisture are believed to partially govern the moisture sensitivity of asphalt mixtures, which can also affect the serviceability, performance and durability of the asphalt pavement. This thesis describes the work that was carried out with regard to the moisture damage evaluation of aggregate-bitumen bonds through different procedures. The fundamental properties of the individual material such as the chemical composition and rheological properties of bitumen, moisture absorption, surface morphology and mineralogical composition of aggregates were first characterised. Two types of equipment, namely the dynamic contact angle (DCA) analyser and dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) system were used for determining the surface energy of the bitumen and aggregates, respectively. The obtained surface energy results were then combined thermodynamically to determine the work of adhesion between aggregate and bitumen, and the reduction in the adhesive properties if water is introduced into the system. Three established mechanical tests consisting of the standard peel test, Pneumatic Adhesion Tensile Testing Instrument (PATTI) test and a pull off test were developed and redesigned to make sure that these tests are practical, reliable and feasible to measure the bonding strength of aggregate-bitumen combined specimens. The composite substrate peel test (CSPT) was developed to prepare composite substrates using crushed coarse aggregates as a more practical replacement for the aggregate substrates prepared from aggregate boulders. Finally, the moisture damage results from mechanical tests and thermodynamic results were compared and correlated with the basic physico-chemical properties of the original materials. The results showed that in the dry condition, all techniques used in this research, including the mechanical tests and the surface energy tests led to similar results, with bitumen rather than aggregates dominating the bonding properties of aggregate-bitumen systems. After moisture conditioning, the four mechanical tests, including standard peel test, CSPT, PATTI test and pull-off test showed similar moisture sensitivity ranking and failure surface results demonstrating the good correlation between these four tests. In addition, based on the comparison conducted, the four mechanical tests are all considered to be reliable to evaluate the moisture sensitivity of different aggregate-bitumen systems. However, based on the aggregates considered in this research, the moisture sensitivity parameters obtained from the surface energy tests are suggested unreliable to evaluate the moisture sensitivity of aggregate-bitumen systems...|$|E

Endothermic reactions dominate the whole {{reactions of the}} FCC cracking process. Specifically, cracking and dealkylation with C–C bond breakup are endothermic and favored at high temperature, leading to high conversion of heavy hydrocarbons.
