5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's <b>critical</b> <b>pressure</b> of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{pressures}} are calculated by adding {{up all the}} volumes of gas required for {{the parts of the}} dive after the critical point, and for other functions such as suit inflation and buoyancy control if these are supplied from the same set of cylinders, and dividing this total volume by the volume of the cylinder set. A minimum functional pressure is added to this value to give the <b>critical</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
25|$|Independent twin {{cylinders}}, (Two cylinders {{of about}} the same capacity mounted together {{on the back of}} the diver, each with its own regulator) are unquestionably a redundant gas supply configuration, as there is no possibility of flow from one to the other during the dive. Use of independent twins for bailout requires the diver to ensure that at all times during the dive both cylinders have sufficient gas remaining to ensure a safe ascent, including any decompression that may be required. This requirement is based on the possibility that either of the cylinders may become unusable without warning. This requirement means that the cylinders are usually breathed in turn, and changed before the pressure drops to the <b>critical</b> <b>pressure</b> for that stage of the dive. This system is economical on gas, and highly reliable when done correctly, but relatively heavy on task loading.|$|E

These critical points all {{are associated with the}} formation of condensed complexes between these lipids and cholesterol (or dihydrocholesterol). The miscibility <b>critical</b> <b>pressures</b> depend on subphase pH and ionic strength.

2500|$|For flow of gases, to {{determine}} whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the Mach number of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3. [...] For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the <b>critical</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the <b>critical</b> <b>pressure</b> the actual flow pressure becomes). [...] Acoustic problems always require allowing compressibility, since sound waves are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{concrete}} cover tensile (CCT) capacity of cracked concrete caused by reinforcement corrosion is investigated. A newly developed double-cylinder model with {{the consideration of}} concrete confinement effects is {{used to evaluate the}} <b>critical</b> expansive <b>pressure</b> of the corrosion products necessary to cause unstable cover crack propagation in corroded reinforced concrete. After considering the <b>critical</b> <b>pressures</b> associated with wide ranges of tensile capacities of concrete, reinforcement diameters and cover thicknesses, an empirical <b>critical</b> expansion <b>pressure</b> function is determined by the least squares method. The CCT capacity of cracked concrete is obtained by considering the equilibrium of expansive pressure and concrete resistant tensile force at the limiting stage. A generic relationship between CCT capacity and concrete cover in a bilinear form, which is suitable for the design, analysis and modeling of the problems related to reinforcement bar corrosion induced and other internal expansion-caused cover cracking, is proposed for the first time. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects of the tensile strength of concrete and cover thickness on the <b>critical</b> expansive <b>pressure</b> and CCT capacity...|$|R

2500|$|As the {{turbocharged}} aircraft climbs, {{however, the}} pilot (or automated system) can close the wastegate, forcing more exhaust gas through the turbocharger turbine, thereby maintaining manifold pressure during the climb, {{at least until}} the <b>critical</b> <b>pressure</b> altitude is reached (when the wastegate is fully closed), after which manifold pressure falls. With such systems, modern high-performance piston engine aircraft can cruise at altitudes up to 25,000 feet (above which, RVSM certification would be required), where low air density results in lower drag and higher true airspeeds. This allows flying [...] "above the weather". In manually controlled wastegate systems, the pilot must take care not to overboost the engine, which causes detonation, leading to engine damage.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s Robert D. Workman of the U.S. Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) {{reviewed}} {{the basis of}} the model and subsequent research performed by the US Navy. Tables based on Haldane's work and subsequent refinements were still found to be inadequate for longer and deeper dives. Workman proposed that the tolerable change in pressure was better described as a <b>critical</b> <b>pressure</b> difference, and revised Haldane's model to allow each tissue compartment to tolerate a different amount of supersaturation which varies with depth. He introduced the term [...] "M-value" [...] to indicate the maximum amount of supersaturation each compartment could tolerate at a given depth and added three additional compartments with 160, 200 and 240-minute half times. Workman presented his findings as an equation which could be used to calculate the results for any depth and stated that a linear projection of M-values would be useful for computer programming.|$|E
