2500|$|The {{high levels}} of sugars and lack of harsh tannins, makes Grenache well adapted to the {{production}} of fortified wines, such as the vin doux naturels (VDN) of the Roussillon region and the [...] "port-style" [...] wines of Australia. In these wines, the must ferments for 3 days before grape spirit is added to the must to halt the fermentation and the conversion of sugar into alcohol. The high alcoholic proof grape spirit brings the finish wine up to 15-16% alcohol. These wines can be made in a rancio style by leaving it outside in glass demi-johns (or <b>carboys)</b> or wooden barrels where the wine bakes in the sun for several years until it develops a maderized character and flavors of sour raisins, nuts and cheese. These fortified VDNs and port-style wines have longevity and can be drinkable well into their third decade.|$|E

60|$|It {{appeared}} to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood <b>carboys</b> of acid in wicker baskets. One of these {{appeared to}} leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor.

6000|$|Two of {{the most}} [...] "refined" [...] women in the store--a forelady and a cashier--had a few [...] "swell gentlemen friends" [...] with whom they now and then dined. Once they {{included}} Nancy in an invitation. The dinner {{took place in a}} spectacular café whose tables are engaged for New Year's eve a year in advance. There were two [...] "gentlemen friends"--one without any hair on his head--high living ungrew it; and we can prove it--the other a young man whose worth and sophistication he impressed upon you in two convincing ways--he swore that all the wine was corked; and he wore diamond cuff buttons. This young man perceived irresistible excellencies in Nancy. His taste ran to shop-girls; and here was one that added the voice and manners of his high social world to the franker charms of her own caste. So, on the following day, he appeared in the store and made her a serious proposal of marriage over a box of hem-stitched, grass-bleached Irish linens. Nancy declined. A brown pompadour ten feet away had been using her eyes and ears. When the rejected suitor had gone she heaped <b>carboys</b> of upbraidings and horror upon Nancy's head.|$|E
60|$|Somerset {{mounted at}} once to the first story, {{and opened the door}} of the drawing-room, which was brilliantly lit by several lamps. It was a great apartment; looking on the square with three tall windows, and joined by a pair of ample folding-doors to the next room; elegant in proportion, papered in sea-green, {{furnished}} in velvet of a delicate blue, and adorned with a majestic mantelpiece of variously tinted marbles. Such was the room that Somerset remembered; that which he now beheld was changed in almost every feature: the furniture covered with a figured chintz; the walls hung with a rhubarb-coloured paper, and diversified by the curtained recesses for no less than seven windows. It seemed to himself that he must have entered, without observing the transition, into the adjoining house. Presently from these more specious changes, his eye condescended to the many curious objects with which the floor was littered. Here were the locks of dismounted pistols; clocks and clockwork in every stage of demolition, some still busily ticking, some reduced to their dainty elements; a great company of <b>carboys,</b> jars and bottles; a carpenter’s bench and a laboratory-table.|$|E

6000|$|Not tamely, however, did {{the tall}} seaman behold the discomfiture of his companion.

Here tearing down the {{skeleton}} which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout. Rushing then with all his force against the fatal hogshead full of October ale and Hugh Tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an instant. Out burst a deluge of liquor so fierce--so impetuous--so overwhelming--that the room was flooded from wall to wall--the loaded table was overturned--the tressels were thrown upon their backs--the tub of punch into the fire-place--and the ladies into hysterics. Piles of death-furniture floundered about. Jugs, pitchers, and <b>carboys</b> mingled promiscuously in the melee, and wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk. The man with the horrors was drowned upon the spot-the little stiff gentleman floated off in his coffin--and the victorious Legs, seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed out with her into the street, and made a bee-line for the [...] "Free and Easy," [...] followed under easy sail by the redoubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who, having sneezed three or four times, panted and puffed after him with the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.|$|E
50|$|In modern laboratories, <b>carboys</b> {{are usually}} made of plastic, though {{traditionally}} were (and still {{are in many}} university settings) made of ferric glass or other shatter-resistant glasses immune to acid corrosion or halide staining common in older plastic formulations. They are used to store large quantities of liquids, such as solvents or deionised water. In these applications, a tap may be included for dispensing. <b>Carboys</b> are also used to collect and store waste solvents. Collecting waste solvents in plastic <b>carboys</b> is preferable to reusing glass Winchesters due to the lesser chance of breakage if a solution is placed in an incorrectly labeled carboy.|$|E

40|$|Phytoplankton bloom cycles were {{followed}} for 9 d in two 20 l <b>carboy</b> mesocosms {{filled with water}} from the offshore plume of Mobile Bay Alabama, USA, and incubated under fluorescent light. One of the blooms was enriched by addition of nitrate+phosphate (+nutrients), and both blooms were used to study how dimethylsulfide (DMS) concentrations and biological consumption varied over the bloom cycles. Peaks of algal biomass (15 - 22 µg chlorophyll a l- 1) in the blooms {{were followed}} within 1 d by peaks of the DMS precursor, particulate dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSPp; 100 - 140 nM). DMS concentrations increased rapidly during the early bloom, rising from 1 nM on Day 1 up to 12 nM in the unamended <b>carboy</b> and up to 17 nM in the +nutrient <b>carboy</b> on Day 6. Maximum values for DMS concentrations, DMS consumption rates (as measured with 35 S-DMS), and bacterial production were observed during the early decline of phytoplankton biomass. DMS consumption rates were initially 0. 8 nM d- 1 and increased to 3. 1 nM d- 1 in the unamended <b>carboy</b> and to 9. 1 nM d- 1 in the +nutrient <b>carboy.</b> Rate constants for DMS consumption (0. 25 - 0. 95 d- 1) initially decreased as DMS concentrations increased, resulting in longer turnover times for DMS during the peak and early decline of the blooms. Assimilation of DMS-sulfur by bacterioplankton accounted for 4 - 22 % of the total DMS consumption and higher rates of DMS assimilation occurred in the +nutrients bloom. Despite a bloom and decline of total heterotrophic bacterial abundances, bacterial community composition at the major phylogenetic group level remained relatively constant in both blooms, although the alpha proteobacteria showed a temporal increase in abundance in the +nutrient <b>carboy.</b> The concentration ratios of DMS:chlorophyll a and DMS:DMSP displayed non-linear, sigmoidal patterns over the bloom cycles and these ratios were not substantially affected by the nutrient amendment. Our results demonstrate that uncoupling of DMS production and biological consumption can occur early in a bloom cycle, causing DMS concentrations to rise significantly before biological consumption responds to draw down the DMS...|$|R
