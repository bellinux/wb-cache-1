50|$|The {{design of}} a monitor lift system is {{for the most part}} {{similar to that of the}} {{vertical}} pop-up TV lift system, with the only real difference being that the movement radius of the motor and the electrics are enclosed inside a sheet metal module. The system is conceived for smaller PC monitor sizes. They are predominantly installed in conference room tables in order to save space. The monitor lift systems are inserted from above into the section which has been cut out of the table by a carpenter or joiner and they are then secured to the table once again from below with screws. The upper part of the monitor lift system is often a cover plate made of brushed steel. With the push of a button, the <b>cover</b> <b>section</b> folds inward into the monitor lift and makes way for the monitor to move into position. The monitor moves up automatically and can still be tilted electronically when in the end position. A number of manufacturers manufacture the monitor lift with a fixed display. Monitor lift systems are available in various sizes ranging from 15 inches up to 42 inches.|$|E

5000|$|Packaging {{methods have}} changed since the {{introduction}} of the LP record. The 'wrap-around' or 'flipback' sleeve initially became the standard packaging method for LPs during the 1950s. In this packaging method the front cover is able to be printed in colour and is laminated, whereas the back cover features only black text on a white background and is usually unlaminated. These sleeves are constructed in two parts: a laminated front section is wrapped around a separate back panel. Three 'flaps' are used to fix the front and back panels together on the outside. As the unlaminated cardboard back <b>cover</b> <b>section</b> is prone to discolouration due to exposure to natural light, in some instances a single printed sheet containing the back cover information is pasted over the entire back panel, covering the 'wrap-around' flaps but not reaching {{the outer edge of the}} sleeve, thus allowing some of the laminated 'flaps' to be exposed. While discolouration still occurs with this method, it is often less evident than when the cardboard back cover alone is exposed. A common feature of flipback sleeves in the 1960s was for information specific to either monaural or stereo versions of the record (typically a format-specific catalogue number and a [...] "MONO" [...] or [...] "STEREO" [...] disclaimer) would be printed on the same front cover artwork, and the whole front panel shifted up or down to expose the appropriate [...] "version" [...] on the front while the unused one would be covered up (but often not very well) by the back cover panel.|$|E
5000|$|The Loktak Hydropower Project on the Manipur River or Imphal River, {{with the}} Loktak Lake forming the head waters to provide {{regulated}} storage for power generation, {{was built in}} 1983 as a multipurpose project with power generation of 105 MW (3x35 MW) for power supply to Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura, and lift irrigation to an area of 23000 ha in the Manipur valley. The main components of the project, as built, are, a) the Ithai barrage, across the Manipur river of 10.7 m height and 58.8 m length with three spillway bays, b) water conductor system for trans-basin diversion comprising an open channel of 2.323 km length, a cut and <b>cover</b> <b>section</b> of 1.077 km length (bed width 18 m, followed by a Head Race Tunnel of 3.81 m diameter (horseshoe type) and 6.62 km long to carry a discharge of [...] (...) for power generation and [...] for irrigation), c) a surge shaft, d) penstocks and e) a surface powerhouse and a tailrace channel on the right bank of the narrow Leimatak River with three units of 35 MW capacity each generating an annual energy of 448 GW·h (1.613 PJ). The downstream Loktak Power Project in cascade to utilize the regulated releases from the upper project for further power generation of 90 MW is proposed to be taken up for joint implementation by NHPC and the Government of Manipur.The project has invited severe criticism since the water level in the lake at the Ithai barrage is maintained throughout the year at FRL 786.5 m from considerations of power generation from the well planned water conductor system. The problem in the lake is, however, diverse; economic activities {{in and around the}} lake, and encroachments by 50,400 fishermen for extensive fishing activity are also cited to be some reasons. Other reasons for the distress situation in the lake are a) jhum (shifting) cultivation, b) extensive deforestation and unscientific land use practices in the catchment areas which bring large amount of silt into the lake and c) undefined ownership of the lake where the stakeholders are the districts of Imphal west district, Bishnupur and Thoubal causing lack of integrated approach to the lakes potential for providing benefits.|$|E
5000|$|On December 1995, Mosely {{was added}} as the 5th member in Inspection 12 as second guitar and vocals. His first show {{with the band}} was at a friend's {{backyard}} birthday party. Because {{he did not know}} any of their songs, he only played the <b>cover</b> <b>section</b> consisting of songs by NOFX and Weezer. The band went on to record six full length independent albums, and although being a relatively successful local band, Mosely recalls feeling like outcasts because of their preppy clothes and unorthodox style of punk rock, explaining that [...] "Whenever we'd play a show like Good Riddance or AFI, it would always be a real tough crowd. I used to hear it all the time about us being rich kids."The band went on a hiatus in 1999 when singer Dan McLintock joined fellow musician Ryan Key to audition for the Tooth & Nail band Craig's Brother. Ryan soon returned home and joined local band Yellowcard, and a year later Dan also returned, with a proposal from Fat Wreck Chords record label owner Fat Mike to record some new material for consideration for Fat Wreck Chords subsidiary Honest Don's Records. Guitarist James Trimble was by then studying in Tennessee to become an obstetrician so Ryan was asked to help with the recording of their Home EP. Yellowcards violinist Sean Mackin was also featured on strings. After the recording their record label debut album In Recovery in December 2000, drummer Scott Shad died after going into diabetic shock while driving his car, but the band persevered and drafted lifelong friend of the band Tim Grisnik as a drummer. They went on a U.S. tour and later returned to the studio to record their second album for Honest Don's, Get Rad. However, after eight months of recording songs, Honest Don's president reportedly told them, [...] "My label doesn't put out this kind of music. And I don't even know what to call it." [...] They were dropped from the record label and bought their recorded material back to finish the album themselves.The band would go on to release its newest album in 11 years, Redefine, in December 2014. The album features the return of original lead vocalist, Rob Reid, to the band.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of water in}} open channels on extremely flat grades is difficult because of the head loss that is necessary. A modified venture section, the contraction of which is provided by a top <b>cover</b> <b>section</b> mounted in a rectangular flume, is proposed {{to meet the requirements}} of a suitable measuring device for use in canals of flat gradients. The method of finite differences has been used for the mathematical solution to the idealized inviscid flow problem. This was followed by a laboratory investigation to ascertain the hydraulic characteristics of the proposed design. The experiments were conducted in a 3 feet by 3 feet by 200 feet concrete flume. The equation for discharge as obtained in this study is as follows: Coefficient of discharge CD has been calculated for throat opening of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 inches. The results have been presented in the form of curves and these curves have been compared with the work done by previous investigators...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} report field erosion {{tests of the}} inner slope of a sea dyke in the {{province}} of Groningen (near Delfzijl) are described for the situation of severe wave overtopping. Three types of tests have been performed: tests at the present grass cover, tests at a reinforced grass cover and tests at a section of bare clay. At the reinforced grass <b>cover</b> <b>section</b> a provisional Smart Grass Reinforcement (SGR) system was installed in May 2006 (Royal Haskoning & Infram, 2005). The test sections were 4 m wide and extended over about 16 m along the inner slope, down from the dyke crest. It should be remarked that the erosion tests focused on the inner slope from the crest to some distance above the level of the service road. Below the service road, the berm slope was artificially strengthened with riprap as to avoid any damage on beforehand. The tests have been carried out under the framework of ComCoast, Work Package 3 (WP 3). Additional measurements have been commissioned by the SBW program (Sterkte & Belastingen Waterkeringen or in English: Strength & Loads Water Defences), a research program for improvement of knowledge of present defences. These measurements included: measurement of flow velocities and water depths, infiltration tests, determination of the soil shear strength and an additional erosion test at a bare clay section. The present report is an overall report, presenting a full overview of all test activities, as far as conducted under the responsibility of the consortium. At a later stage, the SBW measurements will be analysed further within the scope of the SBW program. Where applicable, however, some preliminary results are included in this report. For further information, the present report addresses background reports that were written within the framework of ComCoast or SBW. Special reference is made here to the report on the wave overtopping simulator (Infram & Royal Haskoning, 2007), a summary of which has been presented in the present report in Chapter 4.
