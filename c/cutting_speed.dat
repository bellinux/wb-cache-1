It is known that B1112 has a tool life of 60 minutes at a <b>cutting</b> <b>speed</b> of 100 sfpm. If a material has a machinability rating of 70%, it can be determined, with the above knowns, that {{in order to maintain the}} same tool life (60 minutes) the <b>cutting</b> <b>speed</b> must be 70 sfpm (assuming the same tooling is used).|$|E

25|$|Machinability can {{be based}} on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when {{comparing}} materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall with this approach is that tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, <b>cutting</b> <b>speed,</b> feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).|$|E

Experiment shave been conducted using different material, punch die clearances and different <b>cutting</b> <b>speeds.</b> In {{order to determine the}} reachable <b>cutting</b> <b>speeds</b> and calculate the energy required for blanking, velocity stroke cures were obtained. The quality of the part edges shows that higher <b>cutting</b> <b>speeds</b> can improve the part edge quality, resulting in smaller burr height and rollover, and a larger shear zone. Furthermore, it could be observed that the part quality improvement when blanking with high <b>cutting</b> <b>speeds</b> is much more distinct for stele than for copper or aluminum. According to blanking theory, this improvement was expected because copper and aluminum have much higher heat conduction coefficients. Therefore, the at dissipates faster and the desired stress relief effect does not take place to the same degree as for stele...|$|R
50|$|Due to high <b>cutting</b> <b>speeds</b> a <b>cutting</b> fluid is {{required}} to lubricate and cool the tool and workpiece.

25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, the <b>cutting</b> <b>speed</b> {{in light}} steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.|$|E
25|$|The {{machinability}} {{rating of}} a material attempts {{to quantify the}} machinability of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a normalized value. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) determined machinability ratings {{for a wide variety}} of materials by running turning tests at 180 surface feet per minute (sfpm). It then arbitrarily assigned 160 Brinell B1112 steel a machinability rating of 100%. The machinability rating is determined by measuring the weighed averages of the normal <b>cutting</b> <b>speed,</b> surface finish, and tool life for each material. Note that a material with a machinability rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and material with a value more than 100% would be easier.|$|E

Bulk, monolithic silicon nitride {{is used as}} a material for cutting tools, due to its hardness, thermal stability, and resistance to wear. It is especially recommended for high speed machining of cast iron.
