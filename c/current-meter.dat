40|$|Atmospheric forcing during 2009 – 2010 and 2010 – 2011 {{winter months}} showed {{differences}} in both intensity and persistence {{that led to}} distinct oceanographic responses. Persistent dry northern winds caused strong heat losses (14 211 W m− 2 ) in winter 2009 – 2010 that triggered a pronounced sea surface cooling compared to winter 2010 – 2011 (1597 W m− 2 lower). As a consequence, a large volume of dense shelf water formed in winter 2009 – 2010, which cascaded at high speed (up to &sim; 1 m s− 1 ) down Cap de Creus canyon, as measured by <b>current-meters</b> in mooring lines deployed inside the canyon at 300 m and 1000 m water depth. The lower heat losses recorded in winter 2010 – 2011, together with an increased river discharge, resulted in lowered density waters over the shelf, thus preventing the formation of dense shelf water. Particle fluxes were concurrently measured by using sediment traps at the same mooring stations. High total mass fluxes (up to 84. 9 g m− 2 d− 1 ) recorded in winter 2009 – 2010 indicate that dense shelf water cascading resuspended and transported sediments at least down to 1000 m deep within the canyon. Sediment fluxes were lower (28. 9 g m− 2 d− 1 ) under the quieter conditions of winter 2010 – 2011. The dominance of the lithogenic fraction in mass fluxes during the two winters points to a resuspension origin {{for most of the}} particles transported down canyon. The variability in organic matter and opal contents relates to seasonally controlled inputs associated to the plankton spring bloom during March and April of both years. Our measurements of particle fluxes (including major components and grain size distribution), together with meteorological and oceanographic parameters such as wind speed, turbulent heat flux, near-bottom water temperature, current speed and suspended sediment concentration, during winters 2009 – 2010 and 2010 – 2011 along the Cap de Creus submarine canyon, show the important role of atmospheric forcings in transporting particulate matter through the submarine canyon and towards the deep sea...|$|R

The mooring, deployed {{in conjunction with the}} Brazil Basin Tracer Release Experiment, was placed in the general area where enhanced diapycnal mixing had previously been inferred. The <b>current-meter</b> data characterize the velocity, temperature, shear, and temperature gradient variability as a function of frequency. Energetic velocities and shears were observed at the mooring at a variety of frequencies. In addition to semidiurnal flows, a significant amount of shear variance derived from near-inertial motions, as has been seen in a recent numerical modeling study of tidal-frequency internal wave radiation and wave–wave interaction. At times, a fortnightly modulation of the total superinertial shear variance was indicated in the data, but this signal did not dominate the records. Wave ray tracing indicates that the deeper current meters may have been placed in a shadow zone for locally generated internal tides. At shallower levels, it is suggested that dispersion, wave–wave interaction, and wave breaking effectively obscured the sources of the finescale energy. Average diapycnal diffusivity estimates inferred from a Richardson-number-based parameterization and from observations of tempera-ture inversions at 4648 m were of the same order of magnitude as those derived from turbulent dissipation estimates and from the rate of diapycnal tracer dispersion.

ADCP <b>current-meters</b> were deployed during the paroxysmal phase in 2002 and 2003 a few meters from the degassing vent, recording day-long timeseries. Datasets were sorted to remove errors and select good quality ensembles over the entire water column.

Time series intervals had been selected when the basic ADCP assumptions were fulfilled and random errors minimized. Backscatter data were also processed to identify bubbles in the water column with the aim of locating bubble-free ensembles. Reliable timeseries are selected combining these data. Two possible scenarios have been described: firstly, a high dynamic situation with visible surface diverging rings of waves, entrainment on {{the lower part of the}} gas column, detrainment in the upper part and a stagnation line (SL) at mid depth where currents were close to zero and most of the gas bubbles spread laterally; secondly, a lower dynamic situation with water entraining into the gas plume at all depths and no surface rings of diverging waves. Reasons for these different dynamics may be ascribed to changes in gas fluxes (one order of magnitude higher in 2002).

Measurements from a cross-shore {{array of}} {{pressure}} sensors and <b>current-meters,</b> deployed on the fringing reef of Ipan, Guam {{as part of}} the PILOT (Pacific Island Land-Ocean Typhoon) experiment, were analyzed to understand the processes driving the large water level oscillations observed at the shore during energetic wave events. Offshore, sea and swell (SS: 3 to 20 seconds period) energy is dominant, while on the reef flat, energetic oscillations are observed with periods in the infragravity (IG: 20 to 200 seconds) and far infragravity (fIG 200 to 1000 seconds) bands. The nonlinear processes that contribute to this low-pass transformation of wave energy across the reef are analyzed in terms of the energetics of the wave field in each frequency band. Wave transformation across the fringing reef is characterized by the strong breaking and dissipation of the incident SS energy which provides a driving force for the waves at lower frequencies. The SS energy on the reef flat is shown to be strongly dependent on the total reef flat water level that includes wave induced setup. The non linear transfer of energy between the SS and low frequency (LF: IG and fIG) bands is responsible for both the forcing and the loss of low frequency energy at the reef crest. In IG band, the low frequency oscillations resulting from the breaking SS envelope work against the incident bound waves and energy is transferred to the SS band similar to the nonlinear transfer observed on sandy beaches. The SS envelope oscillations at fIG frequencies force free fIG waves across the surfzone. Across the reef flat, low frequency oscillations at normal mode frequencies are preferentially excited. The development of standing waves on the reef flat is controlled by the strong depth dependent frictional dissipation of the LF waves reflected at the shoreline. During tropical storm Man-Yi, resonant standing modes in the fIG band were excited when a large increase in water level over the reef occurred due to wave setup that both reduced the effects of friction and the period of the fundamental mode...|$|R
40|$|EGU General Assembly 2013, 7 - 12 April, 2013, Vienna, AustriaThe {{offshore}} {{displacement of}} bottom trawling fleets has raised {{concerns over the}} impact of this human activity on deep-sea ecosystems and associated living resources, which are characterized by a lower resilience than shallow water correlatives. However, the effects of bottom trawling on sediment remobilization across continental margins and on the alteration of seafloor morphology still remain largely unaddressed. We present a compilation of results from studies conducted during the last decade in the La Fonera (Palamós) submarine canyon (NW Mediterranean Sea), where a bottom trawling fishing fleet is active on a daily basis at depths from 400 to 800 m. Deployments of mooring lines equipped with punctual and profiling <b>current-meters,</b> turbidimeters and sediment traps have documented that trawling gears passing along the canyon flanks generate daily sediment gravity flows, implying a periodic sediment removal from fishing grounds. These sediment-laden flows are able to reach the main canyon axis and progress to a minimum depth of 1200 m. Also, sediment accumulation rates in the lower canyon have increased since the industrialization of the local trawling fleet (1970 s), suggesting a human-induced enhancement of along-canyon transfer of sediments from the fishing grounds to greater depths. Sedimentological and 210 Pb analysis of interface sediment cores collected from the canyon flanks confirm that widespread erosion and stirring of surface sediments is notable on trawled areas when compared to control (untrawled) sites at similar depths. This chronic reworking and removal of surface sediments from trawling grounds has ultimately led to modifications of the seafloor morphology over large spatial scales, as revealed by high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) data sets. Untrawled canyon flank segments are dominated by a dense network of tributary valleys that progress upslope from the main canyon axis, reaching up to five orders of bifurcation. Such complex morphology is missing in the trawled depth range and slightly below, where the sea floor becomes smoother and only the main branches of the tributary valley networks are preserved. Given the global dimension of commercial bottom trawling, our findings suggest that this human activity may have become a significant driver of sediment dynamics and seascape evolution over substantial parts of the world's upper continental slopesPeer Reviewe...|$|R

From Knowledge to Action, 22 - 27 April 2012, Montréal, CanadaClimate {{change is}} {{expected}} to deeply affect the Arctic pelagic ecosystems via ice cover reduction and increase of freshwater discharge. Important but mostly unknown consequences are to follow for the downward export of particulate matter and the carbon cycling in general. This situation has caused a growing need of field observations to monitor the complex and rapidly changing Arctic environment and to enlarge the dataset available to modelers. In {{the framework of the}} international multidisciplinary project MALINA, an intensive survey in the Beaufort Sea off the Mackenzie River Delta was done during August 2009. The vertical flux of particulate material and carbon was measured and characterized. The sources of the organic carbon pool was also identified by analysis of lipid biomarkers and their δ 13 C in both suspended particles and surface sediments in order to identify the terrestrial, marine and bacterial sources of carbon and the processes of transport and degradation in the water column. Downward particle and carbon flux was measured directly by means of sediment traps (Technicap PPS 3) attached to a drifting line. Traps were deployed at 4 depths (40, 85, 145 and 200 m) along with <b>current-meters.</b> The drifting array was deployed at selected sites of the Canadian Beaufort Sea between 14 and 25 August 2009. Mooring deployments lasted for 28 - 50 hours and targeted the shelfbreak and the slope along the Beaufort-Mackenzie continental margin, as well as the edge between the Mackenzie Shelf and the Amundsen Gulf. The measured fluxes were relatively low (in the range of 9 - 56 mg m- 2 d- 1 for the total mass and 1 - 15 mg C m- 2 d- 1 for carbon). Overall, the magnitude and composition of the particulate flux suggests post-bloom conditions during the survey. Particulate organic carbon export was also estimated through natural radionuclide disequilibria (234 Th/ 238 U) used as a proxy for POC flux. Water column profiles of total 234 Th were obtained from 2 L of seawater (small volume technique) sampled by a CTD-Rosette, and particulate 234 Th was measured at selected depths using large volume Challenger in-situ pumps. Derived fluxes were relatively low during the sampled period and consistent with the direct flux measurements. The analysis of molecular and isotopic lipid biomarkers in suspended particulate matter in the water column from the Mackenzie Shelf {{to the edge of the}} Amundsen Gulf showed a predominant biogenic and fossil composition, while surface sediments revealed that sinking material was relatively fresh and of marine organic source, mixed with a fossil hydrocarbon background and a small input of terrestrial sources.

40|$|Tese de dout., Ciências do Mar, da Terra e do Ambiente (Ciências do Mar-Oceanografia Física), Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Univ. do Algarve, 2011 Research {{into the}} {{consequences}} of engineering works on the long-term behaviour of inlet systems has been hindered {{by the absence of}} suitable datasets, the shortcomings of existing formulae when applied to different inlets, and the difficulties particular to multi-inlet situations. Cross-sectional channel areas adjust to hydrodynamics and sediment transport conditions. The impacts of a new inlet on the adjacent shoreline can be unpredictable and are difficult to quantify. The coupling of morphology and hydrodynamics analysis should therefore be extended to all inlets in order to infer the stability of the overall system based on the distribution of the tidal prism through time and the patterns of inlet circulation and sediment transport. Within this thesis both historical and present-day hydrodynamic data collected using high frequency equipment are combined to analyse the recent evolution and equilibrium of a multiple-inlet system. Methods for calculating sediment budgets, analysing the evolution of inlet parameters and determining present hydrodynamic and sediment transport patterns are coupled together, with the aim of improving understanding and prediction of tidal inlet morphodynamics. The results augment existing knowledge about multiple-inlet systems and improve understanding of their short- to medium-term stability. The findings indicate that combining sediment budget calculation and inlet parameter analysis is useful for understanding historical sediment pathways and magnitudes, as well as for analysing the evolution of an inlet, or multiple-inlet system, towards equilibrium. Existing formulae for inferring inlet stability that relate crosssectional area to tidal prism should be revised with a view to including other external variables (e. g. stratigraphic controls) and making their application more flexible to cope with the range of different inlet conditions. Although it is generally acknowledged that most multiple inlets are unstable and cannot co-exist, detailed measurements of hydrodynamic variables obtained over complete spring and neap tidal cycles in a multiple-inlet system in Southern Portugal (Ria Formosa) indicate that the two main inter-connected inlets servicing an embayment (Faro-Olhão and Arrmona inlets) can coexist, at least over a time scale of several decades. Their coexistence cannot be explained simply using empirical equilibrium relations or inlet hydraulics. Residual flow between the inlets appears {{to play an important role}} in enhancing their stability. The morphology of the inner channels connecting the inlets can play an important role in inlet stability by controlling the interconnections between the inlets. The capacity to exchange large portions of the tidal prism, while maintaining independent behaviour for the majority of the neap-spring tidal cycle, can contribute to the stability of multiple inlets by altering residual flow and, consequently, transport capacity. This can be particularly important for tidal conditions in which inlets can drain each sub-basin independently. However, it is the availability of sediment stored in the ebb-tidal deltas (and its capacity to be carried into the inlets during storm events) that ultimately dictates the overall equilibrium, independently of hydraulic flushing capacity. If littoral drift is strong, ebb shoals trap significant quantities of sand. During periods of increased wave activity, the tide may not have the capacity to transport material away from the inlet mouth area, and the inlet will accumulate sand due to the shoreward migration of the ebb shoal. Such movement of sediment leads to the obstruction of the inlet channels, thereby affecting the hydraulic efficiency and eventually leading to inlet closure over the long term. The long-term equilibrium of sediment storage in the ebb-tidal deltas must therefore be considered when analysing the possible equilibrium of multiple-inlet systems. Regarding the techniques used, a statistical evaluation of the best method for extrapolating velocity measurements to the unmeasured areas of a vertical profile is presented. To calculate cross-sectional discharge, mean velocities and bed-friction velocities, custom Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) software makes use of theoretical models (e. g. 1 / 6 power-law and logarithmic law) to reconstruct velocity profiles based on models calibrated and tested for fixed <b>current-meters</b> The aim of this work was to define the best method to extrapolate velocities when using boat-mounted ADCPs, allowing the accurate calculation of the tidal prism, as well as increasing the reliability of the sediment transport estimations. The results revealed the logarithmic law to be more robust across different velocities and channel morphologies. Quantification of sediment transport in tidal inlets remains a fundamental requirement for developing both conceptual and numerical modelling of tidal inlet function and evolution. Well-established empirical formulae were used to estimate bedload, suspended load and total sediment transport rates. The results compared favourably with direct and indirect field observations of sediment transport rates. Although subject to a range of errors, the methods adopted have helped to quantify net accretion/erosion and enabled evaluation of both the flushing and bypassing capacity of tidal inlets in the system. The work has increased knowledge of sediment dynamics in multiple inlet systems and identified appropriate approaches for the prediction of sediment transport in these environments. They may therefore assist in identifying evolutionary trends for a single tidal inlet or a multi-inlet system. The approach and methodology followed in this study could be applied to other multiple-inlet systems around the world in an attempt to “design with nature”, combining an understanding of sediment movement in a region, development projects and regional sediment-management actions.

During the "EQUALANT" program (1999 - 2000), a mooring array was deployed around the equator near 10 °W that recorded one year of measurements at various depths. Horizontal velocities were obtained in the upper 60 m from an upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and at 13 deeper levels from current meters between 745 and 1525 m. To analyze the quasiperiodic variability observed in these records, a wavelet-based technique was used. Quasiperiodic oscillations having periods between 5 and 100 days were separated into four bands: 5 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 40, and 40 - 100 days. The variability shows (i) a strong seasonality (the first half of the series is dominated by larger periods than the second one) and (ii) a strong dependence with depth (some oscillations are present in the entire water column while others are only present at certain depths). For the oscillations that are present in the entire water column the origin of the forcing can be traced to the surface, while for the others the question of their origin remains open. Phase shifts at different depths generate vertical shears in the horizontal velocity component with relatively short vertical scales. This is especially visible in long-duration events (> 100 days) of the zonal velocity component. Comparison with a simultaneous lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler (LADCP) section suggests that some of these flows may be identified with equatorial deep jets. A striking feature is a strong vertical shear lasting about 7 months between 745 and 1000 m. These deep <b>current-meter</b> observations would then imply a few months of duration for the jets in this region...|$|E
40|$|The term {{entrapment}} zone {{has been}} used to describe a zone of elevated concentrations of particles, plankton, and juvenile fish observed in low-salinity areas of north (San Francisco) bay and the western Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. The hypothesized mechanism for entrapment was a combination of particle aggregation, sinking and a residual current null zone. The null zone is a time-mean, near-bed flow convergence where riverine flow ends and gravitational circulation begins that was presumed to occur near a salinity of 2 psu. <b>Current-meter</b> measurements made prior to 1990 provide evidence of gravitational circulation and a null zone during autumn in the north bay of San Francisco Bay, including Suisun Bay and the western delta. Data collected after 1990, however, show an absence of gravitational circulation from most of Suisun Bay during spring, and the presence of multiple gravitational circulation cells between bathymetric constrictions elsewhere in the bay. Because null zones appear to be bathymetrically controlled, they often occur in areas far removed from the low salinity zone (near X 2, the position of a bottom salinity of 2 psu). The presence or absence of gravitational circulation can be predicted with appropriate physical scaling, which explains the most recent and historical <b>current-meter</b> observations throughout the Bay/Delta system. In areas where gravitational circulation is weak or nonexistent, some other physical or biological mechanism(s) must be causing the observed concentration of particles and organisms in the low-salinity zone. Four physical mechanisms are discussed in this chapter: density-current pulses that occur near slack tide, ebb/flood shear stress asymmetries, vertical migration of organisms during the tidal cycle, and an upstream mass flux known as Stokes ’ drift. Stokes ’ drift was eliminated from further consideration because variations in sea level are small relative to the mean depth and because of the weak correlation between sea level and the tidal currents in Suisun Bay...|$|E
40|$|Dramatic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} in the mid-to-high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean as evidenced by TOPEX/Poseidon observations of sea surface height (SSH) in the subpolar gyre and the Gulf Stream. Analysis of altimeter data shows that subpolar SSH has increased during the 1990 s and the geostrophic velocity derived from altimeter data shows a decline in the gyre circulation. Direct <b>current-meter</b> observations in the boundary current of the Labrador Sea support the trend in the 199 Os, and, together with hydrographic data show that in the mid-late 1990 s the trend extends deep in the water column. We find that buoyancy forcing over the northern North Atlantic has a dynamic effect consistent with the altimeter data and hydrographic observations: a weak thermohaline forcing and the subsequent decay of the domed structure of the subpolar isopycnals would give rise to the observed anticyclonic circulation trend...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This report {{describes}} an experiment {{to make a}} completely non-contact open-channel discharge measurement. A van-mounted, pulsed doppler (10 GHz) radar collected surface-velocity data across the 183 -m wide Skagit River, Washington at a USGS streamgaging station using Bragg scattering from short waves produced by turbulent boils {{on the surface of}} the river. Surface velocities were converted to mean velocities for 25 sub-sections by assuming a normal open-channel velocity profile (surface velocity times 0. 85). Channel cross-sectional area was measured using a 100 MHz ground-penetrating radar antenna suspended from a cableway car over the river. Seven acoustic doppler current profiler discharge measurements and a conventional <b>current-meter</b> discharge measurement were also made. Three non-contact discharge measurements completed in about a 1 -hour period were within 1 % of the gaging station rating curve discharge values. With further refinements, it is thought that open-channel flow can be measured reliably by non-contact methods. 1...|$|E
40|$|Bed-load {{transport}} under tidal {{currents and}} waves, and waves alone, is predicted from near-bed self-recording <b>current-meter</b> data and observations from a wave-rider buoy. Transport rates and paths are derived using seven different unidirectional transport formulae {{and those of}} Bagnold (1963), Bijker (1967) and Madsen and Grant (1976) for combined flows. Predicted rates are compared {{with the results of}} a fluorescent sand tracer study. The data are available from Swansea Bay, a high tidal- and wave-energy embayment on the British continental shelf. Sediment transport paths in this region had been determined previously using a variety of techniques, including bedform orientation and sea-bed drifter recovery patterns. Transport is enhanced under the superimposed effect of waves and, in some circumstances, the direction of the resultant vector is altered. Such storm-induced catastrophic transport is different to that predicted under tidal currents alone; this could provide a mechanism for long-term sediment supply. In some areas, there is correspondence between bedform orientation and storm-induced transport paths; in others, there is opposition...|$|E

It consists in a network of accurate autonomous SBE 37 CTDs deployed in selected Mediterranean key-sites, with a typical 1 -hr sampling interval. In order to make deployments/recoveries as easy as possible, even from small ships, the CTDs are generally set on short moorings, so that they sample at ~ 10 - 20 m above the seafloor, most often associated with a <b>current-meter.</b> Moorings are serviced locally by individual partners every 1 - 2 years.

A high-resolution sigma-coordinate model of the circulation of a Tyrrhenian Sea coastal area coupled with an operational circulation model of the whole Tyrrhenian Sea reproduces correctly the oscillation. Model outputs are used to interpret the phenomenon. The oscillation, arising from the relaxation of an extended coastal upwelling, is associated with coastal patterns that decrease exponentially from the coast with an e-folding length scale L and propagate with the coast to the right with phase speed c. Both L and c {{are found to be}} in excellent agreement with Kelvin wave theory. The subtle role played by the nesting in reproducing such a dynamical feature is finally discussed (this contribution is obtained in the framework of the Italian RITMARE Flagship Project, U. O.

The propagation speed of the main internal wave was around 0. 3 m s 1, and nonstationary time series analysis was used to locate the trailing short-wavelength internal waves in fre-quency (periods of around 40 min) and tidal-phase space. The average energy dissipation rate (5 108 m 2 s 3) was an order of magnitude smaller than that observed on the open shelf in other studies, but peaks in dissipation rate were measured to be much greater. The vertical diffusivity of heat was around 104 m 2 s 1, comparable to, or greater than, other studies. Examples of the scale and sporadic nature of larger mixing events were observed. The behavior was complicated by the nearby steeply shoaling coast of the Poor Knight Islands. Consistent reflected wave energy was not apparent. 1...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of the experimental investigation of a Zarea-type torsional velocity-meter. For this, a torsional meter was designed, built and tested in the laboratory. The current meter consists of an axial rotor with blades fixed to a shaft which is in turn fixed to a rigid hub. The force of the water flow produces a torque which deforms the shaft. The current meter has been statically calibrated, thereby establishing the variational curve of the torsion angle as a function of the applied torque. A laboratory facility has been constructed in which tests were run for water speeds of up 3 m/s. The torque measurements were taken by using strain gauges. The methodology and the equipment used for the experimental evaluation are shown. Additionally illustrated are the calibration curves, the analysis of obtained results, some advantages and disadvantages, and the range of application of the torsional <b>current-meter</b> are all discussed...|$|E

The turbulence characteristics obtained from the statistical analysisof longitudinal velocity component are summarized as follows. The intensity and the length scale of turbulence decrease in the curved and thedownstream straight reaches except the outer part of the inlet region of the curved reachwith the smaller central radius. In the outer part of the region, the turbulence intensityincrease, but the r. m. a. of the velocity fluctuation {{are no more than}} that of the upperstraight reach and the turbulence scale also decrease. The decrease of turbulence inte-nsity and scale is due to the decrease of energy spectral density in the lower frequencyrange...|$|E

We report data taken by various limnigraphs and current meters and isolate, by spectral analysis, the most conspicuous barotropic periods of these signals. The analysis that follows is based on the linearized shallow-water equations, that are solved for the free oscillations and thus identify the eigenperiods and corresponding mode structures for this lake. Computational results are presented for a finite difference representation for these surface-seiche equations applied to the entire Lake Onega including its bays. The grid consists of quadratic elements of 1000 m side length corresponding to 9344 active cells. The emerging matrix eigenvalue problem exceeds the storage and compuational capacity of standard PCs or workstations and thus requires use of the approximate Lanczos procedure to isolate the first ten eigenperiods and corresponding mode structures of the barotropic seiches, lying between 12. 1 and 2. 2 h.
