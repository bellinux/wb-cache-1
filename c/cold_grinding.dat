30|$|A {{membrane}} fraction {{enriched in}} plasma membrane vesicles was prepared {{as described by}} Briskin et al. (1987) with minor changes. Excised roots were homogenized (1 / 2, w/v) with {{a mortar and pestle}} in a <b>cold</b> <b>grinding</b> medium containing: 25  mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.2), 250  mM mannitol, 5  mM EDTA, 5  mM EGTA, 1  mM DTT and 1.5 % (w/v) PVP. The whole isolation procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 560 [*]×[*]g for 12  min, then the supernatant was centrifuged at 10, 000 [*]×[*]g for 15  min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 60, 000 [*]×[*]g for 30  min to yield a crude membrane fraction. The resulting pellet was resuspended with 1  mL in a gradient buffer containing: 20  mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.5), 5  mM EDTA, 0.5  mM EGTA. The supernatant was layered on top of a step gradient consisting of 1  mL 45 %, 33 %, and 15 % (w/w) sucrose, respectively, and then centrifuged for 2  h at 70, 000 [*]×[*]g.|$|E
30|$|About 10  g {{leaves were}} grinded in 100  mL ice <b>cold</b> <b>grinding</b> medium [50  m MHEPES–KOH (pH 8.0), 330  mM sorbitol, 2  mM EDTA-Na 2 (pH 8.0), 5  mM ascorbic acid, 5  mM cysteine, 0.05 % bovine serum albumin (BSA)]. Filter the {{homogenate}} through a double layer of nylon cloth (22  μm). Collect crude chloroplasts by centrifugation for 3  min at 1300 g. Resuspend the crude chloroplast pellet in wash medium [50  mM HEPES–KOH (pH 8.0), 330  mM sorbitol, 2  mM EDTA-Na 2 (pH 8.0)] by swirling the suspension. Load the resuspended chloroplast on a Percoll step cushion [PF Percoll (40 % or 85 %), 0.5  mM EDTA, 50  mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 330  mM sorbitol] and spin for 10  min at 3750  g in a swing-out rotor. Collect the intact chloroplasts from the 40 / 85 % Percoll interface using a pipet and add wash medium to dilute the Percoll. Spin the chloroplasts for 3  min at 1200  g. Remove the supernatant. The pellets are intact chloroplasts.|$|E

50|$|Tofu {{flavor is}} {{generally}} described as bland, however this taste is desired by customers in North America while a more beany-flavor is preferred in East Asia. The beany or bland taste is generated during the grinding and cooking unit process during production and either a “hot grind” or “cold grind” {{can be implemented}} to influence the taste in line with taste preference. The hot grind method reduces the beany flavor due to the inactivation of the lipoxygenase enzyme in soy protein that is known to generate off flavors to generate a tofu that is “bland” taste whereas the <b>cold</b> <b>grind</b> the enzyme is still present which produces the aldehyde, alcohol and ester volatile compounds that create to the beany notes of some tofu.|$|R
50|$|Turned, Ground, and Polished (TGP) is a {{classification}} of finishing processes {{often used for}} metal shafting. Turning (on a lathe) creates straight round bars without the strain induced by <b>cold</b> drawing, while <b>grinding</b> and polishing improves the surface finish and roundness for high dimensional accuracy. Extreme straightness is critical in high-speed applications to prevent vibration and reduce wear on bearings.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer-controlled}} apparatus processes {{batches of}} soybeans into {{one or more}} of a variety of food products, under conditions that can be chosen by the user and reproduced from batch to batch. Examples of products include soy milk, tofu, okara (an insoluble protein and fiber byproduct of soy milk), and whey. Most processing steps take place without intervention by the user. This apparatus was developed for use in research on processing of soy. It is also a prototype of other soy-processing apparatuses for research, industrial, and home use. Prior soy-processing equipment includes household devices that automatically produce soy milk but do not automatically produce tofu. The designs of prior soy-processing equipment require users to manually transfer intermediate solid soy products and to press them manually and, hence, under conditions that are not consistent from batch to batch. Prior designs do not afford choices of processing conditions: Users cannot use previously developed soy-processing equipment to investigate the effects of variations of techniques used to produce soy milk (e. g., <b>cold</b> <b>grinding,</b> hot grinding, and pre-cook blanching) and of such process parameters as cooking times and temperatures, grinding times, soaking times and temperatures, rinsing conditions, and sizes of particles generated by grinding. In contrast, the present apparatus is amenable to such investigations. The apparatus (see figure) includes a processing tank and a jacketed holding or coagulation tank. The processing tank can be capped by either of two different heads and can contain either of two different insertable mesh baskets. The first head includes a grinding blade and heating elements. The second head includes an automated press piston. One mesh basket, designated the okara basket, has oblong holes with a size equivalent to about 40 mesh [40 openings per inch (. 16 openings per centimeter) ]. The second mesh basket, designated the tofu basket, has holes of 70 mesh [70 openings per inch (. 28 openings per centimeter) ] and is used in conjunction with the press-piston head. Supporting equipment includes a soy-milk heat exchanger for maintaining selected coagulation temperatures, a filter system for separating okara from other particulate matter and from soy milk, two pumps, and various thermocouples, flowmeters, level indicators, pressure sensors, valves, tubes, and sample port...|$|E
2500|$|Aboriginal Australians used munyunpa as an {{infusion}} {{or in the}} form of ashes to treat backache and the leaves as {{an infusion}} or a decoction to treat sores, cuts, head colds, sore eyes or diarrhoea.

[...] Recent research has focused on the pharmacology of many eremophila species, including E. sturtii. Isolating compounds found in endemic species of plants is becoming prevalent in the search for means to assist in the fight against antibiotic resistant bacteria. This is a costly and time consuming practice. Research into E. sturtii has been focused on the development of an antibacterial layer that can be applied to medical implants to prevent infection.|$|R
60|$|His {{mother was}} glad, {{he seemed so}} pleased. And his lodging in Walthamstow was so dreary. But now there seemed to come a kind of fever into the young man's letters. He was {{unsettled}} by all the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to spin rather giddily on the quick current of the new life. His mother was anxious for him. She could feel him losing himself. He had danced and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with friends; and she knew he sat up afterwards in his <b>cold</b> bedroom <b>grinding</b> away at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office, and in the law {{as much as he}} could. He never sent his mother any money now. It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life. And she did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight corner, and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry. She still dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself behind him. Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious her heart was because of him.|$|R
40|$|Coffee is {{prepared}} by the extraction of a complex array of organic molecules from the roasted bean, which has been ground into fine particulates. The extraction depends on temperature, water chemistry and also the accessible surface area of the coffee. Here we investigate whether variations in the production processes of single origin coffee beans affects the particle size distribution upon grinding. We find that the particle size distribution is independent of the bean origin and processing method. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of bean temperature on particle size distribution, concluding that <b>grinding</b> <b>cold</b> results in a narrower particle size distribution, and reduced mean particle size. We anticipate these results will influence the production of coffee industrially, as well as contribute to how we store and use coffee daily...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. March 2009. Major. American Studies. Advisor: Elaine Tyler May. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 168 pages. American television {{became a national}} medium in the late 1940 s and, at its inception, foregrounded both {{the family and the}} American Dream as cornerstones of American culture and identity. An explicitly commercial medium, television used middle- and working-class family sitcoms to promote the commodities necessary for middle-class assimilation, but also to position working-class characters as stern object lessons in the battle to promote a "classless" American post-World War II idyll. Although 1970 s television ushered in a much more visible (and in some ways, sympathetic) image of American working-class life, the era's programming nevertheless continued to promote the American Dream through material accumulation and behavioral assimilation in its representations of socio-economic class. A new representation of class, however, emerged just as the <b>Cold</b> War was <b>grinding</b> to a halt. Beginning in the late 1980 s and continuing into the late 1990 s, working-class family sitcoms began to challenge the American Dream paradigm by presenting working-class cultures to be equally valid to the middle-class American culture that television had always promoted. This dissertation explores {{the rise and fall of}} this phenomenon, and how the politics, economics, history, and technological developments of the era facilitated this challenge to the hegemonic, middle-class norm...|$|R
