25|$|On March 23, 2006, Judge Lew {{concluded}} that, in the 1947-48 lawsuit (see above), Judge Young already {{addressed and}} rejected these arguments and that res judicata and <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> precluded re-litigation. Lew {{ruled that the}} Siegel heirs had effectively terminated Siegel's grant of the rights to Superboy. He also ruled that the protagonist of the television show Smallville was Superboy.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury, a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an [...] "implied acquittal" [...] via conviction of a lesser included offense. In addition, the {{government is}} barred by <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> from re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts.|$|E
500|$|In Mashpee, the First Circuit {{rejected}} the Mashpee's attempt {{to stay the}} litigation until the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) could adjudicate the tribe's petition for federal recognition. The court noted: [...] "The Department has never formally passed on the tribal status of the Mashpees or, {{so far as the}} record shows, any other group whose status was disputed. Therefore, the Department does not yet have prescribed procedures and has not been called on to develop special expertise in distinguishing tribes from other groups of Indians." [...] Yet, in 1978, the BIA had promulgated regulations establishing the criteria for federal recognition of tribes. In light of these new regulations, and their later use, the Second Circuit has held that the BIA retains [...] "primary jurisdiction" [...] over tribal recognition. In other words, Nonintercourse Act claims by unrecognized tribes must be stayed until the BIA is given a timely opportunity to adjudicate the tribe's petition for recognition. If the BIA rejects a tribe's petition, the tribe's Nonintercourse Act claim may be barred by <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury, a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an [...] "implied acquittal" [...] via conviction of a lesser included offense. In addition, the {{government is}} barred by <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> from re-litigating against the same defense, a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts.|$|E
2500|$|Extinguishment can be {{accomplished}} through res judicata. [...] Extinguishment may also be effected through <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> following a final decision by a Court of Claims. Even before a final ICC judgement, if a tribe claims compensation {{on the theory that}} its lands were extinguished, it cannot later attempt to claim valid title to those lands. An ICC judgement acts as a bar to future claims, and an ICC payment conclusively establishes extinguishment (although, for timing purposes, the ICC has not jurisdiction to extinguish). Even though ICCA settlements are binding, the scope of the settlement may be up for debate. The United States is bound by prior determinations as well.|$|E
2500|$|Williamson County's [...] "state procedures" [...] {{ripeness}} requirement {{has proven}} to be highly controversial. It has been complained that the Court decided this question without adequate briefing, the requirement of pursuing compensation from the state is not logically inherent in the text of the Fifth Amendment, the rule derives from procedural due process considerations that are inapplicable to takings claims, and that principles of res judicata and <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> may bar a plaintiff's claim from federal court after complying with Williamson County's procedures to [...] "ripen" [...] the claim. The latter problem became known as the [...] "Williamson Trap" [...] among attorneys for aggrieved property owners, although it was defended as a straightforward application of principles of preclusion by government advocates. However, in an earlier landmark takings case, Euclid v. Ambler (1926), the Court held it unnecessary to seek a local permit before challenging a land-use regulation as unconstitutional.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{applied only}} {{where there was}} mutuality of parties, meaning that both the party seeking to employ <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> and the party against whom <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> is sought were parties to the prior action.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of mutuality, courts are more {{hesitant}} to apply <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> in an offensive setting than in a defensive one. In other words, courts are more hesitant to apply <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> to a defendant from a previous action if the defendant is sued by a new plaintiff for the same issue.|$|E

5000|$|Federal {{courts have}} {{traditionally}} {{adhered to the}} related doctrines of res judicata (claim preclusion) and <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> (issue preclusion). Under RJ, a final judgment {{on the merits of}} an action precludes the parties [...] [...] [...] from re-litigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action. Under <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel,</b> once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision may preclude re-litigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first cause. As this court and other courts have often recognised, res judicata and <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> relieve parties of the costs and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., the {{doctrine}} of offensive non-mutual <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> does not extend to the U.S. government; it is limited to private litigants.|$|E

5000|$|More specifically, {{as stated}} in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970): [...] "...when an issue of {{ultimate}} fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit." [...] Res judicata is a term of general application. Underneath that conceptual umbrella {{is the concept of}} <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel.</b> As applied to double jeopardy, the court will use <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> as its basis for forming an opinion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> cases raise {{constitutional}} {{due process}} problems, {{particularly when it}} is applied to a party that {{did not participate in}} the original suit. Due process mandates that <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> not be applied to a party that has not litigated the issue in dispute, unless that party is in legal privity to a party that litigated it. In other words, every disputant is entitled to a day in court and cannot ordinarily be bound by the negative result of another disputant's suit, even if that other disputant had exactly the same legal and factual arguments.|$|E
50|$|Res judicata {{includes}} two related concepts: claim preclusion and issue preclusion (also called <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> or issue estoppel), though sometimes res judicata is used more narrowly to mean only claim preclusion.|$|E
5000|$|... re-litigating {{against the}} same defense a fact {{necessarily}} {{found by the}} jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts. In such a situation, the government is barred by <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> is an {{efficiency}} rule that {{is meant to}} save judicial resources by avoiding the relitigation of issues of fact {{that have already been}} litigated. The rule is also intended to protect defendants from the inequity of having to defend the same issue repeatedly.|$|E
5000|$|The Third Circuit {{said that}} it found <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{inapplicable}} because the judgment in the Government was not dependent upon the determination that anticompetitive injury to the dealers such as the plaintiffs was essential to the prior determination that Dentsply had committed an antitrust violation. The Government case requests a determination whether Dentsply's conduct was anticompetitive. That had two issues: [...] "first, whether Dentsply possessed monopoly power; and second, whether Dentsply used that power to edge out competition." [...] The ruling made requires only a finding that Dentsply's manufacturer competitors was injured. There was no [...] "need to conclude that any upstream purchasers, such as Hess was threatened with injury." [...] That might have happened, {{but that does not}} mean that it was essential to the holding. Therefore, there was no <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> and therefore, further, [...] "Dentsply should not be precluded from defending itself against the plaintiffs' claim for injunctive relief." [...] Aside from arguing <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel,</b> the plaintiffs made no showing of antitrust injury. Furthermore, since the Government case resulted in an injunction that already prohibited Dentsply from pursuing the very conduct that gave rise to the Plaintiffs' claim, the plaintiffs did not need a duplicative injunction. The Third Circuit therefore affirmed the district court's denial of the plaintiffs' summary judgment motion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{does not}} prevent an appeal of a decision, or a party from asking the judge for re-argument or a revised decision. In federal court, {{judgments}} on appeal are given preclusive effect. However, if the decision is vacated, the preclusive effect of the judgment fails.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{is closely}} related to the concept of claim preclusion, which {{prevents}} parties relitigating the same cause of action after it has been decided by a judge or jury. Res judicata (literally - that which has been decided) can be used as the term for both concepts, or purely as a synonym for claim preclusion. Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. Under the doctrine of <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel,</b> on the other hand, the second action is upon a different cause of action and the judgment in the prior suit precludes relitigation of issues litigated and necessary to the outcome of the first action.|$|E
5000|$|However, the Supreme Court {{said that}} <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> in {{determinations}} of tax liability [...] "must {{be confined to}} situations where the matter raised in the second suit is identical in all respects with that decided in the first proceeding and where the controlling facts and applicable legal rules remain unchanged." ...|$|E
50|$|On March 23, 2006, Judge Lew {{concluded}} that, in the 1947-48 lawsuit (see above), Judge Young already {{addressed and}} rejected these arguments and that res judicata and <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> precluded re-litigation. Lew {{ruled that the}} Siegel heirs had effectively terminated Siegel's grant of the rights to Superboy. He also ruled that the protagonist of the television show Smallville was Superboy.|$|E
5000|$|Due process {{concerns}} {{also can}} arise {{even when a}} party did have a day in court to dispute an issue. For example, a defendant may have not effectively litigated an issue decided against the defendant in an earlier suit because the damages were too small, {{so it may be}} unjust to bar the defendant from relitigating the issue in a trial for much greater damages. As another example, suppose that a defendant did effectively litigate an issue to a favorable conclusion in nine cases, but to an unfavorable result in a tenth case. In this situation, note that the defendant did not have the opportunity to use the nine judgments in its favor as <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> against subsequent plaintiffs, because that would violate their right to a day in court. To allow a subsequent plaintiff to use the tenth, negative judgment as <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> against the defendant may seem unjust. [...] See the leading USA Supreme Court case Parklane Hosiery Co, Inc. v. Shore.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> may {{be avoided}} {{as a defense}} if the {{claimant}} {{did not have a}} full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue decided by a state court, which means he may file suit in federal court to challenge the adequacy of state procedures. Note that in this case the plaintiff's suit would be against the state, not against the other party from the prior lawsuit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{defendants}} {{contended that}} [...] "the court invoked non-mutual <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> and precluded Polytech from presenting its permissible repair and first sale defenses {{on the basis}} of court proceedings to which Polytech was not a party." [...] However, this argument was waived because it was not raised at the right time during the defendants' 50(a) motion for judgement {{as a matter of law}} and 50(b) post-trial motion.|$|E
5000|$|Res judicata {{may be used}} as {{a defense}} in a second suit which {{involves}} the same claim as a prior suit, and is conclusive on all matters which were litigated as well as all matters which could have been litigated in the prior suit. In <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> the judgment is conclusive only regarding the issues which were litigated. In order for CE to apply, four factors must be met: ...|$|E
5000|$|But {{note that}} the use of {{offensive}} non-mutual <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> may work against the goal of judicial economy. The offensive use encourages potential plaintiffs to sit and [...] "test the waters" [...] to see the strength of the defendant's case. If the defendant's case is weak, there is great incentive for new parties to sue and claim that the defendant is estopped based on the prior adverse ruling.|$|E
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of direct estoppel prevents {{a party to}} a litigation from relitigating an issue that was decided against that party in that litigation, under certain circumstances. Specifically, direct estoppel applies where the issue was decided {{as part of a}} larger claim which was finally decided, and stops the issue from being redecided in another claim of the same lawsuit. Contrast <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel,</b> which stops a claim from being redecided in another lawsuit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> (CE), {{known in}} modern {{terminology}} as issue preclusion, {{is a common}} law estoppel doctrine that prevents a person from relitigating an issue. One summary is that, [...] "once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision ... precludes relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving {{a party to the}} first case". The rationale behind issue preclusion is the prevention of legal harassment and the prevention of abuse of judicial resources.|$|E
50|$|Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591 (1948), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of the United States in 1948 in which the Court {{outlined}} the scope of <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> or estoppel by judgment in determinations of federal tax liability. This was important because a single controversial circumstance may have a bearing on income tax liability for several years. Res judicata, {{as part of the}} doctrine of judicial finality, protects a taxpayer's tax liability for a given year once the taxpayer wins a judgment in court. The judgment is controlling not only controlling with regard to the issues litigated but also with any issues that could have been raised if they would have affected the determination of tax liability for the year. However, of course, a single controversial circumstance may have a bearing on income tax liability for several years, and if a judgment fixes liability for one of the years, res judiciary forecloses the reopening of only that year's liability. But the related doctrine of <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> prevents relitigation of issues that were in fact raised and decided in the earlier litigation, even when they arise in a new cause of action, such as a dispute as to liability for a later year.|$|E
50|$|As {{shown by}} the defence in the Court of Appeals Benkahla was put in double jeopardy, and left the {{question}} whether the second trial broke the principle of <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel.</b> For example, if Benkahla {{was found not guilty}} of going to military camps in the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, how could it have been said that he denied attending these camps? There was no new evidence that came out after the first trial. And so he had not been found guilty in the first trial on the same evidence that was used to try to get him in the second.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} a second suit to be {{dismissed}} on a motion of res judicata in a civilian jurisdiction, the trial must be identical to the first trial in the following manner: (1) identical parties, (2) identical theories of recovery, and (3) identical demands in both trials. In other words, the issue preclusion or <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> found in the common law doctrine of res judicata is not present in the civilian doctrine. In addition if all else is equal between the two cases, minus the relief sought, {{there will be no}} dismissal based on res judicata in a civil law jurisdiction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{government}} is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury, a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an [...] "implied acquittal" [...] via conviction of a lesser included offense. In addition, the {{government is}} barred by <b>collateral</b> <b>estoppel</b> from re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts.|$|E
