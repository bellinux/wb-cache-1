50|$|A <b>compass</b> <b>saw</b> {{is a type}} of saw {{used for}} making curved cuts known as compasses, {{particularly}} in confined spaces where a larger saw would not fit.|$|E
50|$|The {{blade of}} a <b>compass</b> <b>saw</b> may be fixed or retractable, and are {{typically}} interchangeable. Partially retracting the blade can prevent flexing and breaking when cutting harder materials.|$|E
50|$|In carpentry, architecture, and shipbuilding, {{a compass}} is a curve (or bent) {{circular}} form. A compass plane is {{a plane that}} is convex, length-ways, on the underside, for smoothing the concave faces of curved woodwork. A <b>compass</b> <b>saw</b> is a narrow-bladed saw that cuts a curve. A compass timber is a curved (or crooked) timber, sometimes used in shipbuilding. A compass brick is a curved brick. A compass wall is a curved wall. A compass window is a circular bay window (or oriel window).|$|E
50|$|<b>Compass</b> <b>saws</b> {{typically}} {{feature a}} larger, coarser blade, and {{are designed to}} cut though tougher materials.|$|R
50|$|Compared with drywall <b>saws,</b> <b>compass</b> <b>saws</b> {{typically}} {{have a longer}} blade - at 150 to 300 mm - and more teeth per inch.|$|R
50|$|<b>Compass</b> <b>saws</b> are {{suitable}} for cutting softer woods, plastic, drywall, and non-ferrous metals. The pointed tip of the blade {{can be used to}} penetrate softer materials without the need for a pilot hole.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{with other}} saws {{designed}} for cutting curves, such as coping or fretsaws, <b>compass</b> <b>saws</b> {{have a larger}} blade and fewer teeth per inch. This allows them to cut more quickly, and to cut through thicker materials, but leaves a rougher finish.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Compass</b> <b>saws</b> have a narrow, tapered blade usually {{ending in}} a sharp point, {{typically}} with eight to ten teeth per inch, but up to twenty teeth per inch for harder materials and as few as five teeth per inch for softer materials. They have a curved, light [...] "pistol grip" [...] handle, designed for work in confined spaces and overhead.|$|R
60|$|Sam had {{interested}} {{himself in}} steering {{from the start}} and knew {{how to handle a}} wheel moderately well. He looked at the <b>compass</b> and <b>saw</b> that they were running almost due east, varying a little to the southward. He untied the wheel and kept to the course with but little trouble.|$|R
50|$|Astrocompasses only became useful {{following}} {{the invention of}} the marine chronometer, without which it is almost useless for navigation. Even then, they saw only limited use, with first magnetic compasses and then gyrocompasses being preferred in almost all cases. Polar exploration was one of the fields in which the astrocompass saw the most use, for the reasons described above. They have also been used throughout history in other climes to check the accuracy of other forms of <b>compasses.</b> They <b>saw</b> use, for example, in the North African Campaign of World War 2.|$|R
60|$|But {{the nearest}} big town {{was a long}} way off, and it took them more than a day to reach it. In the evening they came to a wood, and they made up their minds to go no further, but to spend the night there. The donkey and the {{greyhound}} lay down under a big tree, and the cat and the cock got up into the branches, the cock flying right up to the topmost twig, where he thought he would be safe from all danger. Before he went to sleep he looked round the four points of the <b>compass,</b> and <b>saw</b> a little spark burning in the distance. He called out to his companions that he was sure there must be a house not far off, for he could see a light shining.|$|R
5000|$|In {{tropical}} areas, {{a survival}} kit may have mosquito head netting, additional insect repellent, anti-fungal cream, a machete, water purification tablets, foot powder, matches, a flint strike, a <b>compass,</b> a wire <b>saw,</b> a space blanket, medical equipment (gauze pads, elastic gauze bandage, antiseptic creams, anti-malaria tablets, anti-infection tablets, bandages, etc.), salt tablets, a fishing kit, snare wire, extra socks, a candle, a signal mirror, flares, a sewing kit, safety pins, tinder, tape, a whistle, and rations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fine adventures, {{if we can}} but <b>compass</b> them. You <b>saw</b> {{that lady}} with the carrot-headed fellow?--I saw that you saw. Well, if you will believe me, that man has no more gentle blood than I have,--has no more right {{to sit on the}} settle than I. He is a No-man's son, a Pict from Galloway, who came down with a pirate crew and has made himself the master of this drunken old Prince, and the darling of all his housecarles, and now will needs be his {{son-in-law}} whether he will or not." ...|$|R
