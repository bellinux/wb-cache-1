25|$|The {{circuit and}} Grand Prix were first {{proposed}} {{in the middle of}} 2010. The circuit was the first in the United States to be purpose-built for Formula One. The layout was conceived by promoter Tavo Hellmund and 1993 Motorcycle World Champion Kevin Schwantz with the assistance of German architect and <b>circuit</b> <b>designer</b> Hermann Tilke, who has also designed the Sepang, Shanghai, Yas Marina, Istanbul, Bahrain, Yeongam, and Buddh circuits, as well as the reprofiling of the Hockenheimring and Fuji Speedway. The circuit has FIA Grade 1 license.|$|E
25|$|Rv {{provides}} a bias current {{for both the}} Zener diode and the transistor. The current in the diode is minimum when the load current is maximum. The <b>circuit</b> <b>designer</b> must choose a minimum voltage that can be tolerated across Rv, bearing {{in mind that the}} higher this voltage requirement is, the higher the required input voltage, Uin, and hence the lower the efficiency of the regulator. On the other hand, lower values of Rv lead to higher power dissipation in the diode and to inferior regulator characteristics.|$|E
50|$|As well {{as these}} problems, some logic {{elements}} can enter metastable states, which create further problems for <b>circuit</b> <b>designers.</b>|$|R

500|$|Following {{increased}} hostilities between North Korea and South Korea in {{the wake}} of the sinking of the South Korean corvette [...] in March 2010, Formula One Group chief executive Bernie Ecclestone had said the race would be in jeopardy if political tensions continued to escalate, and it would be abandoned if the North Korean army crossed the border. The revival of the French Grand Prix at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours was mooted as an alternative if the Korean Grand Prix was cancelled. Although hostilities between the two nations eventually relaxed, the race was further threatened by delayed construction. On 27 September 2010, Ecclestone said he doubted the circuit would be ready despite the tarmac having been laid. A final inspection of the circuit took place on 11 October; Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety delegate Charlie Whiting certified that the circuit was ready on 12 October. The top layer of the track was completed ten days before the race; there was not enough time for the elements to remove the oils and bitumen chemicals in the tarmac. <b>Circuit</b> <b>designer</b> Hermann Tilke said the surface would be slippery, making the race challenging for drivers and exciting for fans.|$|E
500|$|In May 2010, it was {{announced}} that Austin, Texas would host the return of the United States Grand Prix, the first since Indianapolis in 2007. Known as the Circuit of the Americas, the venue will be a brand-new, purpose-built permanent circuit designed by event promoter Tavo Hellmund and 1993 Grand Prix Motorcycle World Champion Kevin Schwantz with the assistance of German architect and <b>circuit</b> <b>designer</b> Hermann Tilke. In November 2011, Bernie Ecclestone expressed [...] "minor" [...] doubt over the race going ahead after what he described as [...] "disagreements inside the [...] company" [...] and gave the circuit owners and race organisers a deadline of 7 December – coinciding with the meeting of the FIA World Motorsports Council and the release of the final 2012 calendar – to sort out their differences or else risk losing the event entirely. The final calendar included the race, with Ecclestone confirming that a new arrangement had been made, and that the event organisers had paid their circuit sanctioning fees for 2012. The race was originally scheduled to be held in June, but was moved back to become the penultimate event of the season in response to concerns over the heat of the Texas summer and its effects on teams, drivers and spectators, and the failure of race organisers to meet a key deadline for the race sanctioning fees.|$|E

2500|$|Building 20 was {{the home}} of [...] the Tech Model Railroad Club, where many aspects of what later became the hacker culture developed. [...] Around 1973, the MIT Electronic Research Society (MITERS) was founded there, as an early student-run hackerspace. [...] Building 20 also housed {{one of the first}} {{anechoic}} chambers, where research was performed by acoustics pioneer Leo Beranek. [...] Professor Amar Bose did his early research on loudspeakers here, eventually leading to the founding of Bose Corporation. Prolific analog <b>circuit</b> <b>designer</b> and technical writer Jim Williams had an electronics lab here for a decade, before moving on to National Semiconductor and then Linear Technology.

40|$|Abstract — Rapid {{decrease}} in feature sizes has increasingly accentuated {{the importance of}} matching between transistors. Deep sub-micron designs will further emphasize the {{need to focus on}} the effects of mismatch. Furthermore, increased efforts on high level analog device modeling will necessitate accompanying mismatch simulation and measurement methods. The deep sub-micron era forces <b>circuit</b> <b>designers</b> {{to learn more about the}} physics and the technology of transistors. This study introduces a method and assists <b>circuit</b> <b>designers</b> in including this method in their traditional design flow of circuits. By proposing a solution to the problem of building a modeling bridge between transistor mismatch and circuit response to it, we hope to enable designers to incorporate low level mismatch information in their higher level design.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for concurrently optimizing an IC fabrication process {{and a standard}} cell library {{in order to maximize}} overall yield. The approach uses the Concurrent Subspace Optimization (CSSO) algorithm, which has been developed for general coupled, multidisciplinary optimization problems. An example is provided showing the application of the algorithm to optimizing a mixed analog-digital library on a CMOS process. 1 Introduction In order to develop high-performance, integrated systems, IC designers are reliant upon having highperformance cell libraries. The development, characterization, and optimization of cell libraries is itself a very complex task, requiring the coordinated efforts of <b>circuit</b> <b>designers</b> and fabrication process engineers. While <b>circuit</b> <b>designers</b> may optimize the performance of individual cells by adjusting device geometries, they do so under the constraints of a fixed fabrication process.
