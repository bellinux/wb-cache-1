60|$|On the {{steeply sloping}} {{sides of the}} road the young grass was {{springing}} up everywhere among the old rubbish of dead grass and leaves and sticks and stems. More conspicuous than the grass blades, green as verdigris, were the arrow-shaped leaves of the arum or <b>cuckoo-pint.</b> But there were no flowers yet except the wild strawberry, and these so few and small that only the eager eyes of the little children, seeking for spring, might find them.|$|E
60|$|In the {{restriction}} of bright colour to those edible fruits the eating {{of which is}} beneficial to the plant, we see the undoubted result of natural selection; {{and this is the}} more evident when we find that the colour never appears till the fruit is ripe--that is, till the seeds within it are fully matured and in the best state for germination. Some brilliantly coloured fruits are poisonous, as in our bitter-sweet (Solanum dulcamara), <b>cuckoo-pint</b> (Arum) and the West Indian manchineel. Many of these are, no doubt, eaten by animals to whom they are harmless; and {{it has been suggested that}} even if some animals are poisoned by them the plant is benefited, since it not only gets dispersed, but finds, in the decaying body of its victim, a rich manure heap.[141] The particular colours of fruits are not, so far as we know, of any use to them other than as regards conspicuousness, hence a tendency to any decided colour has been preserved and accumulated as serving to render the fruit easily visible among its surroundings of leaves or herbage. Out of 134 fruit-bearing plants in Mongredien's Trees and Shrubs, and Hooker's British Flora, the fruits of no less than sixty-eight, or rather more than half, are red, forty-five are black, fourteen yellow, and seven white. The great prevalence of red fruits is almost certainly due to their greater conspicuousness having favoured their dispersal, though it may also have arisen in part from the chemical changes of chlorophyll during ripening and decay producing red tints as in many fading leaves. Yet the comparative scarcity of yellow in fruits, while it is the most common tint of fading leaves, is against this supposition.|$|E

5000|$|In 1440, {{the nuns}} of [...] Syon Abbey in England used {{the roots of}} the <b>cuckoo-pint</b> flower to make starch for altar cloths and other church linens. In fact, [...] communion linen could only be made in this way.|$|E
5000|$|A. maculatum is {{also known}} as cuckoo pint or <b>cuckoo-pint</b> in the British Isles and is named thus in Nicholas Culpepers' famous 17th-century herbal. This is a name it shares with Arum italicum (Italian lords-and-ladies) - the other native British Arum. [...] "Pint" [...] is a {{shortening}} of the word [...] "pintle", meaning penis, derived from the shape of the spadix. The euphemistic shortening has been traced to Turner in 1551.|$|E
50|$|The {{root of the}} <b>cuckoo-pint,</b> when roasted well, is edible {{and when}} ground was once traded {{under the name of}} Portland sago. It was used like salep (orchid flour) to make saloop â€” a drink popular before the {{introduction}} of tea or coffee. It was also used as a substitute for arrowroot. If prepared incorrectly, it can be highly toxic, so should be prepared with due diligence and caution.|$|E
5000|$|Arum maculatum is {{a common}} {{woodland}} plant species of the Araceae family. It is widespread across most of Europe, as well as Turkey and the Caucasus. It is known by an abundance of common names including snakeshead, adder's root, arum, wild arum, arum lily, lords-and-ladies, devils and angels, cows and bulls, <b>cuckoo-pint,</b> Adam and Eve, bobbins, naked girls, naked boys, starch-root, wake robin, friar's cowl, sonsie-give-us-your-hand, jack in the pulpit and cheese and toast. The name [...] "lords-and-ladies" [...] and other gender-related names refer to the plant's likeness to male and female genitalia symbolising copulation.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{mitochondrial}} ATPase {{has been}} chloroform-solubilized and purified by gel filtration from spadices of <b>cuckoo-pint</b> (Arum maculatum). The subunit composition of purified plant and rat liver ATPase were compared by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The delta- and epsilon-subunits {{of the plant}} enzyme are larger than their supposed rat liver counterparts and, as such, A. maculatum mitochondrial ATPase shows structural homologies with the enzyme from Escherichia coli [Futai, Sternweis & Heppel (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 71, 2725 - 2729] rather than with the rat liver enzyme...|$|E
40|$|The {{subcellular}} {{location of}} the two porphyrin-synthesis enzymes 5 -aminolaevulinate dehydratase (ALAD) and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) was investigated in Pisum sativum (pea) leaves and spadices of Arum (<b>cuckoo-pint).</b> Throughout the tissue-fractionation procedures {{the distribution of the}} two enzymes paralleled that of the plastid marker enzyme (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase), even in Arum, a tissue where the synthesis of non-plastid haem is predominant. The distribution of cytosolic marker enzyme (lactate dehydrogenase) was significantly different from that of ALAD and PBGD and, although purified mitochondria from both species had some residual activity, this was always less than contaminating plastid marker enzyme. The results suggest that ALAD and PBGD are exclusively plastid enzymes. The significance of this for the role of plastids in cellular porphyrin synthesis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{subcellular}} {{location of}} two enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for protoporphyrin IX, coproporphyrinogen (coprogen) oxidase (EC 1. 3. 3. 3) and protoporphyrinogen (protogen) oxidase (EC 1. 3. 3. 4) {{has been investigated}} in etiolated pea (Pisum sativum) leaves and spadices of <b>cuckoo-pint</b> (Arum maculatum). Plant tissue homogenized in isotonic buffer was subjected to subcellular fractionation to prepare mitochondria and plastids essentially free of contamination by other cellular organelles, as determined by marker enzymes. Protogen oxidase activity measured fluorimetrically was reproducibly found in both mitochondria and etioplasts. In contrast, coprogen oxidase could be detected only in etioplasts, using either a coupled fluorimetric assay or a sensitive radiochemical method. The implications of these results for the synthesis of mitochondrial haem in plants is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{properties of}} <b>cuckoo-pint</b> (Arum maculatum) mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase have been analysed. The pH profile, effect of inhibitors, cold-stability and substrate specificity {{are characteristic of}} mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatases, although a high guanosine triphosphatase activity {{does appear to be}} restricted to plant mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatases. The kinetic properties of nucleoside 5 '-triphosphate hydrolysis by membrane-bound and soluble enzymes have been studied by means of double-reciprocal plots. These plots were linear {{in the absence of an}} activating anion, which may indicate that the catalytic and/or regulatory mechanism of Arum maculatum adenosine triphosphatase is different from that of other enzyme preparations. It is suggested that the differences in subunit composition of plant and mammalian adenosine triphosphatases reported previously [Dunn, Slabas & Moore (1985) Biochem. J. 225, 821 - 824] are structurally, rather than functionally, significant...|$|E
40|$|The {{external}} NADH dehydrogenase {{has been}} purified from Arum maculatum (<b>cuckoo-pint)</b> mitochondria by phosphate washing, extraction with deoxycholate, ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis shows, when the gel is silver-stained, that the purified enzyme contains two major bands of Mr 78 000 and 65 000 and a minor one of Mr about 76 000. It {{is not possible}} at present to determine which of these, or which combination, constitutes the dehydrogenase. The enzyme contains non-covalently bound FAD and {{a small amount of}} FMN. Since the conditions of purification lead to considerable loss of flavin and possibly iron-sulphur centres, {{it is not possible to}} decide with certainty whether the enzyme is a flavo- or ferroflavo-protein. The enzyme has been distinguished from the other NADH dehydrogenases on the basis of its substrate specificity, its capability of reducing electron acceptors such as ubiquinone- 1 and 2, 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol and its sensitivity towards Ca 2 +, EGTA and dicoumarol...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of pyrophosphate:fructose- 6 -phosphate 1 -phosphotransferase [PFK (PPi); EC 2. 7. 1. 90] in extracts of the storage tissues of leek (Allium porrum), beetroot (Beta vulgaris) and roots of darnel (Lolium temulentum) exceeded 0. 15 mumol/min per g fresh wt. As net flux from fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate to fructose 6 -phosphate in these tissues is unlikely, {{it is suggested}} that PFK (PPi) does not contribute to gluconeogenesis or starch synthesis. The maximum catalytic activities of PFK (PPi) in apex, stele and cortex of the root of pea (Pisum sativum) and in the developing and the thermogenic club of the spadix of <b>cuckoo-pint</b> (Arum maculatum) were measured and compared with those of phosphofructokinase, and to estimates of the rates of carbohydrate oxidation. PPi and fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate in Arum clubs were measured. The above measurements are consistent with a glycolytic role for PFK (PPi) in tissues where there is marked biosynthesis, but not in the thermogenic club of Arum. The possibility that PFK (PPi) is a means of synthesizing pyrophosphate is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Cations {{caused a}} {{decrease}} in the apparent Km and an increase in the Vmax. for the oxidation of exogenous NADH by both Jerusalem-artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and Arum maculatum (<b>cuckoo-pint)</b> mitochondria prepared and suspended in a low-cation medium (approximately or equal to 1 mM-K+). In Arum mitochondria the addition of cations caused a much greater stimulation of the oxidation of NAD(P) H via the cytochrome oxidase pathway than via the alternative, antimycin-insensitive, pathway. This shows that cations affected a rate-limiting step in the electron-transport chain at or beyond ubiquinone, the branch-point of electron transport in plant mitochondria. The effects were only dependent on the valency of the cation (efficiency C 3 + greater than C 2 + greater than C+) and not on its chemical nature, which is consistent with the theory of the diffuse layer. The results are interpreted to show that the screening of fixed negative membrane changes on lipids and protein complexes causes a conformational change in the mitochondrial inner membrane, leading to a change in a rate-limiting step of NAD(P) H oxidation. More specifically, it is proposed that screening removes electrostatic restrictions on lateral diffusion and thus accelerates diffusion-limited steps in electron transport...|$|E
40|$|X-band electron-paramagnetic-resonance {{spectroscopy}} at 4. 2 [...] 77 K {{combined with}} measurements of oxidation-reduction potential {{was used to}} identify iron [...] sulphur centres in Arum maculatum (<b>cuckoo-pint)</b> mitochondria. In the oxidized state a signal with a derivative maximum at g = 2. 02 was assigned to succinate dehydrogenase centre S- 3. Unreduced particles showed additional signals at g = 2. 04 and 1. 98 (at 9. 2 GHz), which {{may be due to}} a spin-spin interaction. In the reduced state a prominent signal at g = 1. 93 and 2. 02 was resolved into at least three components that could be assigned to centres S- 1 and S- 2 of succinate dehydrogenase (midpoint potentials - 7 and - 240 mV respectively at pH 7. 2) and a small amount of centre N- 1 b (e'o= - 240 mV) of NADH-ubiquinone reductase. In addition, changes in line shape around - 10 mV indicated the presence of a fourth component in this signal. The latter was more readily reduced by NADH than by succinate, suggesting that it might be associated with the external NADH dehydrogenase. The iron-sulphur centres of NADH-ubiquinone reductase were present in an unusually low concentration, indicating that the alternative, non-phosphorylating, NADH dehydrogenase containing a low number of iron-sulphur centres may be responsible for most of the high rate of oxidation of NADH...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{solubilization}} of cyanide- and antimycin-insensitive duroquinol oxidase {{activity from}} <b>cuckoo-pint</b> (Arum maculatum) mitochondria was achieved using taurocholate. Inhibitor-sensitivities and water-forming DQH 2 (tetramethyl-p-hydroquinone, reduced form) : O 2 stoichiometry {{were the same}} for the alternative oxidase of intact Arum mitochondria. Cyanide-insensitive oxidation of DQH 2 by intact and solubilized mitochondria was stimulated by up to four-fold by high concentrations of anions high in the Hofmeister series, such as phosphate, sulphate or citrate. Optimal (0. 7 M) sodium citrate increased Vmax. for DQH 2 oxidation by the solubilized preparation from 450 to 2400 nmol of O 2 X min- 1 X mg of protein- 1 and decreased the apparent Km for DQH 2 from 0. 53 to 0. 38 mM. Inhibition of solubilized DQH 2 oxidase activity by CLAM (m-chlorobenzhydroxamic acid) and SHAM (salicylhydroxamic acid) was mixed competitive/non-competitive, with apparent inhibition constants for CLAM of 25 microM (Ki) and 81 microM (KI) and for SHAM of 53 microM (Ki) and 490 microM (KI). Propyl gallate and UHDBT were non-competitive inhibitors with respect to DQH 2 (apparent Ki = 0. 3 microM and 12 nM respectively). Low concentrations of C 18 fatty acids selectively inhibited cyanide-insensitive oxidation by intact and solubilized mitochondria, and inhibition was reversed by 1 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Inhibition was competitive with DQH 2, suggesting that fatty acids interfere reversably with the binding of DQH 2 to the oxidase. These results tend to support the view that quinol oxidation by the alternative pathway of Arum maculatum mitochondria is catalysed by a quinol oxidase protein, rather than by a non-enzymic mechanism involving fatty acid peroxidative reaction.
