25|$|In February 1940 at Wright Field, the Army Air Corps {{established}} the Technical Data Branch (Technical Data Section in July 1941, Technical Data Laboratory in 1942). After Air Corps Ferrying Command was established on 29 May 1941, on 21 June an installation {{point of the}} command opened at Patterson Field. The Flight Test Training unit of Air Technical Command was established at Wright Field on 9 September 1944 (moved to Patterson Field in 1946, Edwards AFB on 4 February 1951). Two densely populated housing and service areas across Highway 444, Wood City and Skyway Park, were geographically separated from the central core of Patterson Field and developed almost self-sufficient <b>community</b> <b>status.</b> (Wood City was acquired in 1924 {{as part of the}} original donation of land to the government but was used primarily as just a radio range until World War II. Skyway Park was acquired in 1943.) They supported the vast numbers of recruits who enlisted and were trained at the two fields as well as thousands of civilian laborers, especially single women recruited to work at the depot. Skyway Park was demolished after the war. Wood City was eventually transformed into Kittyhawk Center, the base's modern commercial and recreation center.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about the}} association between individual socio-economic <b>status,</b> <b>community</b> socio-economic <b>status</b> and health. The current study examines individual data from a case-control study of stroke (n= 3489) conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. The study sought to identify whether individual socio-economic status (as measured by income from lifetime occupation) and <b>community</b> socio-economic <b>status</b> (measured {{in a number of}} ways) predicts the onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for individual risk factors (e. g., smoking, obesity and hypertension). Logistic regression results show that individual socio-economic status and all of the <b>community</b> socio-economic <b>status</b> measures predict the onset of stroke before controlling for individual risk factors. However, there is a high correlation between the various measures of <b>community</b> socio-economic <b>status.</b> Stepwise regression results suggest that average household income is the measure of community-level socio-economic status with the greatest predictive power. The results suggest that individual income and average household income are significant predictors of onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for behavioural and medical risk factors. Logistic regression analysis of the pathway suggests that individual income is a significant predictor of smoking and obesity, and that <b>community</b> socio-economic <b>status</b> is a significant predictor of heart disease, heavy drinking, diabetes, smoking and obesity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the relationships among}} functional health status measures (SF- 12 physical and mental components summary scores), traditional measures of <b>community</b> health <b>status,</b> and social determinants of health among respondents to <b>community</b> health <b>status</b> surveys conducted in nine different communities. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data collected as part of comprehensive <b>community</b> health <b>status</b> assessments conducted in each of nine communities (in seven states) between 1992 and 1997. The purpose of each assessment was to gather data to plan and evaluate population health improvement initiatives. STUDY DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION: This is an opportunistic study drawing on the universe of community health survey data collected by the authors to support local health improvement initiatives. Both community-level {{as well as an}} aggregate of individual-level measures are used in the analysis. Within each locality, survey respondents were randomly selected using a telephone-facilitated, mailed survey methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The key variables reported here are functional health status measures (SF- 12) and social determinants of health variables. SF- 12 physical and mental component scales correlated with two of four traditional measures of <b>community</b> health <b>status.</b> At the aggregate level of analysis, significant relationships were found for seven of nine social determinants of health measures when compared with SF- 12 component summary scores. Relationships between social determinants measures and PCS- 12 and MCS- 12 scores suggest both application possibilities and the need for additional analysis {{in order to understand the}} nature of those relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Physical and mental health functioning summary scores as measured by the SF- 12 are useful in describing overall <b>community</b> health <b>status</b> when compared with traditional measures such as total deaths, age-adjusted mortality, or physician to population ratio. The SF- 12 can also be used to measure the relationship between physical and mental health functioning (as proxies for <b>community</b> health <b>status)</b> and the social determinants of health. This analysis can help to refine our understanding of how social determinants and health status interact in a community or population as a precursor to the development of models of community or population health...|$|R
