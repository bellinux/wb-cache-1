40|$|This paper {{presents}} the macrostructure of Chinese, English <b>and</b> Polish school <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> university diplomas (Hughes, Varó 2002) in {{the aspect of}} translation. The language and vocabulary used in Chinese, Polish <b>and</b> English <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> diplomas are researched into. The conclusions are that the historically conditioned differences in legal realities in China, Taiwan, Poland (the impact of the partitions and the Communist regime) and the English-speaking countries affect the structure and contents of such <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> diplomas. Thus, Polish <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> diplomas are more similar to British and American ones. However, <b>certificates</b> <b>and</b> diplomas executed in China have different macrostructure (they are in a form of a book). As a consequence, some legal terms and expressions which appear in them do not occur in Polish and English...|$|R
