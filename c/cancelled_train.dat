50|$|In North Carolina, the {{hurricane}} produced winds {{of up to}} 90 mph in Manteo. Described {{as one of the}} worst hurricanes in record in Hatteras, the storm resulted in $25,000 in damage (1936 USD, $360,000 2006 USD) to roads and bridges and $30,000 in damage (1936 USD, $440,000 2006 USD) to buildings and piers. Very high tides were reported along the Outer Banks, with Nags Head losing about 35 ft of beach. The hurricane destroyed the highway bridge along the Currituck Sound, and resulted in heavy crop damage in northeastern North Carolina. The hurricane was also considered among the worst hurricanes on record in the Norfolk, Virginia, area. Winds of up to 84 mph at Cape Henry destroyed windows, roofs, and some entire buildings, resulting in around $500,000 in damage (1936 USD, $7.3 million 2006 USD). The hurricane produced a storm tide of 9.3 ft in Sewell's Point, Virginia, the second highest on record at that location. Two locations along the James River experienced record crest levels of over 20 ft. Rough seas washed several boats ashore, and shipping was cancelled in and out of Norfolk. The hurricane resulted in <b>cancelled</b> <b>train</b> service and increased traffic. The hurricane was indirectly responsible for two casualties. The first fatality occurred when debris from {{the hurricane}} struck a person in the head and later died. Another person drowned in the Elizabeth River in an effort to recover a rowboat blown adrift. Though hurricane warnings were posted for the northeast United States and hurricane-force winds occurred there, damage, if any, is unknown.|$|E
40|$|One {{recovery}} {{strategy in}} case of a major disruption in a rail network is to cancel all trains on a specific line of the network. When the disturbance has ended, the cancelled line must be reinserted as soon as possible. In this article we present a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for calculating the best way to reinsert <b>cancelled</b> <b>train</b> lines in a rail network covered by a periodic timetable. Using a high abstraction level it has been possible to incorporate the temporal aspect in the model only relying on the information embedded in the train identification numbers of each departure. The model finds the optimal solution in an average of 0. 5 CPU seconds in each test case. Introduction to DSB S-tog DSB S-tog (S-tog) is the operator of the city rail of Copenhagen, Denmark. Covering approximately 170 km double-tracks and 80 stations the city rail of Copenhagen services the inner and outer parts of Copenhagen. At a daily level the operator carries approximately 30. 000 passengers. S-tog is the only user of the tracks, which are controlled by the infrastructural owner BaneDanmark (BD) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose is}} to test the {{hypothesis}} that the choice of strategy for preventive maintenance of rail infrastructure might affect the amount of serious disruptions in the train traffic. The relation between preventive maintenance and serious train traffic disruptions can be divided into two parts. On one hand it is the relation between the chosen strategy for preventive maintenance and the state of the rail infrastructure. On the other hand it is the relation between the state of the rail infrastructure and the amount of occurring train traffic disruptions. Either the sub relations can be analysed and quantified separately or one might try to perform an analysis without dividing the relation between preventive maintenance and serious train traffic disruptions into two parts. An operational definition of serious disruption in train traffic in this context is that faults or damages on the rail infrastructure cause such severe delays that the planned turnover of train vehicles cannot be maintained, <b>cancelled</b> <b>train</b> traffic or the closure of a railway. Several methods for quantifying serious train traffic disruptions, based on available train traffic data, are suggested. It is clear from these methods that faults or damages on the overhead contact line dominate increasingly as higher weight is put on the larger train delays, while the opposite applies to faults and damages on signal system. The result of a Delphi study is presented, where two scenarios are tested. The purpose of the study is to let experts on maintenance of rail infrastructure judge to what extent the decision of preventive maintenance strategy may affect the amount of occurring train traffic disruptions. The first scenario means that the necessary maintenance strategy in order two reach the target standard for the rail infrastructure is implemented. In the second scenario a maintenance strategy is implemented that is 50 percent more ambitious than the strategy of the first scenario...|$|E

30|$|The {{calculated}} VTTV {{related to}} the cargo component based on the precautionary costs from the COOP case (around € 4 per tonne-hour delay) {{is higher than the}} Swedish CBA-guidelines-recommended VTTV (for groceries, around € 0.5 per delay-tonne-hour). The VTTV would be even higher if operational costs and costs due to two <b>cancelled</b> <b>trains</b> had been included. 19 However, at this point in time, the recommended values for VTTV in Sweden are based on an ad hoc approach in that VTTS is multiplied by the factor 2, 20 without any theoretical or empirical justification.

40|$|AbstractAs {{more and}} more governments are {{planning}} or constructing their high-speed rail (HSR) systems, the central control mechanism of such systems, i. e., train timetables, should be investigated more in order to cope with various disturbances due to disasters.

This research proposed a scheduling optimization model that has the capability to accommodate not only basic requirements but train circulation as well for Taiwan HSR system. The sensitivity analysis was applied {{in order to identify}} how disturbances propagate in the original timetable and which actions to be taken in order to mitigate the impact instead of <b>cancelling</b> <b>trains.</b> With proper enhancement, the proposed model could be a good simulation tool to help predict the effect of disruptions on the timetable without doing real experiments...|$|R
