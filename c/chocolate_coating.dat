Oliver was an anti-obesity campaigner {{and author of a}} [...] "Practical Essay on the Use and Abuse of warm Bathing in Gluty Cases". In more recent years, Oliver's efforts have been traduced by the introduction of a version of the biscuit with a plain <b>chocolate</b> <b>coating.</b> Bath Chaps, the salted and smoked cheek and jawbones of the pig, takes its name from the city and is available from a stall in the daily covered market.

500|$|In December 2010, Yuraku Confectionery Company {{introduced}} [...] "White Black Thunder" [...] bars, called Shiroi Black Thunder ( [...] ), for {{a limited}} run of six months. [...] The cookie and rice puff core {{are the same as}} Black Thunder, but the outer <b>chocolate</b> <b>coating</b> is white. [...] The package mentions [...] "From Hokkaido", an area which has been associated with white chocolate since its introduction by the Rokkatei Confectionery, based in Obihiro, Hokkaido, in the 1970s. [...] The advertising slogan can be translated as: [...] "Straight descent into deliciousness!" [...] ( [...] ), and uses a term distinctly related to the steep slopes of Alpine skiing. [...] Within a short time, the White Thunder bar has proven to be quite popular, as demonstrated by the rapid depletion of stocks.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{concept was}} {{a candy bar}} that would have three main components, a heavy texture, rich flavor, and a reasonable price; {{the combination of these}} qualities would ensure that it would be an easily marketable product. [...] It was later decided it should be appealing to as many demographic groups as possible, including children. [...] A candy bar was developed with a dark cocoa-flavored cookie pieces mixed with Japanese-style crisped rice, and finally coated with dark milk chocolate. [...] The cookie bar is pressed relatively flat on five sides; however, the top of the bar presents an uneven surface, even with the <b>chocolate</b> <b>coating.</b> [...] When it came to a name for the product, it was decided that the keyword should be the color [...] "black", which would allude to the dark chocolate flavor. [...] This is in keeping with other marketing trends in Japan, where the color [...] "black" [...] is associated with dark or bittersweet chocolate, such as the popular Meiji Black chocolate bar. [...] To give the product some [...] "impact" [...] with consumers, it was decided to name it after the Japanese god of thunder, Raijin. [...] Although the name of the product uses the English words [...] "Black Thunder" [...] (pronounced or transliterated as Burakku Sandah), the outer package also carries the Japanese kanji term for the product in a smaller font (...) , so that the meaning would not be lost on consumers. [...] An advertising slogan recorded from the development period translates to, [...] "Delicious taste like a flash of lightning!" [...] ( [...] ), but was initially rejected in favor of the basic one-line descriptive [...] "Black cocoa crunch".|$|E
