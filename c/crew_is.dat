5|$|A dance <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> a team {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, the TARDIS materialises in the 17th century {{on board}} a pirate ship whose <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> being terrorised by a Siren-like creature. After {{receiving}} an injury, however minor, a black spot appears on their palms and then the creature apparently disintegrates them.|$|E

5|$|After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk {{arrives in}} the engine room and discovers Spock dying of {{radiation}} poisoning. The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship's <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> a logical one, before succumbing to his injuries. A space burial is held in the Enterprise torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot into orbit around the new planet. The crew leaves {{to pick up the}} Reliant marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V. Spock's coffin, having soft-landed, rests on the Genesis planet's surface.|$|E
5|$|Eventually accumulating all the artifacts, the Raiders {{discover}} that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, Valerian Mengsk; though the Hyperion <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> concerned about having been working for their enemy, Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan's infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they arrive}} at Illium, the <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> {{attacked}} a group of mercenaries including Commander Jacobus, hired by Saren, leaving Tali and Keenah the only survivors. The two stowaway on a ship to the Citadel, though are uncovered and turned over to C-Sec once they arrive. Though they try to tell of the evidence they have found, they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies.|$|E

5|$|The EO-10 crew, {{launched}} aboard Soyuz TM-13 on 2 October 1991, was {{the last}} crew to launch from the USSR and continued the occupation of Mir through {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union. The <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> notable for having launched as Soviet citizens and returning to earth as Russians. The newly formed Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) was unable to finance the unlaunched Spektr and Priroda modules, instead putting them into storage and ending Mir's second expansion.|$|E
5|$|The First VIII receive {{university}} blues, and {{is therefore}} more {{commonly known as the}} Blue Boat, with Cambridge in light blue and Oxford dark blue. While the <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> all female, the cox can be male or female. The Second VIII receives university colours. The 2011 race was the first to be sponsored by Newton Investment Management, a subsidiary of BNY Mellon. Previously the crews had no sponsorship and were self funded. Newton have remained the sponsor since then and increased the amount of funding significantly.|$|E
5|$|The USS Enterprise is {{on patrol}} near the Romulan neutral zone and the <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> {{experiencing}} unusual dreams. Captain James T. Kirk and Science Officer Spock both confess {{that they are}} having dreams that Spock is Captain {{of the ship and}} Kirk is an Ensign. Kirk informs Spock that Starfleet intelligence has discovered that the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and are sending more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS ShiKahr, which appears to otherwise be the Enterprise. The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict who has been on board for only a day.|$|E
25|$|The 1989 tanker <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> {{half the}} size of the 1977 crew, worked 12- to 14-hour shifts, plus overtime. The <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> rushing to leave Valdez with a load of oil.|$|R
50|$|In 1870, the Franco-Prussian War {{markedly}} delayed construction, {{since the}} German construction <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> drafted for military service, and the Italian <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> let go. Work did not resume until 1871.|$|R

5|$|The helicopters, {{primarily}} the AS350, {{are used for}} special flights, such as search and rescue, air ambulance, charter flights to the Thule Air Base on contract with the U.S. Air Force, geological exploration, and supply flights to the mining sites and the research stations on the Greenland ice sheet. During the peak summer season, the helicopter <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> supplemented by freelance pilots from Norway and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Venturers are {{expected}} to know and live by the Venturing Oath and Venturing Code. They associate and work directly with adults as partners, but the <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> led by elected youth officers who are given opportunities to learn and apply leadership skills. Venturers plan and participate in interdependent group experiences dependent on cooperation. An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and personal growth. Each award requires the Venturer to teach {{what they have learned}} to others returning the skill and knowledge back to the community and enabling the Venturer to master those skills.|$|E
5|$|At the Fountain, Blackbeard's <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> {{confronted by}} Barbossa {{and his men}} and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish {{suddenly}} arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the Queen Anne's Revenge and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena {{goes back to the}} dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.|$|E
25|$|A two-crew {{concept was}} {{established}} for SSBNs, combined with forward deployment {{to maximize the}} time each submarine would spend on patrol. The <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> named Blue and Gold after the US Naval Academy colors. The <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> deployed for 105 days and at their home bases for 95 days, with a 3-day turnover period on {{each end of the}} deployed period. <b>Crews</b> <b>were</b> flown from their home bases to and from the forward deployment bases. After taking over the boat, the crew would perform a 30-day refit assisted by the tender, followed by a 70-day deterrent patrol. Sometimes a port visit would be arranged {{in the middle of the}} patrol. The home bases for Atlantic Fleet <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> Groton, Connecticut and Charleston, South Carolina. Pacific Fleet <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} {{reservations}} about using Dutch <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> overcome, all-Dutch <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> used, although the flights used BOAC flight numbers and passenger handling. The KLM contingent was housed at BOAC's Whitchurch base.|$|R
25|$|U-570s inexperienced <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> {{not unique}} for the time. British {{interrogation}} of rescued crew-members of —sunk {{on her first}} patrol in September 1941—revealed that 41 out of 48 <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> on their first war patrol.|$|R
5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help decrypt it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg {{have never been able to}} assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|Shipping {{incidents}} {{resulting from}} the storm caused several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk, killing all its occupants. A tug boat sank {{off the coast of}} Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge; the fate of the <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> unknown. A ship named the American SS Catopazi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba, with all 30 crew members lost. Near Daytona Beach, a vessel carrying 2,000 cases of liquor sank along with all six crewmen. The last incident, involving a yacht, occurred off the coast of Georgia. The ship sank near Savannah, Georgia with the 12 crew members drowning. The total loss of life at sea was at least 55. Shipping throughout the East Coast was crippled by the storm as vessels were forced to seek shelter at port.|$|E
50|$|After scuttling the Ayesha, the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> {{taken to}} Arabia to begin an {{overland}} trek {{that ended in}} Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire in May 1915. From there, the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> {{able to return to}} Germany.|$|R
50|$|SS-Hauptsturmführer Michael Wittmann: Tiger tank ace, who {{along with}} his tank <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> informally buried in an unmarked site {{following}} their deaths on 8 August 1944. Rediscovered in 1983, the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> re-interred at La Cambe.|$|R
50|$|After {{spending}} {{a number of}} days alone on the tiny islet, the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> greeted by men from a village on a nearby island who arrived in canoes, having seen washed-up flotsam from the raft. The <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> taken back to the native village, where they were feted with traditional dances and other festivities. Finally the <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> taken off Raroia to Tahiti by the French schooner Tamara, with the salvaged Kon-Tiki in tow.|$|R
5|$|Tennessee (Danny McBride) is {{the pilot}} of the Covenant and Maggie Faris' husband. During a space walk to repair the solar {{recharge}} sails of the Covenant, Tennessee inadvertently intercepts a signal from Shaw, which prompts the colonization mission to divert towards the signal's source. While {{the brunt of the}} crew embarks on an excursion {{to the surface of the}} Engineer home world, Tennessee pilots Covenant in high orbit. Due to an ionic storm, he is unable to have adequate communication with the expedition. To regain communications, Tennessee brings Covenant dangerously close to the storm, which allows Daniels to privately reveal to him that Maggie is dead. Tennessee pilots a cargo lander down to the surface of the planet and extracts Daniels, Lope and David impersonating Walter, assisting with killing an Alien in the process. Aboard Covenant, the <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> alerted to an Alien stowaway, prompting Tennessee to work with Daniels to dispose of it. They lure it to the terraforming bay, where it is ejected into space. Tennessee subsequently returns to cryosleep before Daniels does.|$|E
5|$|This season {{introduced}} the main characters, and established the general plot as a documentary <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> recording {{the lives of}} the employees of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In a mockumentary format, it shows Michael Scott (Steve Carell), regional manager of the Scranton branch office, as he tries to convince the filmmakers of the documentary that he presides over a happy, well-running office. Meanwhile, sales rep Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) finds methods to undermine his cube-mate, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson); receptionist Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) is trying to deal with Michael's insensitivities and flubs; and the temporary employee Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is acting mostly as an observer of the insanity around him.|$|E
5|$|After the hijacking, Cofresí adopted Anne as his flagship. Although she is popularly {{believed}} to have been renamed El Mosquito, all official documents use her formal name. Anne was quickly used to intercept a merchant off the coast of Vieques who was completing a voyage from Saint Croix to Puerto Rico. Like others before it, the fate of the captured ship and its <b>crew</b> <b>is</b> unknown. The Spanish countered with an expedition from the port of Patillas. Captain Sebastian Quevedo commanded a small boat, Esperanza, to find the pirates but was unsuccessful after several days at sea. At the same time, de la Torre pressured the regional military commanders to take action against the pirates and undercover agents monitored maritime traffic in most coastal towns. The pirates docked Anne in Jobos Bay before sunset, a pattern reported by the local militia to southern region commander Tomás de Renovales. At this time the pirates sailed Anne towards Peñuelas, where the ship was recognized. Cofresí's last capture was on March 5, 1825, when he commanded the hijacking of a boat owned by Vicente Antoneti in Salinas.|$|E
50|$|On 23 January 1968 the United States Navy ship USS Pueblo (AGER-2) was boarded and {{captured}} by the North Koreans. The ship and its <b>crew</b> <b>were</b> taken to the port at Wonsan and the <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> taken hostage.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} pieces of information provided by Johnson was how The Vario <b>Crew</b> <b>was</b> avoiding FBI wiretaps and bugs. The <b>crew</b> <b>was</b> using a parked trailer in a junkyard owned by Paul Vario in Brooklyn.|$|R
50|$|For {{the fifth}} season of America's Best Dance <b>Crew,</b> auditions <b>were</b> held in six cities: Atlanta, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, Boston, and New York City. Fifteen dance <b>crews</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} and then categorized into three regions: South, East Coast, and West Coast. Following the regional competitions, the initial pool of dance <b>crews</b> <b>was</b> narrowed down to nine.|$|R
