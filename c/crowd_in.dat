40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of government expenditure on private domestic investment in Indonesia. Based on the previous studies, there is no clear justification whether government expenditure is <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> or <b>crowding</b> out the private investment. Using quarterly time series data during period 1985 to 2012, the empirical results show that government expenditure (total) is crowding out private domestic investment in both short term and long term. Specifically, government expenditure for public service is crowding out the private investment in both short term and long term. Unlike public services, the economic expenditure is <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> the private investment in the long term. Moreover, health expenditure is crowding out the private investment in the short term while education expenditure is <b>crowding</b> out <b>in</b> the short term and <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> in the long term...|$|R
