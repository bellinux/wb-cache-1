Second, it detects <b>cable</b> length and <b>adjusts</b> the power accordingly. Previous standard switches provide enough power to send a signal up to 100 m. However, this is often unnecessary, especially in the home, where 5 to 10 m of cabling are typical between rooms.In addition to the pure power saving benefits of Green Ethernet, backing off the transmit power on shorter cable runs reduces alien crosstalk, and improves the overall performance of the cabling system.|$|R

Effects of important parameters such as cable sag and pre-tension are also studied.

40|$|Recently, long {{filamentous}} bacteria, {{belonging to}} the family Desulfobulbaceae, were shown to induce electrical currents over long distances in the surface layer of marine sediments. These “cable bacteria” are capable of harvesting electrons from free sulfide in deeper sediment horizons and transferring these electrons along their longitudinal axes to oxygen present near the sediment-water interface. In the present work, we investigated the relationship between cable bacteria and a photosynthetic algal biofilm. In a first experiment, we investigated sediment that hosted both cable bacteria and a photosynthetic biofilm and tested the effect of an imposed diel light-dark cycle by continuously monitoring sulfide at depth. Changes in photosynthesis at the sediment surface had an immediate and repeatable effect on sulfide concentrations at depth, indicating that cable bacteria can rapidly transmit a geochemical effect to centimeters of depth in response to changing conditions at the sediment surface. We also observed a secondary response of the free sulfide at depth manifest on the time scale of hours, suggesting that <b>cable</b> bacteria <b>adjust</b> to a moving oxygen front with a regulatory or a behavioral response, such as motility. Finally, we show that on the time scale of days, {{the presence of an}} oxygenic biofilm results in a deeper and more acidic suboxic zone, indicating that a greater oxygen supply can enable cable bacteria to harvest a greater quantity of electrons from marine sediments. Rapid acclimation strategies and highly efficient electron harvesting are likely key advantages of cable bacteria, enabling their success in high sulfide generating coastal sediments...|$|R
40|$|A cable {{supported}} footbridge {{model with}} pre-tensioned cables in {{vertical and horizontal}} planes is proposed to investigate the vibration characteristics of shallow suspension footbridges under walking dynamic loads in this conceptual study.

In the numerical analysis, SAP 2000 is adopted to study the vibration properties and dynamic response under walking loads. The dynamic behaviour of the bridge under structure synchronous excitation is stimulated by resonant vibration. The crowd walking loads are modelled as uniform loads acting on the whole bridge deck and they consist of three parts: vertical dynamic force, lateral dynamic force and vertical static force.

2500|$|Carburetion {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five throttle cables, providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique [...] "port valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves <b>adjusting</b> <b>cables</b> controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|R

Deployment is thus carried out though an equilibrium manifold. The deployment-actuation step size is identified as a critical parameter for successful deployment. Large deployment steps lead to instable configurations while small steps are computationally expensive. Due to mechanism-based deployment, the total energy in the structural system remains nearly constant during deployment. Elastic potential energy due to cable tension is the highest energy identified while kinetic energy and the work of torque friction on strut-to-strut joints are relatively low. Finally, internal forces increase during deployment but remain low compared with service self-stress values showing that deployment is not a critical phase for the design of the bridge...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and assessment of computer techniques for the formfinding and sizing of large modular building space structures suitable for urban development. The contents of the Chapters are summarised as follows: 1 : An introduction to conceptual and computer aided design of large building space structures. 2 : A review of topological computer design methods. 3 : A comparison of a dynamic relaxation method, for the formfinding of modularly constrained structures subject to a dominant design loading case, with linear programming and fully stressed design methods. This comparison shows that the dynamic relaxation method is efficient and particularly suitable for interactive use. 4 : A parametric study {{of the effects of the}} iteration parameters on the stability and rate of convergence is presented. No general rules appear to be possible regarding the effects of these parameters on stability. It is noted, however, that the number of structure modifications before the solution becomes apparent is independent of the parameters. The dynamic relaxation formfinding procedure is generalised to cater for different stress constraints in tension and compression members and, for the problem considered, derives a lighter form than the fully stressed design technique. The optimum form of the D. R. solution is verified by the linear programming technique. 5 : An intuitive dynamic relaxation method for the sizing of structures of fixed topology subject to multiple loading cases,and stress constraints is presented. The method also caters for maximum member area sizes and deflection constraints by the use of parallel elastic and elasto-plastic analyses. Solutions derived using this method are compared with solutions derived using the non-linear program algorithm. They are shown to be of similar weight and to require similar solution times. 6 : Two dynamic relaxation methods are presented for the formfinding and sizing of multiply loaded space structures. The first or parallel method is suitable for deriving and sizing forms of optimum or near optimum weight by deleting members which are small in area size and reducing in size. The second or series method is particularly suitable for interactive use and consists of testing the efficiency of each member with respect to each loading case. The final topology is then sized considering all loading cases simultaneously. These methods are both applied to a bridging ground structure subject to multiple loads and compared with solutions derived using linear, nonlinear programming and topological design methods. The parallel dynamic relaxation method is then extended to cater for cable members allowing for on-off non-linearities and prestress effects. The bridging structure is subsequently redesigned using internal <b>cable</b> members and <b>adjusting</b> the prestress level to ensure that the bridge deck does not deflect vertically under the action of the primary loading case. 7 : A summary of conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of new materials and advanced engineering technology, slender footbridges are increasingly becoming popular to satisfy the modern transportation needs and the aesthetical requirements of society. These structures however are always "lively" with low stiffness, low mass, low damping and low natural frequencies. As a consequence, they are prone to vibration induced by human activities and can suffer severe vibration serviceability problems, particularly in the lateral direction. This phenomenon has been evidenced by the excessive lateral vibration of many footbridges worldwide such as the Millennium Bridge in London and the T-Bridge in Japan. Unfortunately, present bridge design codes worldwide do not provide sufficient guidelines and information to address such vibrations problems and to ensure safety and serviceability {{due to the lack of}} knowledge on the dynamic performance of such slender vibration sensitive bridge structures. A conceptual study has been carried out to comprehensively investigate the dynamic characteristics of slender suspension footbridges under human-induced dynamic loads and a footbridge model in full size with pre-tensioned reverse profiled cables in the vertical and horizontal planes has been proposed for this purpose. A similar physical suspension bridge model was designed and constructed in the laboratory, and experimental testings have been carried out to calibrate the computer simulations. The synchronous excitation induced by walking has been modelled as crowd walking dynamic loads which consist of dynamic vertical force, dynamic lateral force and static vertical force. The dynamic behaviour under synchronous excitation is simulated by resonant vibration at the pacing rate which coincides with a natural frequency of the footbridge structure. Two structural analysis software packages, Microstran and SAP 2000 have been employed in the extensive numerical analysis. Research results show that the structural stiffness and vibration properties of suspension footbridges with pre-tensioned reverse profiled <b>cables</b> can be <b>adjusted</b> by choosing different structural parameters such as cable sag, cable section and pretensions in the reverse profiled cables. Slender suspension footbridges always have four main kinds of vibration modes: lateral, torsional, vertical and longitudinal modes. The lateral and torsional modes are often combined together and become two kinds of coupled modes: coupled lateral-torsional modes and coupled torsionallateral modes. Such kind of slender footbridges also have different dynamic performance in the lateral and vertical directions, and damping has only a small effect on the lateral vibration but significant effect on the vertical one. The fundamental coupled lateral-torsional mode and vertical mode are easily excited when crowd walking dynamic loads are distributed on full bridge deck. When the crowd walking dynamic loads are distributed eccentrically on half width of the deck, the fundamental coupled torsional-lateral mode can be excited and large lateral deflection can be induced. Higher order vertical modes and coupled lateral-torsional modes can also be excited by groups of walking pedestrians under certain conditions. It is found that the coupling coefficient introduced in this thesis to describe the coupling of a coupled mode, is an important factor which has significant effect on the lateral dynamic performance of slender suspension footbridges. The coupling coefficient, however, is influenced by many structural parameters such as cable configuration, cable section, cable sag, bridge span and pre-tensions, etc. In general, a large dynamic amplification factor is expected when the fundamental mode of a footbridge structure is the coupled lateral-torsional mode with a small coupling coefficient. The research findings of this thesis are useful in understanding the complex dynamic behaviour of slender and vibration sensitive suspension footbridges under humaninduced dynamic loads. They are also helpful in developing design guidance and techniques to improve the dynamic performance of such slender vibration sensitive footbridges and similar structures and hence to ensure their safety and serviceability...|$|R
