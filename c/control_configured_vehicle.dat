40|$|Vertical/Short Take-Off arid Landing (V/STOL) fighter {{aircraft}} are characterised by increased control complexity {{caused by the}} extra degree ol freedom. This {{can result in a}} high pilot workload which may be alleviated with the careful application of active flight control. However, the advent of <b>control</b> <b>configured</b> <b>vehicles</b> demands that the controller design must be part of a fully integrated and iterative aircraft design; hence it must allow the two-way flow of design information. In this thesis a suitable controller (leSign method is developed to solve this two-fold problem.

40|$|Conventionally, the {{pitching}} instability of road vehicles has been controlled mechanically {{through the application}} of suspension systems. The present study demonstrates how unsteady aerodynamics can be exploited for such <b>control</b> by properly <b>configuring</b> <b>vehicle</b> body shapes. To discern the effect of unsteady aerodynamics on road vehicle stability, large eddy simulation has been conducted to simulate the flow past simplified vehicle models. Forced-sinusoidal-pitching oscillation was imposed on the models during the simulation to probe their dynamic responses. Numerical results were compared with wind tunnel measurements for validation, and good agreement is attained. Unsteady flow structures above the rear section of the vehicles were found to significantly affect their pitching stability. Depending on the vehicle body shape configurations, the induced aerodynamic force tended to either enhance or restrain the vehicles' pitching instability...|$|R
40|$|Development of new <b>control</b> <b>configured</b> flight <b>vehicles</b> has {{introduced}} challenging problems {{in both the}} areas of control system design and handling qualities specifications. Standard design techniques based on 2 ̆ 2 open-loop 2 ̆ 2 criteria and a posteriori handling qualities verification for pilot 2 ̆ 7 s acceptability {{have proved to be}} often inadequate when applied to the above vehicles {{because of the lack of}} information and unprecedented properties of their behavior. Using the concepts originated by Schmidt, a control system design approach for optimal stability augmentation systems using limited state feedback theory, with the specific inclusion of the human pilot in the loop is proposed in the present dissertation. ^ The methodology is intended to be especially suitable for application to flight vehicles exhibiting non-conventional dynamics characteristics and for which quantitative handling qualities specifications might not be available. ^ The design objectives are introduced via correlation between pilot ratings and the objective function of the optimal control model of the human pilot. Since both human and augmentation controllers must be compatible and operate in parallel, simultaneous optimization for augmentation and pilot gains is required. The method is used for the implementation of a control system for the AFTI/F- 16 aircraft in a pitch tracking task and experimentally verified and validated via fixed base simulation to show its capability of improving the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A design {{criterion}} is developed {{to achieve the}} following goals simultaneously: (i) input-output decoupling of multivariable feedback systems; (ii) complete and arbitrary closed-loop pole assignment; (iii) desired zero assignment for reference signal tracking; and (iv) robust stabilisa-tion of multivariable feedback systems subjected to time-varying nonlinear uncertainties. Thus, the requirements of performance as well as stability robustness of a multivariable feedback system will be simultaneously met by employing this {{design criterion}}. Moreover, by minimising H"-norm of each channel of the closed-loop transfer matrix, we can obtain the robustness optimisation of the system, i. e., we can predict the maximum slope of the sector-bounded nonlinear uncertainties that can be tolerated in each channel of the system. A practical example, the lateral flight control of CCV (<b>control</b> <b>configured</b> <b>vehicle),</b> is given to illus-trate {{the validity of the}} proposed design algo-rithm. ...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{pressure}} measurements {{have been made}} at Mach 10 in air on an instrumented 0. 006 -scale model of an advanced (<b>control</b> <b>configured)</b> winged entry <b>vehicle.</b> The tests were conducted in the Langley Continuous Flow Hypersonic Tunnel. Data were obtained at 83 surface pressure stations, which include locations on the lower and upper surface centerlines, spanwise positions along the lower and upper surfaces of the wing, the lower {{surface of the body}} flap, and radial locations on the fuselage. Data were obtained for angles of attack ranging from zero to 40 deg, sideslip angles of - 2 deg to + 5 deg, Reynolds numbers of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 million per foot, and body-flap deflections of zero, 10, and 20 deg. Test conditions and orifice locations were chosen to correspond directly with those for the heat transfer measurements previously reported on the same configuration. Comparison of windward symmetry plane data with predictions based upon an approximate engineering method was found to yield reasonable agreement for angles of attack from 20 to 40 deg. The leeward surface pressure data were observed to be roughly an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding windward data. At low angles of attack, regions of high pressure were noted on the windward wing surface. The result is attributed to vortical action or shock impingement. High pressures were also measured on the deflected body flap, a critical region for this type of vehicle. Reynolds number effects were found to be insignificant...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of {{active control technology}} to the suppression of flutter has been successfully demonstrated during two recent studies in the Langley transonic dynamics tunnel.

The magnitude and distribution of heating are characterized in terms of angle of attack and Reynolds number aided by {{an analysis of the}} flow data which are used to suggest the presence of various three dimensional flow structures that produce the observed heating patterns. Of particular interest are streak heating patterns that result in high localized heat transfer rates on the wing windward surface at low to moderate angles of attack.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a new type of robotic underwater vehicle designed specifically for the inspection of critical infrastructures such as boiling water reactor nuclear power plants. These applications require vehicles that can access confined areas, maneuver precisely, and move easily in several directions. In addition, external appendages such as fins or propellers should be avoided in order to reduce the risk of damage through collisions. We propose a smooth, spheroid shaped vehicle that uses an internal propulsion system to generate and direct water-jets for propulsion and maneuvering. Drawing inspiration from aeronautics and ocean engineering, we treat this system as a control-configured vehicle (CCV) and design the system specifically for superior control performance. Like many modern CCV aircraft, our robot is designed to be open loop unstable in order to avoid bulky external stabilizers. We refer to this new type <b>vehicle</b> as a <b>Control</b> <b>Configured</b> Spheroidal <b>Vehicle</b> (CCSV). An integrated pump-valve maneuvering system is developed by combining powerful centrifugal pumps with compact Coanda-effect valves. This system is used to design and construct a compact, multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) prototype vehicle. To achieve precision orientation control, high speed valve switching is exploited using a unique Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control scheme. Dead zones and other complex nonlinear dynamics of traditional propeller thrusters and water jet pumps are avoided with use of integrated pump-valve control. Three simple control algorithms for coordinating valve switching and pump output are presented and are verified through experiments. Planar control is complicated by the presence of hydrodynamic instability. A dynamic control system that augments stability and achieves high maneuverability is outlined and implemented. A nonlinear hydrodynamic model is formulated, and its linearized dynamics are analyzed to attain insights into how physical design parameters, such as jet direction and body shape, influence controllability and stability. The integrated design method is implemented and shown to achieve high maneuverability and stability. Finally, this thesis concludes with a discussion on broader CCSV design approaches. The vehicle open loop dynamics are studied and a plant zero is shown to significantly influence closed loop performance. Jet angle and vehicle shape are explored through the lens of optimizing this plant zero location, and design recommendations are presented for both ideal and practical situations. These lessons can be used to design new CCSV systems for a variety of scales and applications. by Anirban Mazumdar. Thesis: Ph.
