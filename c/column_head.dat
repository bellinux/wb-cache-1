40|$|In gas {{chromatography}} (GC) reproducible retention times {{are in many}} cases highly favorable {{or in some cases}} even required. In one-dimensional GC, retention time shifts can be eliminated or minimized using a procedure called retention time locking (RTL). This procedure is based on adjusting the (constant) <b>column</b> <b>head</b> pressure. Unfortunately, this RTL procedure cannot be used in comprehensive two-dimensional {{gas chromatography}} (GC × GC) given the fact that peaks will shift in both dimensions. Adjusting the <b>column</b> <b>head</b> pressure in GC × GC will only minimize or eliminate the primary retention time shifts. In this paper, a fast and easy to perform, two-step retention time locking procedure for two-dimensional gas chromatography (2 D-RTL) is proposed and its feasibility is demonstrated. This 2 D-RTL procedure involves adjustment of the <b>column</b> <b>head</b> pressure or constant column flow, followed by the adjustment of the so-called effective secondary column length. The secondary column length is increased or decreased, simply by moving it stepwise through the modulator. It is demonstrated that retention time shifts in both the primary- and secondary-dimension, which may occur after e. g. replacing the column set, can be minimized to less than half peak base width. The proposed 2 D-RTL procedure is used successfully for approximately 1 year in our laboratory...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) in air was developed using simultaneously pressure and temperature programmed gas chromatography (GC) on a capillary column. The separation of C 2 -C 10 hydrocarbons was performed in a single GC-run using a fused silica capillary column (FSCC) with a chemically bonded non-polar stationary phase (CP-Sil- 5 -CB). A combination of on-column cryofocusing and GC reinjection provided baseline separation of C 2 hydrocarbons at subambient initial temperature (- 40 degrees C). The cryofocusing {{was performed on the}} <b>column</b> <b>head</b> immersed in liquid nitrogen. Quantitative retention of all C 2 -C 10 hydrocarbons was achieved only when a temperature gradient is created along the cooled column section.

30|$|More {{and more}} {{research}} interests have {{been devoted to}} the study of column in heritage buildings in recent years. Friction-sliding seismic isolation model has been proposed and the slippage criterion of a column foot is given [12]. It is assumed that the moment carried by the column foot is the same as that at the <b>column</b> <b>head,</b> and restoring moment at the column foot is determined according to the analytical moment at the top of column [13]. Lee et al. [14] proposes a technique for obtaining the skeleton curve of moment–rotation relation at the stone base of traditional timber buildings from local compression tests of wooden components. Those studies mainly focused on the friction-sliding characteristics, restoring moment of <b>column</b> <b>head</b> and stiffness characteristics of column. However, study on the whole process of column rocking under external loads is rare, and the rotational behaviors of column foot joint during rocking have not been studied. Furthermore, a recent trend in analyzing timber structures involves considering the timber connections as semi-rigid joints. But, few researches have focused on the semi-rigidity of column foot joint in traditional timer structure, and many studies take column foot as rigid or hinge joint during structural analysis. In fact, the rotation behavior of column foot needs to be better known to properly analyze the whole structure, and there is an urgent to study the mechanical behavior and propose a theoretical model for predicting the restoring moment and the rotational performance of column foot joint.|$|E

40|$|This thesis report {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} a soil improvement technique that is being executed for a Van Oord project in Kuwait. The soil is improved {{by the use of}} a column supported embankment, consisting of sand columns installed in a soft soil layer and a sand platform. The efficiency of this method is defined in terms of stress transfer and settlement reduction. When the soil improvement is finished and the land will be used, there are conditions concerning bearing capacity and settlement behavior. To this extent two important parameters were defined. i. e. the incremental efficiency (the load increase in a sand column over the total surface load increase) and incremental settlement reduction ratio (the settlement of the improved soil over the settlement of the unimproved soil (i. e. soil that has not been improved by sand columns), under loading). To determine the efficiency of the soil improvement, a number of tests were performed on site. Tests included plate load tests (in this thesis referred to as zone load tests). The load tests were simulated in Plaxis, with the known load/settlement results the model could be benchmarked. Furthermore soil samples were taken and tested to determine the local soil characteristics. The parameters derived from the soil tests are also used in the Plaxis calculations. Plaxis allows for a step-by-step consolidation of the soft soil in which the columns were installed. It can be seen that the stress distribution changes for different stages of consolidation. The columns are first constrained by the very stiff soft soil layer (due to high excess pore pressures under loading). When the pore pressures dissipate the constraining stress is lowered and the <b>column</b> <b>head</b> expands. Under vertical loading the stress in the <b>column</b> <b>head</b> has a funnel shape, due to the displacements in the outer ring of the <b>column</b> <b>head.</b> Based on the Plaxis calculations it can be concluded that when a load is activated on top of a surface of soil that has been improved by the use of sand columns (with a center-to-center distance of three meters), given that the platform is thick enough, 60 % of that load is transferred to the column. With a greater center-to-center distance between the columns that percentage decreases, e. g. 28 % for a column spacing of five meters. Compared to existing theories by Hewlett and Randolph (1988) and Zaeske (2001) (it should be noted that most existing theories assume presence of geosynthetic reinforcement, which is not the case for this project) the calculated column force is relatively low. A minimal thickness of the sand platform is needed to facilitate maximum efficiency. The thickness as determined by the Plaxis calculations are lower compared to existing literature. With platform heights of up to seven meters no full arching was observed, however partial arching did occur as evidenced by the efficiency values.

3000|$|For {{the second}} assumption, the {{position}} of vertical load {{is assumed to be}} applied at the top center of column. Before column rocking, the assumption is reasonable. But once rotation of the column occurs, {{the position of}} vertical load deviates from the center of <b>column</b> <b>head.</b> Because the theoretical model is mainly obtained based on the small rotation angle, the offset distance of vertical load is small. While the position of vertical load makes a little effects on the restoring moment. Equation (71) changes into Ph+N([...] Δ - Δ _d)=M^+_bc with taking the partial compression into consideration. Δ _d is the offset distance of vertical load. The theoretical moment may be overestimated without considering the partial compression based on the above formula. All in all, {{it should be noted that}} the above assumptions should be improved in the future study in order to make the theoretical model more accurate.|$|E
