40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to measure the returns of private equity investments based on a stochastic model of the dynamics of a private equity fund. Our stochastic model of a private equity fund consists of two independent stages: the stochastic model of the capital drawdowns and the stochastic model of the <b>capital</b> <b>distributions</b> over a fund's lifetime. <b>Capital</b> <b>distributions</b> are assumed to follow lognormal distributions in our approach. A mean-reverting square-root process is applied to model the rate at which capital is drawn over time. Applying equilibrium intertemporal asset pricing consideration, we are able to derive closed-form solutions for the market value and time-weighted model returns of a private equity fund.

However, a first-order model is ergodic in the sense that each stock asymptotically spends [...] -th of its time at each rank, a property that is not present in actual markets. In order to vary the proportion of time that a stock spends at each rank, it is necessary to use some form of hybrid Atlas model with parameters that depend on both rank and name. An effort in this direction was made by Fernholz, Ichiba, and Karatzas (2013), who introduced a second-order model for the market with rank- and name-based growth parameters, and variance parameters that depended on rank alone.|$|E

Framework of the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution contains rich set of methods and tools, including infinite-dimensional diffusion process. The purpose of this note is to introduce framework of exchangeable distributions on partitions in the financial context.

This suggests that the two-parameter model can be employed for modelling evolution of market weights and prices fluctuating in stochastic equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|The low {{representation}} of female workers in elite jobs is sometimes {{attributed to a}} tail effect: If the human <b>capital</b> <b>distribution</b> exhibits less variation among females than among males, then even with comparable average human capital there will be fewer females in the right tail than males. This paper offers an explanation for why the human <b>capital</b> <b>distribution</b> might have this property. We show that {{the belief that the}} female human <b>capital</b> <b>distribution</b> has a lower variance than the male distribution can be self-fulfilling, in that it provides individuals with incentives to invest in human capital such that the resulting distribution exhibits exactly this characteristic. If this happens, fewer females are employed in high-end jobs (a “glass ceiling ” effect). The average productivity of female workers may at the same time be higher than that of male workers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper studies how initial {{human capital}} {{distributions}} may determine a country’s development pattern when there exist local externalities in education technology and intra-firm spillovers in production technology. Specifically, families {{in rural areas}} suffer from low upward intergenerational mobility since the overall educational environment is poor, and their only way out is to migrate to cities. Their migration decision partly depends on the wage rates in cities, which in turn depends on cities ’ human <b>capital</b> <b>distribution</b> due {{to the presence of}} intra-firm spillovers. By studying the interaction between wage schedules, migration choices, and human capital distributions, some preliminary results are derived, including: (1) Initial human <b>capital</b> <b>distribution</b> matters in determining steady states. The steady-state GDP per capita depends negatively on the initial size of poorly educated people and positively on the initial intermediate-educated to high-educated ratio. (2) A better initial human <b>capital</b> <b>distribution,</b> in the first-order stochastic dominance sense, may not lead to a better steady state. These results are empirically testable. The baseline model can be applied to analyze the impacts of Household Registratio...|$|E
40|$|This {{working paper}} {{presents}} the {{general theory of}} the higher order ”skew lognormal cascade distribution ” as a mathematical extension of the previously proposed skew lognormal cascade distribution (Stephen Lihn 2008, SSRN: 1273087, which is the first order cascade over the normal distribution). In particular, the second order distribution is studied in details, which incorporates the fat tails into the volatility (aka the volatility of volatility). We show that the second order distribution can handle very heavy tails and high kurtosis in the high frequency financial time series. It accurately fits the first four moments of the daily log-returns of Dow, whose kurtosis is 26. The framework of the higher order lognormal cascade distributions also provides a new way to study the <b>capital</b> <b>distribution</b> (aka firm size distribution), the market index, and the market entropy of the stock market. Such study in the context of stochastic portfolio theory reveals that the origin of the fat tails in the fluctuations of the market index is from the lognormal cascade structure of the <b>capital</b> <b>distribution</b> in the market. We show from a simple stochastic model that the contraction and expansion of the underlying <b>capital</b> <b>distribution</b> is the fundamental driving force of the bull-bear market cycles and the market volatility in the past 20 years. A stochastic equation is derived to establish the relation between the market index and the <b>capital</b> <b>distribution,</b> which is exactly the lognormal cascade equation in our theory. This shows that the fluctuations of the market index are a natural mathematical consequence of the stochastic calculus on the market portfolio in which weights are exponentially distributed. Therefore, we conclude that the phenomena of fat tails should exist everywhere in our financial system...|$|E
