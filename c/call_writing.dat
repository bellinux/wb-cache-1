40|$|The {{empirical}} {{performance of}} covered <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> is quite puzzling {{in the traditional}} finance framework. Covered <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> is typically a risk reducing strategy so its expected return should be less than the expected return on the underlying in an efficient market. However, recent empirical evidence suggests (covering a period from 1988 onwards) that the covered <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> has nearly the same return as the underlying whereas the standard deviation of returns is considerably less. Market professionals consider a call option to be a surrogate for the underlying. Such mental accounting of a call option with the underlying has strong support in laboratory experiments. We show that such mental accounting embodied in the principle, assets with similar payoffs must have the same expected returns, provides a new behavioral explanation for the puzzling empirical performance of covered <b>call</b> <b>writing.</b> JEL: G 13, G 1...|$|E
40|$|Various {{explanations}} for the popularity of covered call option strategies have been explored in the literature. According to Shefrin and Statman [1993], framing and risk aversion can help justify its attractiveness to investors. Applying prospect theory and hedonic framing, these authors predict that {{in a world of}} frame dependence an investor that is sufficiently risk averse in the domain of gains will prefer a covered call position over a stock only position and that certain covered call designs will be preferred despite identical cash flows. To date, the relationship among framing, risk aversion, and covered <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> has not been empirically tested. We gather empirical evidence to complete this gap in the literature. We find highly significant empirical evidence for a pronounced framing effect with respect to different covered call designs with equal net cash flows as well as covered calls in general. We find only scarce empirical evidence for a relationship between risk aversion in the domain of gains and a preference for covered calls. In order to observe a positive relationship between risk aversion and covered <b>call</b> <b>writing,</b> investors with above average risk aversion seem to be required. Arvid O. I. Hoffmann and E.

40|$|There {{are various}} types of risk {{associated}} with trading options. Traders typically manage such risks {{with the help of}} various partial derivatives of option prices known as Greeks. Experimental and anecdotal evidence suggests that mental accounting matters in the valuation of options. Mental accounting changes the values of Greeks significantly with crucial implications for risk management. I show that for a call option, delta-risk is under-estimated, gamma risk is over-estimated, and the value-decay due to the passage of time is under-estimated. For a put option, all three types of risks are over-estimated. I also show that covered <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> is more profitable when mental accounting influences prices...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of people, mathematicians included, think that writing out formulas {{is exactly what}} we <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> in math-ematics. I was guilty of the same preconceptions before I started to work with the Writing Across the Curriculum Project at Medgar Evers College (WAC @ MEC). The definition of writ-ing to learn that we use at MEC helped me come up with the idea that served as the basic principle for my further experi-ments and conclusions as I implemented writing to learn in math-ematics. Our definition of WAC @ MEC is this: We define writing across the curriculum as a means to connect writing to learning in all content areas. We define writing as the process through which students think on paper, explore ideas, raise questions, attempt solutions, uncover processes, build and defend argu-ments, brainstorm, introspect, and figure out what’s going on. We define all of these as thinking. Writing to learn across the curriculum provides a potent way for students to exercise their own voices as well as to take on new voices which represent their knowledge of the content and the language of the discipline they are learning (Lester, et. al, 2000, p. 4). The words that I have underlined gave me the idea of what the concept of writing to learn in mathematics should be–learn-ing the new language of the new discipline...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{analyses}} {{the work}} of four Lusophone Naturalist writers, two from Portugal (Abel Botelho and Eça de Queirós) and two from Brazil (Aluísio Azevedo and Adolfo Caminha) {{to argue that the}} pseudoscientific discourses of Naturalism, positivism and degeneration theory were adapted {{on the periphery of the}} Western world to critique the socio-economic order that produced that periphery. A central claim is that the authors in question disrupt the structure of the patriarchal family — characterised by exogamy and normative heterosexuality — to foster alternative notions of kinship that problematise the hegemonic mode of transmitting name, capital, bloodline and authority from father to son. It was this rapidly globalising form of patriarchal capitalism that saw Portugal and Brazil slip into positions of economic disadvantage and dependency, events that were then naturalised in centres of dominance as incidences of national, racial and sexual “degeneracy”. The thesis thus draws links between contemporaneous disquiet about the nation’s race and bloodline; the various “homosexual scandals” that rocked the period; the considerable prevalence of incest and non-normative desire in the literature concerned, and the supposed “inconsistencies” in the style of Lusophone Naturalism that have often been regarded as imperfections in the face of Zola’s model. I propose instead that such adaptations to the Naturalist model can be read as attempts to reassess its potentially marginalising discourse from the margins themselves, exposing something “queer” at the textual, discursive level. This is the process that I <b>call</b> <b>writing</b> “against nature”, relating non-normative kinship to the disruption of the Naturalist aesthetic more generally. Drawing on postcolonial theory, psychoanalysis and queer theory, I argue that the Lusophone Naturalist perspective presents the divided world of the period as anything but a “natural” state of affairs. In this sense, a second line of reasoning is developed: that its authors formed a tentative transatlantic movement that criticised Naturalism as conceived in centres of dominance, calling for a revision of the role that the “scientists” played in shaping and understanding the fin-de-siècle world.

40|$|Our word {{law is a}} loanword from Old Norse. 1 It {{makes its}} {{earliest}} appearances in Old English manuscripts in the late tenth century. At that time the Old English word for law was, believe it or not, æ, written as a digraph called 2 ̆ 2 ash. 2 ̆ 2 Now most readers, myself included, tend to experience anxiety when we confront a ligatured vowel like ae and so we untie it {{as a prelude to}} getting rid of it altogether: we turn an aesthete 2 into an aesthete before finally humiliating him (or her) as an esthete, all to resolve our nervousness. King Æthelred the Unready becomes AEthelred before turning ignominiously into Ethelred. If 2 had stayed our word for law and we make the necessary allowances for what happened to the pronunciation of Old English words that had an ash in them, instead of lawyers we would simply be 2 ̆ 2 ers, 2 ̆ 2 which indeed was how Chaucer spelled arse. 3 And imagine how hard it would be to maintain the pompous tone in which we are wont to speak of THE LAW if instead we were speaking of THE E, pronounced with a short e to add even further indignity to the institution. So we have something to thank those Vikings for after all. They might have emptied England of most of its silver and carried off no small number of captives as slaves, but they left us our word for the model of order 4 - law - as an exchange for the disorders they wrought. So the etymology of law gives me my warrant for the violent yoking of my title: uniform laws and saga Iceland. And the retirement of my colleague Bill Pierce gives me the occasion for yoking them. The sagas were written in Old Norse or, more precisely, in a dialect of Old Norse philologists call Old Icelandic. Old Norse lög, a plural form, had a literal sense of things that had been laid down. But the word referred to more than positive enactments - Le., laws; it also indicated the community that shared those laws, a community that was then known as 2 ̆ 2 our law. 2 ̆ 2 5 Hence the term outlaw 6 to indicate someone who had been expelled from the community and who as an outlaw was shorn of all jural status and all jural rights: he or {{she was supposed to be}} killed by anyone hearty enough to undertake the task. 7 2 ̆ 2 Law 2 ̆ 2 even came to be thought of as the land in which those people who followed one particular law dwelled. Hence the name Danelaw for the east midland region of England where the bulk of the invading Viking armies settled. Given this conception of law as the community defined by a single body of laws, there could not be, by definition, a persistent problem about uniformity of laws. Local custom might vary, but if it varied too much we were in a different world, a world of their law, not our law. With this as a most superficial of backdrops let me give you two case studies. The first deals with the conversion of Iceland to Christianity in the year 1000. This particular case treats of the specific problem of what happens when one faction within the unity of 2 ̆ 2 our law 2 ̆ 2 threatens to secede and make their own law. The second case discusses the problem for uniformity of law and laws when an oral culture meets a powerful new technology we <b>call</b> <b>writing...</b>|$|E
