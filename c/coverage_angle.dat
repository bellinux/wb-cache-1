40|$|The {{development}} of the Electronically Steerable Spherical Array (ESSA) was started in 1975. ESSA provides the inertialess antenna needed by user satellites for communication over their large <b>coverage</b> <b>angles</b> towards the Tracking Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). The performance of ESSA over large <b>coverage</b> <b>angles</b> {{is better than the}} performance provided by phased arrays. The primary difference between the two antenna types is the method of beam forming. The ESSA steers a beam by illuminating a set of elements which point in the desired direction. This set of elements is illuminated by a simple multipole switch called a switching power divider (SPD). Attention is given to details regarding the difference in performance between ESSA and phased arrays, the ESSA block diagram, the performance improvement achieved by phase compensation, power requirements, the four operating modes, multibeam operation, and the data interface...|$|R
50|$|Many flash {{devices have}} auto- or manual-adjust zoom {{features}} that permit the illumination angle to be widened (lessening the guide number) to fully illuminate the image area of wide-angle lenses, or narrowed (increasing the guide number) for telephoto lenses. Such <b>coverage</b> <b>angles</b> {{may be given}} in degrees but are often expressed as being equivalent to lens focal lengths for full-frame, 35 mm cameras. Manufacturers’ advertising practices vary as to the <b>angle</b> of <b>coverage</b> underlying their guide number ratings, {{in large part because}} some flash devices can be zoomed whereas others are fixed.|$|R
50|$|Guide {{numbers are}} not an {{absolute}} measure of flash power (a property called luminous energy) because they are influenced by other variables, notably the camera’s ISO setting (film speed) and flash <b>coverage</b> <b>angle</b> (for flash devices with zoom heads). For any given ISO setting and <b>coverage</b> <b>angle</b> however, an inherently more powerful flash device featuring a guide number that is, for instance, twice as great will permit subjects to be properly exposed from twice as far away for any given fstop, or conversely, will permit scenes at a given distance to be properly exposed at an fnumber twice as great.|$|E

5000|$|The narrow part of {{the horn}} next to the driver is called the [...] "throat" [...] and the large part {{farthest}} away from the driver is called the [...] "mouth". The angular coverage (radiation pattern) of the horn {{is determined by the}} shape and flare of the mouth. Unlike cone speakers, horn speakers usually have rectangular apertures, with the width tailored for proper horizontal <b>coverage</b> <b>angle,</b> and height tailored for proper vertical <b>coverage</b> <b>angle.</b> A major problem of horn speakers is that the radiation pattern varies with frequency; high frequency sound tends to be emitted in narrow beams with poor off-axis performance. [...] Significant improvements have been made, beginning with the [...] "constant directivity" [...] horn invented in 1975 by Don Keele.|$|E
40|$|A novel design {{solution}} of a dual-linearly polarised Ku-band low-profile radiating element for low elevation <b>angle</b> <b>coverage</b> (down to 10 ° above horizon) is presented. Such an element {{is suitable for}} full-duplex Satellite Communications On-The-Move (SCOTM) hybrid scanned phased array antenna applications. Standard designed radiating elements for array applications with low profile physical structure suffer poor low elevation <b>angle</b> <b>coverage</b> as the element pattern reduces by sine of the elevation angle. The element design demonstrated in this paper features unique louvered array element geometry incorporating a spatial “ray bending” lens facilitates the shaping of the element pattern to increase gain at low elevation angles. Preliminary modelling results using ray tracing analysis shows that the desired low <b>angle</b> <b>coverage</b> can be achieved. Currently in progress full 3 D electromagnetic simulations which include {{the interaction between the}} basic radiator and the spatial lens indicates that using an ideal tilted element with novel louvered reflector in addition with proposed lens, low angular coverage can potentially be realised in a low profile structure...|$|R

30|$|We {{obtained}} focal mechanism {{solutions for}} 219 of 881 earthquakes {{based on the}} three-dimensional model. According to the JMA catalog, the magnitudes of these earthquakes range from 2.0 to 6.3. These earthquakes have errors in epicenter and focal depth location of less than 1.3  km and less than 2.2  km, respectively. We selected mechanism solutions with {{less than or equal}} to three inconsistent polarity data. The number of inconsistent data was ≤ 1 for 159 of the 219 total solutions. For the solutions with two or three inconsistent polarity data, the inconsistent data accounted for 12 % of the total, on average. We provide examples of the focal mechanisms with the distribution of polarity data in Additional file 2 : Figure A 2. Because the coverage of the polarity data on the focal sphere is generally good, the focal mechanisms determined in the present study are considered to be robust. We also show the frequency distributions of azimuthal <b>coverage</b> and take-off <b>angle</b> <b>coverage</b> in Additional file 3 : Figure A 3.

The Super-Angulons are Biogon designs, making for huge, heavy lenses, but also giving very generous angles of coverage. The f/4 lenses give 95° of coverage, the f/8 models give 100°, and the f/5.6 units give a 105° <b>coverage</b> <b>angle.</b> The f/4 and f/5.6 lenses are 8-element, 4-group designs, while the f/8 lenses are older 6-element, 4-group, symmetrical designs. Coating technologies improved along the production life of these lenses, and recent Super-Angulons are multicoated.|$|E
50|$|Note that {{manufacturers}} of flash devices may provide guide numbers ratings specified relative to ISO 200, which increases {{them by the}} square root of the difference, or a 41 percent increase relative to those given at ISO 100. When comparing or shopping for flash devices, {{it is important to}} ensure that the guide numbers are given in the same ISO sensitivity, are for the same <b>coverage</b> <b>angle,</b> and reduce to the same unit of distance (meters or feet). When these three variables have been normalized, guide numbers can serve as an comparative measure of intrinsic illuminating energy rather than an inconstant metric for calculating exposures.|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{have become an}} emerging technology for surveillance, disaster management, habitat monitoring, etc. The problem of coverage in sensor networks has been studied {{in a variety of}} contexts. Most of the previous works focus on area or target coverage problem, that is, to make sure every point or target in the network is sufficiently monitored. The current studies of target coverage problem assume that a target can covered by a single sensor. However, there are situations where a sensor can only monitor a certain portion of the object. Examples include image capturing and coastline monitoring. In this research, we consider a tracking system where an object of interest is monitored by the sensors surrounding it. We study the <b>angle</b> <b>coverage</b> problem, that is, to make sure the target’s perimeter is completely covered by the sensors. We define the Minimum Cover problem as identifying a set of sensors which preserve the full <b>angle</b> <b>coverage</b> with minimum number of sensors.

50|$|Different {{models of}} flash devices {{available}} on the market have widely varying maximum-rated guide numbers. Powerful flash devices (those with inherently greater guide numbers when compared at the same ISO sensitivity and <b>coverage</b> <b>angle)</b> are especially useful for outdoor photography because photographers can increase the maximum flash-to-subject distance when filling in shadows. In large part, {{this is because the}} sun is such a bright, unadjustable light source against which a flash device must compete. However, a contributing factor is that many modern cameras with focal-plane shutters can sync with flash devices at speeds no faster than 1/60&thinsp;th of a second. Such a relatively long exposure requires particularly small apertures and/or low ISO sensitivities, both of which constrain how far a camera and its camera-mounted flash can be from the subject. See Fill flash: Guide numbers vs. distance, below.|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} calculating the {{beamwidth}} and Q of devices and systems appear questionable and incomplete {{when looking at}} measured polar data. Calculated beamwidth depends on the chosen method of nor-malizing the polar data and on a judgment of what response anomalies should be allowed {{inside and outside the}} area of coverage. Q is commonly referenced to a single measurement position on axis and it is therefore depen-dent upon device <b>coverage</b> <b>angle.</b> This obscures it’s usefulness as an indicator of the amount of excess and sometimes problematic sound radiated outside the intended coverage area. Width of coverage, smoothness of response within the <b>coverage</b> <b>angle,</b> and amount of excess energy outside the <b>coverage</b> <b>angle</b> are all important to the sound quality and to the suitability of a loudspeaker for a particular applica-tion.

40|$|A special image {{restoration}} {{problem is the}} reconstruction of image from projections – a problem of immense importance in medical imaging, computed tomography and non-destructive testing of objects. This is a problem where a two – dimensional (or higher) object is reconstructed from several one –dimensional projections [1]. The reconstruction techniques are broadly classified into three categories, analytical, iterative, and statistical [2]. The comparative study among these is of great importance {{in the field of}} medical imaging. This paper aims at comparative study by analyzing quantitatively the quality of image reconstructed by analytical and iterative techniques. Projections (parallel beam type) for the reconstruction are calculated analytically by defining Shepp logan phantom head model with <b>coverage</b> <b>angle</b> ranging from 0 to ± 180 o with rotational increment of 2 o to 10 o. For iterative reconstruction <b>coverage</b> <b>angle</b> of ± 90 o, iteration up to 10 is used. The original image is grayscale image of size 128 X 128. The Image quality of the reconstructed image is measured by six quality measurement parameters. In this paper as analytical technique; simple back projection and filtered back projection are implemented, while as iterative; algebraic reconstruction technique is implemented. Experiment result reveals that quality of reconstructed image increase as <b>coverage</b> <b>angle,</b> and number of views increases. The processing time is one major deciding component for reconstruction.

True anterior <b>coverage</b> <b>angle</b> on the sagittal plane was measured in the pelvic coordinate system.

An object of interest moves around the network and the sensors near the object are responsible for capturing images of it. The <b>angle</b> <b>coverage</b> problem aims to identify a set of sensors that preserve all the angles {{of view of the}} object while fulfilling the image resolution requirement. The user is required to specify the minimum acceptable image resolution in the request. Only the images that fulfill the resolution requirement will be considered.
