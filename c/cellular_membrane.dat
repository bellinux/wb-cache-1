As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as {{the demand for}} glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis. In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.|$|E

40|$|N-Formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (fPRL 1) is {{a member}} of the {{chemoattractant}} subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors and plays a key role in inflammation via chemotaxis and the regulation of mediator release from leukocytes. Activated fPRL 1 has recently been shown to induce a complicated pattern of cellular signaling in vitro, but the details of the regulation and alteration of leukocyte cellular fPRL 1 during inflammation in vivo remain unclear. To clarify the alteration of neutrophil fPRL 1 during inflammation in vivo, the immunohistochemical staining of neutrophil fPRL 1 in samples from patients with purulent dermatitis was performed. The in vitro morphological alteration of neutrophil fPRL 1 on <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes</b> by stimulation with N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was also examined. Both the cytoplasm and the <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes</b> of blood neutrophils stained strongly for fPRL 1.

The enhancement of neutrophil fPRL 1 on <b>cellular</b> <b>membranes</b> by stimulation with fMLP indicates the exocytosis of neutrophil fPRL 1 -containing granules. In conclusion, we for the first time confirmed the alteration of neutrophil fPRL 1 in clinical cases of purulent dermatitis.

The mechanism for this process is fairly well understood and is very similar to the fusion process employed by the virion to facilitate cellular entry.

25|$|Potassium is {{the most}} {{abundant}} intracellular cation and about 98% of the body's potassium is found inside cells, with the remainder in the extracellular fluid including the blood.

25|$|Prostaglandins were {{originally}} believed {{to leave the}} cells via passive diffusion because of their high lipophilicity. The discovery of the prostaglandin transporter (PGT, SLCO2A1), which mediates the cellular uptake of prostaglandin, demonstrated that diffusion alone cannot explain the penetration of prostaglandin through the <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane.</b> The release of prostaglandin has now {{also been shown to}} be mediated by a specific transporter, namely the multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4, ABCC4), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily. Whether MRP4 is the only transporter releasing prostaglandins from the cells is still unclear.|$|E
25|$|During {{postnatal}} development, KCC2 {{levels are}} strongly upregulated while NKCC1 levels are down regulated. This change in expression correlates to a developmental {{shift of the}} chloride ion concentration within neurons from high to low intracellular concentration. Effectively, as the chloride ion concentration is reduced, the chloride gradient across the <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> is reversed such that GABAA receptor and glycine receptor stimulation causes chloride ion influx, making the internal neuronal environment more negative (i.e. more hyperpolarized) {{than it would be}} at rest. This is the developmental shift of inhibitory synapses from the excitatory postsynaptic responses of the early neural development phase to the inhibitory postsynaptic responses observed throughout maturity.|$|E
25|$|In full {{collapse}} fusion, the synaptic vesicle merges {{and becomes}} {{incorporated into the}} cell membrane. The formation of the new membrane is a protein mediated process and can only occur under certain conditions. After an action potential, Ca2+ floods to the presynaptic membrane. Ca2+ binds to specific proteins in the cytoplasm, {{one of which is}} synaptotagmin, which in turn trigger the complete fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane.</b> This complete fusion of the pore is assisted by SNARE proteins. This large family of proteins mediate docking of synaptic vesicles in an ATP-dependent manner. With the help of synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle, the t-SNARE complex on the membrane, made up of syntaxin and SNAP-25, can dock, prime, and fuse the synaptic vesicle into the membrane.|$|E

25|$|The mononegavirus {{life cycle}} begins with virion {{attachment}} to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by fusion of the virion envelope with cellular membranes and the concomitant {{release of the}} virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. The virus RdRp partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. Mononegavirus RdRps bind to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription either terminates after a gene or continues to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome are transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end are least likely to be transcribed. The gene order is therefore a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell determines when the RdRp switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication results in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that are in turn transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near {{the inside of the}} cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> they bud from. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.|$|E
25|$|As a neurotoxin, ethanol {{has been}} shown to induce nervous system damage and affect the body in a variety of ways. Among the known effects of ethanol {{exposure}} are both transient and lasting consequences. Some of the lasting effects include long-term reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus, widespread brain atrophy, and induced inflammation in the brain. Of note, chronic ethanol ingestion has additionally been shown to induce reorganization of <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> constituents, leading to a lipid bilayer marked by increased membrane concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat. This is important as neurotransmitter transport can be impaired through vesicular transport inhibition, resulting in diminished neural network function. One significant example of reduced inter-neuron communication is the ability for ethanol to inhibit NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, resulting in reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory acquisition. NMDA {{has been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in LTP and consequently memory formation. With chronic ethanol intake, however, the susceptibility of these NMDA receptors to induce LTP increases in the mesolimbic dopamine neurons in an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) dependent manner. This reorganization may lead to neuronal cytotoxicity both through hyperactivation of postsynaptic neurons and through induced addiction to continuous ethanol consumption. It has, additionally, been shown that ethanol directly reduces intracellular calcium ion accumulation through inhibited NMDA receptor activity, and thus reduces the capacity for the occurrence of LTP.|$|E
25|$|Their {{life cycle}} {{is thought to}} begin with a virion {{attaching}} to specific cell-surface receptors such as C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, or integrins, which is followed by fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The virions taken up by the cell then travel to acidic endosomes and lysosomes where the viral envelope glycoprotein GP is cleaved. This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid. The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the <b>cellular</b> <b>membrane</b> from which they bud. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.|$|E
