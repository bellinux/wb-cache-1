There are many stories of New Zealand sportswomen’s success that should be celebrated, and {{there is little doubt that}} visibility, opportunities, public support and recognition have improved over time. In this first section of the book, we focus on research that highlights some of those achievements. The early 2000 s feature a generation of young Kiwi women who are succeeding in sports their mothers and grandmothers never imagined; snowboarding, downhill mountain biking and kite surfing, to name a few. At the same time, their mothers are <b>charting</b> <b>new</b> <b>territory,</b> learning how motherhood can enhance their abilities to act as sport leaders.

Not surprisingly, each generation tends to take for granted the opportunities their mothers gained for them and looks ahead to the next challenge. As Holly Thorpe’s chapter points out, young sportswomen today may be employing a new brand of activism – called Third Wave Feminism – that looks and feels markedly different from what has gone before.

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} whether library andinformation science (LIS) doctoral research atNorth American institutions has, over the lasteighty or so years, displayed a clear trendtoward addressing topics other than thoseassociated with librarianship and traditionallibrary functions; and whether one can discern,in this regard, any significant differencesamong those institutions. Design – Conceptual content analysis ofdissertation titles and abstracts. Setting – North American universities withAmerican Library Association accredited LISprograms {{in the period}} 1930 through 2009. Subjects – The titles and, to the extentavailable, the abstracts of 3, 230 LIS doctoraldissertations completed at these institutionsduring this period. Methods – Having opted for a directed, singlecategorytype content analysis, the researchersbegan by pre-establishing a group of termswhich they assumed could “represent the corecurriculum of the master’s in library science”:terms which they surmised would therefore beable to function, where they appeared in “therecords of doctoral output”, as good indicatorsthat that output itself can rightly be judged tohave had “an explicit focus onlibraries/librarianship” (pp. 36, 44). The termsselected were: “librar*”, “catalog*”, “circulat*”,“collection develop*”, “collection manag*”,“school media”, and “reference” (where “*” indicates truncation, and that any term beginning with the respective letter string was acceptable). The researchers then simply tallied {{for each of the}} 3, 230 dissertations under investigation how many times {{one or more of the}} pre-chosen terms occurred in its title and in its abstract, not recording which term or terms that occurred. (They do not make entirely clear to what extent data collection was computerized.) They subsequently analyzed the data longitudinally and by institution, with only one, nominal and dichotomous, variable for the title as well as for the abstract: whether or not any of the pre-chosen terms occurred at least once. Multiple occurrences, whether of the same term or of varying terms, played no role. Their analysis for the entire period of 1930 through 2009 was based on title data only, and did not take doctorate-granting institution into account. The separate analysis (N= 2, 305) for the period 1980 through 2009 excluded the thirty cases in which one or more of the terms occurred in the title but none of them occurred in the abstract. Main Results – One occurrence of any of the specified terms in the title was, for the overall period of 1930 - 2009, enough for any given dissertation to be qualified as having an explicit focus on libraries/librarianship. The percentage of such dissertations remained fairly stable from the 1930 s through the 1980 s, at between 56 % and 62 %, with the exception of an unexplained dip for the 1950 s to 44. 1 %. Then, for the 1990 s, the researchers discovered a fall-off from 57. 9 % to 36. 0 %, and in the following decade a further decrease, down to a level of 21. 5 %. During the separately-analyzed period 1980 - 2009, the percentage of dissertations with at least one of the specified terms in the title as well as in the abstract diminished steadily from well over half (58. 4 %) for 1980 - 1984 to less than 1 in 5 (19. 8 %) for 2005 - 2009. A chi-square test revealed that the relationship between year of dissertation and term occurrence is statistically significant. By far the greatest decrease, of 15 percentage points, was that between the first half and the second half of the 1990 s. Interestingly, during the whole thirty-year period, the percentage where a term appeared not in the title but only in the abstract remained fairly constant, at around 20 %, give or take about 2. 5 percentage points. Yet when one looks at how many of the dissertations displayed none of the terms in the title and none in the abstract, one sees a continuous increase starting at 20. 7 % for 1980 - 1984 all the way up to 61. 0 % for 2005 - 2009, with the sharpest climb, of more than 17 percentage points, occurring around the mid- 1990 s. The distinction between the year 1980 and the year 2009 is even greater: from just over 1 in 7 (14. 7 %) to more than 3 out of 5 (62. 2 %). The analysis by institution revealed a statistically significant relationship for the period 1980 - 2009 between institution at which the dissertation was written and the occurrence of any of the terms at least once in both title and abstract. Certain institutions (most notably SUNY-Albany, Syracuse, Missouri, Hawaii, Montréal, and Long Island) showed a much higher than average overall level of no occurrence, and some (Michigan in particular, but also, for example, Florida State and the University of North Carolina) displayed a remarkably consistent decline in occurrence. Conclusion – The researchers conclude that their study, insofar as North America is concerned, “has provided empirical evidence for... the lessening focus in LIS dissertations on topics commonly associated with librarianship” and that it “supports the assertion that this focus varies significantly between schools—with some schools demonstrating a more explicit connection to library-related topics than other schools” (p. 43). They are unsure how best to interpret these findings or how they could be applied, but they do offer certain suggestions for possible interpretations and pose a few questions regarding what those interpretations might imply (p. 44). One could, they suggest, argue that the terms employed in the study “are themselves antiquated, and dissertations are <b>charting</b> <b>new</b> <b>territory,</b> pushing the boundaries of both research and practice. ” Another possibility is that “while the dissertations may not be immediately applied work, the work could be utilized for application. ” On the other hand, it may simply be the case that the selected terms indeed remain trustworthy indicators, and that doctoral candidates “are no longer studying topics that are relevant to the practical field” of librarianship. One could perhaps even justifiably assert that LIS is in effect no longer a single unified discipline but, rather, has split into a library field and an information field, whereby the latter has been steadily gaining the upper hand in LIS programs, albeit less so at some institutions than at others. In pondering the above alternatives for interpretation of this study’s results, the library practitioner will probably also be inclined to reflect, the authors suggest, on the prospects for adequate academic research support of actual library practice, while keeping in mind, furthermore, that the formal education of future practitioners will largely remain in the hands of those trained as LIS doctoral students. To what extent will these educators feel an affinity with, and possess an understanding of, the world of practical librarianship...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{expands the}} {{discourse}} surrounding digital forms of making by scrutinizing {{the role of}} materials within computation, ultimately proposing a speculative working model that <b>charts</b> <b>new</b> <b>territory.</b> The growing importance of materials within technological research makes this an appropriate time to consider the nuance of their role within it. Currently, material innovation is happening along two central tracks: the customized cutting, sculpting, and forming of conventional materials with Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) fabrication equipment {{and the development of}} new materials through innovations in material science. Both tracks rely on a limited set of material protocols which enable process-based control and eliminate the intrusion of any unpredictable material variable. Although efficient, such an approach limits architecture's ability to procure novel material engagements. A few designers are developing an alternative model where computational codes are coupled with eccentric materials to produce unusual results. Digital materiallurgy, as I have called it, is part technique and part attitude, it relies on intentionally ceding limited design control to unpredictable matter thus capitalizing on matter's innate ability to produce unexpected formal and material complexity. Digital materiallurgy identifies the intersection of computation and eccentric materiality as a departure point for architectural innovation. By purposefully inserting material heterogeneity and inconsistency into computational means and methods, this work pries apart the apparently seamless relationship between digital design and physical production. By blurring the distinction between physical material and digital form, this work offers an integrated aesthetic experience, one that fetishizes neither the virtual nor the vintage but fuses both into a richer, wilder present...|$|R

With an intensely practical approach, the guide takes the reader through the process of using digital technologies for this important and valuable work. It outlines a series of fun and engaging projects on which the practitioner and young person can work together, including photo collages, making soundtracks, creating cartoons, and filming guided walks. Clear step-by-step instructions are provided, with information and advice for those unfamiliar with the technology. Digital life story work also considers: *why life story work is so important and what can be achieved; *how to work successfully with young people, including negotiating expectations, setting boundaries and managing risks; points to consider when setting up and undertaking a project; * how to prepare and edit visual and audio material to produce something the young person can be proud of. While the products created by this technology may be videos or photo collages, rather than traditional life story books, the therapeutic process of building a relationship with a supportive adult while reflecting on their lives will be immensely important for the young person’s self-esteem and identity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} history of unwanted pregnancy and abortion in La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia between 1952 and 2010. Although in Bolivia abortion is illegal, an estimated three in five women terminate at least one pregnancy in their lifetime—making the country’s abortion rate {{the highest in the}} region. Based on 113 personal interviews and over 3, 000 medical records, the project reconstructs two central aspects of reproductive history. The first centers on the social, political, and medical phenomena of abortion and pregnancy. I outline changing policies and debates on reproduction, the evolution of abortion incidence and provisioning, and the emergence of a stable illegal abortion system in the country. A central argument of the project is that women’s experiences with illegal abortion helped shape both the evolution of reproductive health policy and changes in abortion provisioning in the country. In particular, I find that women’s demand for abortion coalesced with broader processes set in motion by the democratic opening of 1982 to spark the emergence of a stable and efficient illegal abortion network in these cities. This illegal network provided a response to women’s need to control their reproduction while simultaneously slowing efforts to legalize the procedure. The final two chapters of the dissertation <b>chart</b> <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> in {{the history of}} reproduction by exploring women’s personal experiences with unwanted pregnancy and abortion. In these ethnographic chapters, I analyze interview testimony to uncover the complex range of factors influencing women’s feelings and reactions toward pregnancy and motherhood. I argue that the language of “choice” often employed by reproductive rights movements is too narrow to adequately capture the contours of human experience. Instead, women’s decisions to continue or terminate their pregnancies were often so heavily conditioned by adverse circumstances that most felt they {{had no choice but to}} do so...|$|R
40|$|The {{heart of}} {{education}} beats with a teacher's perception of instructional effectiveness with students. Research suggests that differentiated instruction, using multiple modes of presentation, will positively increase a student's opportunity for earning. Communicating efficiently will enhance a teacher's instructional effectiveness and a student's ability to understand. This study begins by examining selected modes of communication available to educators and poses {{questions of the}} validity of these modes within schools. It explores theories of the changing expectations of how people want to be given information or want to have information available via electronic means and how this could change the way educators communicate to students individually and collectively. Seen for many years as something special, the Internet and related electronic tools were available only to techno-wizards and data-loving geeks. They have now become part of everyday life. People routinely integrate them into the ways they communicate with each other, moving between phone, computer, and face to face encounters without deliberation. Blogs are one of those tools. Blogging appears to offer multiple opportunities for teacher and student use. Writing in a blog by both student and teacher may strengthen their relationship while also providing a unique means of communicating instruction more effectively. Through electronic surveys and virtual interviews of blogging K- 12 teachers, as well as document analysis of their blogs, this study examines blogging in classrooms within the United States to determine how blogging is used for communication and instruction. This study also considers the teacher's perception of how blogging has changed their instructional practice. This examination of blogging educators, or edubloggers, <b>charts</b> <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> and informs the educational community on the potential of blogging to support classroom communication and promote increased learning for the Digital Age studen...|$|R
5000|$|Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle {{noted that}} [...] "Dark Side recalls Clarkson's under-appreciated My December disc, {{a swirl of}} lullaby strains and goth-pop grooves. Think Katy Perry with a much, much better voice." [...] Jason Scott of Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked, [...] ""Dark Side," [...] takes Stronger and banks a hard left. With a {{xylophone}} tinkling out a lullaby-like intro, Clarkson takes a creative adventure into extraterrestrial territory that is an oddly soothing and intriguing fit for her voice. You {{did not ask for}} The Twilight Zone, but somehow with an electrically tender arrangement, Clarkson transports you there." [...] He later described the song as [...] "a crafty pop hook with Owl City influence that does not let up on skeletal drums, <b>charts</b> <b>new</b> <b>territory</b> for the Idol without venturing too far from the working formula." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard remarked, [...] "On this thoughtful mid-tempo track, Clarkson dials back her vocal power on the verses and pleads with a guy to embrace her flaws." [...] During her performance of the song during the VH1 Unplugged: Kelly Clarkson special, Kat George of VH1 remarked [...] "In fact, this is what we love best about Kelly — that she’s just a regular girl. Acknowledging the pitfalls of her personality, Kelly invites us all to be imperfect without letting us (or herself) be any less perfectly loveable." [...] Brian Mansfield of USA Today described the track's music-box intro as [...] "nightmarish" [...] and stated that the song [...] "could wind up being a favorite song of psycho girlfriends everywhere, because it's a set-up." [...] On March 5, 2013 Billboard ranked the song #70 in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time.|$|R
