5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax,</b> many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E

40|$|Economic theory {{states that}} on market with {{imperfect}} competition, per unit <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> should induce a larger increase of prices than ad valorem <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes.</b> It implies that consumers bear {{a larger share}} of the tax burden for per unit <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> than for ad valorem <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes.</b> The present paper aims at testing empirically this theoretical result.

40|$|It {{is known}} that, {{in the context}} of a real {{business}} cycle model with constant returns to scale and a balanced budget fiscal policy rule, steady state indeterminacy may arise as a result of endogenously determined labor income tax rates. This happens for a range of empirically plausible tax rates and this range is amplified if government expenditures are financed by a combination of capital and labor income taxes. This paper revisits the issue of indeterminacy and aggregate instability when government expenditures may be financed by <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> as well. It is shown that by introducing <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes,</b> the ranges of indeterminacies shrink, thus reducing the possibility of aggregate instability. The results also add one more argument in favor of (the less distortionary) <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> in place of capital taxesFiscal policy, <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes,</b> balanced budget rules, indeterminacy. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{government}} of Canada {{has reduced the}} Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate by 2 -percentage points {{over the past several}} years. This tax measure seems to be welcomed by the public and some public policy observers; however, it is also associated with certain economic and social costs. This paper aims to assess the rightness of the GST reduction. To that end, the paper summarizes research findings regarding economic costs and levels of distortion associated with alternate tax measures. The paper also contrasts Canada’s reliance on <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> with general trends prevailing in other industrialized countries. The analysis shows that <b>taxing</b> <b>consumption</b> {{is one of the most}} economically effective methods of generating government revenues, whereas the reduction of <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> yields the least optimal economic pay-off compared to other tax measures. The growing importance of value-added taxation is the clearest tax policy trend in the OECD countries, whereas reducing the GST rate will further diminish the importance of <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> in Canada with no noticeable dollar value savings for households. <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes,</b> GST, Goods and Services Tax, composition of government revenue...|$|R

In contrast, a welfare promoting policy would be to cut capital taxes, while concurrently increasing labour or <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> to make up for the loss in capital tax revenue...|$|R
