Para tanto, foram calculados o risco de base destas operações, as razões de hedge ótimas e as efetividades nas principais praças de comercialização de gado bovino do país entre setembro de 1995 e fevereiro de 2001. As mesmas análises foram {{realizadas}} para o hedge do boi gordo. A razão de hedge ótima se mostrou elevada no <b>cross</b> <b>hedge</b> (entre 37 % e 49 %) e no own hedge (entre 58 % e 63 %). Quanto à efetividade, constatou-se que no caso do own hedge, o risco de preço pode ser reduzido em cerca de 50 % com a tomada de posição em contratos futuros na proporção de hedge ótima. No entanto, para o <b>cross</b> <b>hedge,</b> a efetividade foi bastante baixa - cerca de 1, 5 %. Isso se deve ao alto risco de base destas operações, aproximadamente 80 % superior ao risco associado ao hedge do boi gordo nas semanas de vencimento dos contratos considerados neste período. Dessa forma, os resultados demonstram o acerto da BM&F quanto ao recente lançamento do contrato de bezerro. The aim of {{the study}} is to analyze the feeder cattle <b>cross</b> <b>hedge</b> at BM&F Futures Market verifying the real need of the existence of futures contract for this commodity. Basis risk of these operations was calculated, as well as the optimal hedge ratios and the respective effectiveness in the main commercialization regions of bovine cattle in Brazil, for the period comprised between September of 1995 and February of 2001. The same analyzes were carried for the live cattle hedge. The optimum hedge ratio appeared high in the <b>cross</b> <b>hedge</b> (between 37 % and 49 %) and in the own hedge (between 58 % and 63 %). The own hedge figures mean a 50 % reduction in price risk when hedging at the optimal ratio, a value that drops consistently to about 1, 5 % for all regions when the <b>cross</b> <b>hedge</b> is considered. The main conclusion {{of the study is}} that the BM&F live cattle future markets are quite effective as a price risk reduction strategy for the own hedge operations, but lack effectiveness in this sense for the feeder cattle <b>cross</b> <b>hedge.</b> That is caused by the high basis risk of these operations, around 80 % higher than the risk associated to the live cattle hedge during the contract maturity week considered in this period.

40|$|The {{substantial}} increase in corn use by the ethanol refinery industry (Figure 1) has resulted in livestock producers, especially cattle feeders, substituting distiller’s grain (DG) for corn in feed rations. DG futures markets do not exist, but actively traded corn and soybean meal (SBM) futures are the most probable markets for hedging DG price risk. Therefore, the ability to offset DG price risk using corn and SBM futures is incorporated into analysis to quantify the strength of price relationships. If DG prices and corn or SBM futures prices are strongly related, then a viable <b>cross</b> <b>hedging</b> opportunity might exist. If they are not related, then <b>cross</b> <b>hedging</b> DG price risk in corn or SBM could increase risk. The growing importance of DG markets demonstrates a need for information regarding price relationships in the industry.

For a set of 20 futures markets, that are divided into four groups (financial, agricultural, mineral, and currency futures), we analyze the model using both standard test procedures as well as the specification error bounds introduced by Hansen & Jagannathan (1997).

40|$|Price {{variability}} is {{a potential}} source of risk {{in the market for}} whole cottonseed. Conventional risk management practices for similar commodities consist of longer term storage, forward contracting, and hedging using futures markets as a means to combat unfavorable price movements. However, no futures market currently exists for whole cottonseed, limiting users and growers in their marketing planning and approaches for risk reduction. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine cottonseed supply and usage patterns within Texas and to analyze the feasibility of price risk management strategies by <b>cross</b> <b>hedging</b> cash cottonseed with soybean and soybean meal futures. Results from a survey disseminated to Texas cotton gins gave credibility to the idea that finding an alternative method to managing price risk would be economically beneficial. The relationship between cash and futures prices is significant enough to warrant further investigation and hedge ratios allowing for the proper risk coverage for a seller of seed are estimated. Additionally, a measurement of hedge effectiveness is considered and results in <b>cross</b> <b>hedges</b> using either soybean or soybean meal contracts that reasonably reduce risk when compared to an unhedged position. Practical testing from a seller?s perspective using historical data produced outcomes that showed that net effective prices from <b>cross</b> <b>hedging</b> are typically higher than unhedged cash prices over the considered time period. Though past performance is not an indicator of future outcomes, this presents an additional potential outlet for cotton gins to market cottonseed aside from the traditional methods, and possibly improve their financial position and profitability.

In the frame of active portfolio also the ETFs with negative leverage factors can be applied for the hedge or <b>cross</b> <b>hedge</b> of a portfolio. These hedging possibilities will be analyzed in this paper. Short ETFs exist with different leverage factors. In Europe, the leverage factors 1 (e. g. ShortDAX ETF) and 2 (e. g.

The results show e. g. that higher leverage factors achieve higher profits as well as losses. In the case, that a bearish market is supposed, minimizing the variance of the hedge seem not to be until to get better hedging results, due to a very skewed return distribution of the hedge. The risk measure target-shortfall-probability confirms the use of the standard hedge weightings which depend only on the leverage factor. This characteristic remains, when a portfolio has to be hedged instead of the underlying index of the short ETF. For portfolios which have a low correlation with the index return should not be used high leverage factors for hedging, due to the higher volatility and target-shortfall-probability...|$|E

40|$|Estimates are made, {{from time}} series data on real gross {{domestic}} products, {{of the standard}} deoiation of returns in markets for perpetual claims on countries ’ incomes. The results indicate {{that there is much}} fundamental uncertainty to be hedged. Evidence is shmun that there may be only minimal ability to <b>cross</b> <b>hedge</b> these returns in existing capital markets. Methods of establishing markets fm perpetual claims on aggregate incomes are examined. Such markets, by allowing hedging of these aggregate income risks, might make for dramatically more effective international macroeconomic risk sharing than is possible today. Retail institutions are described that might develop such markets and help the public with their risk management. However, the establishment of such markets would also incur the risk of major financial bubbles and panics. This paper provides estimates of the amount of risk in aggregate incomes of countries around the world, and discusses mechanisms, futures markets, that might be set up to allow the hedging of such risk. The risk that will be studied here is risk of fluctuations in Market present values of long streams of aggregate income flows. Hedging markets might best be set up {{in such a way that}} the markets establish such present values. The empirical work presented here allows us to assess the price variability in such hedging markets. Markets for perpetual claims, in particular, perpetual futures (Shiller 1993) would allow trading of perpetual income streams and the price discovery would reveal present values. The perpetual futures markets would be cash settled based on measures of aggregate income, with a settlement formula that involves a regular capital gain and loss component, so that the futures price would work out to be the price of a claim on a perpetual income stream. By allowing hedging of the capital value of a stream of income, the hedging markets (let us call them macro markets) would allow hedging of the kind of longer-run macroeconomic risk that really matters to individuals.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal production, export allocation and hedging decisions of a risk-averse international firm that exports to several foreign markets with different currencies. The firm faces multiple exchange rate risks. Optimal decisions are analyzed under two scenarios. In the first, {{there is a}} forward market for one currency only. Then, the export allocation to different markets is separable from the firm's preferences and the joint distribution of the exchange rates. In contrast, total production is not separable except for a special case. In the second scenario, there is a forward market for each currency. Then, both production and export allocation are separable. Hedging with forward contracts depends on risk premia and the joint distribution of the exchange rates. If tradable exchange rate risk is a linear function of untradable exchange rate risk plus noise, there is a conflict between <b>cross</b> <b>hedging</b> and taking a basis risk.
