OBJECTIVE: To describe the electrocardiographic changes in chronic obstructive lung disease patients. METHODS: The electrical axis of the various waves of the ECG using the hexiaxial reference system in 92 Nigerian patients with COLD were examined, 39 of whom had associated <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale,.</b> P wave axis greater than 900 was present in 2 (19. 1 %) of 17 patients with COLD alone and 15 (41. 7 %) out of 36 with development of <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> (p< 0. 001). The mean P wave axis was 64. 7 ± 10. 6 0 in those without <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> while it was significantly shifted to the right (83. 90) in those with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale.</b> The mean QRS axis was 53. 50 ± 21. 20 and 89. 0 ± 12. 40 in those without and with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> respectively (p= 0. 7716).

40|$|To analyze plasma myostatin {{levels and}} {{investigate}} {{their relationship with}} right ventricular (RV) function in patients with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> secondary to <b>chronic</b> obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study recruited 81 patients with advanced COPD and 40 age-matched controls. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: those with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> and those without. Echocardiography was used to evaluate RV function and morphology, and the value of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) less than 16 mm was considered RV dysfunction. Plasma myostatin levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were analyzed as a comparison of myostatin. The data detected <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> in 39 / 81 patients, with the mean value of TAPSE of 14. 3 mm. Plasma myostatin levels (ng/mL) were significantly higher in patients with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> (16. 68 ± 2. 95) than in those without (13. 56 ± 3. 09), and much higher than in controls (8. 79 ± 2. 79), with each p< 0. 01. Significant differences were also found in plasma BNP levels among the three groups (p< 0. 05). Multivariate regression analysis suggested that myostatin levels were significantly correlated with the values of TAPSE and RV myocardium performance index among the COPD patients, and that BNP levels were significantly correlated only with systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, with each p< 0. 05. Plasma myostatin levels are increased in COPD patients who have <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale.</b> Stronger correlations of plasma myostatin levels with echocardiographic indexes of the right heart suggest that myostatin might be superior to BNP in the early diagnosis of <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> in COPD...|$|R

The increased mortality associated with <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale</b> and severe hypoxia was reduced 3 0 % and 4 0 %, respectively, by {{this form of}} therapy when contrasted to other results reported in the literature. Continuous oxygen therapy does not prevent the late development of <b>cor</b> <b>pulmonale,</b> but it does make management significantly more effective when used with an overall care program.
