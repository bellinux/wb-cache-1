25|$|Paine {{was arrested}} in France on December 28, 1793. Joel Barlow was {{unsuccessful}} in securing Paine’s release by circulating a petition among American residents in Paris. Sixteen American citizens were allowed to plead for Paine’s release to the Convention, yet President Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier of the Committee of General Security refused to acknowledge Paine’s American citizenship, stating he was an Englishman and a citizen of a country at war with France. Paine himself protested and claimed {{that he was a}} citizen of the U.S., which was an ally of Revolutionary France, rather than of Great Britain, which was by that time at war with France. However, Gouverneur Morris, the American minister to France, did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment. Paine narrowly escaped execution. A <b>chalk</b> <b>mark</b> was supposed to be left by the gaoler on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside; this was {{due to the fact that}} the door of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794).|$|E
500|$|Michigan {{defeated}} Iowa, 9–3. In {{the first}} quarter, Harry Kipke punted from midfield, and his kick grazed an Iowa lineman. [...] Iowa's Wesley Fry let the ball roll {{into the end}} zone, not realizing it had been touched {{by one of his}} teammates. [...] Jack Blott, Michigan's 200-pound center, raced down the field and jumped on the ball. [...] Referee James Masker awarded a touchdown to Michigan. [...] Iowa fans, having not seen the ball touch any of the Hawkeyes, reacted angrily to the ruling. [...] Blott won praise for his [...] "quick thinking" [...] in racing to recover the fumble, with one writer noting:When Jack Blott, Michigan's star center, fell on a loose ball, in back of the goal line in the recent Michigan-Iowa game, he performed a feat which is rarely accomplished on the gridiron. [...] Not only did it win the contest for the Wolverines, but it marked {{one of the few times}} wherein a center is credited with having scored a touchdown...

2500|$|Mitchell {{continued}} {{experimenting with}} synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers for the recordings of her next album, 1988's <b>Chalk</b> <b>Mark</b> in a Rain Storm. She also collaborated with artists including Willie Nelson, Billy Idol, Wendy & Lisa, Tom Petty, Don Henley, Peter Gabriel, and Benjamin Orr of the Cars. The album's first official single, [...] "My Secret Place", {{was in fact}} a duet with Gabriel, and just missed the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The song [...] "Lakota" [...] was one of many songs on the album to take on larger political themes, in this case the Wounded Knee incident, the deadly battle between Native American activists and the FBI on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the previous decade. Musically, several songs fit into the trend of world music popularized by Gabriel during the era. Reviews were mostly favorable towards the album, and the cameos by well-known musicians brought it considerable attention. <b>Chalk</b> <b>Mark</b> ultimately improved on the chart performance of Dog Eat Dog, peaking at No. 45.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> can {{be easily}} wiped off with a damp cloth, a sponge or a special {{blackboard}} eraser usually consisting of a block of wood covered by a felt pad. However, <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> made on some types of wet blackboard {{can be difficult to}} remove. Blackboard manufacturers often advise that a new or newly resurfaced blackboard be completely covered using the side of a stick of chalk and then that chalk brushed off as normal to prepare it for use.|$|R

50|$|The vaquejada is a sport typical to the Nordeste {{region of}} Brazil, {{in which two}} cowboys ("vaqueiros") on horseback pursue a bull, seeking to pin it between the two horses and direct it to a goal (often {{consisting}} of <b>chalk</b> <b>marks),</b> where the animal is then knocked over.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, Herbie Hancock, a {{longtime}} associate {{and friend of}} Mitchell's, released , an album paying tribute to Mitchell's work. Among the album's contributors were Norah Jones, Tina Turner, Leonard Cohen, and Mitchell herself, who contributed a vocal to the re-recording of [...] "The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)" [...] (originally on her album <b>Chalk</b> <b>Mark</b> in a Rain Storm). On February 10, 2008, Hancock's recording won Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. It {{was the first time}} in 43 years that a jazz artist took the top prize at the annual award ceremony. In accepting the award, Hancock paid tribute to Mitchell as well as to Miles Davis and John Coltrane. At the same ceremony Mitchell won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Pop Performance for the opening track, [...] "One Week Last Summer", from her album Shine.|$|E
2500|$|In the Iowa game on November 3, 1923, Blott scored Michigan’s only {{touchdown}} {{in a close}} 9-3 win over the 1922 Big Ten champions. [...] Blott’s score was described as “a very fluky touchdown, earned through the Blott’s quick thinking." [...] One writer wrote: “When Jack Blott, Michigan’s star center, fell on a loose ball, {{in back of the}} goal line in the recent Michigan-Iowa game, he performed a feat which is rarely accomplished on the gridiron. [...] Not only did it win the contest for the Wolverines, but it marked {{one of the few times}} wherein a center is credited with having scored a touchdown. ...

60|$|The two men {{had stopped}} {{opposite}} the window. Some <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which I could see in one of them. The other was a very small, dark fellow, with his hat pushed back and several packages under his arm.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the turn}} each coin that is {{completely}} within a 'bed' (between two horizontal lines and within the bordering vertical lines) scores a point for that player in that bed. The points are scored with <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> in the squares {{at either end of the}} bed on the edge of the board, one player owning the right side, the other, the left. The aim is to get three <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> in each of the squares - three scores in each of the nine beds. However, once three scores have been made in a bed, any further scores in that bed will be given to the opponent instead, unless the opponent already has three scores in the bed. The one exception to this is the winning point which must be scored properly by the winning player, not given away.|$|R
60|$|In {{the hours}} that passed before nightfall, Philip related to Claire how Pierre's {{warnings}} had excited his uneasiness; {{and how the}} discovery of the <b>chalk</b> <b>marks,</b> on the doors, had confirmed him in his conviction that some evil was intended; and explained the steps they had taken for providing for an escape from the city.|$|R

5000|$|When dishonest {{carnival}} game operators {{found someone}} who they could entice {{to keep playing}} their rigged (slang term: [...] "gaffed") game, they would then [...] "mark" [...] the individual by patting their back with a hand that had chalk on it. Other game operators would then look for these <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> and entice the individuals to also play their rigged game.|$|R

Fowler did this, and drew a <b>chalk</b> <b>mark</b> about it, numbering it [...] "Position No. 1." [...] Immediately after his return to his seat the table was strongly pushed away from the psychic. It moved in impulses, an inch or two at a time, until it was certainly six or eight inches farther from the psychic.|$|E
25|$|In art schools {{classrooms}} or studios, {{the model}} usually poses on a raised platform called the model stand or dais. In sculpture studios this platform may be built to rotate {{to allow for}} a 360° view for every artist. Long poses are generally required for painting (hours or days) and sculpture (perhaps days). To aid in resuming a long pose after a break, <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> and/or masking tape are often placed on the model stand.|$|R
2500|$|Many non-climbers also {{object to}} the {{appearance}} of climbing <b>chalk</b> <b>marks,</b> anchors, bolts and slings on visible cliffs. Since these features are small, visual impacts can be mitigated through the selection of neutral, rock-matching colors for bolt hangers, webbing and chalk. The use of certain types of climbing gear is banned altogether at some crags due {{to the risk of}} damage to the rock face. In such cases, [...] climbers use knotted slings and ropes for climbing protection.|$|R

There is shelving beneath three benches containing various machine parts. Parts are also lying on the floor. <b>Chalk</b> <b>marks</b> on the walls indicate oil types.|$|R
6000|$|As soon as {{they had}} donned their uniforms, the boys {{returned}} to the gymnasium, where they were placed in what was called an awkward squad, and which was {{under the direction of}} Dan Soppinger.

60|$|Rollo looked, {{and found}} that Jonas had put down {{quite a number of}} chalk marks along in a line, where they had first began to mark the place where the shadow of the door reached into. Rollo and Lucy had {{forgotten}} all about their plan of making such a series of observations; but Jonas had gone on regularly, making a mark every Monday, at noon, precisely. As the sun, at that season of the year, was going round farther and farther to the south every week, it shone in farther and farther upon the floor, so that each <b>chalk</b> <b>mark</b> was farther in than the one made the week before.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a short}} pause, the {{schoolmaster}} evidently {{taking time}} to consider, for, after all, life, even {{in a place like}} Cockerham, was sweet in comparison with what might be expected in the society of the odoriferous one whose mirth was so decidedly ill-timed and unmusical. The silence was not of long continuance, however, for the Evil One began to fear that a detestably early cock might crow, and thereby rescue the trembling one from his clutches. In his impatience, therefore, he knocked upon the floor with his cloven hoof and whistled loudly, after the manner followed now-a-days by dirty little patrons of the drama, perched high in the gallery of a twopenny theatre, and again danced rapidly round the ring in what the tenant deemed unnecessary proximity to the <b>chalk</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} a small parking lot on its {{property}} that slopes down from Union Place. Another large lot is across Summit Avenue, accessible from Broad Street. In the 1990s, a multistory parking garage was built on part of the Broad Street lot. In {{the days after the}} September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the city made <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> on the tires of the many unclaimed vehicles in it for every day they remained there, to help identify those missing.|$|R
5000|$|Race knife {{also known}} as a timber scribe (scorer, tree marker) is a knife with a U-shaped end {{sometimes}} called a scoop knife for cutting marks in wood by lumbermen, carpenters, coopers, surveyors, and others. The reasons for making marks varies and includes keeping count (tally marks), identifying parts (carpenter's marks), numbering, and tracing patterns around a template as a part of marking out. The gouges left by the timber scribe are more durable than pencil or <b>chalk</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For Throne of Blood, in {{the scene}} where Washizu (Mifune) is {{attacked}} with arrows by his own men, the director had archers shoot real arrows, hollowed out and running along wires, toward Toshiro Mifune {{from a distance of}} about ten feet, with the actor carefully following <b>chalk</b> <b>marks</b> on the ground to avoid being hit. (Some of the arrows missed him by an inch; the actor, who admitted that he was not merely acting terrified in the film, suffered nightmares afterward.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucy {{asked him}} what he was {{thinking}} of, and he told her. He then took Lucy into the barn, and showed her the <b>chalk</b> <b>mark</b> upon the floor. She looked on with a good deal of interest, and said she thought it was an excellent plan; and she wished there was a great barn with a south floor at their house. Lucy knew more about the subject than Rollo did, and she gave him some explanations about it. [...] "You see," [...] said she, [...] "that the sun rises in the east every morning, and comes up higher and higher, every hour, till noon; and then it begins to go down again, and at last it sets in the west. But, at some times in the year, it comes up higher at noon than it does at other times, and so it does not shine so much into the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I vaulted {{up to the}} sill. Thank heaven, I was athletic. Not a {{soul was}} about: but I heard a noise of muffled voices in the other rooms behind. Treading cat-like across the floor, I turned {{the key in the}} lock. A <b>chalk</b> <b>mark</b> still showed the {{position}} of the pistol on the ground exactly as you flung it. The box was on the table, and I saw at a glance, the wires which connected it with the battery had never been disconnected. I was afraid of receiving a shock if I touched them with my hands, and I had no time to waste in discovering electrical attachments. So I pulled out my knife, and you can fancy with what trembling hands I cut that wire on either side and released the box from its dangerous connections. I knew only too well the force of that current. Then I took the thing under my arm, leaped from the window once more, and ran across the shrubbery towards the spot where I'd left my bicycle.|$|E
60|$|The {{man looked}} up from the sheet of {{notepaper}} which he held in his hand, and gazed through the open French windows before which he was standing. It was a very pleasant and very peaceful prospect. There was his croquet lawn, smooth-shaven, the hoops neatly arranged, the <b>chalk</b> <b>mark</b> firm and distinct upon the boundary. Beyond, the tennis court, the flower gardens, and to the left the walled fruit garden. A little farther away was the paddock and orchard, and a little farther still the farm, which {{for the last four years}} had been the joy of his life. His meadows were yellow with buttercups; a thin line of willows showed where the brook wound its lazy way through the bottom fields. It was a home, this, in which a man could well lead a peaceful life, could dream away his days to the music of the west wind, the gurgling stream, the song of birds, and the low murmuring of insects. Peter Ruff stood like a man turned to stone, for even as he looked these things passed away from before his eyes, the roar of the world beat in his ears--the world of intrigue, of crime, the world where the strong man hewed his way to power, and the weaklings fell like corn before the sickle.|$|E

She was also well aware that she would certainly {{have to pick up}} as many baskets of chips as should be indicated by the line of <b>chalk</b> <b>marks.</b> She, therefore, resumed her work, inwardly resolving that she would not speak another word. All this time, Mary Bell went on with her drawing, without apparently paying any attention to the conversation between Bella and her mother.|$|R
