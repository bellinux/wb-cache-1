5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, the phrase is not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history. Historians question {{whether it was}} ever used as a customary salute. It was more likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals <b>condemned</b> <b>to</b> die, and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors.|$|E

5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is <b>condemned</b> <b>to</b> hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been <b>condemned</b> <b>to</b> hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

Some of their early unpopularity came about because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going.

Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.|$|E

5|$|My {{conclusion}} is, accordingly, {{that there}} is no evidence whatever for the much-quoted salute of the gladiators. The only two ancient references, those in Suetonius and in Dio, refer not to gladiators but to naumachiarii, men <b>condemned</b> <b>to</b> die, and even these references are to one specific episode, the circumstances of which indicate that the supposed salute was not even a regular salute of the naumachiarii.|$|E
5|$|Public {{entertainments}} {{varied from}} combat between just two gladiators, to large-scale events with potentially thousands of deaths. The naumachia (also called navalia proelia by the Romans) {{was one of}} the latter, a large-scale and bloody spectacular combative event taking place on many ships and held in large lakes or flooded arenas. Prisoners of war and criminals <b>condemned</b> <b>to</b> die were tasked with enacting naval battles to the death for public entertainment. Those selected were known as naumachiarii.|$|E

The other five were hanged and then burned on the Gallow Green in Paisley on 10 June 1697, the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe.|$|E
