This includes aerial operations, day and night navigation, camp setup and security, evasion, escape, interventions and ambushes.|$|R
5000|$|Search and Destroy, Seek and Destroy, or even simply S&D, {{refers to}} a {{military}} strategy that became a large component of the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. The idea was to insert ground forces into hostile territory, search out the enemy, destroy them, and withdraw immediately afterward. The strategy {{was the result of}} a new technology, the helicopter, which resulted in a new form of warfare, the fielding of air cavalry, and was thought to be ideally suited to <b>counter-guerrilla</b> jungle <b>warfare.</b> The complementary conventional strategy, which entailed attacking and conquering an enemy position, then fortifying and holding it indefinitely, was known as [...] "clear and hold" [...] or [...] "clear and secure." [...] In theory, since the traditional methods of [...] "taking ground" [...] could not be used in this war, a war of attrition would be used, eliminating the enemy by the use of [...] "searching" [...] for them, then [...] "destroying" [...] them, and the [...] "body count" [...] would be the measuring tool to determine the success of the strategy of [...] "search and destroy." [...] It is common practice among military forces to enforce strict rules on a search and destroy mission.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, success of revolutionary warfare {{techniques}} against conventional armies in China, Indochina, Algeria, and Cuba led the conventional armies {{in the developed}} and underdeveloped worlds to concentrate on finding military and political strategies to fight domestic revolutionary warfare. This led to an adoption of what Stepan called, in 1973, [...] "New Professionalism." [...] The New Professionalism was formulated and propagated in Brazil through the Escola Superior de Guerra, which had been established in 1949. By 1963 New Professionalism had come to dominate the school, when it declared its primary mission to be preparing [...] "civilians and the military to perform executive and advisory functions (Decreto Lei No. 53,080 December 4, 1963)." [...] This new attitude towards professionalism did not arise out of nowhere. Though its domination of the ESG was completed by 1963, it had begun to penetrate the college much earlier than that — assisted by the United States and its policy of encouraging Latin American militaries to assume as their primary role in <b>counter-guerrilla</b> and counter-insurgency <b>warfare</b> programs, civic action and nation-building tasks.|$|R

50|$|With the {{resignation}} of Jânio Quadros, who succeeded Kubitschek, a new institutional crisis opens up, exacerbated by the Cold War context, and in late March-early April 1964, the Brazilian Army (then led by General Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco) seized power through its third coup d'état, inaugurating another dictatorial period, which lasted 21 years. This coup {{was the first of}} a series of coups d'état in South America that replaced democratically elected governments with military regimes. These dictatorships dominated South America until the 1980s. In this period the Brazilian Army employed harsh means to suppress militant dissident groups: changing the law, restricting political rights, after harassing and pursuing dissidents; and militarily, with support of police forces and militias, proceeding with methods of <b>counter-guerrilla</b> and counter-insurgency <b>warfare</b> to defeat the guerrilla movements that tried to combat the regime by force. The urban guerrillas were active in Brazil between 1968 and 1971 while in the rural areas the 2 main movements subdued by the Army were respectively, one in the region where are today the Caparaó National Park (1967) and the other one in the region of Araguaya River (1972-74).|$|R

The UDTs were utilized as special operations units and were trained by the Pakistan Army's special forces for missions from the air or on land, and at sea by the navy's specialized weapons system school. The commando teams were to be trained in unconventional warfare such as armed forces diving, high-altitude parachuting, demolitions, foreign languages and intelligence management for the intelligence services.|$|E

[...] "Bull" [...] Simons, the dozen eight-man teams were shared out three per {{training}} base at Luang Prabang, Pakse, Savannakhet, and Vientiane. Even as the Operation Hotfoot teams began weapons {{training and the}} French military mission taught tactics, the RLA was losing a series of skirmishes in Xam Neua near the Vietnamese border. The training was held in abeyance while the Green Berets surveyed the situation. They deemed the higher command of the RLA inexperienced, especially in command of any unit above company level, or in staff positions. Having surveyed the situation, the Green Berets began training in September 1959. That same month, under the codename Project Erawan, the Royal Thai Army began training 1,400 Lao recruits in guerrilla and <b>counter-guerrilla</b> <b>warfare.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Rangers {{continued}} {{to participate in}} skirmishes with Native Americans through 1846, when the annexation of Texas to the United States and the Mexican-American War saw several companies of Rangers mustered into federal service. They played important roles at various battles, acting as guides and participating in <b>Counter-guerrilla</b> <b>warfare,</b> soon establishing a fearsome reputation among both Mexicans and Americans. At the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846, famous Texas Rangers such as John Coffee [...] "Jack" [...] Hays, Ben McCulloch, Bigfoot Wallace, and Samuel Hamilton Walker played important roles in the battle, to include advising General William Jenkins Worth on the tactics required to fight inside a Mexican city. Richard Addison Gillespie, a famed Texas Ranger, died at Monterrey, and General Worth renamed a hill [...] "Mount Gillespie" [...] after him. [...] Colonel Hays organized a second regiment of Texas Rangers, including Rip Ford, who fought with General Winfield Scott in his Mexico City Campaign and the Anti guerrilla campaign along his line of communications to Vera Cruz.|$|E
5000|$|The Dutch Brigade (Hollandse Brigade) was {{a unit of}} the Royal Army of the Kingdom of Holland. It {{was sent}} out in September 1808, by King Louis Bonaparte at the request of his brother Emperor Napoleon of France, {{to take part in the}} Peninsular War on the French side. The brigade, under the command of Major-General David Hendrik Chassé, was made part of the {{so-called}} [...] "German Division". The Division also consisted of units from the Nassau, the Baden and other German allies of the French empire under command of the French general Leval. It was, in turn, part of the IVth French Corps under command of Marshals Lefebvre and Sébastiani, and was later part of the Ist Corps of Marshal Victor. The brigade distinguished itself initially in several major battles, and was later employed mainly in <b>counter-guerrilla</b> <b>warfare.</b> After the annexation of the Kingdom of Holland by the French empire in 1810, the brigade was formally decommissioned and its personnel, now French subjects, absorbed into the French 123rd Line Infantry Regiment, and later into the 130th Line Infantry Regiment, the other battalions of the 123rd back home being reassigned to the Russian campaign of 1812.|$|E
50|$|In July 1950 the bandits/guerrillas became overly {{confident}} due to {{the outbreak}} of the Korean War, believing that the Communist regime would collapse because it was not a match for the much more powerful US military. Consequently, they decided to launch a massive offensive. The Communist high command of Central and Southern Military Region held a second conference and decided to reinforce Guangxi and Guangdong, concentrating on western and northern Guangdong. In western Hunan two commands in the north and south would be formed to better coordinate the campaigns aimed at eradicating bandits in the border region of Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces. By the end of May 1951 over 500,000 bandits had been eradicated. This marked the end of conventional warfare, which the bandits/guerrillas could no longer launch and they also could no longer mass sufficient strength to launch any strikes that posed a real threat to the communist regime. By the beginning of June 1950 the campaign turned into purely <b>counter-guerrilla</b> <b>warfare.</b> The Communists improved upon their military success by sending over 30,000 cadres to the countryside to support land reform, and managed to win the support of most of the peasantry there. The Communists further changed their tactics by forming over 3,000 counter=guerrilla teams and fought the bandits/guerrillas with guerrilla warfare, and after a year over 76,000 bandits were further eradicated.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} half of 1810, the Dutch brigade was tasked with <b>counter-guerrilla</b> <b>warfare</b> in La Mancha. The guerrillas were {{numerous}} and very successful at harassing French supply lines. They operated in large bands, led by legendary leaders like El Empecinado, and [...] "Chaleco" [...] (the Vest). French counter-measures were largely ineffective often because their troops alienated the population with their harshness. Every action by [...] "brigands" [...] led to reprisals against the civilian population of nearby settlements. This caused a spiral of atrocities and reprisals. Civilians, blinded by hatred, murdered isolated patrols, gallopers, and wounded soldiers if they had a chance. The Dutch brigade was generally unsuccessful, too, though captain J.P. Sprenger, with a detachment of 100 men, defeated a troop of 900 Spanish irregular cavalry near Lerma on 24 January. However, a month later, a Dutch squad was ambushed in Segovia and disappeared without trace; only a few bandoliers were recovered. In mid-April 1810, Chassé established his headquarters in Almagro and managed to capture a flock of 15,000 merino sheep being driven to Portugal by guerrillas on orders of the Junta Central. In mid-June, he arrived with the severely depleted brigade (only 600 men, 260 horses and two guns were left) in Manzanares to fight the local guerrillas, but his troops were too exhausted to do anything noteworthy. However, a detachment under Lieutenant-Colonel Aberson occupied Villanueva de los Infantes and improvised a patrol base. When Aberson left with most of his men on one of those patrols, the local population attacked the remaining Dutchmen, who retreated to the local church. They were besieged for a few days until Chassé and Aberson relieved them. The Dutchmen plundered the church and citizenry in reprisal; they left with two cart-loads of silver.|$|E
