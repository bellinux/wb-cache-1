5|$|President Obama {{signed the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female {{contraception}} {{was added to}} a list of preventive services covered by the ACA that would be provided without patient <b>co-payment.</b> The federal mandate applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012. Grandfathered plans did not have to comply unless they changed substantially. To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law. The Guttmacher Institute noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover the prescription contraceptives, but the federal mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging part of the cost to the patient.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of {{reference}} pricing on prices and <b>co-payments</b> in the (German) market for off-patent pharmaceuticals. We present a theoretical model with price-sensitive and loyal consumers that shows that {{a decrease in the}} reference price affects the consumers' <b>co-payments</b> in a non-monotonic way: For high reference prices, a marginally lower reference price may lead to lower <b>co-payments.</b> However, for low reference prices a further reduction may result into higher consumer <b>co-payments.</b> We use quarterly data on reference priced drugs covered by the social health insurance in Germany over the period 2007 - 2010 to analyze the empirical effects of reference price reductions. We find that, while prices decrease due to the reduction, <b>co-payments</b> behave non-monotonically and indeed increase if the reference price is sufficiently low...|$|R
40|$|In {{countries}} where {{health care is}} publicly provided and where equity considerations {{play an important role}} in policy decisions, it is often argued that an increase in <b>co-payments</b> is unacceptable as it will be particularly harmful to the less well-off in society. The present paper derives socially optimal <b>co-payments</b> in a simple model of health care where people differ in income and in severity of illness. The social optimum depends on the welfare weights given to persons with different levels of expected utility. Increased concern for equity may increase optimal <b>co-payments</b> for illnesses with homogeneous severity across the population. For illnesses where the severity varies strongly across the population, optimal <b>co-payments</b> go down as a response to increased concern for equity, provided income differences in the society are sufficiently small. public health, <b>co-payments,</b> equity concerns...|$|R

The use of chiropractic declined from 9.9% of U.S. adults in 1997 to 7.4% in 2002; this was the largest relative decrease among CAM professions, which overall had a stable use rate. As of 2007 7% of the U.S. population is being reached by chiropractic.

25|$|While {{a health}} care {{provider}} visit with a patient may result in the patient leaving with a prescription for medication, not all patients will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. In the U.S., 20-30% of prescriptions are never filled at the pharmacy. There are many reasons patients do not fill prescriptions including {{the cost of the}} medication, doubting the need for medication, or preference for self-care measures other than medication. Cost may be a barrier to prescription drug adherence, but convenience, side effects and lack of demonstrated benefit are also significant factors to a complex situation. A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20-30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions. However, analysis by health insurers suggest that patient <b>co-payment</b> requirements can be reduced to $0 with little or no improvement in long-term adherence rates.|$|E
25|$|At the 2013 federal election, Abbott led the Coalition {{to victory}} over the {{incumbent}} second Rudd government. Abbott and his ministry were sworn in on 18 September 2013. Abbott government came to power with 53.5 percent of the two-party preferred vote. However, the Coalition failed to win control of the Senate, that resulted in several blockages of the Coalition's proposed legislative reforms including university education and TAFE deregulation, <b>co-payment</b> for general practitioner visits, and a paid parental leave scheme. By the May release of the 2014 budget, average polling revealed that the Abbott government's two-party preferred vote had decreased to 46 percent; and despite an upward swing in polling between August to October 2014, by late January and early February 2015, polling had reduced the two-party preferred vote to 45 percent. A Fairfax/Ipsos poll in released in early February revealed that Abbott's approval rating had fallen 9 points to 29 per cent since December and his disapproval had risen 10 points to 67 per cent. Abbott trailed Labor Opposition leader Bill Shorten as preferred Prime Minister by 50 per cent to 34 per cent, an 8 point worsening for Abbott since December.|$|E

40|$|<b>Co-payments</b> help {{determine}} how expensive an individual health service is both to payers and to enrollees. The Japanese government had provided its elderly with first dollar coverage, including pharmaceuticals, until January 2001 when it introduced 10 % <b>co-payments</b> {{in an effort}} to contain costs. We evaluated whether the Japanese increase in <b>co-payments</b> reduced compliance with necessary care, including prescription pharmaceuticals, in elderly patients with chronic illness. Subjects were members of the Health Care System for the Aged (persons age 70 or older) who belonged to a health insurance society located in Fukuoka Prefecture continuously from January 2000 to December 2001. We defined 234 highly compliant patients with hypertension and 35 with diabetes mellitus who visited physicians at least once per month during every month of the 6 -month period from January to June 2000. We used time series analyses to compare medical service use during 6 months before and 12 months after the 10 % <b>co-payments</b> were introduced. During this study, medical visits were necessary to obtain prescriptions for pharmaceuticals in Japan. Compliance decreased significantly for both hypertension and diabetes mellitus patients after the introduction of 10 % <b>co-payments,</b> controlling for the possible impact of secular trends. The impact on necessary pharmaceutical use was likewise affected. However, the impact on costs was not as marked. <b>Co-payments</b> {{have a major impact on}} patient compliance and recommended medical service use (but perhaps not on costs), especially in the elderly with chronic diseases...|$|R

The AMA went on to rally {{state and federal agencies}} to investigate the relationship between the operating clinics and the pharmacy chains to decide if this practice should be prohibited or regulated. Dr. Peter Carmel, neurosurgeon and AMA board member asked, [...] "If you own both sides of the operation, shouldn't people look at that?" [...] The AMA also noted some employers reduce or waive the <b>co-payment</b> if an employee goes to the retail clinic instead of the doctor's office, inferring that this practice might negatively affect quality of care.|$|E
2500|$|The {{maximum length}} of stay that Medicare Part A covers in a {{hospital}} inpatient stay or series of stays is typically 90 days. The first 60 days would be paid by Medicare in full, except one copay (also and more {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "deductible") {{at the beginning of the}} 60 days of $1,288 as of 2016. Days 61–90 require a <b>co-payment</b> of $322 per day as of 2016. The beneficiary is also allocated [...] "lifetime reserve days" [...] that can be used after 90 days. These lifetime reserve days require a copayment of $644 per day as of 2016, and the beneficiary can only use a total of 60 of these days throughout their lifetime. A new pool of 90 hospital days, with new copays of $1288 in 2016 and $302 per day for days 61–90, starts only after the beneficiary has 60 days continuously with no payment from Medicare for hospital or nursing home confinement.|$|E
