5|$|In {{his book}} A New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram {{points out that}} rule 184, when run on {{patterns}} with density 50%, {{can be interpreted as}} parsing the context free language describing strings formed from nested parentheses. This interpretation is closely related to the ballistic annihilation view of rule 184: in Wolfram's interpretation, an open parenthesis <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> a left-moving particle while a close parenthesis <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> a right-moving particle.|$|E

5000|$|Maps [...] in the {{structure}} group <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> [...] in , with [...] The corresponding map on [...] sends (|) to(|). Similarly the map <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> [...] sends (|) to(|), the map <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> [...] sends (|) to(|) and the map <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> [...] sends(|) to (|). It follows that the map <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> [...] sends (|) to(|).On the other hand, if [...] is invertible,(|) is equivalent to(|), whence the formula for the fractional linear transformation.|$|R

5|$|The {{recorded}} {{series of}} two-dimensional diffraction patterns, each corresponding {{to a different}} crystal orientation, is converted into a three-dimensional model of the electron density; the conversion uses the mathematical technique of Fourier transforms, which is explained below. Each spot <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> {{a different type of}} variation in the electron density; the crystallographer must determine which variation <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> which spot (indexing), the relative strengths of the spots in different images (merging and scaling) and how the variations should be combined to yield the total electron density (phasing).|$|E

5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E

5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> a still life pattern.|$|E
