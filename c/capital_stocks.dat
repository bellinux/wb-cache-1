25|$|Once {{the legal}} {{barriers}} were overcome, American investments transformed the Cuban economy. Within {{two years of}} entering Cuba, the Cuba Company built a 350-mile railroad connecting the eastern port of Santiago to the existing railways in central Cuba. The company was the largest single foreign investment in Cuba {{for the first two}} decades of the twentieth century. By the 1910s it was the largest company in the country. The improved infrastructure allowed the sugar cane industry to spread to the previously underdeveloped eastern part of the country. As many small Cuban sugar cane producers were crippled with debt and damages from the war, American companies were able to quickly and cheaply take over the sugar cane industry. At the same time, new productive units called centrales could grind up to 2,000 tons of cane a day making large-scale operations most profitable. The large fixed cost of these centrales made them almost exclusively accessible to American companies with large <b>capital</b> <b>stocks.</b> Furthermore, the centrales required a large, steady flow of cane to remain profitable, which led to further consolidation in the industry. Cuban cane farmers who had formerly been landowners became tenants on company land, funneling raw cane to the centrales. By 1902, 40% of the country’s sugar production was controlled by North Americans.|$|E
2500|$|When {{government}} statisticians compile gross {{fixed capital}} formation (GFCF) figures, they usually add in [...] "ownership transfer costs" [...] (fees, taxes, charges, insurance costs, installation costs etc.) {{associated with the}} acquisition of a fixed asset put in place. In the United States, these costs represent around 1% of GDP, or around 4.5% of total fixed investment. This inclusion may be perfectly valid {{for the purpose of}} a realistic gross investment measure, but when GFCF data is subsequently used to extrapolate the value of fixed <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> using the PIM (the perpetual inventory method), it includes elements which are, strictly speaking, not part of the value of fixed assets themselves. It appears [...] "as if" [...] ownership transfer costs are incurred and depreciated each year in the lifetime of fixed assets, since the value of these costs is carried forward in the perpetual inventory (unless a special adjustment is made). This has the effect of raising the fixed capital stock estimate above true value, cumulatively.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{theories}} posit Europe's unique {{relationship with the}} New World as {{a major cause of}} the Great Divergence. The high profits earned from the colonies and the slave trade constituted 7percent a year, a relatively high rate of return considering the high rate of depreciation on pre-industrial <b>capital</b> <b>stocks,</b> which limited the amount of savings and capital accumulation. Early European colonization was sustained by profits through selling New World goods to Asia, especially silver to China. According to Pomeranz, the most important advantage for Europe was the vast amount of fertile, uncultivated land in the Americas which could be used to grow large quantities of farm products required to sustain European economic growth and allowed labor and land to be freed up in Europe for industrialization. New World exports of wood, cotton, and wool are estimated to have saved England the need for 23 to [...] of cultivated land (by comparison, the total amount of cultivated land in England was just 17 million acres), freeing up immense amounts of resources. The New World also served as a market for European manufactures.|$|E
