50|$|The Sankoty sand {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensive}} aquifers in the state. It frequently is 100 ft thick and is typically found below elevations of 520 to 530 feet above sea level. It has been used as a water source in the Peoria area since at least 1892. By 1909, it was observed that groundwater levels at the North Field in Peoria fluctuated with the river stage in the Illinois River. The Sankoty aquifer extends beyond the width of the Illinois River valley and occurs beneath the uplands. In these locations, it is frequently confined by clayey deposits of glacial till (which may include other sands). Consequently, the groundwater may occur under <b>confined</b> (<b>artesian)</b> conditions.|$|E
40|$|Intrastratal karst {{is by far}} the {{predominant}} gypsum karst type. Its development may begin in deep-seated settings within rocks already buried by younger strata, and it proceeds increasingly rapidly as uplift brings gypsum sequences into progressively shallower positions. Such development commonly occurs under <b>confined</b> (<b>artesian)</b> hydrogeological conditions, that subsequently change to open conditions (phreatic-water table-vadose). The general evolutionary line of intrastratal karst is typified by progressive emergence of a sequence into a shallower position, activation of groundwater circulation and development of cave systems within karst units, commencement of gravitational breakdown and its upward propagation through overlying beds, and development of a karst landscape. These processes and phenomena progress through the directed evolution of karst types as follows: deep-seated intrastratal karst (1 K) to subjacent 1 K to entrenched 1 K to denuded karst. One of the main characteristics of intrastratal karst is that it induces gravitational breakdown in cover beds. With the aid of processes other then simple breakdown, such effects may propagate upwards and may, or may not, reach the surface, depending upon the thickness and structure of the overburden. A karst landscape evolves when such features reach the surface. This paper considers the conditions and mechanisms of such development...|$|E
40|$|Lakes {{developed}} in the inner depressions of tufa mounds are rare geomorphic features and still poorly understood. Sedimentation in this unusual type of endorheic lake with a very restricted catchment area is highly sensitive to environmental and hydrological changes. The Isona tufa mound complex, north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, {{is associated with the}} discharge zone of a <b>confined</b> <b>artesian</b> aquifer and comprises 11 tufa mounds consisting of an annular rimstone enclosing a central depression filled with lake deposits. Data gathered from trenches excavated in four palaeolakes located within three different morphostratigraphic units permitted a precise analysis of the geometrical characteristics and stratigraphic relationships of the deposits and provided a sedimentation model for the Late Quaternary infilling of the spring-fed lakes. The work illustrates that trenches allow a precise characterization of the stratigraphic arrangements, lateral facies changes and deformation structures, which are not apparent in studies relying solely on borehole records, and facilitate sampling for dating and geochemical analyses. The five sedimentary facies described represent different evolutionary stages of the lakes, including: (i) carbonate-rich palustrine deposits probably related to periods with strong hydrological seasonality; (ii) massive highly bioturbated organic ooze; (iii) banded organic carbonate-rich facies associated with an increase in the regional effective moisture; (iv) finegrained quartz-rich aeolian/slope-wash sediments; and (v) colluvial facies deposited following the desiccation of the lakes located at higher altitudes. Geochemical and sedimentological analyses of the lacustrine sequences provided information on the palaeohydrological evolution of the Isona tufa mound complex and the palaeoenvironmental conditions of the area over the last 28 ka. Radiometric dating suggests that deposition occurred simultaneously at ca 22 ka in palaeolakes situated at different elevations. A drop in the piezometric level prompted by the opening of springs at lower altitudes probably caused the deactivation of the upper springs and the desiccation of the lakes. Arid conditions prevailed in the area during the Late Glacial and the early Holocene (28 · 0 to 8 · 5 ka BP). More humid conditions recorded from 8 · 5 to 4 · 2 ka and again since 1 · 7 ka are in accordance with palaeoenvironmental reconstructions available in the Western Mediterranean since the Last Glacial Maximum.

40|$|<b>Artesian</b> <b>confined</b> {{aquifers}} do {{not need}} pumping energy, and water from the aquifer flows naturally at the wellhead. This study proposes correcting the method for analyzing flowing well tests presented by Jacob and Lohman (1952) by considering the head losses due to friction in the well casing. The application of the proposed correction allowed the determination of a transmissivity (T = 411 m(2) /d) and storage coefficient (S = 3 x 10 (- 4)) which appear to be representative for the confined Guarani Aquifer in the study area. Ignoring the correction due to head losses in the well casing, the error in transmissivity evaluation is about 18 %. For the storage coefficient the error is of 5 orders of magnitude, resulting in physically unacceptable value. The effect of the proposed correction on the calculated radius of the cone of depression and corresponding well interference is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{groundwater}} systems requires realistic conceptual hydrogeological models {{as a framework}} for numerical simulation modelling, but also for system understanding and communicating this to stakeholders and the broader community. To help overcome these challenges we developed GVS (Groundwater Visualisation System), a stand-alone desktop software package that uses interactive 3 D visualisation and animation techniques. The goal was a user-friendly groundwater management tool that could support a range of existing real-world and pre-processed data, both surface and subsurface, including geology and various types of temporal hydrological information. GVS allows these data to be integrated into a single conceptual hydrogeological model. In addition, 3 D geological models produced externally using other software packages, can readily be imported into GVS models, as can outputs of simulations (e. g. piezometric surfaces) produced by software such as MODFLOW or FEFLOW. Boreholes can be integrated, showing any down-hole data and properties, including screen information, intersected geology, water level data and water chemistry. Animation is used to display spatial and temporal changes, with time-series data such as rainfall, standing water levels and electrical conductivity, displaying dynamic processes. Time and space variations can be presented using a range of contouring and colour mapping techniques, in addition to interactive plots of time-series parameters. Other types of data, for example, demographics and cultural information, can also be readily incorporated. The GVS software can execute on a standard Windows or Linux-based PC with a minimum of 2 GB RAM, and the model output is easy and inexpensive to distribute, by download or via USB/DVD/CD. Example models are described here for three groundwater systems in Queensland, northeastern Australia: two unconfined alluvial groundwater systems with intensive irrigation, the Lockyer Valley and the upper Condamine Valley, and the Surat Basin, a large sedimentary basin of <b>confined</b> <b>artesian</b> aquifers. This latter example required more detail in the hydrostratigraphy, correlation of formations with drillholes and visualisation of simulation piezometric surfaces. Both alluvial system GVS models were developed during drought conditions to support government strategies to implement groundwater management. The Surat Basin model was industry sponsored research, for coal seam gas groundwater management and community information and consultation. The “virtual” groundwater systems in these 3 D GVS models can be interactively interrogated by standard functions, plus production of 2 D cross-sections, data selection from the 3 D scene, rear end database and plot displays. A unique feature is that GVS allows investigation of time-series data across different display modes, both 2 D and 3 D. GVS has been used successfully as a tool to enhance community/stakeholder understanding and knowledge {{of groundwater}} systems and is of value for training and educational purposes. Projects completed confirm that GVS provides a powerful support to management and decision making, and as a tool for interpretation of groundwater system hydrological processes. A highly effective visualisation output is the production of short videos (e. g. 2 – 5 min) based on sequences of camera ‘fly-throughs’ and screen images. Further work involves developing support for multi-screen displays and touch-screen technologies, distributed rendering, gestural interaction systems. To highlight the visualisation and animation capability of the GVS software, links to related multimedia hosted online sites are included in the references...|$|E
5000|$|The first piezometers in {{geotechnical}} engineering {{were open}} wells or standpipes (sometimes called Casagrande piezometers) [...] installed into an aquifer. A Casagrande piezometer will typically {{have a solid}} casing down to the depth of interest, and a slotted or screened casing within the zone where water pressure is being measured. The casing is sealed into the drillhole with clay, bentonite or concrete to prevent surface water from contaminating the groundwater supply. In an unconfined aquifer, the water level in the piezometer would not be exactly coincident with the water table, especially when the vertical component of flow velocity is significant. In a <b>confined</b> aquifer under <b>artesian</b> conditions, the water level in the piezometer indicates the pressure in the aquifer, but not necessarily the water table. Piezometer wells can be much smaller in diameter than production wells, and a 5 cm diameter standpipe is common.|$|R
40|$|Coffee Cave, {{located in}} the lower Pecos region of southeastern New Mexico, {{illustrates}} processes of hypogenic speleogenesis in the middle Permian Seven Rivers Formation. Coffee Cave is a rectilinear gypsum maze cave with at least four stratigraphically-distinct horizons of development. Morphological features throughout the cave provide unequivocal evidence of hypogenic ascending speleogenesis in a confined aquifer system driven by mixed (forced and free) convection. Morphologic features in individual cave levels include a complete suite that defines original rising flow paths, ranging from inlets for hypogenic fluids (feeders) through transitional forms (rising wall channels) to ceiling half-tube flow features and fluid outlets (cupolas and exposed overlying beds). Passage morphology does not support origins based on epigenic processes and lateral development, although the presence of fine-grained sediments in the cave suggests minimal overprinting by backflooding. Feeder distributions show a lateral shift in ascending fluids, with decreasing dissolutional development in upper levels. It is likely that additional hypogenic karst phenomena {{are present in the}} vicinity of Coffee Cave because regional hydrologic conditions are optimum for <b>confined</b> speleogenesis, with <b>artesian</b> discharge still active in the region...|$|R
40|$|A {{geologic}} {{framework is}} required to understand {{the environmental impact of}} proposed mining of lead and zinc on large springs in the karst area of south-central Missouri. Information about lithologies, faults, joints, and karst features (sinkholes, caves, and springs) contributes {{to the development of a}} conceptual model of karst hydrogeology. Conduits and caves along bedding planes and joints provide avenues for ground-water recharge, movement, and discharge. The trend of joints was studied to determine if they controlled the orientation of cave passages and conduits. The data show that cave passages are curvilinear and do no correlate well with measured joint trends. Instead, stratigraphy, bedding-plane dip, and local base level affect conduit and cave development. The majority of caves in south-central Missouri have developed within stromatolitic dolomite horizons beneath sandstone beds. It is thought that the sandstone beds act as <b>confining</b> units allowing <b>artesian</b> conditions and mixing to occur beneath them, thus, enhancing dissolution. Joints and the high primary porosity of the stromatolitic dolomite beds form openings in the bedrock that initiate solution. Where a solution-widened joint intersects a bedding plane, lateral movement of ground water is controlled by the bedding plane...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{properties of}} the aquifers located in the coastal plain sands, Lagos, Nigeria had been investigated. A review of both the theoretical and practical applications of pumping tests in groundwater resource evaluation for coastal plain sands aquifer was carried out. The main activities involved collation of information related to well logs, step-drawdown and constant rate pumping tests from existing database on borehole drilling in seven wells to an average depth of 100 m. Graphical methods based on Rorabaugh’s Hantush-Bierschenk’s analyses {{were used to determine}} the components of drawdown due to well and aquifer losses from the step-drawdown pumping tests. Conventional analytical methods based on non-equilibrium equation were used to assess the local hydraulic regime of the groundwater system using constant rate pumping tests data. Data from 11 controlled pumping tests in Shomolu area of Lagos metropolis were analyzed. The transmissivity values of the multi-layered aquifer system range between 345. 6 and 2, 332 m 2 /day while the storage coefficient values range between 2. 8 x 10 - 4 and 4. 5 x 10 - 4. Both results indicate <b>confined</b> aquifers of <b>artesian</b> conditions. The step-drawdown pumping tests results indicate that well losses constituted a significant component of drawdown in the pumped wells, a phenomenon due to poor well design, well development; and non-Darcian flow in the multi-layered aquifer. The pumping test results allowed for theoretical and practical prediction of aquifer and well yields in the study area...|$|R
40|$|The Jock River Basin was {{selected}} {{as a case study}} representative of carbonate aquifers in South-Eastern Ontario, where development is increasing demands for groundwater. Monthly hydrochemical and isotope data were used to define aquifer recharge and response to recharge events. Groundwater discharge is important in maintaining the river base flow and wetlands. Deep bedrock groundwater recharge (between 10 to 25 m below bedrock surface) occurs in areas of shallow discontinuous overburden. Groundwaters show a high degree of mixing, but despite mixing impact by anthropogenic activity as road salting and nitrate pollution has been documented. In areas of thick overburden ($>$ 2 m) two <b>artesian</b> <b>confined</b> interconnected aquifers have been identified, (i) a highly permeable basal overburden - upper bedrock aquifer and (ii) a deeper fractured bedrock aquifer. Circulation rates can be {{in a matter of days}} in the shallow aquifer, implying sensitivity to drought and development. While shallow groundwaters are highly sensitive to seasonal recharge, deeper bedrock groundwaters show essentially no temporal variations in chemistry and isotopes despite their shallow depth (25 m). Their homogeneity and their low tritium content suggest a mean circulation time on the order of several decades. Susceptibility to mining and long term contaminant loading is a concern for long circulation time bedrock groundwaters. Isotope measurements suggest reversals of hydraulic gradients during periods of high groundwater consumption from both aquifers. The measurements show that these gradient reversals allow for rapid transport of surface waters into the aquifers. Conditions may allow for rapid introduction of contaminants in the long circulation time bedrock groundwaters...|$|R
40|$|Willow Creek Dam {{is located}} in a unique region on the {{boundary}} of a <b>confined</b> aquifer, where <b>artesian</b> conditions exist. Recently, groundwater levels have exceeded the elevation of the downstream berm well above anticipated piezometric elevations. It was presumed from limited evidence that these high piezometric levels resulted from pressure in the aquifer rather than from seepage out of the reservoir. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative contributions of the reservoir and the regional groundwater to observed piezometric levels and how these levels affect seepage exit gradients and slope stability of the dam. Comparing the head levels in shallow and deep piezometers at the dam, the seepage is shown to originate from the regional aquifer and to flow upwards. The head in the groundwater exceeds the reservoir elevation, and the reservoir elevation has little influence on local phreatic elevations. The largest annual fluctuations in the groundwater levels result from local irrigation pumping. Influences of irrigation wells were quantified using a well influence statistic derived for this study. This statistic was found to be the best predictor of variation in groundwater elevations at the dam. Using a finite element analysis program, it was shown that the regional aquifer provides all the flow into the relief well system and solely contributes to the exit gradients long the downstream toe. Flow rates in the dam’s 27 pressure relief wells were found to be less than the flow rates when the reservoir was first filled, even though piezometer levels are much higher now. This points to a need to redevelop the pressure relief wells. Resulting higher relief well flow will decrease the piezometric levels at the dam and will result in reduced exit gradients. Local and global slope stability was not found to be in jeopardy with local seepage failure occurring well before stability failures. Advisor: John R. Rohd...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for {{water in the}} Canterbury region, and the realisation that spring flow {{plays an important role}} in many wetland and river systems, requires methods for predicting changes in spring behaviour as Canterbury's groundwater resources are utilised. This study into the flow of groundwater through artesian spring systems provides a better understanding of the impacts of changes in artesian aquifer pressure. The aquifer system of the central coastal Canterbury Plains consists of gravels separated by successive layers of fine sediment. The fine sediment acts as a <b>confining</b> aquitard, creating <b>artesian</b> pressures in the gravel aquifers where the piezometric surface is above ground level. Artesian springs occur in the confining aquitard through localised zones of weakness. Piezometric levels associated with artesian springs in gravel aquifers are not well documented and have never been observed in Canterbury. Examination of near-spring groundwater flow patterns should confirm the shallow artesian aquifer as the main source of water to artesian springs. Little information is available on the relationship between artesian aquifer pressure and artesian spring discharge. Groundwater flow equations indicate that turbulence occurs in the high velocity flow encountered in artesian spring systems. Energy losses should thus be proportional to velocity squared and the pressure - flow relationship is expected to be non-linear. A non-linear relationship would buffer spring discharge against changes in aquifer pressure induced by groundwater abstraction. Field investigations were carried out at two spring sites near Christchurch. Near-spring water levels were observed in the aquifer directly below the spring to confirm it as the principal source of water to the spring. Variations in artesian pressure were then induced via groundwater abstraction from nearby wells in the source aquifer, and changes in spring discharge measured. The upper confined aquifer was confirmed to be the primary source of water for Christchurch's artesian spring systems. The relationship between artesian aquifer pressure and artesian spring discharge was found to be entirely linear for the range of pressures and flows observed. Although theoretical analysis indicates that turbulent flow is occurring at, and close to, the spring vent, the distance over which it occurs is small enough that energy losses due to rapid flow in the groundwater system are negligible. The results imply that any reduction in artesian pressure due to groundwater abstraction will have a direct, linear impact on artesian spring flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between shallow groundwater levels and Avon River baseflow upstream of Gloucester Street has been investigated. Avon River baseflow is supplied by shallow groundwater-fed springs. Historical and anecdotal information indicate that since European {{settlement of the}} Christchurch area in the 1850 's, Avon River baseflow has declined. The baseflow decline is attributed to the progressive lowering of the Christchurch area watertable which has caused downstream migration of headwater spring positions {{and a reduction in}} spring discharge. Prior to this study minimal historical Avon River flow data existed, and a quantitative estimation of the decline in baseflow is not possible. A management plan for maintaining acceptable baseflow levels in the Avon River is currently being developed by the Canterbury Regional Council. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide information on the {{relationship between}} Avon River baseflow and shallow groundwater levels to aid baseflow management. The Christchurch groundwater system is characterised by a watertable aquifer that overlies a series of layered confined aquifers. Direct groundwater discharge into the Avon River is considered to be from both the watertable aquifer and upper most confined aquifer. Groundwater was found to enter the river system by two different mechanisms; seepage through stream bed gravel and artesian spring discharge. Groundwater seepage through streambed gravel occurs where the stream channel intersects the watertable aquifer. Artesian springs occur where water-bearing gravels are overlain by between approximately 1 to 10 m of finer-grained <b>confining</b> sediment. <b>Artesian</b> spring water is thought to flow from both the watertable aquifer and the uppermost confined aquifer. Pipes through the confining sediment connect the spring vent to the underlying water-bearing gravels. When the hydraulic head of the underlying gravel aquifer is above the stream stage artesian spring flow will occur. Tributary baseflow and shallow groundwater data were collected for the 11 month period, February 1992 to January 1993. In addition, baseflow was separated from the Avon River flow record. Available flow data indicate that mean A von River baseflow at Gloucester Street from 1980 to 1992 was approximately 1700 1 /s. In March 1993 Avon River baseflow was 50 % of that in March 1980. Large rainfall events in late-August 1992 caused Avon River baseflow in January 1993 to increase to approximately 77 % of the March 1980 value. Regression analysis established a relationship between both hydraulic head in the upper most confined aquifer and unconfined watertable levels, to Avon River baseflow (R² > 0. 8). The flow hydrograph showed that the daily abstraction of shallow groundwater from beneath the catchment caused an associated reduction in flow. Seasonal fluctuations in spring discharge and baseflow were found to be greater in the western tributaries than the eastern tributaries. This is attributed to the greater seasonal fluctuation of shallow groundwater levels in the western area of the catchment than in the eastern area. From available data the peak in seasonal groundwater levels occurred throughout the study area during the period of 24 - 27 October 1992. No observable time delay occurred between the seasonal peaks in shallow groundwater levels and Avon River baseflow at Gloucester Street. In order to sustain acceptable rates of Avon River baseflow, shallow groundwater levels need to be maintained in areas of the catchment were groundwater enters the river. As a first step, the Canterbury Regional Council has placed restrictions on the abstraction of groundwater in areas where springs occur. The information presented in this study on the relationship between shallow groundwater levels and Avon River baseflow confirms the need for management of shallow groundwater levels in areas where groundwater contributes to baseflow. To ascertain the effectiveness of remedial measures continued monitoring of A von River baseflow and shallow groundwater levels are necessary...|$|R
