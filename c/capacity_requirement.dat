40|$|Abstract — In IP-over-WDM {{networks}} {{the logical}} topology {{consists of a}} set of lightpaths that are routed on top of the physical fiber topology. Hence a single fiber cut can lead to multiple logical link failures. We study the impact of lightpath routing on network survivability and spare <b>capacity</b> <b>requirements.</b> We show that poor routings can lead to significant increase in spare <b>capacity</b> <b>requirements</b> and develop new metrics for assessing the survivability of different lightpath routings. Finally, we use these metrics to develop joint lightpath routing and capacity assignment algorithms that significantly reduce the spare <b>capacity</b> <b>requirements</b> of IP-over-WDM networks.

5000|$|The home arena [...] "Ischelandhalle" [...] has a {{capacity}} of 1,800. The minimum <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> for the BBL is 3,000. A refurbishment and enlargement to {{a capacity}} of 3,000 of the current building is planned for the 2009-10 season. Therefore, an alternative location is required for that period. Three options were considered by Phoenix Hagen: a tent solution in Hagen with {{a capacity of}} 3,500, an alternative gym in Hagen or a location near Hagen. On 23 April 2009 the BBL refused the application of Phoenix Hagen for a license {{to play in the}} BBL. In the application the tent solution was proposed, which has been the reason for the rejection. Within a week after the rejection Phoenix Hagen had the right to appeal against the decision. Phoenix Hagen evaluated the feasibility of converting a building, which is located in Hagen and is currently hosting badminton and tennis courts. As an alternative solution outside of Hagen, the gym [...] "Uni Sporthalle" [...] of the University of Wuppertal was considered. The appeal to the BBL was staged with the plans and contracts for the Hagen solution. On Tuesday 02/05/09 the responsible board of the BBL decided to send a delegation to the proposed location in Hagen to inspect the site before making a final decision on the licence. On Friday 08/05/09 the BBL canceled their previous decision and granted a licence with resolutive condition. Phoenix Hagen is eligible to maintain the licence, if progress requirements for the setup of the basketball arena will be fulfilled. The temporary arena is planned to have a capacity of 3,035. On Monday 06/07/09 the BBL announced that Phoenix Hagen has fulfilled the requirements regarding its economic performance. Phoenix Hagen will have to present the arena converted and ready for match operation by 31 July 2009, which forms the final hurdle towards the 2009-10 BBL licence. In the 08/05/09 press release the BBL already stated that it expects Phoenix Hagen also to meet these requirements.|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} and near instantaneous balance between generation supply and load demand {{must be maintained}} in power system operation. As a kind of regulation reserve, automatic generation control (AGC) is widely employed for maintaining system security and reliability, especially for controlling frequency deviation and supporting commercial transactions. In a competitive electricity market, AGC services are either contracted via negotiations between the market operator and generation companies concerned, or procured via a certain form of auction. A new framework to determine AGC <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> {{and to deal with}} regulation dispatch under uncertain demand in a competitive electricity market is presented in this paper. First, the stochastic characteristics of AGC <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> and services are analyzed. A stochastic optimization decision-making model for determining optimal AGC <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> is then developed, followed by a pricing analysis which reveals that a trade-off between economic efficiency and system security must be made by the market operator. Finally, an optimal AGC dispatch algorithm is suggested. A numerical study is given to further demonstrate the essential features of the proposed model and method.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new method of {{short-term}} <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> planning (CRP) {{from the viewpoint}} of “stability”. The term stability refers to the higher predictability of a released <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> plan (or a load plan), and also signifies the robustness of a manufacturing process against internal/external uncertainties. The objective of CRP mentioned in this study is to determine a stable allocation of each manufacturing resource to given operation orders with the aim of minimizing the probability that the resource requirement of each operation order exceeds the capacity of corresponding resource. Through some computational simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed CRP method is applicable as a short-term CRP method by applying it to a flexible job-shop manufacturing system...|$|E
