2500|$|As Ogilvie (2004) shows, the guilds {{negatively}} affected quality, skills, and innovation. Through what economists now call [...] "rent-seeking" [...] they imposed deadweight losses on the economy. Ogilvie says they generated no demonstrable positive externalities and notes that industry began to flourish {{only after the}} guilds faded away. Guilds persisted over the centuries because they redistributed resources to politically powerful merchants. On the other hand, Ogilvie agrees, guilds created [...] "social capital" [...] of shared norms, <b>common</b> <b>information,</b> mutual sanctions, and collective political action. This social capital benefited guild members, even as it hurt outsiders.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to social}} {{conventions}} and retribution against both victim and perpetrator of non-consensual same-sex sexual conduct and violence against participants in consensual same-sex sexual conduct, this activity was generally unreported. In {{light of the}} law authorities relied on public indecency charges or confessions of monetary exchange (i.e., prostitution, which is illegal), to prosecute same-sex sexual activity. ... LGBT persons often faced abuse and violence from family and nongovernmental actors. From February to April, a wave of violent attacks in Baghdad, Basrah, Samarra, Wasit, and Tikrit targeted individuals perceived to be LGBT.... In early February signs and flyers appeared in Baghdad that threatened persons by name unless they cut their hair, stopped wearing nonconformist clothing, and gave up their [...] "alternative" [...] lifestyles. This intimidation campaign precipitated attacks. Attacks ranged from intimidation and verbal harassment to reports of kidnappings, beatings (some of which resulted in deaths), sexual assault, and killings. Reports varied {{on the number of}} victims killed in the attacks, some of which reportedly were carried out by extremist groups, including the Mahdi Army and League of the Righteous (Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq). UNAMI independently verified the deaths of at least 12 individuals; a Reuters report put the number of victims in Baghdad at 14. Local human rights NGOs reported much higher numbers. ... The government did not acknowledge a pattern of attacks nor take measures to ensure safety for individuals publicly named. ... Due to stigma, intimidation, and potential harm, including violent attacks, LGBT organizations did not operate openly, nor were gay pride marches or gay rights advocacy events held. The law prohibits discrimination based on race, disability, or social status, but it does not address ... sexual orientation or gender identity. Societal discrimination in employment, occupation, and housing based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and unconventional appearance was <b>common.</b> <b>Information</b> was not available regarding discrimination in access to education or health care due to sexual orientation or gender identity, although media reported that students were harassed at school for not adopting conventional clothing or hairstyles. There were minimal government efforts to address this discrimination. At year's end authorities had not announced any other arrests or prosecutions of any persons for violence against LGBT individuals, including cases reported in 2011.|$|E

All that they have done is to {{transfer}} the contradictions to established truth from the region of science proper to that of <b>common</b> <b>information</b> and common sense. For, really, the assertion that the surface of a body of deep water, to which no addition was made, and which there was nothing to stop from running into the sea, sank at the rate of only a few inches or even feet a day, simply outrages the most ordinary and familiar teachings of every man's daily experience.

[...] When that nameless thing which has been lately set up in France was described as [...] "the most stupendous and glorious edifice of liberty which had been erected on the foundation of human integrity in any time or country," [...] it might at first have led the hearer into an opinion that the construction of the new fabric was an object of admiration, as well as the demolition of the old. Mr. Fox, however, has explained himself; and it would be too like that captious and cavilling spirit which I so perfectly detest, if I were to pin down the language of an eloquent and ardent mind to the punctilious exactness of a pleader. Then Mr. Fox did not mean to applaud that monstrous thing which, by the courtesy of France, they call a Constitution. I easily believe it. Far from meriting the praises of a great genius like Mr. Fox, it cannot be approved by any man of common sense or <b>common</b> <b>information.</b> He cannot admire the change of one piece of barbarism for another, and a worse. He cannot rejoice at the destruction of a monarchy, mitigated by manners, respectful to laws and usages, and attentive, perhaps but too attentive, to public opinion, in favor of the tyranny of a licentious, ferocious, and savage multitude, without laws, manners, or morals, and which, so far from respecting the general sense of mankind, insolently endeavors to alter all the principles and opinions which have hitherto guided and contained the world, and to force them into a conformity to their views and actions.

This paper analyzed the conception of <b>Information</b> <b>Commons</b> and its service features, simply described the construction of <b>Information</b> <b>Commons</b> and issues needing to be concerned. <b>Information</b> <b>Commons</b> Twenty years on, mankind enters into the time of knowledge economy and social informationization. Data from some investigation agencies show that the digital information increasing at exponential speed will exceed the extension of storage device very soon. With the flying increasing of information, user demands on information have also been increasing dramatically. At the same time, the extensive use of computer technologies has changed the people’s measures and customs of utilizing information essentially. In addition, as the service center of social information, library has also benefited from the development of information and technologies and taken on new vital force. <b>Information</b> <b>Commons,</b> also shortened as IC, consists of the Physical Commons and the Virtual <b>Commons.</b> At abroad, <b>Information</b> <b>Commons</b> is thought {{as a way of}} maintaining fair and effective information acquisition for users[1].
