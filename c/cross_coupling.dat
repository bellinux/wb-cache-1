25|$|Mechanism: In the future, further {{investigation}} of the precise steps involved in the mechanism of hydrogen bond catalysis will be required that will enable chemists to rationally design catalytic strategies for more complex or more useful transformations. For comparison, the basic steps of palladium-catalyzed <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> have been systematically and thoroughly studied {{over the last few}} decades and have led to dramatic advances in catalytic scope, control and reaction design principles. For example, improved understanding of oxidative addition has led to aryl chlorides becoming practical coupling partners, while improved understanding of reductive elimination has {{led to the development of}} new reactions involving sp3 centers. Knowing these fundamental catalytic steps, the ability to rationally plan new reactions and cascades has been extremely useful in the field of total synthesis. In contrast, we lack a general, systematic mechanistic understanding of the steps of hydrogen bond catalysis and how to influence them. Detailed mechanistic studies have so far been limited to individual systems, and their findings have not been of demonstrable predictive use.|$|E
