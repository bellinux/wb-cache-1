5|$|The <b>chronometer</b> was trialled in 1761 by Harrison's son {{and by the}} end of 10 {{weeks the}} clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Later famous horologists {{included}} John Arnold {{who made}} the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's <b>chronometer,</b> Thomas Earnshaw {{who was the first}} to make these available to the public, Daniel Quare, who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, {{was the first}} to invent and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a <b>chronometer</b> maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5000|$|In 1826 Dent {{submitted}} two <b>chronometers,</b> Nos. 54 and 55, {{for trial}} at Greenwich. This must {{indicate that he}} had made at least 55 <b>chronometers</b> by 1826. His submitting <b>chronometers</b> for trial brought him to the notice of the authorities at Royal Observatory, Greenwich. [...] Indeed, in 1828 Dent was employed by Royal Observatory, Greenwich to examine and repair <b>chronometers.</b> His charges for repairing <b>chronometers</b> were as high as 25 guineas - an apparently exorbitant cost, but one that was nevertheless accepted.|$|R

5|$|Beagle carried {{only three}} <b>chronometers</b> on this expedition; the {{majority}} of the expedition's <b>chronometers</b> were on board Adventure (see next section).|$|R
5|$|Critically, {{the ship}} {{did not have}} a <b>chronometer</b> for this voyage, a {{comparatively}} new and expensive navigational instrument at the time. Captain George Simpson could not afford the 60–100 guineas for one,Hall 1820, primary sources. and the ship's owners were also unwilling to purchase one, even threatening to replace him with another captain if he refused to set sail without one.Hall 1833, primary sources.|$|E
5|$|In 1735 Harrison {{built his}} first <b>chronometer,</b> which he {{steadily}} improved {{on over the}} next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, {{including the use of}} bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chronometer</b> was {{returned}} to Greenwich 6 February 1826 and then sent to its makers for servicing. It did not come back to Greenwich for nearly two years. On 4 March 1828 it was issued to Captain J. Bolder in command of HMS Hecla. At this time Hecla was a famous ship: {{under the command of}} George Francis Lyon she had been part of Parry's second expedition to find the Northwest Passage. Over 6,000 members of the public visited the ship at Deptford while she waited to set out on Parry's third expedition in 1824. The attempt was abandoned in 1825 after the leading ship, HMS Fury was abandoned due to ice damage. Parry used Hecla again in an 1827 attempt to reach the North Pole. Parry unwillingly gave up Hecla when the admiralty sent her to survey the West African coast under the command of Bolder. In July 1830 the <b>chronometer</b> {{was returned}} from Hecla and went for cleaning to Robert Molyneux in London. It {{was returned to}} Greenwich in November but not immediately issued to another ship.|$|E
5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of <b>chronometers</b> because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the <b>chronometers</b> were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all <b>chronometers</b> vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of <b>chronometers,</b> especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|R
5000|$|Mainly {{this means}} that if two <b>chronometers</b> contradict, {{how do you know}} which one is correct? At one time this {{observation}} or rule was an expensive one as the cost of three sufficiently accurate <b>chronometers</b> was more than the cost of many types of smaller merchant vessels.Some vessels carried more than three <b>chronometers</b> [...] - [...] for example, the HMS Beagle carried 22 <b>chronometers.</b> [...] However, such a large number was usually only carried on ships undertaking survey work {{as was the case with}} the Beagle.|$|R
50|$|Edward John Dent (1790-1853) {{discovered}} {{his passion for}} horology from his cousin, Richard Rippon, himself a master watchmaker. Dent established his own company in 1814, and developed {{a reputation as a}} builder of accurate <b>chronometers.</b> One of his <b>chronometers</b> won the First Premium Award in the 1829 Greenwich Trials. The Royal Navy equipped themselves with Dent’s <b>chronometers.</b>|$|R
5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine <b>chronometer</b> would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem {{from time to time}} during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine <b>chronometer,</b> such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling {{was one of}} Christchurch's {{most lucrative}} {{industries}} during the 18th and 19th centuries due to easy access to neighbouring towns and the difficult harbour entrance which acted {{as a barrier to}} customs cutters. Many townspeople were involved in this illegal trade and large quantities of wealth were accumulated. In 1784 a confrontation between a gang of local smugglers and Customs and Excise officers led to the Battle of Mudeford in which a Royal Navy officer was killed and a smuggler subsequently executed. Another important industry during this period was the manufacture of fusee chains for watches and clocks. In 1790, Robert Cox began to manufacture fusee chains in workshops in the High Street. By 1793 Cox gained a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and <b>chronometer</b> makers throughout the country. In 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. However, by 1875 the chains were no longer required due to changes in watch designs and the factories were closed.|$|E

5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Baltimore, Empire Simba headed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to take on another load of scrap iron for the UK. After making her way to Halifax by early February, she sailed on 9 February {{as a part of}} Convoy HX-108, but dropped out and joined up with Convoy SC-22, a slower convoy that had left Halifax a day earlier. Off the Northern Ireland coast, the convoy escorts broke off and Empire Simba and three other ships sailed into the Irish Sea. Headed to her {{destination}} of Port Talbot, Empire Simba was {{at the back of the}} line of the four ships. At 1300 hrs on 1 March, a Heinkel He 111 bomber of Kampfgeschwader 27, Luftwaffe attacked the column, and had a near miss on Empire Simba. The force of the explosion shattered the main water injection pipe in the engine room, flooding her engine room and leaving the ship dead in the water. The German bomber, with smoke trailing from it after being hit by bullets from one of Empire Simbas two Hotchkiss Mark I machine guns, headed off for Ireland. There were no towing vessels immediately available for Empire Simba, so as darkness approached, Empire Simbas crew abandoned the ship for the escorting trawler. Taking the ship's two machine guns, the <b>chronometer,</b> and some personal belongings, the crew were landed at Milford Haven. Empire Simba was saved and towed into Birkenhead, where the officers rejoined with their erstwhile ship. During an overnight bombing raid on the night of 12/13 March, German bombers parachuted land mines on Birkenhead. One landed on Empire Simba and exploded, causing significant damage to the ship.|$|E
