5|$|Salih quickly {{gained the}} {{allegiance}} {{of the entire}} body of Kilab, who were in awe of his escape, and moved against Aleppo. Mansur's ghilmān staved off Salih's forces at Aleppo's outskirts, encouraging Mansur to assemble a larger army composed of his ghilmān, craftsmen from the suq and men from Aleppo's lower-class neighborhoods, including many <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews.</b> On 13 August, Salih routed the Aleppine force, killing some 2,000 of Mansur's soldiers, and capturing Mansur and his senior commanders.|$|E

It is more likely, however, that Zenobia tolerated all cults in an effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome.|$|E

5|$|Aqil's {{closeness}} {{with the}} Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His {{relations with the}} kaimakam of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam on his behalf. Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} at Beth Israel, Plotkin was heavily {{involved}} in Phoenix's Jewish and non-Jewish communities. He was a strong Zionist at Hebrew Union College, {{at a time when}} the movement was unpopular there, and was later a staunch supporter of Israel. He was an advocate for civil rights, and a supporter of the arts. He founded the Jewish Studies program at Arizona State University and taught there, and volunteered for 25 years as a chaplain at Phoenix Veterans Hospital.

5|$|Like Ladislaus I, Coloman {{proved to}} be a great legislator, but he {{prescribed}} less severe punishments than his uncle had done. He ordered that transactions between <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> were to be put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry their daughters to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the marturina, the traditional in-kind tax of Slavonia, in cash.|$|E
5|$|Services were {{initially}} traditional, following the Polish rite. Men and women sat separately, but the mehitza separating them was soon done away with. In 1881 the new president, David Hirschberg, led {{a campaign to}} modernize, and convinced a small majority to introduce a number of reforms, including {{the addition of a}} mixed choir of <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> and organ music, and the removal of the requirement for a minyan. Traditionalists—who mostly came from the Hebrew Benevolent Society—objected and withdrew, forming their own Orthodox minyan, which eventually became Oakland's Congregation Beth Jacob.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{position}} of the <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of their faith. They had been exempted from Decius's persecution and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government. Because their faith was new and unfamiliar and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians had no such excuse. Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.|$|E

5|$|Under the Umayyads Gaza {{served as}} a minor {{administrative}} center. In 672 an earthquake struck the city but there are few details of its effects. Under the caliph-appointed governors, <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> were taxed, though their worship and trade continued, {{as noted in the}} writings of the bishop Saint Willibald, who visited the city in 723. The year 750 saw the end of Umayyad rule in Palestine and the arrival of the Abbasids, with Gaza becoming a center for the writing of Islamic law. In 767, Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; al-Shafi'i founded one of the prominent fiqhs (schools of law) of Sunni Islam, named Shafi'i after him.|$|E
5|$|Salih's escape {{boosted the}} Kilab's morale and they {{assembled}} {{to offer him}} their allegiance. In the following days, the Kilab under Salih besieged Aleppo, but Mansur's forces were able to plunder Salih's camp and capture fifty of his tribesmen. Buoyed by his victory, Mansur collected his army of ghilmān in Aleppo along with local toughs, <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> and confronted Salih's forces {{on the outskirts of}} Aleppo. The Kilab routed their opponents, killing some 2,000 Aleppines in the process, and captured Mansur. Negotiations between Salih and Mansur's representatives ensued, concluding with an agreement that freed Mansur in return for the release of Salih's brothers, a ransom of 50,000 gold dinars and the allotment of half of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues to the Kilab. Salih was also able to remarry Tarud and was given Mansur's daughter to wed as well. Furthermore, Mansur recognized Salih as the supreme emir of the Kilab, officially investing him with authority and control over his tribesmen.|$|E

25|$|<b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> in the sultanate were {{governed by}} the dual {{authority}} of their respective religious institutions and the sultan. The authority of the former extended {{to many of the}} everyday aspects of Christian and Jewish life and was not restricted to the religious practices of the two respective communities. The Mamluk government, often under the official banner of the Pact of Umar which gave <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> dhimmi (protected peoples) status, ultimately determined the taxes that <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> paid to the sultanate, including the jizyah (poll tax), whether a house of worship could be constructed and the public appearance of <b>Christians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews.</b> Jews generally fared better than Christians, and the latter experienced more difficulty under Mamluk rule than under previous Muslim powers. The association of Christians with the Mongols, due to the latter's use of Armenian and Georgian Christian auxiliaries, the attempted alliance between the Mongols and the Crusader powers, and the massacre of Muslim communities and the sparing of Christians in cities captured by the Mongols, may have contributed to rising anti-Christian sentiments in the Mamluk era. The manifestations of anti-Christian hostility were mostly spearheaded at the popular level rather than under the direction of Mamluk sultans. The main source of popular hostility was resentment at the privileged positions many Christians held in the Mamluk bureaucracy.|$|E
