One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units.

The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry)</b> has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high-throughput screening.|$|E

In order for the field to grow, rich knowledge enterprises and business must work more closely together and adopt simulation strategies. Consequently, more importance must be placed on the role of computational biology with regards to safety and risk assessments.

The analysis of poor success rate of the approach has been suggested to connect with the rather limited chemical space covered by products of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry.</b> When comparing the properties of compounds in <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> libraries to those of approved drugs and natural products, Feher and Schmidt [...] noted that <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> libraries suffer particularly from the lack of chirality, as well as structure rigidity, both of which are widely regarded as drug-like properties. Even though natural product drug discovery has not probably been the most fashionable trend in pharmaceutical industry in recent times, a large proportion of new chemical entities still are nature-derived compounds, and thus, {{it has been suggested that}} effectiveness of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> could be improved by enhancing the chemical diversity of screening libraries. As chirality and rigidity are the two most important features distinguishing approved drugs and natural products from compounds in <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> libraries, these are the two issues emphasized in so-called diversity oriented libraries, i.e. compound collections that aim at coverage of the chemical space, instead of just huge numbers of compounds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a microfluidic chip {{in which two}} perpendicular laminar-flow streams can be operated to sequentially address {{the surface of a}} flow-chamber with semi-parallel sample streams. The sample streams can be controlled in position and width by the method of electrokinetic focusing. For this purpose, each of the two streams is sandwiched by two parallel sheath flow streams containing just a buffer solution. The streams are being electroosmotically pumped, allowing a simple chip design and a setup with no moving parts. Positioning of the streams was adjusted in real-time by controlling the applied voltages according to an analytical model. The perpendicular focusing gives rise to overlapping regions, which, by <b>combinatorial</b> (bio) <b>chemistry,</b> might be used for fabrication of spot arrays of immobilized proteins and other biomolecules. Since the patterning procedure is done in a closed, liquid filled flow-structure, array spots will never be exposed to air and are prevented from drying. With this device configuration, it was possible to visualize an array of 49 spots on a surface area of 1 mm 2.

50|$|As above mentioned, <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> {{was a key}} {{technology}} enabling the efficient generation of large screening libraries {{for the needs of}} high-throughput screening. However, now, after two decades of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry,</b> it has been pointed out that despite the increased efficiency in chemical synthesis, no increase in lead or drug candidates has been reached. This has led to analysis of chemical characteristics of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> products, compared to existing drugs or natural products. The chemoinformatics concept chemical diversity, depicted as distribution of compounds in the chemical space based on their physicochemical characteristics, is often used to describe the difference between the <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> libraries and natural products. The synthetic, combinatorial library compounds seem to cover only a limited and quite uniform chemical space, whereas existing drugs and particularly natural products, exhibit much greater chemical diversity, distributing more evenly to the chemical space. The most prominent differences between natural products and compounds in <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> libraries is the number of chiral centers (much higher in natural compounds), structure rigidity (higher in natural compounds) and number of aromatic moieties (higher in <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> libraries). Other chemical differences between these two groups include the nature of heteroatoms (O and N enriched in natural products, and S and halogen atoms more often present in synthetic compounds), as well as level of non-aromatic unsaturation (higher in natural products). As both structure rigidity and chirality are both well-established factors in medicinal chemistry known to enhance compounds specificity and efficacy as a drug, {{it has been suggested that}} natural products compare favourable to today's <b>combinatorial</b> <b>chemistry</b> libraries as potential lead molecules.|$|E

The recombinant surface proteins, containing the IgA- or IgE-specific affibodies, were demonstrated to be expressed as full-length proteins, localized and properly exposed at the cell surface of S. carnosus. Furthermore, these chimeric receptors were found to be functional, since recombinant S. carnosus cells were shown to have gained IgA and IgE binding capacity, respectively.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Mammalian cell screens of peptide {{libraries}} {{for changes}} in cellular phenotype may identify novel functional peptides and their cognate binding partners, and allow identification of signal transduction network members or proteins important in disease processes. Results: Green fluorescent protein (GFP) peptide libraries with different structural biases were tested by retroviral expression in A 549 carcinoma cells, HUVEC and other cell types. Three different loop replacement libraries, containing 12 or 18 random residues, were compatible with enhanced GFP (EGFP) folding, as was a C-terminally fused random 20 -mer library. Library concentrations in A 549 cells ranged from ca. 1 to 54 μM. Replacement of loop 3 with known nuclear localization sequence (NLS) peptides, but not with inactive mutants, directed EGFP to the nucleus. Microscopy-based screens of three different libraries for non-uniform localization revealed novel NLS peptides, novel variants of a peroxisomal localization motif, a variety of partial NLS peptides, peptides localized to the nucleolus, and nuclear-excluded peptides. Conclusions: Peptides can be presented by EGFP in conformations that can functionally interact with cellular constituents in mammalian cells. A phenotypic screen resulting in the discovery of novel localization peptides that were not cell type-specific suggests that this methodology may be applied to other screens in cells derived from diseased organisms, and illustrates the use of intracellular <b>combinatorial</b> peptide <b>chemistry</b> in mammalian cells...|$|R

Here we describe a <b>combinatorial</b> protein <b>chemistry</b> strategy for studying structure-activity relationships in proteins. Our approach (termed ’protein signature analysis’) involves functional selection from an array of self-encoded protein analogs prepared by total synthesis, coupled to a simple chemical readout that unambiguously identifies the modified proteins in the resulting active and inactive populations. Results: Protein signature {{analysis was used to}} study the interaction of the amino-terminal SH 3 domain from the cellular adaptor protein c-Crk with its cognate proline-rich peptide, C 3 G. Using a functional selection assay, the qualitative effects of scanning a series of synthetic analog units through the amino-acid sequence of the SH 3 domain were evaluated. The analog units were designed to alter both amino-acid sidechains and the polypeptide backbone within the protein. These chemical studies revealed that the sidechain of Asp 150 in the SH 3 domain is essential for ligand binding and that changes {{in the structure of the}} polypeptide backbone can also result in loss of binding activity. Conclusions: These chemical studies have provided new insight into how ligand binding is related to the covalent structure of the SH 3 domain. Protein signature analysis is a powerful and conceptually novel way of studying the molecular and chemical basis of protein function; it combines the advantages of systematic modification of a protein's chemical structure with the practical convenience of combinatorial synthesis...|$|R
