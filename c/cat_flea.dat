25|$|Cat scratch disease occurs worldwide. Cats are {{the main}} {{reservoir}} of Bartonella henselae, and the bacterium is transmitted to cats by the <b>cat</b> <b>flea</b> Ctenocephalides felis. Infection in cats is very common with a prevalence estimated between 40-60%, younger cats being more commonly infective. Cats usually become immune to the infection, while dogs may be very symptomatic. Humans may also acquire it through flea or tick bites from infected dogs, cats, coyotes, and foxes.|$|E
500|$|Fleas are {{wingless}} insects, 1/16 to 1/8-inch (1.5 to 3.3mm) long, {{that are}} agile, usually dark colored (for example, the reddish-brown of the <b>cat</b> <b>flea),</b> with a proboscis, or stylet, adapted to feeding by piercing {{the skin and}} sucking their host's blood through their epipharynx.

50|$|<b>Cat</b> <b>fleas</b> can {{transmit}} other parasites and infections to {{dogs and cats}} and also to humans. The most prominent of these are Bartonella, murine typhus, and apedermatitis.

40|$|The {{identification}} of apparently fastidious microorganisms is often problematic. DNA from a rickettsia-like agent (called the ELB agent) present in <b>cat</b> <b>fleas</b> could be amplified by PCR with conserved primers derived from rickettsial 17 -kDa common protein antigen and citrate synthase genes but not spotted fever group 190 -kDa antigen gene. Alu I sites {{in both the}} 17 -kDa and citrate synthase PCR products obtained with the rickettsia-like agent and Rickettsia typhi were different even though both agents reacted with monoclonal antibodies previously thought specific for R. typhi. The DNA sequence of {{a portion of the}} 17 -kDa PCR product of the rickettsia-like agent differed significantly from all known rickettsial sequences and resembled the 17 -kDa sequences of typhus more than spotted fever group rickettsiae.

40|$|The prevalences of Bartonella, Rickettsia, and Wolbachia were {{investigated}} in 309 <b>cat</b> <b>fleas</b> from France by {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) assay and sequencing with primers derived from the gltA gene for Rickettsia, the its and pap 31 genes for Bartonella, and the 16 S rRNA gene for Anaplasmataceae.

5000|$|The <b>cat</b> <b>flea</b> {{belongs to}} the insect order Siphonaptera (Ancient Greek siphono- [...] "tube" [...] or [...] "siphon" [...] + a [...] "not" [...] + ptera [...] "wing", the tube-drinking {{wingless}} insects) which in its adult stage is an obligatory hematophage. Adults of both sexes range from 1-2 mm long and are usually a reddish-brown colour, although the abdomens of gravid females often swell with eggs causing them to appear banded in cream and dark brown. Like all fleas, the <b>cat</b> <b>flea</b> is compressed laterally allowing it to slip between the sometimes dense hairs of its host just above {{the top layer of}} the skin, resulting in an extremely thin insect that may be difficult to observe even if the host's coat is pure white.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In recent decades, the {{majority}} of human plague cases (caused by Yersinia pestis) have been reported from Africa. In northwest Uganda, which has had recent plague outbreaks, <b>cat</b> <b>fleas</b> (Ctenocephalides felis) have been reported as the most common fleas in the home environment, which is suspected {{to be a major}} exposure site for human plague in this country. In the past, C. felis has been viewed as only a nuisance-biting insect because limited laboratory studies suggested it is incapable of transmitting Y. pestis or is an inefficient vector. Our laboratory study shows that C. felis is a competent vector of plague bacteria, but that efficiency is low compared with another flea species collected in the same area: the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis. On the other hand, despite its low vector efficiency, C. felis is the most common flea in human habitations in a plague-endemic region of Uganda (Arua and Nebbi Districts), and occasionally infests potential rodent reservoirs of Y. pestis such as the roof rat (Rattus rattus) or the Nile rat (Arvicanthis niloticus). Plague control programs in this region should remain focused on reducing rat flea populations, although our findings imply that <b>cat</b> <b>fleas</b> should not be ignored by these programs as they could play a significant role as secondary vectors...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbtract Background In the Pacific islands {{countries}} and territories, {{very little is}} known about the incidence of infectious diseases due to zoonotic pathogens. To our knowledge, human infections due to Rickettsia spp., Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia spp. and Bartonella spp. have never been reported in French Polynesia; and infections due to C. burnetti have been reported worldwide except in New Zealand. To evaluate the prevalence of this disease, we conducted a serosurvey among French Polynesian blood donors. Methods The presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies against R. felis, R. typhi, R. conorii, C. burnetii, B. henselae, B. quintana, and E. chaffeensis was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay in sera from 472 French Polynesian blood donors collected from 2011 to 2013. In addition, 178 ticks and 36 <b>cat</b> <b>fleas</b> collected in French Polynesia were also collected and tested by polymerase chain reaction to detect Rickettsia spp., B. henselae and Ehrlichia spp. Results None of the blood donors had antibodies at a significant level against Rickettsia spp., Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia spp. and Bartonella spp. All tested ticks and <b>cat</b> <b>fleas</b> were PCR-negative for Rickettsia spp., B. henselae, and Ehrlichia spp. Conclusion We cannot conclude that these pathogens are absent in French Polynesia but, if present, their prevalence is probably very low.
