For the Soviets, deception permeated {{all levels of}} war.

5|$|Rocky Balboa {{represents}} {{a partnership between}} Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Revolution Studios, and Columbia Pictures (Columbia's corporate parent Sony holds a 20% stake in MGM). Since the Rocky series was originally produced and distributed by United Artists (now MGM's subsidiary studio), the partners jointly decided that the film <b>could</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> take advantage of MGM's newly reinvigorated domestic distribution apparatus. 20th Century Fox handles its theatrical and DVD distributions outside of the United States and Canada, while Sony Pictures Home Entertainment handled its American and Canadian video distributions. In the Philippines and Switzerland, Fox released the film through joint ventures with Warner Bros. Entertainment. In Japan, the film was promoted by Fox as Rocky The Final. It opened across Japan on April 20, 2007.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} reason for Jamaican dissatisfaction was the Federation's continuing colonial status. Jamaica had joined the Federation because its leaders had believed that the West Indies would quickly be granted independence. Nearly {{three years after the}} formation of the Federation, this had not occurred; meanwhile, smaller British colonies, like Cyprus and Sierra Leone, had gained independence. Thus, many Jamaicans believed that the island <b>could</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> seek independence in its own right.|$|E
25|$|On June 21, 1890, the Massachusetts General Court passed An Act to Promote the Abolition of Grade Crossings, {{which allowed}} town {{officials}} or a railroad company to petition the state superior court {{to create an}} independent commission {{to determine whether a}} grade crossing <b>could</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> be eliminated. The costs of such eliminations were to be borne 65% by the railroad, not more than 10% by the town, and the remainder by the state.|$|E
25|$|Virginians were {{intensely}} individualistic at this point, {{weakening the}} small new communities. According to Breen (1979) their horizon was {{limited by the}} present or near future. They believed that the environment <b>could</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> be forced to yield quick financial returns. Thus everyone was looking out for number one {{at the expense of}} the cooperative ventures. Farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed. This extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the Indians, resulting in two massacres.|$|E

25|$|Marylanders might {{agree in}} {{principle}} that slavery <b>could</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> be abolished, {{but they were}} slow to achieve it statewide. Although the need for slaves had declined with the shift away from tobacco culture, and slaves were being sold to the Deep South, slavery was still too deeply embedded into Maryland society for the whites {{to give it up}} voluntarily on a wide scale. Wealthy planters exercised considerable economic and political power in the state. Slavery did not end until after the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|To many, the specialness {{of health}} care meant that cost {{should not be a}} {{consideration}} in care. Ethical physicians <b>could</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> not consider money in deciding what they should do for sick patients. Patients were to receive whatever services they needed, regardless of its cost. Reasoning based on cost has been strenuously resisted; it violated the Hippocratic Oath, was associated with rationing, and derided as putting a price on life, akin to the economist who knew the price of everything but the value of nothing. Indeed, many physicians were willing to lie to get patients what they needed from insurance companies that were trying to hold costs down.|$|E
25|$|Douglass {{also came}} to {{consider}} Garrison too radical. Earlier Douglass had agreed with Garrison's position that the Constitution was pro-slavery, because of its compromises related to apportionment of Congressional seats, based on partial counting of slave populations with state totals; and protection of the international slave trade through 1807. Garrison had burned copies of the Constitution to express his opinion. But, Lysander Spooner published The Unconstitutionality of Slavery (1846), which explored the United States Constitution as an anti-slavery document. Douglass's change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 {{became one of the}} abolitionist movement's most notable divisions. Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution <b>could</b> <b>and</b> <b>should</b> be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery.|$|E
