5|$|Quenya {{allows for}} a very {{flexible}} word order {{because it is an}} inflectional language like Latin. Nevertheless, it has word order rules. The usual syntax structure is subject-verb-object. The adjective <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> before or after the noun that it modifies.|$|E
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> {{into one}} of three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E

5|$|Carrots can {{be stored}} for several months in the {{refrigerator}} or over winter in a moist, cool place. For long term storage, unwashed carrots <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in a bucket between layers of sand, a 50/50 mix of sand and wood shavings, or in soil. A temperature range of 32 to 40°F (0 to 5°C) is best.|$|E
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in {{the same amount of}} space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{was soon}} transported to Tenedos, {{and then to}} Samothrace. He was {{ultimately}} killed while attempting to escape the island. The exact date is unknown, but since Theophanes Continuatus claims that the exiled Romanos I saw a nightmare featuring his son's descent to Hell {{at the time of}} Constantine's death, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> between 946 and Romanos's own death in 948.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3 {{contains}} non-gameplay additions, such as Forge, a map-editing tool. Forge enables {{players to}} insert and remove game objects, such as weapons, crates and vehicles into existing multiplayer maps. Almost all weapons, vehicles, and interactive objects <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> {{and moved on}} maps with Forge. Players can enter Forge games and edit and manipulate objects in real time. A budget limits the amount of objects that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed.</b> Players may also save up to 100 films of gameplay to their Xbox 360's hard drive, viewing the action from any angle and at different speeds. Halo 3 offers a form of file sharing, where items such as saved films, screenshots, and custom variants can all be uploaded to Bungie's official website, Bungie.net. Anyone can browse user created content that has been uploaded to Bungie's website and tag it to automatically download to their console next time they sign into Xbox Live on Halo 3.|$|E
5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{generally}} by allogamy (cross-pollination) and Hippeastrum may be propagated by seed or offset bulbils (bulblets), although commercial ventures use in vitro techniques, or splitting of the bulb into sections. The genus has been intensely bred and cultivated {{since the early}} nineteenth century to produce large colourful showy flowers. In temperate climes these <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> outside in the summer, and after a dormancy period, be induced to rebloom inside in the winter.|$|E

5|$|Surge can be {{measured}} directly at coastal tidal stations as {{the difference between the}} forecast tide and the observed rise of water. Another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead of an approaching tropical cyclone. This was first tested for Hurricane Rita in 2005. These types of sensors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in locations that will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.|$|E
5|$|The City of London has {{assessed}} {{the entire length}} of the Veterans Memorial Parkway, identifying areas where interchanges can be constructed, grade separations can occur, and where cul-de-sacs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed.</b> Upon completion, the Veterans Memorial Parkway would no longer be an expressway, but a freeway, for the majority of its length.|$|E
5|$|The Toy Train minigame {{involves}} {{laying a}} railroad track across a complex game board. The toy train must pass through every train station and reach a defined end point, and in harder levels, {{it must be}} timed to avoid cars and other trains. The toy train requires fuel to move, limiting the amount of track that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> by a player unless more fuel is collected before a track ends.|$|E

50|$|While {{there was}} {{continuity}} {{in the overall}} model {{and structure of the}} funerary busts, stylistic changes occurred over time. The busts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>places</b> into three groups based on Dr. Harald Ingholt’s 1928 chronological classifications: Group I (50-150 CE), Group II (15-200 CE), and Group III (200-273 CE).|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, passers-by would {{pray and}} offer alms when passing {{one in the}} street. Candles, flowers and alms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>place</b> in the niche. All the city's alminhas are well {{preserved}} and kept by the brotherhood. However, due to theft and damage of the shrines, some alminhas no longer accept alms.|$|R
5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if {{the objects in}} a set <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even. This definition {{is equivalent to the}} first one. Again, zero is even because the empty set can be divided into two groups of zero items each.|$|E
5|$|Type {{safety is}} {{variable}} in COBOL. Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric data <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in any data item {{that can be}} stored as a string, including numeric and group data. In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> {{in a corner}} of the room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E

5000|$|Titles are {{animated}} text screens, normally {{placed at}} the beginning or end of the movie, but <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> over video clips. Titles and credits <b>can</b> <b>be</b> added as stand alone titles or overlaying them on the clip by adding them onto the selected clip. Titles range from static (non-animated) titles to fly in, fading, news banner, or spinning newspaper animations. They <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> on video clips to create sub-titles.|$|R

5|$|Khmer {{is written}} with the Khmer script, an abugida {{developed}} from the Pallava script of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared. Written left-to-right with vowel signs that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, {{both of which were}} based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Hindu-Arabic numerals. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.attenuata {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, B.attenuata is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.oligantha {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.oligantha is a reseeder; it has thin bark, and lacks a lignotuber, so it is killed by fire. However, the species is weakly serotinous: fire triggers seed release, yet seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
