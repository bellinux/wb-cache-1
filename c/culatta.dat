Since that publication, additional warnings have been recommended for other commonly prescribed stimulant medications for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Parents and teachers of two groups of students with physical disabilities may find that these warnings are of special interest as ADHD commonly accompanies traumatic brain injury and cerebral palsy.

Motor difficulties such as poor balance and poor coordination are commonly seen in students with TBI (Smith, 2001). Also, numerous citations have substantiated the associations between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). ADHD is a common comorbid condition following TBI. Hill (1999) found that extreme distractibility is a common cognitive change for students with TBI.
