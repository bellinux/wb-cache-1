5000|$|... Ryanair has {{not officially}} {{recognized}} the Ryanair Pilot Group. In an August 2013 interview, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary dismissed {{the group as}} a [...] "joke" [...] and claimed that the pilots group was an attempt by pilot unions from other airlines to unionise <b>Ryanair.</b> Following a <b>comment</b> <b>from</b> the <b>Ryanair</b> CEO Michael O'Leary in August 2013 in which he agreed to meet with the RPG if more than 1601 pilots were registered with them, an invitation to talk was sent by the RPG. [...] In response, Ryanair released a short statement, stating that [...] "We don’t comment on the activity or false claims of KLM or Aer Lingus pilots,” a reference to the five-member interim council of the Ryanair Pilot Group consisting of non-Ryanair pilots.|$|R

50|$|According to {{information}} <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair</b> on November 4, 2008, these flights would have commenced {{during the winter}} or spring of 2010, and bases would have been London-Stansted, Dublin, Frankfurt-Hahn, Stockholm-Skavsta and Milan-Bergamo.|$|R
50|$|Recently Reus Airport {{has started}} to receive low cost flights <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair</b> that fly to Reus from many {{different}} European locations and North Africa. The airport also receives major charter flights from the United Kingdom. Barcelona Airport is another airport which serves the area for those destinations not served by Reus Airport.|$|R

Its work and {{research has been}} used in many airline and airport reports, and has been quoted in mainstream media as well as a financial report presentation <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair.</b>|$|R
50|$|On September 1, 2015, Bellew joined Malaysian {{flag carrier}} Malaysia Airlines <b>from</b> <b>RyanAir</b> as chief {{operations}} officer, {{as part of}} the airline's ongoing restructuring program amid huge financial losses, compounded with the twin major aviation disasters of MH370 and MH17 in 2014. Under his tenure, he oversaw parts of the restructuring program led by former Aer Lingus chief Christoph Mueller that saw a 6,000-job cut by the airline.|$|R
50|$|Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, {{stated in}} April 2007 that Ryanair planned {{to launch a}} new {{long-haul}} airline around 2009. The new airline would be separate <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair</b> and operate under a different branding. It would offer both low cost with fares starting at €10.00 and a business class service which {{would be much more}} expensive, intended to rival airlines like Virgin Atlantic. The new airline would operate <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair's</b> existing bases in Europe, to approximately six new bases in the United States. The new American bases will not be main bases such as New York's JFK airport, but smaller airports located outside major cities. Since the Boeing 787 was sold out of production until at least 2012, and the Airbus A350 XWB will not enter service until 2014, this has contributed a delay to the airline's launch. It is said that the name of the new airline will be RyanAtlantic and it will sell tickets through the Ryanair website under an alliance agreement. In February 2010, O'Leary said the launch would be delayed until 2014, at the earliest, because of the shortage of suitable, cheap aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The new airline {{would have}} offered both low cost and a first class service and {{intended}} to rival airlines like Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Iberia, Virgin Atlantic. It would operate <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair's</b> existing bases in Europe {{to the new}} bases in the United States. The new American bases would not be main hubs such as New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport, but smaller airports located outside major cities, similar to Ryanair's secondary airports in Europe.|$|R
25|$|While the two {{airlines}} share {{a common}} business charter and concept, easyJet's strategy differs <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair's</b> in several areas. The most noticeable is that easyJet flies mainly to the primary airports in the cities that it serves, {{for the convenience of}} passengers, while Ryanair often chooses secondary airports to further reduce costs. For example, in servicing Paris, easyJet flies to Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport, the primary airports, while Ryanair flies to the smaller Beauvais-Tillé Airport, 85 km and a 75-minute bus journey from Paris.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, {{the entire}} runway was renovated and paved, {{and a new}} taxiway was built, nicknamed [...] "Mike". This major task only took 14 hours. The runway was closed over night between the hours 23:00 and 06:00. This did not prevent a Boeing 737-800 <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair</b> landing {{at one end of}} the runway, while they worked at the other end. The same year was also a record year for the airport. 2,546,856 {{passengers}} passed through the terminals, an increase of 12.7 percent compared with 2007.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Ryanair {{stated that}} {{websites}} like Opodo, CheapOair etc. and their partners engage in screenscraping and false advertising, {{and attempted to}} prevent them <b>from</b> showing <b>RyanAir</b> data.|$|R
50|$|Airlines which {{attempt to}} compete {{directly}} with Ryanair are treated competitively, with Ryanair being accused {{by some of}} reducing fares to significantly undercut their competitors. In response to MyTravelLite, who started to compete with Ryanair on the Birmingham to Dublin route in 2003, Ryanair set up competing flights on some of MyTravelLite's routes until they pulled out. Go was another airline which attempted to offer services <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair's</b> base at Dublin to Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland. A fierce battle ensued, which ended with Go withdrawing its service from Dublin.|$|R
25|$|During 2003 SAS was {{undergoing}} a major restructuring program, which largely focused on reducing unit costs. As {{part of this}} work, the company's management in cooperation with McKinsey & Company devised a scheme to better target the leisure market. Inspiration was both gathered <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair</b> and SAS' partner airline Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Germanwings. SAS had just bought its main Norwegian competitor, Braathens, and had also cleared {{out most of the}} Swedish domestic competition through the purchase of Linjeflyg. The airline was worried about new entrants in these markets, and was especially concerned with Ryanair and EasyJet.|$|R
50|$|The {{captain was}} 38-year-old Aristos Sokratous, from Cyprus. He had over 6,000 hours of total flying time. Sokratous was {{promoted}} to captain {{a year and a}} half before the crash. At the time of the crash, he had intended to quit the airline after accepting a job <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair,</b> which would allow him to be based with his family in Cyprus. His wife was due to give birth to their first child a few weeks after the crash. According to several Flydubai staff members, Sokratous decided to leave the airline mainly because of fatigue and lifestyle issues.|$|R

25|$|On 20 June 2012, Aer Lingus {{issued a}} press release stating that, having {{reviewed}} Ryanair's proposed offer, the company board rejected it and advised the company's shareholders not to take any action in relation to it. The statement pointed out that any offer <b>from</b> <b>Ryanair</b> was unlikely {{to be capable of}} completion due to, firstly, the EU Commission's 2007 decision to block the airline's bid for Aer Lingus at the time, and, secondly, the UK Competition Commission's ongoing investigation of Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Furthermore, the press release stated that the Aer Lingus board believed that Ryanair's offer undervalued Aer Lingus, considering the airline's profitability and balance sheet, including cash reserves in excess of €1 billion (as of 31 March 2012).|$|R
