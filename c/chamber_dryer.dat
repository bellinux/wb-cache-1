The task of exergy {{analysis}} - evaluation {{based on}} the second law of thermodynamics, thermodynamic degree of technical perfection of the whole system, {{as well as to}} identify those stages of a technical process, which contains the bulk of the loss of exergy in order to improve its efficiency. Using exergy analysis allows to solve a wide range of technical problems {{on the basis of a}} unified thermodynamic methods. Exergy analysis was performed by the method whereby thermotechnological system candied fruit production, conventionally separated from the environment of the closed control surface. Exchange scheme under consideration thermotechnological candied fruit production material, thermal and energy flows to the environment, as well as between the control surfaces. Exergy in external input material streams: air and water and citric acid, as well as output streams without having increment Shih-exergy in the process of passing through the reference surface - of running air-water and after washing, are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the surroundings is zero. In the total number of internal exergy losses include losses from the final result of the temperature difference in the heat exchange between the raw material to be dried and heated air electromechanical arising from irreversible alteration of structural and mechanical properties of the product, and the hydraulic loss due to the sudden increase of the specific volume of air as it enters the working <b>chamber</b> <b>dryer.</b> The resulting exergy efficiency is 8. 87 %, which is 3. 7 % higher than when using the technology of the prototype based on solar air-dried product.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Marigold petals can be {{detached}} from flowers by tumbling while being dried in a rotary heated–air dryer. This {{study examined the}} effect of dryer diameter, RPM, airflow, and flower compaction on threshing petals from marigold flowers using two types of rotary dryers. A sectored rotary dryer was tested at three rotational speeds (2, 4, and 8 rpm) and two diameters (1. 2 and 1. 8 m). An open–chamber rotary dryer was tested with three levels of flower compaction (1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 X) and three airflows (4. 3, 4. 5, and 5. 3 changes/min). Both the sectored and open <b>chamber</b> <b>dryers</b> performed well in drying and threshing petals from flowers. In most tests, more than 80 % of the petals were threshed when their moisture dropped to less than 10 %, i. e., within 20 to 24 h of drying. Threshing performance was different between the sectored and open dryer. The sectored dryer had a relatively large increase in the threshing rate after 10 to 15 h of drying while the open dryer’s threshing rates remained fairly constant. The open dryer produced more threshed, high moisture petals. Threshed material from both dryers contained an insignificant amount of trash. The threshing characteristics for both dryer types were unaffected by changes in operating speed, amount of compaction, and airflow. However, by using higher compaction, the open dryer can thresh 50 to 100 % more flowers...|$|R

Nevertheless, the optimization of the air distribution inside the drying chamber of a batch dryer remains a very important point, due to its strong effect on drying efficiency as well as the uniformity of the moisture content of the drying products. A new scale laboratory batch-type tray air (BTA) dryer was designed, constructed and evaluated for the drying of several horticultural and agricultural products. The airflow field inside the dryer was studied through a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package. A three-dimensional model for a laboratory BTA dryer was created and the steady-state incompressible, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations that formulate the flow problem were solved, incorporating standard and RNG k-ε turbulence models. In the simulation, the tray, used inside the BTA drying chamber, was modeled as a thin porous media of finite thickness. The simulations for testing the chamber were conducted at an average velocity of 2. 9 m/s at ambient temperature.

The aim {{of this research was}} to improve the batch uniformity and the energy efficiency of a cabinet dryer suitable for smallholder farmers. Experiments were carried out with the cooperation of a dryer manufacturer and a group of users. On each trial 144. 5 kg of peeled and deseeded litchis were placed at the dryer’s 17 trays, that were stacked atop each other.

40|$|Certain {{models of}} NIOSH-approved {{filtering}} facepiece air purifying respirators are manufactured with stapled head straps. Depending on the manufacturer, these head straps may be stapled to the filter media itself. This may cause leakage through the filter media of the respirator, potentially exposing {{the user to}} an unacceptable level of contaminant. In this study, monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres were generated to challenge four replicates of a N 95 single use respirator model made by the same manufacturer. Nominal particle sizes of the PSL spheres used to challenge the respirators were 0. 5, 1, and 2 micrometers in diameter. All respirators were sealed onto a custom built testing assembly and tested in a sealed chamber. Particle sizes of interest were generated using a nebulizer, and passed through a diffusion dryer and a Krypton- 85 radioactive source prior to entering the test <b>chamber.</b> The <b>dryer</b> reduces the humidity of the aerosol generating by the nebulizer, while the radioactive source neutralizes the charge of the aerosol cloud. The test chamber was constructed using a glass aquarium measuring 32 x 53 x 122 centimeters. Three stainless steel air diffusers were placed above the testing compartment to evenly distribute the aerosol in the chamber. An exhaust manifold was placed at {{the lower part of}} the chamber beneath another stainless steel diffuser below the area where test respirators were placed. The respirators were challenged as received from the manufacturer with 0. 5, 1 and 2 micrometer-sized (PSL) spheres. The same procedure was repeated for each respirator after sealing the areas where the head straps were stapled with silicon rubber. Testing was conducted at a flow rate of 85 liters per minute, as specified in the NIOSH respirator testing protocol. A laser particle counter was used to measure the concentration inside and outside of the respirator. The results showed unsealed efficiencies for particle sizes 0. 5, 1, and 2 micrometers of 96. 68 %, 99. 72 %, 99. 88 % and sealed efficiencies of 97. 35 %, 99. 82 %, 99. 93 % respectively. There were no differences for particle size or sealing at 1. 0 and 2. 0 micrometers. A significant drop in efficiency was observed when testing with 0. 5 micrometer PSL spheres.

However, the control and design of this operation is still based on empirical knowledge. Improvement in product quality, which is governed by time/temperature history, thus involves {{greater understanding of the}} process via physico-chemical, thermodynamic and kinetic approaches. With regard to the latter, the residence time distribution (RTD) of the product provides valuable information about the product flow pattern in the dryer according to the operating conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the RTD of skim milk in a drying plant with different configurations, according to fine particle recycling (top of the chamber or internal fluid bed) and internal fluid bed thickness (4 to 16 cm). The RTD signal of the atomisation device was established first; then the RTD signals of the different spraydryer configurations were obtained by deconvolution of the experimental curves obtained and the RTD signal of the atomisation device, and modelled according to a combination of four reactor sets. The mean residence time of the product was only slightly modified by the dryer configuration (range 9. 5 to 12 min). However, the results showed that a thicker internal fluid bed tends to increase mean residence time due to higher product retention, whereas top recycling of fine particles tends to decrease the mean residence time because of better agglomeration. RTD modelling provides additional information concerning the product flow rate fraction and the residence time distribution of each part of the <b>dryer</b> (<b>chamber,</b> cyclones and fluid bed), indicating that 60 to 80 % of the powder passes through the cyclones, depending on the configuration.

Raman and NIR spectra were continuously collected during freeze drying (one Raman and NIR spectrum/min) and the spectra were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution (MCR). Raman spectroscopy was able to supply information about (i) the mannitol solid state throughout the entire process, (ii) the endpoint of freezing (endpoint of mannitol crystallization), and (iii) several physical and chemical phenomena occurring during the process (onset of ice nucleation, onset of mannitol crystallization). NIR spectroscopy proved to be a more sensitive tool to monitor the critical aspects during drying: (i) endpoint of ice sublimation and (ii) monitoring the release of hydrate water during storage. Furthermore, via NIR spectroscopy some Raman observations were confirmed: start of ice nucleation, end of mannitol crystallization and solid state characteristics of the end product. When Raman and NIR monitoring were performed on the same vial, the Raman signal was saturated during the freezing step caused by reflected NIR light reaching the Raman detector. Therefore, NIR and Raman measurements were done on a different vial. Also the importance of the position of the probes (Raman probe above the vial and NIR probe at the bottom of the sidewall of the vial) in order to obtain all required critical information is outlined. Combining Raman and NIR spectroscopy for the simultaneous monitoring of freeze drying allows monitoring almost all critical freeze drying process aspects.

40|$|The major {{phenomena}} {{involved in}} the drying of calcium lactate in a spray dryer are discussed: evaporation, crystallization and agglomeration. Tests have been done on the following types of spray dryers: a conventional dryer at high temperature (HTD), a conventional dryer at low temperature (LTD), a fluid bed dryer (SDA) and a belt dryer (FILTERMAT). The influence of process conditions on the above phenomena is studied as well the interactions between those phenomena. Completely crystallized calcium lactate contains 27 % moisture as a part ofthe crystal lattice. Water {{that is not a}} part of the crystal lattice is called "free moisture content" and contributes highly to the stickiness of a particle and hence to agglomeration. If the evaporation is too fast, crystallization will be hindered and an amorphous calcium lactate with a lot of free moisture will cause the particles to stick to the wall, to agglomerate and hence to block the dryer. The dryers diSFer in residence time. A combmation of slow evaporation and a long residence time give the best crystallization results and hence httle stickiaess. In all dryers product or off-gas particles are retumed by blowing them around the feed inlet. These particles serve as nuclei for crystallization. A drying curve of calcium lactate has been determined and gives evidence of the fact that the drying of calcium lactate ia a spray dryer is a heat limited process. A simple mathematical model is presented which describes the drying of calcium lactate in a FILTERMAT <b>dryer</b> <b>chamber,</b> only with respect to evaporation.

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2016. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 52). Brick remains the major construction material in our country as we have limited source of construction rocks. Topsoil from agricultural lands, river floodplains are used for making the green bricks which is burnt later at the kilns mainly using the imported coal and domestic fire wood. Brick kiln owners mainly use imported Indian poor quality coal for burning bricks in the seasonal brick kilns operated during November to May every year. A recent UNDP study suggests that fire wood share approximately 33 per cent of the fuel used in the seasonal brick kilns in the country. Bangladesh Brick Manufacturing Owners Association (BMOA) claims that there are approximately 8, 000 brick fields that manufacture bricks of different grades in the country. About 60 per cent of the produced bricks {{in the country are}} consumed by different government departments, such as the Roads and Highways Department, Public Works Department and Local Government Engineering Department annually. The rest is consumed by private sector users. As reported by BMOA, brick making industry employs around 2 million workers during the peak-season and 0. 8 million in the off-season. According to a UNDP source, the country produces over 8. 66 billion bricks a year and the sector has grown at 5. 3 per cent over the last decade. But there are reasons to believe that total brick production in the country is almost three times the above estimate per year. Brick kilns are major sources of greenhouse gas in Bangladesh, emitting annually 6 to 9 million tons of CO 2. Such high levels of emissions are a result of the use of age-old technologies and substandard fuels such as high sulfur coal, tires and wood used in the kilns. This situation is being exacerbated by the growth of new brick fields every year. It is not easy to replace the existing brick kilns with new technology very quickly, although there is availability of proven technology capable of producing quality bricks using one-third fuel (coal) compared to conventional FCK or BTK. Installation of a fixed chimney brick kiln involves approximately Tk 3 million, while a Zigzag kiln installation requires double the amount (excluding land price or rent). A Hybrid Hoffman kiln may require an investment of Tk 80 - 100 million (excluding land price) to be installed. Hoffman and Hybrid Hoffman brick kilns are generally installed in the highlands, and BTK, FCK and the Zigzag brick kilns can operate both at high and low lands as they are seasonal kilns. UNDP started providing technical assistance in Bangladesh to improve the brick kiln technology {{with the support of the}} Global Environment Facilities (GEF) fund. Within this scope, seven Hybrid Hoffman Kilns are set at different locations of the country which operate round the year to produce quality bricks using significantly less amount of coal. These projects are attracting new entrepreneurs to replicate the environment-friendly brick kiln technology. The Chinese Xian Design Institute of Wall and Roof Materials is helping the efforts to implement the HHK technology viably. HHK includes among others, using pulverized coal mixed with clay to form green bricks. This technology helps to improve reduced fuel use for brick burning and Green House Gas emission. As reported, almost 80 per cent of the total energy required for burning bricks in the HHKs is met by the coal mixed with the clay used in the green bricks. The remaining 20 per cent coal is fed externally into the firing chambers of the specially designed hybrid Hoffman Kiln. And because of proper air circulation inside the kiln, almost all the coal used for brick making and for firing is burnt efficiently. The system also includes the preheating arrangements for the green bricks in the stacks put inside the properly insulated <b>dryer</b> <b>chambers</b> with the help of exhausts directed in the <b>dryer</b> <b>chambers</b> from the previous firing in the kiln. Due to the efficient drying and burning technology, HHK require only 13 - 14 tons of coal for making one hundred thousand quality bricks. A single unit HHK may produce 45, 000 - 50, 000 bricks every day. Thus a HHK can replace 5 - 7 conventional FCK or BTK or Zigzag kilns as the HHK can operate round the year. HHK requires an investment of Tk 100 - 110 million initially including the land price. As the HHK saves approximately 9 - 10 tons of coal for burning 100, 000 bricks (compared to FCK or BTKs), entrepreneur may claim the carbon credit from the global carbon trading market. A rough estimate suggests that a HHK may claim approximately Tk 700, 000 annually from carbon credit by producing 15 million bricks in HHK. And the carbon emission saving benefit is on top of the regular business returns from the brick production and selling. To implement environment friendly brick manufacturing project, financial feasibility is a must. As this technology is capital intensive, this report aims to identify the parameters to achieve to implement a green brick technology. Md. Asif IqbalM. Business Administratio...|$|R

AlÃm disso, essa espÃcie estÃ na RelaÃÃo de Plantas Medicinais de Interesse para o SUS (Renisus). Pelo menos parte da atividade antiinflamatÃria e broncodilatadora, determinadas anteriormente, estÃo relacionadas Ã presenÃa de cumarina (CM) e umbeliferona (UMB), considerados princÃpios ativos/marcadores quÃmicos da planta. No sentido de inovar e agregar mais tecnologia aos fitoprodutos derivados de J. pectoralis, o presente estudo objetivou desenvolver o processo de obtenÃÃo da soluÃÃo extrativa (EPJP) e do extrato seco padronizados (ESPJP), bem como {{investigar}} o seu potencial farmacolÃgico prÃ-clinico. Foi desenvolvido e validado de acordo com a legislaÃÃo vigente um mÃtodo analÃtico por cromatografia lÃquida de alta eficiÃncia (CLAE â DAD) para determinaÃÃo do teor de CM e UMB em produtos derivados de chambÃ. As condiÃÃes para produÃÃo da droga vegetal em estufa com circulaÃÃo e renovaÃÃo de ar foram estabelecidas, assim como parÃmetros farmacognÃsticos da droga. O mÃtodo extrativo empregado (percolaÃÃo) foi avaliado quanto as influÃncias de variÃveis (tempo de maceraÃÃo, proporÃÃo droga:solvente e teor alcoÃlico do solvente extrator) por meio de um planejamento fatorial (2 Â), no qual a proporÃÃo droga:solvente e do teor de etanol afetaram o rendimento de CM e UMB nos extratos produzidos. O extrato hidroalcoÃlico de chambÃ produzido sob condiÃÃo eleita (droga:solvente, 1 : 15; teor de etanol: 20 %; tempo de maceraÃÃo: 24 h) foi caracterizado fÃsico-quimicamente e submetido a secagem por spray dryer, empregando como excipiente diÃxido de silÃcio coloidal, sendo determinadas suas propriedades fÃsico-quÃmicas. A avaliaÃÃo toxicolÃgica {{in vitro}} do ESPJP (CM: 8, 84 mg/g; UMB: 1, 27 mg/g) mostrou a sua baixa citotoxicidade em neutrÃfilos humano, mensurada pela atividade da enzima lactato desidrogenase, alÃm de reduzir a liberaÃÃo de mieloperoxidase por eles. Ainda, o EPJP (100, 200 e 400 mg/Kg) reduziu em atÃ 38 % o edema de pata induzido por carragenina e 79, 6 % a nocicepÃÃo induzida por capsaicina. Portanto, os resultados obtidos no presente estudo suportam o desenvolvimento de fitoterÃpicos padronizados a partir de J. pectoralis, espÃcie cujo extrato nÃo se mostrou citotÃxico e apresentou atividade antiinflamatÃria e antinociceptiva. Justicia pectoralis (Acanthaceae), known as âchambÃâ, is an herb popularly {{used for the}} treatment of asthma. This species has been selected for the Phytotherapy Public Programs in Northeast and included in the National Medicinal Plants list of Interest to the Unified Health System. At least a part of the anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatador activities of J. pectoralis has been related to the presence of coumarin (CM) and umbelliferone (UMB), active principles / chemical markers. In order to innovate and aggregate more technology to the phytoproducts from J. pectoralis, the present work aimed to develop the best process to obtain the standardized extract (SEJP) and to investigate its pharmacological properties. It was developed and validated a high performance liquid chromatography method (HPLC â PDA) to determine the concentration of CM and UMB in extract from aerial parts from J. pectoralis. It was established the conditions to produce the drug in a <b>dryer</b> <b>chamber</b> with air circulation and renovation, as well as the pharmacognostic parameters of the product obtained. The influences of the extraction variables related to the extraction method (percolation: maceration time, drug:solvent proportion and alcoholic percentage in water) were evaluated by a factorial planning (2 Â), on what the drug:solvent proportion and ethanol content affected the amount of CM and UMB in the extracts. The hydroalcoholic extract of âchambÃâ produced using the selected conditions (drug:solvent proportion 1 : 15; ethanol content: 20 %; maceration time: 24 h) was characterized physical-chemically and then submitted to spray drying (using colloidal silicon dioxide as adjuvant), being determinated its physical-chemical properties. The toxicological evaluation in vitro of dry extract (CM: 8, 84 mg/g; UMB: 1, 27 mg/g) showed low citotoxicity to human neutrophils, measured by the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activity. The standardized extract (SE; 100, 200 and 400 mg/Kg) reduced around 38 % the paw edema induced by carrageenan in mice and also the release of MPO induced by PMA in human neutrophils. On the other hand, it did not interfere in the paw edema induced by dextan. The SE also reduced the nociception induced by capsaicin in mice, causing inhibition of until 79, 6 %. In conclusion, the present study supports the development of standardized phytomedicine from J. pectoralis. The pharmacological evaluation of the SE from this plant demonstrated its low citotoxicity in human neutrophil, besides the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive...|$|R
40|$|Das Verfahren der Lebensmitteltrocknung wird häufig angewendet, um ein Produkt für längere Zeit haltbar zu machen. Obst und Gemüse sind aufgrund ihres hohen Wassergehalts leicht verderblich durch biochemische Vorgänge innerhalb des Produktes, nicht sachgemäße Lagerung und unzureichende Transportmöglichkeiten. Um solche Verluste zu vermeiden wird die direkte Trocknung eingesetzt, welche die älteste Methode zum langfristigen haltbarmachen ist. Diese Methode ist jedoch veraltet und kann den heutigen Herausforderungen nicht gerecht werden. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein neuer Chargentrockner, mit {{diagonal}}em Luftstömungskanal entlang der Länge des Trocknungsraumes und ohne Leitbleche entwickelt. Neben dem unbestreitbaren Nutzen der Verwendung von Leitblechen, erhöhen diese jedoch die Konstruktionskosten und führen auch zu einer Erhöhung des Druckverlustes. Dadurch wird im Trocknungsprozess mehr Energie verbraucht. Um eine räumlich gleichmäßige Trocknung ohne Leitbleche zu erreichen, wurden die Lebensmittelbehälter diagonal entlang der Länge des Trockners platziert. Das vorrangige Ziel des diagonalen Kanals war, die einströmende, warme Luft gleichmäßig auf das gesamte Produkt auszurichten. Die Simulation des Luftstroms wurde mit ANSYS-Fluent in der ANSYS Workbench Plattform durchgeführt. Zwei verschiedene Geometrien der Trocknungskammer, diagonal und nicht diagonal, wurden modelliert und die Ergebnisse für eine gleichmäßige Luftverteilung aus dem diagonalen Luftströmungsdesign erhalten. Es wurde eine Reihe von Experimenten durchgeführt, um das Design zu bewerten. Kartoffelscheiben dienten als Trocknungsgut. Die statistischen Ergebnisse zeigen einen guten Korrelationskoeffizienten für die Luftstromverteilung (87, 09 %) zwischen dem durchschnittlich vorhergesagten und der durchschnittlichen gemessenen Strömungsgeschwindigkeit. Um den Effekt der gleichmäßigen Luftverteilung auf die Veränderung der Qualität zu bewerten, wurde die Farbe des Produktes, entlang der gesamten Länge der Trocknungskammer kontaktfrei im on-line-Verfahren bestimmt. Zu diesem Zweck wurde eine Imaging-Box, bestehend aus Kamera und Beleuchtung entwickelt. Räumliche Unterschiede dieses Qualitätsparameters wurden als Kriterium gewählt, um die gleichmäßige Trocknungsqualität in der Trocknungskammer zu bewerten. Entscheidend beim Lebensmittel-Chargentrockner ist sein Energieverbrauch. Dafür wurden thermodynamische Analysen des Trockners durchgeführt. Die Energieeffizienz des Systems wurde unter den gewählten Trocknungsbedingungen mit 50, 16 % kalkuliert. Die durchschnittlich genutzten Energie in Form von Elektrizität zur Herstellung von 1 kg getrockneter Kartoffeln wurde mit weniger als 16, 24 MJ/kg und weniger als 4, 78 MJ/kg Wasser zum verdampfen bei einer sehr hohen Temperatur von jeweils 65 °C und Scheibendicken von 5 mm kalkuliert. Die Energie- und Exergieanalysen für diagonale Chargentrockner wurden zudem mit denen anderer Chargentrockner verglichen. Die Auswahl von Trocknungstemperatur, Massenflussrate der Trocknungsluft, Trocknerkapazität und Heiztyp sind die wichtigen Parameter zur Bewertung der genutzten Energie von Chargentrocknern. Die Entwicklung des diagonalen Chargentrockners ist eine nützliche und effektive Möglichkeit um dei Trocknungshomogenität zu erhöhen. Das Design erlaubt es, das gesamte Produkt in der Trocknungskammer gleichmäßigen Luftverhältnissen auszusetzen, statt die Luft von einer Horde zur nächsten zu leiten. The {{process of}} food drying is widely applied {{to make the}} product more stable especially for fruits and vegetables which are highly perishable. In {{order to meet the}} quality standard lot of developments were made in food drying sector {{and most of them are}} indirect type. Batch type convective dryers are common and easy to use due to simple design configuration. But problem of uneven air distribution encounter in most batch type drying systems. Non-uniform air distribution causes non-uniformity in air velocity and drying temperature which translates into drying heterogeneity in the dryer. In this study a new batch type dryer named “diagonal-batch dryer” has been developed with diagonal airflow channel without baffle plates. Apart of the benefits to use air guiders, they cause not only increase in dryer construction cost but also results in velocity pressure drop. So, more energy is consumed in the drying process. In order to get spatial uniform drying without air guiders, the food buckets were arranged diagonally along with the length of dryer. The main purpose of diagonal channel was to expose the entire product uniformly to the incoming hot air. The airflow simulation was carried out using ANSYS-Fluent. Potato slices were used as drying material to conduct drying experiments. The measured span of moisture content among the food buckets was found low at a given drying time showing the occurrence of spatial drying homogeneity. The statistical analysis showed good correlation coefficient (correlation coefficient of 87. 09 %) for airflow distribution between the average predicted and the average experimental measured velocity. The colour of the product was measured non-destructively to develop relationship between drying quality and drying homogeneity. An imaging box was developed for this purpose comprising a camera and lights. Spatial variations of this quality parameter were selected as criteria to assess the uniform quality drying throughout the <b>dryer’s</b> <b>chamber.</b> The change in values of total colour difference of potato slices at all sections of the drying chamber were found similar which ascertain the fact of uniform temperature availability throughout the drying chamber. Thermodynamic analysis of the dryer was performed. The energy efficiency of the system was calculated 50. 16 % within the applied drying conditions and the average amount of energy used in the form of electricity to produce one kilogram of dried potato samples (SPE) and to evaporate one kilogram of water (SEE) were calculated to be lower 16. 24 MJ/kg and 4. 78 MJ/kg respectively at high temperature of 65 oC and sample thickness of 5 mm. The main component for improving the system efficiency was found to be the fan-heater combination based on exergy analysis, possessing low exergy efficiency of 46. 43 - 52. 11 %, high improvement potential rate (IP) of 2. 53 - 2. 55 and high exergetic factor (f) of values 54. 26 - 54. 40 % under the used drying conditions. The energy and exerggy analyses for diagonal batch dryer were also compared with other reported batch tray dryers. The comparison revealed that the diagonal batch dryer gave good results of energy and exergy analyses. It was because of drying uniformity obtained with uniform airflow distribution. Mathematical drying model was developed to describe the drying kinetics of the product and the dynamics of the dryer. The development of diagonal-batch dryer provides a useful and an effective way to get possibility for spatial drying homogeneity. This design is able to expose the entire product to air uniformly in the drying chamber rather to pass the air from one food tray to the next.

40|$|Spray drying is a {{continuous}} operation that converts atomized liquid droplets into dry particles {{usually in a}} high temperature environment. The concept of spray drying was firstly reported over 150 years ago. Due to its scalable feeding capacity and simple mechanical device manipulation spray drying {{has become one of}} the most important powder manufacturing methods in both research laboratory and industry. The applications of spray drying technology has been expanded to an increasingly wide range, covering food, pharmaceutical, agrochemical, detergent, pigment, ceramic, chemicals, etc. In the last three decades significant amount of research and development has been conducted in the area of spray drying in order to handle various precursor materials, to obtain desirable product characteristics, and to reduce materials waste and energy cost. For particle engineering/science research, spray drying, compared to wet-chemistry process, avoids extensive conjugation or purification steps and offers a more efficient means for obtaining powders in one single step to complete encapsulation, complex formation and polymerization. In terms of product quality, there are always specific requirements on particle properties to realize optimal applications. For example, in drug delivery research, there exists desirable particle size range that is dependent on the targeted organs/cells and the routes of administration. For pharmaceutical controlled release applications, the uniformity of particle size and of morphology can be highly beneficial since wide distribution of particle size could lead to more undesirable ‘burst’ effects. For synthesizing functional inorganic products, e. g. photoluminescence, catalysis, and ceramic materials, non-agglomerated spherical particles are usually desirable to increase the packing density and to elevate PL yield or catalysis efficiency. In terms of spray drying kinetics and particle formation studies, the validation of various mathematical models can be facilitated by the narrow size distribution of droplets/particles. Conventional spray dryers, however, suffer from uneasy controllability on particle characteristics (e. g. particle size, size distribution, density, porosity, shape, morphology, moisture content, etc.) and functionalities (e. g. solubility, dispersibility, flowability, hygroscopicity, etc.). It is mostly ascribed to the size polydispersity of the atomized droplets and complicated air flow pattern making the droplets undergo different thermal-mass transfer histories and evaporation processes despite within the same <b>dryer</b> <b>chamber.</b> In addition, complex drop/particle travelling trajectories may result in unwanted particle agglomeration. In this thesis, a specially designed monodisperse droplet generator, referred as micro-fluidic-aerosol-nozzle (MFAN), is presented. Moreover, design and fabrication is introduced for a novel micro-fluidic-jet-spray-dryer equipped with MFAN as the atomizer, capable of synthesizing particles with uniform characteristics. Numerous trials using commercially available monodisperse droplet generators encountered several challenges, such as complicated operating procedures, limited ability to handle viscous liquid, vulnerability to blockage and low yield in droplet production, etc. Thus special designs of the MFAN have been motivated with a few improved features making it an excellent option as the spray dryer atomizer. A cost-efficient visualization means of using a digital SLR camera with a strobe and a micro-lens has been shown to be sufficiently effective to monitor the droplet generation process and to measure the droplet size. The MFAN operating mechanism has been investigated to construct an operability diagram for monodisperse droplet generation. It has been found that a wide frequency range is able to produce monodisperse droplets. The size of monodisperse droplet formed by the MFAN is ranged from 15 to 600 μm. A range of different materials have been tested using the MFJSD, such as functional food and pharmaceutical carrier particles, ceramic and catalysis composites. The size of uniform particle can be made from 10 to 300 μm. Two experimental case studies using the MFJSD are introduced. Firstly, non-agglomerated and uniform microcomposites containing alpha-D-lactose monohydrate, silica nanoparticle, and Eu(III) have been synthesized by the MFJSD-II. The as-prepared particles have been characterized using the light microscope, field emission scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The impact of the precursor composition, ingredient concentration, and drying temperature profile on the particle size, morphology, structure, and element distribution in the composite matrix has been investigated. Distinct from the spherical lactose microparticles with smooth surface, both silica nanoparticle/lactose and Eu(III) /silica nanoparticle/lactose microcomposites are of a bowl-like shape with smooth top and wrinkled bottom. Two possible mechanisms induced by the presence of colloidal silica nanoparticles have been proposed for the formation of such composite structure. X-ray diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectra have been carried out to identify the physical state and surface chemistry of the particles. Transmission electron microscope images of the calcined spray-dried Eu(III) /silica nanoparticle/lactose microcomposites shows the homogeneous distribution of Eu 2 O 3 nanoparticles. Photoluminescence spectra indicate that high Eu(III) -doped concentration has led to the photoluminescence intensity enhancement, whereas spray drying temperature has shown little impact on the photoluminescence property. Secondly, uniform-sized vitamin B 12 -loaded silica microencapsulates have been synthesized via the MFJSD-I. Particle size and morphology have been characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope. With similar initial droplet size and spray drying conditions, added of either alpha-D-lactose monohydrate or Na-alginate generally results in larger particle size. Furthermore, additive lactose facilitates the formation of spherical particles with relatively smooth surface, whereas the presence of Na-alginate renders the particles buckled with either smooth or rough surface, depending on additive amount. In vitro vitamin B 12 release and silica-matrix degradation profiles have shown significant dependence with the additive type and content. In general, lactose accelerates both of the drug release and matrix degradation, likely due to the relatively fast lactose dissolution facilitating the buffer penetration. On the contrary, Na-alginate appears to serve as an additional barrier decelerating the matrix degradation and prolonging the drug release. Increasing drug loading accelerates the drug release, especially in first few hours of the process, probably due to the drug enrichments near or on the particle surface increasing the driving force for mass transfer. However, the drug loading amount tested in this study has shown no obvious impact on the silica-matrix degradation rate. The drug release kinetics studies indicate the drug diffusion-dependant release mechanism regardless the additive type and amount...|$|R
