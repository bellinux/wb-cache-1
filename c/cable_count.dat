40|$|In {{ultrasound}} imaging catheter applications, gathering {{the data from}} multi-element transducer arrays is difficult {{as there is a}} restriction on <b>cable</b> <b>count</b> due to the diameter of the catheter. In such applications, CMUT-on-CMOS technology allows for 2 D arrays with many elements to be designed and bonded directly onto CMOS circuitry. This allows for complex electronics to be placed {{at the tip of the}} catheter which leads to the possibility to include electronic multiplexing techniques to greatly reduce the <b>cable</b> <b>count</b> required for a large element array. Current approaches to cable reduction tend to rely on area and power hungry circuits to function, making them unsuitable for use in catheters. Furthermore the length requirement for catheters and lack of power available to on-chip cable drivers leads to limited signal strength at the receiver end. In this paper an alternative approach using Analogue Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is presented, which addresses the cable restrictions of the catheter and, using a novel digital demultiplexing technique, allows for a reduction in the number of analogue signal processing stages required...|$|E
40|$|In {{real-time}} catheter based 3 D {{ultrasound imaging}} applications, gathering {{data from the}} transducer arrays is difficult {{as there is a}} restriction on <b>cable</b> <b>count</b> due to the diameter of the catheter. Although area and power hungry multiplexing circuits integrated at the catheter tip are used in some applications, these are unsuitable for use in small sized catheters for applications like intracardiac imaging. Furthermore, the length requirement for catheters and limited power available to on-chip cable drivers leads to limited signal strength at the receiver end. In this paper an alternative approach using Analog Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is presented which addresses the cable restrictions of ultrasound catheters. A novel digital demultiplexing technique is also described which allows for a {{reduction in the number of}} analog signal processing stages required. The TDM and digital demultiplexing schemes are demonstrated for an intracardiac imaging system that would operate in the 4 MHz to 11 MHz range. A TDM integrated circuit (IC) with 8 : 1 multiplexer is interfaced with a fast ADC through a micro-coaxial catheter cable bundle, and processed with an FPGA RTL simulation. Input signals to the TDM IC are recovered with - 40 dB crosstalk between channels on the same micro-coax, showing the feasibility of this system for ultrasound imaging applications...|$|E
50|$|As of June 2012, the <b>cable</b> {{operator}} <b>counts</b> over a {{half million}} high-speed fiber-optic customers and 4.6 million households connected to the network. Later that year in November 2012, a company press release announced that the number had grown to almost 600,000. According to figures published by Arcep, Numericable holds 70% of the high-speed fiber-optic market.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, he was still Ambassador at Berlin despite his {{advanced}} age and being partly deaf. In order to bypass him, Foreign Minister Count von Berchtold dispatched his chef de cabinet Count von Hoyos on 4 July as a special envoy to Berlin to request support from the Kaiser for the Austro-Hungarian plans for action against Serbia. Count von Hoyos arrived the following day from Vienna and reviewed the documents with Count Szőgyény-Marich before the latter met with the Kaiser at Potsdam for lunch. In the evening he <b>cabled</b> <b>Count</b> von Berchtold that he had received [...] "full German backing" [...] in any action that Vienna decided to take, even if [...] "serious European complications" [...] resulted, requesting only {{that it would be}} done speedily. The Kaiser's pledge was confirmed the following day by Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg and Zimmermann, the Under Secretary of State. Austria-Hungary had received the so-called 'blank check' promising German support for an Austro-Hungarian attack on Serbia. Count Szőgyény-Marich's action during this critical month has been much debated by historians, some arguing that he did not fully grasp all the intrinsic details in the conversations he entertained with German leaders, in particular that he exaggerated the German support, and that his reports to Vienna therefore were misleading.|$|R
5000|$|During his tenure, Al Jazeera America's ratings grew {{for three}} {{continuous}} quarters, and topped at three million unique viewers {{in the first}} two weeks of July 2014. The medium also became available to 60 million households under Al Shihabi, which is below the 100 million mark other <b>cable</b> broadcasters <b>count</b> with. The broadcaster amassed a number of journalism awards as well, including two Peabody Awards. This, however, was not enough according to some, describing its 30 thousand daily viewers as too low, or even [...] "minuscule", and stating its online presence as deficient, even though some praised its content's quality.|$|R
50|$|The gauge {{numbers in}} SWG (standard wire gauge) and AWG (American wire gauge) reduce as the wire gets larger. Sizing in square {{millimeters}} is also common {{outside of the}} US. Suppliers and manufacturers often specify their <b>cable</b> in strand <b>count.</b> A 189 strand count wire has a cross-sectional area of 1.5 mm2 which equates to 126.7 strands per mm2.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, Sky Cable {{revenues}} {{increased by}} 18% to P6.99 billion from P5.94 billion. The growth in Sky Cable revenues was partly {{attributable to the}} acquisition of Destiny Cable, Inc. Postpaid revenues grew by 16% and broadband revenues by 33%. SKY’s <b>cable</b> TV subscriber <b>count</b> improved by 10 percent as {{of the end of}} 2012 while SKYbroadband registered a 44 percent growth on its base versus the previous year.|$|R
50|$|VASCAR {{relies on}} the {{accuracy}} of the patrol vehicle's speedometer drive (generally located within the vehicle transmission) for determining the distance traveled, using an odometer within the VASCAR system itself. Recently-purchased law enforcement vehicles generally have electronic speedometers, and a sensor wire is connected to the speed-sensor feed wire to count the pulses from the drive. Older vehicles, with cable-driven speedometers, are connected to the VASCAR unit with a mechanical-optical adapter which attaches to the <b>cable.</b> Pulses are <b>counted</b> the same way for both input methods.|$|R
50|$|Cable {{television}} {{was introduced to}} Peru in 1982, {{in the city of}} Iquitos. Polish entrepreneur Stanisław Tymiński established a company called TVS (Televisión Selva) that year and was the first cable television system to deliver pay content to homes in Iquitos and in Peru. Eight years later, in 1990, controversial businessman Genaro Delgado-Parker established Peru's second cable television system in Lima, called Telecable, delivering contents via MMDS only to high class neighborhoods. In 1993, Cable Mágico was established, widely spreading the reach of cable television to the middle and lower classes, expanding operations later that decade to the eight main cities throughout the country. From then on, many local companies started offering pay contents in almost every town in Peru. These small companies are grouped through APTC (Asociacion Peruana de Television por <b>Cable)</b> and they <b>count</b> approximately 400 current members. According to INEI, the statistics organization for Peru, pay television services reach approximately 26% of the country's population and 52% of the population in Lima. DTH services are also offered by DirecTV, Claro and Movistar.|$|R
50|$|The Epix {{television}} service officially launched at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 30, 2009 on Verizon FiOS systems, {{becoming the}} first U.S. premium <b>cable</b> channel (not <b>counting</b> multiplex services of existing pay services) to debut since Liberty Media and Tele-Communications, Inc. launched Starz 15 years earlier on February 1, 1994. The first program to air on the channel was the film Iron Man, followed by the concert special Madonna Sticky & Sweet Tour: Live from Buenos Aires. Initially a single channel service, Epix was offered to subscribers of Verizon FiOS - which carried the channel for free during its debut weekend - for $9.99 per month (significantly less than the subscription rates of other premium channels, which normally {{range in price from}} $12.99 to $17.99 per month). Epix also provided customers - including those that were not Verizon FiOS subscribers - free previews of the online service each weekend through the end of November 2009, permitting access to the website's film content using invite codes given on a first come, first served basis.|$|R
