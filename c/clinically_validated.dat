40|$|Objective: The {{conventional}} {{method of}} dividing hepatic segment 2 (S 2) and 3 (S 3) is subjective and CT interpretation is unclear. The {{purpose of our}} study was to test the validity of our hypothesis that the actual plane dividing S 2 and S 3 is a vertical plane of equal distance from the S 2 and S 3 portal veins in clinical situations. Materials and Methods: We prospectively performed thin-section iodized-oil CT immediately after segmental chemoembolization of S 2 or S 3 in 27 consecutive patients and measured the angle of intersegmental plane on sagittal multiplanar reformation (MPR) images to verify its vertical nature. Our hypothetical plane dividing S 2 and S 3 is vertical and equidistant from the S 2 and S 3 portal veins (vertical method). To <b>clinically</b> <b>validate</b> this, we retrospectively collected 102 patients with small solitary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) on S 2 or S 3 the segmental location of which was confirmed angiographically.
