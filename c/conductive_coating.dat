We found that this coating method improves the electrical properties of the nanocomposites in two ways. First, the coating becomes the main electrical conductive path. Second, the coating promotes the formation of a percolation network at a low filler concentration (0. 3 wt %).

40|$|Abstract. The {{wireless}} communication systems are applied in different {{applications such as}} computers, mobile phones, satellites and antennas for off-body communication. A lot of {{efforts were made to}} have the antennas in a smaller size, flat and with better performance. In the last decade the rigid antennas are replaced with textile in order to be flexible and to be integrated into garments in order to have wearable textile systems. The textile antennas can find use in medical, military and first responders monitoring. The conductivity of the antennas can be achieved by using coated textile materials which are available in the market, conductive threads for embroidery or conductive inks. When using the <b>conductive</b> <b>coated</b> textile it is necessary to cut the patch in the desired pattern but using a simple cutting tool sometimes is not very precise and accurate.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} conducting polymers {{for a wide variety of}} applications. This includes the study and development of alternative contact-connector materials. The main aim is to achieve overall improvements in performance as well as cost effectiveness. Currently, extrinsic conducting polymers (ECPs) are employed as <b>conductive</b> <b>coats</b> or adhesives at contact interfaces. However, frictional abrasion within the metal-doped polymer (ECP) causes instability in the resistance. It is important to overcome this fretting effect, especially in automotive applications; hence, the possibilities of employing intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) are explored. Flat contact film coatings have been fabricated in-house using poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiopene) /poly(4 -styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT/PSS) with dimethylformamide as the secondary solvent. Resistance is measured using the four-wire method. The conductivities of the PEDOT/PSS-coated contacts are found to be in the order of 10 - 2 S cm- 1. The change of resistance under varying compression forces has been found to be repeatable. The thermal effects on these contacts are also studied and the results are depicted as exponential negative temperature coefficients of resistance...|$|R
