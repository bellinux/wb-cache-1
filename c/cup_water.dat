40|$|Irrigas is a water tension {{measuring}} system {{made out of}} a porous cup (sensor), connected to a gas pressurizing/measuring device by a flexible tube. Water tension (T) is obtained from the equation T=Td-p or T=Ts-p, where Td is the sensor desorption critical water tension (bubbling beginning), Ts is the sensor sorption critical water tension (bubbling ceasing) and p is the applied gas pressure. Differently from conventional tensiometers, the irrigas porous cup cavity is filled with air. This characteristics makes the irrigas system nearly maintenance free and also eliminates the need of making hydrostatic pressure corrections for sensor depth. The system was tested both in the desorption and sorption modes. In the first case the Richards pressure chamber was used to adjus) t the soil water tension which makes the porous cup air permeable. The water tension thus obtained was always practically equal to the Td values measured by the bubbling method, observation that is a physical validation of the barrel immersion technique for irrigas usage for irrigation management. Important for instrument dimensioning, porous <b>cup</b> <b>water</b> loss {{as a function of}} water tension measured from zero to Td was diminutive, increased with the soil water tension and was smaller in higher Td porous cups. In the sorption mode, functioning as a gaseous tensiometer, driven by a steady air-flow source, irrigas sensors yielded, directly, water tension readings ranging from zero to Ts. For irrigation scheduling purposes, commercial irrigas water tension systems can be selected according to crop critical water tension requirements...|$|E

Foram {{realizadas}} as contagens de coliformes totais, coliformes fecais, Escherichia coli, estreptococos fecais e microrganismos mesófilos. Os resultados obtidos figuraram que as amostras de água dos reservatórios, de ambos os bebedouros, apresentaram-se contaminadas microbiologicamente antes de passarem pelos bebedouros. A contaminação por bactérias de poluição fecal foi maior nas amostras colhidas nos bebedouros tipo taça, assim como eles foram responsáveis por um maior acúmulo de matéria orgânica, tendo então uma elevada demanda de cloro e uma maior influência na depreciação da qualidade da água fornecida às aves. Dos dois tipos de bebedouros estudados, o tipo nipple mostrou ser o menos deletério no que concerne à qualidade da água entretanto, independente do tipo de bebedouro utilizado na dessedentação das aves, a desinfecção da água é um ato imprescindível à manutenção de sua qualidade e à eliminação de futuros patógenos.

Results showed that both, water trough and tank water, were microbiologycally contaminated before passing through the water trough. The contamination of fecal bacteria was greater in the <b>cup</b> <b>water</b> trough samples, as well as, they were the responsible for a greater organic material accumulation, that caused an elevated chlorine demand and greater depreciation in the water quality offered to the laying hens.

40|$|Introduction The project “ZEOLIFE - Water {{pollution}} {{reduction and}} water saving using a natural zeolitite cycle” has been conceived to test an innovative integrated zeolitite application having the aim {{to reduce the}} NH 4 content in livestock effluents and correct agricultural soils, with improvement of the yield and economization of water for irrigation and fertilizers. This project leads to a reduction of fresh and groundwater pollution and avoids excessive exploitation of the water resource. For further details visit the website www. zeolife. it. The first goal {{of the project was}} to carry out a chemical and physical, as well as mineralogical characterization of several zeolitite samples, coming from different quarries located in Central Italy, in order to select the most suitable raw material to be used throughout the entire project. Samples from the following seven localities were analyzed: Sorano (Gr), Sovana (Gr), Farnese (Vt), Grotte Santo Stefano (Vt), Corchiano (Vt), Nepi (Vt), and Riano (Rm). All the mentioned localities are the closest to the experimental field (Codigoro, Ferrara); in each quarry non-marketable material, namely broken blocks or blocks with irregular shape and size, is available. This material represents an already available reserve of zeolitic tuff that best fit the purposes of this project. Besides the technological properties of the raw material, the final choice also took into account factors of environmental (e. g. carbon footprint) and economic (e. g, cost, full and immediate availability) concern. Experimental In order to obtain representative samples from each examined locality, an appropriate procedure was followed by picking out a total amount of 10 kg of raw material from different points of the quarries. The collected material was accurately ground, and repeatedly quartered until obtaining the needed sample amount. Quantitative mineralogical analyses were carried out using the Rietveld method via the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software package [1], combined with the Reference Intensity Ratio (RIR) method for the determination of the amorphous phase [2]. Whole rock chemical analysis was carried out on pressed pellets via a wavelength-dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Loss On Ignition (LOI) was determined by sample heating in a oven at 1100 °C. CEC determination of exchanged Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, and K+ cations was achieved via Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) measurements. Apparent density was determined as the ratio between the mass of ground sample which fills a measuring cup in loose conditions and the volume of the <b>cup.</b> <b>Water</b> retention was determined using a modified Campbell’s methods [3]. Results and discussion As demonstrated by plenty of experimental scientific works (e. g., [4] for a review), chabazite is very effective not only in NH 4 uptake from swine manure, but also in successive controlled NH 4 release in soils. Other zeolite species, such as phillipsite, have great potential for 244 NH 4 adsorption and retention, but not the same capacity as chabazite in exchanging NH 4 with circulating solutions and plant root systems in soils. A comparison between samples from studied quarries is reported in Fig. 1. As can be observed the Sorano zeolitite shows the best features (e. g., high zeolite content and high CEC) ...|$|E

You couldn't blame them for worshipping him -centering evc:ry thought upon him, making them feel that they, too were like other people. Everything changed. They did the house over. He joined a club -she went in for settlement work. The house rang with youngsters. Presently the boy was out of grammar, out of high, headed for college. Going in for law. Their dreams soared. And suddenly incredibly, we were at war. Th boy was off-wild with excitement. They couldn't be­lieve it but somehow they got through the d!!ys. Then the news came. They sat for a long time, staring at the paper. He tried to speak but no sound came. After a while she walked slowly to the window, pulled down the shades. Drew Shade. on Lile He didn't go to the store next day-nor next week. She can­celed her settlement meetings. They stayed inside-eating out of paper bags. Their friends under stood.

Bit by bit, {{the two of them had}} lost their grip on life-gone back into the soli­tude from which the boy had saved them. Now she doesn't care to go on. In desperation, a friend has written to me. "You've lost a boy. Maybe you'll know [...] " Yes, I know. So do those thou­lIands of 0 the r heartbroken parents whose letters pile on my desk. And my answer to one goes for all. ·Why should you go on? Your boy is why. This world he lov d is why. And all the boys who Will come after, are why. If you let yourself go, you're selling him out and his world and his dreams. You're being a quitter. You're dodging a debt. No Que. tion 01 Wanting You haven't a free choice in this matter. You can't go off into the darkness with a broken heart and call it a day. You have bonds, obligationR, ties you can't ignore. You're not just cruelly hurt in­dividuals. You're part of the' scheme of things and you can't lose your grip on that scheme. It isn't a question of whether you want to live. Living is your job. You've got to see it through. You don't belong to that lonely grave. You belong to life. Life gave you the greatest joy, the most glorious privilege and pride you've ever known. You never knew what rapture meant till the poy was born. Then you stopped being just two people. You be­came part of all people. You shared yourself and your happi­ness -and there isn't money enough in thc world to pay for what you received in return. You realize that, don't you? But do you also realize that you owe a debt for every laugh, every kiss, every dream, every happy hour together? Life gave. Your boy knew beautiful, wonderful days because other men and women had worked and sacrificed and bat­tled for that wonder and beauty. They paid their debt and passed their achievement along. Are you going to break the chain? Life gave. You took. Now it's up to you to pay-and abundantly. For it isn't enough to be brave. It isn't enough to go grimly through the gestures. You've got to repay the principal with in­terest. Otherwise you'll be leaving the world the poorer for his birth. You'll be telling the world that love wasn't worth its cost.

Practices What She ·Teoches DOROTHY COON prepares rhubarb for a canning 1 Asparagus, anothf'r of the first spring canning monstration. Rhubarb and strawberrlell can be foods, requires pressure cooker. All home cannE'd afely canned by the watel' bath or preS 8 UrE' cannE'r. foods should be cooked 10 minutes before tasting, Director 01 Homemaker Center Foresees Big Canning Season MBy MARIAN KITTELL ANY a friendship starts with a seemingly insignificant detail such as a cake recipe or a valuable household hint. And where homemakers do it on small scale, Dorothy Coon, director of Homemakers' Center in one of Toledo's department stores indulges in such neighborliness on a mass scale. She estimates that 800 women each month attend sessions at the cen­ter, not to mention the many pi) rsonal requests that come In one by one. Right now, Mrs. Coon is busy launching the center's canning program for slimmer and perfect­ing plans for drying, brinlng and freezing demonstrations latcr on. She personally has canned dem­onstration jars of strawberries, asparagus and rhubarb. Time for canning them is just around the corner. "The Government," comments Mrs. Coon, "has asked all house­wives to can a little more in ' 44. They are backing up their request by releasing pressure canners for safe home canning. " Pre••ure Canner. Now is the time she says to check old canners and send faulty parts to the manufacturer for repairs. She stresses that the individual manufacturer's direc­tions should be followed in using a pressure canner. Every safety precaution in canning should be observed. Food lJ(lisoning is too deadly to gamble with by using slipshod methods. Plenty of lids will be available for canning even though the jars, such as wide mouth ones, are no longer being manufactured. In sealing glass coffee jars, Mrs. Coon advises punching a few holes in the can's lid that is used as a seal­ing ring. It will make removal easy later on. Although canning is of prime interest at the Homemakers' Cen­ter just now, conservation and meeting every day problems Is the year around theme. Helping women with their cur­rent problems, whether it be making dress forms, fighting moths, a problem In menu plan­ning or infant feeding, is Mrs. Coon's job. Also she likes to pass along good ideas that women who at­tend the center bring in. Current­ly her desk is decorated with the offering of one-a gay centerpiece of tulips, made from nearly whole, dyed egg shells. Wacky Cake Another woman who declared she couldn't bake a cake until someone told her about Wacky Cake bro ht in the recipe. Mrs. Coon triS 'lJis amazing cake that is miXS" he pan it's baked in [...] trlbuted the recipe far and wide. Here it is: WACKY CAKE: Sift flour and measure 1 ¥ [...] cupfuls. To it add 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon soda, ¥ [...] tea­spoon salt and 3 tablespoons cocoa. Sift together three times. Then place mixture in a greased loaf pan. Make 3 dents In top of flour mixture. In the fil'st dent place 1 teaspoon vinegar. In the second dent place 1 teaspoon va­nilla. In the third dent place 15 tablespoons melted shortening. POur 1 <b>cup</b> <b>water</b> over this and mix well. Bake 35 minutes in moderate (350 degree FJ oven. After it is cooled, the following icing is suggested: cup butter or margarine, 1 heaping cup of powered sugar, 3 tablespoons cocoa. Cream and add 2 table­spoons strong coffee and tea­Spoon vanilla. Spread over cake. And if anyone should be well equipped for adVice, it is Dorothy Coon. She practices what she preaches in her own maidless eight-room home. She is the wife of Charles F. Coon and mother of teen age Zanna and Charles (Sonny) Coon. A Spitz dog which Mrs. Coon gaily says looks like a moth-eaten throw rug com­pletes the family circle. The family helps, of course, each member having specific duties. Mrs. Coon believes in I J t j 1 v schedules, not only for food but work. They are made out a week In advance, so that the family will know what's coming up and be ready to help on them. Food. at Home Food Is purchased once a week and left overs are not only ex­pected, but planned for. A large enough Sunday roast is purchased 80 that It will provide mea. t bails or stew for two more meals. Mrs. Coon admits that meat points "peter out" by the end of the week when low point foods such as wieners and sauerkraut or macaroni and cheese are served. She and her family are all fond of soybeans, which she purchases at health food counters or In the country. They are served baked, in soup or cold in salads. But ahe makes a wry face when creamed soybeans are mentioned. One of the family's favorite ways of having this food Is to mix equal quantities of raw hamburger, cooked soybeans and a bit of chopped onion and salt. They are formed into balls and fried like meat patties. Always at the Coon home this 'oriental food is served with a crisp green salad. Mrs. Coon is undoubtedly one of the handsomest women in To­ledo and her beauty Is strength­ened by a charming and unaf­fected personality. She is ener­getic without being nervous and calm without being complacent. She enjoys a tremendous zest in everything she does and finds much pleasure in her family and their friends. The Coon home ap­parently is a neighborhood meet­ing place of tecn age youngsters. Beside her home and her job, IIhe finds time to be an active member of the Quota Club, Vernon McCune Post Auxiliary, and Psi Chi Phi alumni group.
