40|$|The {{study of}} four <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skulls</b> (two fetuses, one infant, {{and a young}} adult) {{concerns}} two Pfeiffer syndromes, a thanatophoric dysplasia and an isolated case. Clinical and radiologic examinations showed malformations {{at the level of}} the calvarium, the base, orbital cavities, and, sometimes, limb abnormalities. Correlations between these findings and the microradiographic analysis of nondemineralized sections elucidate this trilobular appearance of the skull. Premature temporoparietal suture closure terminates at a constricted surface of the lateral sides of the skull during the fetal life. Extension of the synostosis to coronal and frontal sutures and thickening of the occipital bone squama block lengthening of the skull. The consecutive reduction in skull volume is compensated by the maintenance of the permeability during the neonatal period of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. Microradiographic examination shows that this anomaly may be of vascular origin and associated with abnormal osteoclastic resorption...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{present the}} {{ultrasound}} and molecular genetic diagnosis of thanatophoric dysplasia type II (TD 2). Case Report: A 35 -year-old, primigravid woman {{was referred to}} our institution for genetic counseling and amniocentesis at 19 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age and sonographic abnormalities in the fetus. The prenatal ultrasound showed short straight femurs, prominent forehead, narrow chest, skin edema, short limbs, and <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull</b> consistent with the diagnosis of TD 2. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 46,XX. DNA testing for the FGFR 3 gene using uncultured amniocytes revealed a heterozygous c. 1948 A>G, AAG>GAG transversion leading to a p. Lys 650 Glu(K 650 E) mutation in the FGFR 3 gene. A prenatal ultrasound at 21 weeks of gestation showed ventriculomegaly, <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull,</b> straight femurs, micromelia, narrow chest, and pseudoencephalocele with a bulging occipital bone mimicking encephalocele. The pregnancy was subsequently terminated, and a 480 -g malformed fetus was delivered with macrocephaly, depressed nasal bridge, short upturned nasal tip, hypoplastic midface, frontal bossing, short digits, trident-shaped hands, short limbs, <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull,</b> narrow chest, brachydactyly, nuchal edema, and bulging occipital bone. Conclusion: A prenatal diagnosis of <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull,</b> short limbs, straight femurs, and occipital pseudoencephalocele should include a differential diagnosis of TD 2.

40|$|Thanatophoric {{dwarfism}} (TD), literally meaning death seeking dwarf, is {{the most}} common form of lethal bone dysplasia characterized by severe micromelia, extra folds of skin and narrow chest. Other signs include small ribs, underdeveloped lungs, <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull,</b> hypertelorism and protuberant abdomen. A short neck, depressed nasal bridge and hypoplastic mandible may also be present. Hydrocephalus is uncommon but is another poor prognostic sign. The diagnosis is usually made with the ultrasonography in the second trimester. Based on the morphological characters, this condition is sub-divided into type 1 and type 2. Fetuses with this condition are either still-born or die shortly after birth.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a female infant with Pfeiffer-like {{syndrome}} and holoprosencephaly. She had a <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull,</b> ocular proptosis, broad thumbs and halluces, and variable accompanying anomalies compatible with Pfeiffer syndrome.

40|$|Thanatophoric {{dysplasia}} (TD) is {{the most}} common type of lethal skeletal dysplasia in fetuses and neonates.

Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FBGFR 3) gene, on the short arm of chromosome 4, have been described in cases of TD (1). TD can be detected by ultrasonography but other skeletal system anomalies such as osteogenesis imperfecta, achondrogenesis and achondroplasia should be taken into consideration for the differential diagnosis (2).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report on}} a case of Pfeiffer Syndrome, with a {{discussion}} of the diagnostic characteristics and features of disease types and the differential diagnosis.

Type 1 is commonly associated with normal intelligence and generally good outcome. Types 2 and 3 generally have severe neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early death and sporadic occurrence.

40|$|The Museum Vrolik {{collection}} of the Department of Anatomy and Embryology of the University of Amsterdam, founded by Gerardus Vrolik (1775 - 1859) and his son Willem Vrolik (1801 - 1863), consists of more than five thousand specimens of human and animal anatomy, embryology, pathology, and congenital anomalies. Recently, the {{collection of}} congenital anomalies was recatalogued and redescribed according to contempory syndromological views.

40|$|Pfeiffer {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal dominant disease that affects almost 1 out of every 100, 000 live newborns, and it is associated with craniosynostosis, broad and deviated thumbs and big toes, and partial syndactyly in hands and feet. Three types of this syndrome have been described based {{on the presence of}} other abnormalities and the severity of the condition. “Classic” type 1 consists of mild severity with normal to near-normal intelligence and generally a good prognosis. Type 2 is characterized by a <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull,</b> severe proptosis, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, growth retardation and life-threatening neurological and respiratory complications.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{prenatal}} diagnosis of thanatophoric dysplasia by defining {{the change in}} fetal size across gestation {{and the frequency of}} sonographic features, and developing non-invasive molecular genetic diagnosis based on cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma. Fetuses with a confirmed diagnosis of thanatophoric dysplasia were ascertained, records reviewed, sonographic features and measurements determined. Charts of fetal size were then constructed using the LMS (lambda-mu-sigma) method and compared with charts used in normal pregnancies and those complicated by achondroplasia. Cases in this cohort referred to our Regional Genetics Laboratory for molecular diagnosis using cffDNA were identified and results reviewed. Forty-two cases were scanned in our units. Commonly reported sonographic features were very short and sometimes bowed femora, frontal bossing, <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull,</b> short fingers, a small chest and polyhydramnios. Limb shortening was obvious from as early as 13 weeks' gestation, with minimal growth after 20 [*]weeks. Analysis of cffDNA in three of these pregnancies confirmed the presence of the c. 742 C>CT (p. Arg 248 Cys) or the c. 1948 A>AG (p. Lys 650 Glu) mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene.

40|$|Thanatophoric {{dwarfism}} (TD) is a sporadic lethal skeletal dysplasia with micromelic shortening of the limbs, macrocephaly, platyspondyly {{and reduced}} thoracic cavity. In {{the most common}} subtype (TD 1), femurs are curved, while in TD 2, straight femurs are associated with <b>cloverleaf</b> <b>skull.</b> Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR 3) gene were identified in both subtypes. While TD 2 was accounted for by a single recurrent mutation in the tyrosine kinase 2 domain, TD 1 resulted from either stop codon mutations or missense mutations in the extracellular domain of the gene. Here, we report the identification of FGFR 3 mutations in 25 / 26 TD cases. Two novel missense mutations (Y 373 C and G 370 C) were detected in 8 / 26 and 1 / 26 TD 1 cases respectively. Both mutations created cysteine residues in the juxta extramembrane domain of the receptor. Sixteen cases carried the previously reported R 248 C (9 / 26 cases), S 249 C (2 / 26 cases) or stop codon FGFR 3 mutations (5 / 26 cases).
