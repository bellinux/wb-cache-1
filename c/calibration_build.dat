40|$|Ultra-compact, {{low-cost}} microbolometer cameras {{have entered}} the commercial market in recent years. One {{of the most prominent}} of these has been the FLIR Lepton, which has a similar form factor as most cell phone cameras. This presentation will show results of a radiometric <b>calibration</b> that <b>builds</b> on experience calibrating larger-format microbolometer cameras such as the FLIR Photon and Tau. These calibrations require characterization of the camera’s response with changes due to the focal plane array (FPA) temperature. The low thermal mass of the ultra-compact Lepton poses significant challenges to its calibration. For example, performing a non-uniformity correction (NUC) using the attached shutter raises the FPA temperature and camera body temperature. If left uncompensated, this signal significantly impacts the radiometric accuracy. The presentation will report the level of achieved accuracy on this ultra-low cost sensor...|$|R

However, two major technical challenges persist for current Wi-Fi based location systems, instability in positioning accuracy due to changing environmental dynamics, and the need for manual offline calibration during site survey. To address these two challenges, three environmental factors (people, doors, and humidity) that can interfere with radio signals and cause positioning inaccuracy are identified.

We compared three different spiking neuron models, namely the integrate-and-fire (IF), regular spiking (RS) and resonator (RES). First, {{we show that}} different models have different frequency-dependent response properties, yielding large differences in excitability. Then, we investigate the responsiveness of these models to a single afferent inhibitory/excitatory spike, and calibrate the total synaptic drive such that they would exhibit similar peaks of the post-synaptic potentials (PSP). Based on the synaptic <b>calibration,</b> we <b>build</b> large microcircuits of IF, RS and RES neurons and show that the resonance property favors homeostasis and self-sustainability of the network activity. On the other hand, integration is producing instability while it endows the network with other useful properties, such as responsiveness to external inputs.

Several application domains offer the opportunity to tradeoff quality of service/solution (QoS) for improvements in performance and reduction in energy consumption. Programmers sometimes take advantage of such opportunities, albeit in an ad-hoc manner and often without providing any QoS guarantees. We propose a system called Green that provides a simple and flexible framework that allows programmers {{to take advantage of}} such approximation opportunities in a systematic manner while providing statistical QoS guarantees.

40|$|Microbial {{denitrification}} plays {{a central}} role in nitrous oxide (N 2 O) -emitting processes, which are involved in ecosystem services such as crop production and climate regulation. Field characterization of N 2 O-emitting processes being time-consuming due to great variability, laboratory determination of potential denitrification (upon incubation) is often used as a valuable test. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a time- and cost-effective approach that has been reported to allow accurate determination of several soil properties. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess the interest of NIRS for determining potential denitrification over a set of 460 topsoils sampled under crops, tree plantations, savanna or rainforest, originating from Madagascar, Congo-Brazzaville, Brazil, and French Guiana. Prediction of potential denitrification using NIRS was satisfying over the total set, especially with LOCAL <b>calibration,</b> which <b>builds</b> a model for each sample separately using its spectral neighbours in the calibration subset (R 2 = 0. 79 for validation). For the other sets, either textural or geographical, global calibration only was performed, involving for each set a unique prediction model built with all calibration samples. The accuracy of NIRS determination depended on the sample set, decreasing in the following order: Malagasy clayey set > total set ? Brazilian sandy loam set > coarse-textured set (Congo-Brazil) ? Guianese sandy clay loam set ? Congolese sandy set > non-clayey set (Congo-Brazil-Guiana), with cross-validation R 2 ranging from 0. 88 to 0. 44 (external validation was not carried out for small-sized sets). Thus NIRS prediction was more accurate over the clayey homogeneous set than over the non-clayey heterogeneous set. As a result of global calibration, potential denitrification was expressed as a linear combination of absorbance at every wavelength. Wavelengths that contributed most to NIRS prediction of soil potential denitrification corresponded to wavelengths that literature has assigned to organic nitrogenous compounds, amide-containing ones especially, and to carbonaceous compounds such as cellulose or including CH 3 or CH 2 groups. This related to the importance of amides in soil organic nitrogen and microbial biomass, and to the dependence of denitrification on soil organic matter. In short, NIRS is a time- and cost-effective approach that proved relevant for determining soil potential denitrification with acceptable accuracy, especially for clayey samples or when LOCAL calibration was performed.

The major objective was to integrate remotely sensed data with geospatial analysis for high throughput phenotyping of large wheat breeding nurseries. The initial step was to develop and validate a semi-automated high-throughput phenotyping pipeline using a low-cost UAS and NIR camera, image processing, and radiometric <b>calibration</b> to <b>build</b> orthomosaic imagery and 3 D models. The relationship between plot-level data (vegetation indices and height) extracted from UAS imagery and manual measurements were examined and found to have a high correlation. Data derived from UAS imagery performed as well as manual measurements while exponentially increasing the amount of data available. The high-resolution, high-temporal HTP data extracted from this pipeline offered the opportunity to develop a within season grain yield prediction model. Due to the variety in genotypes and environmental conditions, breeding trials are inherently spatial in nature and vary non-randomly across the field. This makes geographically weighted regression models a good choice as a geospatial prediction model. Finally, with the addition of georeferenced and spatial data integral in HTP and imagery, we were able to reduce the environmental effect from the data and increase the accuracy of UAS plot-level data. The models developed through this research, when combined with genotyping technologies, increase the volume, accuracy, and reliability of phenotypic data to better inform breeder selections. This increased accuracy with evaluating and predicting grain yield will help breeders to rapidly identify and advance the most promising candidate wheat varieties...|$|R

In this context, a major concern is to <b>build</b> <b>calibration</b> models {{that are able to}} provide precise (inverse) predictions for X from measured responses Y. This paper aims at answering the following question : which experiments should be run to set up a (linear or nonlinear) calibration curve that maximises the inverse prediction precisions ? The well known class of optimal designs is presented as a possible solution. The calibration model setup is ﬁrst reviewed in the linear case and extended to the heteroscedastic nonlinear one. In this general case, asymptotic variance and conﬁdence interval formulae are derived for inverse predictions. Two optimality criteria are then introduced to quantify a priori the quality of inverse predictions for a given experimental design. The VI criterion is based on the integral of the inverse prediction variance over the calibration domain and the GI criterion on its maximum value. Algorithmic aspects of the optimal design generation are discussed. In a last section, the methodology is applied to 4 possible calibration models (linear, quadratic, exponential and four parameters logistic). VI and GI optimal designs are compared to classical D, V and G optimal designs. Their predictive quality is also compared to the one of simple traditional equidistant designs and it is shown that, even if these last designs have very different shapes, their predictive quality are not far from the optimal design ones. Finally, some simulations evaluate small sample properties of asymptotic inverse prediction conﬁdence intervals...|$|R
