60|$|As the {{comparatively}} {{small size of}} the lakes in the North of England is favourable {{to the production of}} variegated landscape, their boundary-line also is for the most part gracefully or boldly indented. That uniformity which prevails in the primitive frame of the lower grounds among all chains or clusters of mountains where large bodies of still water are bedded, is broken by the secondary agents of Nature, ever at work to supply the deficiences of the mould in which things were originally cast. Using the word deficiences, I do not speak with reference to those stronger emotions which a region of mountains is peculiarly fitted to excite. The bases of those huge barriers may run for a long space in straight lines, and these parallel to each other; the opposite sides of a profound vale may ascend as exact counterparts, or in mutual reflection, like the billows of a troubled sea; and the impression be, from its very simplicity, more awful and sublime. Sublimity is the result of Nature's first great dealings with the superficies of the Earth; but the general tendency of her subsequent operations is towards the production of beauty; by a multiplicity of symmetrical parts uniting in a consistent whole. This is everywhere exemplified along the margins of these lakes. Masses of rock, that have been precipitated from the heights into the area of waters, lie in some places like stranded ships; or have acquired the compact structure of jutting piers; or project in little peninsulas crested with native wood. The smallest rivulet--one whose silent influx is scarcely noticeable in a season of dry weather--so faint is the dimple made by it {{on the surface of the}} smooth lake--will be found to have been not useless in shaping, by its deposits of gravel and soil in time of flood, a curve that would not otherwise have existed. But the more powerful brooks, encroaching upon the level of the lake, have, in course of time, given birth to ample promontories of sweeping outline that contrast boldly with the longitudinal base of the steeps on the opposite shore; while their flat or gently-sloping-surfaces never fail to introduce, into the midst of desolation and barrenness, the elements of fertility, even where the habitations of men may not have been raised. These alluvial promontories, however, threaten, in some places, to bisect the waters which they have long adorned; and, in course of ages, they will cause some of the lakes to dwindle into numerous and insignificant pools; which, in their turn, will finally be filled up. But, checking these intrusive calculations, let us rather be content with appearances as they are, and pursue in imagination the meandering shores, whether rugged steeps, admitting of no cultivation, descend into the water; or gently-sloping lawns and woods, or flat and fertile meadows, stretch between the margin of the lake and the mountains.

40|$|Received [...] .; {{accepted}} [...] . Abstract. This paper {{discusses the}} properties of the inner puffed-up rim which forms in circumstellar disks when dust evaporates. We argue that the rim shape is controlled by a fundamental property of circumstellar disks, namely their very large vertical density gradient, through the dependence of grain evaporation temperature on gas density. As a result, the bright side of the rim is curved, rather than vertical, as expected when a constant evaporation temperature is assumed. We have computed a number of rim models, which take into account this effect in a self-consistent way. The results show that the <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> (as the vertical rim) emits most of its radiation in the near and mid-IR, and provides a simple explanation to the observed values of the near-IR excess (the “ 3 µm bump ” of Herbig Ae stars). Contrary to the vertical rim, for curved rims the near-IR excess does not depend much on the inclination, being maximum for face-on objects. We have then computed synthetic images of the <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> seen under different inclinations; face-on rims are seen as bright, centrally symmetric rings on the sky; increasing the inclination, the rim takes an elliptical shape, with one side brighter than the other. 1...|$|E

The experiments are {{performed in a}} microfluidic channel, whose surface is patterned with a single hole that serves to anchor the drop while the outer fluid continues to flow. The recirculation pattern {{is found to be}} localized near the liquid-liquid interface for all conditions, with most of the fluid motion taking place in the <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> of the droplet. In contrast, the drop's central region remains nearly stationary. This flow pattern corresponds to a three-dimensional recirculation on the drop surface, with the fluid moving {{in the direction of the}} outer flow on the central plane and in the opposite direction closer to the boundaries. The different velocities scale linearly with the outer fluid velocity for all geometries studied. However, the velocity on the interface is found to be lower than the driving velocity even in the case of a gas bubble, pointing to the effect of surface stresses as the underlying retardation and recirculation mechanism. This motivates the development of a Marangoni model to account for the surfactant accumulation around the downstream stagnation point. The model displays good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations for many viscosity ratios and geometries but for a well-chosen surfactant accumulation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{partitioning}} of lipids {{among different}} microenvironments in a bilayer is of considerable relevance to characterization of composition variations in biomembranes. Atomistic simulation has been ill-suited to model equilibrated lipid mixtures because {{the time required}} for diffusive exchange of lipids among microenvironments exceeds typical submicrosecond molecular dynamics trajectories. Amethod to facilitate local composition fluctuations, usingMonte Carlo mutations to change lipid structures within the semigrand-canonical ensemble (at a fixed difference in component chemical potentials, Dm), was recently implemented to address this challenge. This technique was applied here to mixtures of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and a shorter-tail lipid, either symmetric (didecanoylphosphatidylcholine (DDPC)) or asymmetric (hexanoyl-myristoylphosphatidylcho-line), arranged in two types of structure: bilayer ribbons and buckled bilayers. In ribbons, the shorter-tail component showed a clear enrichment at the highly <b>curved</b> <b>rim,</b> more so for hexanoyl-myristoylphosphatidylcholine than for DDPC. Results on buckled bilayers were variable. Overall, the DDPC content of buckled bilayers tended to exceed by several percent the DDPC content of flat ones simulated at the same Dm, but only for mixtures with low overall DDPC content. Within the buckled bilayer structure, no correlation could be resolved between the sign ormagnitude of the local curvature of a leaflet and themean local lipid composition.

40|$|Pore {{formation}} {{is the most}} energy-demanding step during virus-induced membrane fusion, where high curvature of the fusion pore rim increases the spacing between lipid headgroups, exposing the hydrophobic interior of the membrane to water. How protein fusogens breach this thermodynamic barrier to pore {{formation is}} unclear. We identified a novel fusion-inducing lipid packing sensor (FLiPS) in the cytosolic endodomain of the baboon reovirus p 15 fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein that is essential for pore formation during cell-cell fusion and syncytiogenesis. NMR spectroscopy and mutational studies indicate the dependence of this FLiPS on a hydrophobic helix-loop-helix structure. Biochemical and biophysical assays reveal the p 15 FLiPS preferentially partitions into membranes with high positive curvature, and this partitioning is impeded by bis-ANS, a small molecule that inserts into hydrophobic defects in membranes. Most notably, the p 15 FLiPS can be functionally replaced by heterologous amphipathic lipid packing sensors (ALPS) but not by other membrane-interactive amphipathic helices. Furthermore, a previously unrecognized amphipathic helix in the cytosolic domain of the reptilian reovirus p 14 FAST protein can functionally replace the p 15 FLiPS, and is itself replaceable by a heterologous ALPS motif. Anchored near the cytoplasmic leaflet by the FAST protein transmembrane domain, the FLiPS is perfectly positioned to insert into hydrophobic defects that begin {{to appear in the}} highly <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> of nascent fusion pores, thereby lowering the energy barrier to stable pore formation...|$|E
40|$|Models {{predict that}} in the {{innermost}} AU of the disk around Herbig Ae/Be star, the dust disk forms a "puffed-up" inner rim, which should result in a strongly asymmetric brightness distribution for disks seen under intermediate inclination. Using the VLTI/AMBER long-baseline interferometer, we obtained 24 near-infrared (H- and K-band) spectro-interferometric observations on the Herbig Ae star R CrA. In the derived visibility function, we detect the signatures of an extended (25 mas) and a compact component (5. 8 mas), with the compact component contributing about 2 / 3 of the total flux. The brightness distribution is highly asymmetric, {{as indicated by the}} strong closure phases (up to 40 deg) and the detected position angle dependence of the visibilities and closure phases. To interpret these asymmetries, we employ geometric as well as physical models, including a binary model, a skewed ring model, and a puffed-up inner rim model with a vertical or <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> shape. Our curved puffed-up rim model can reasonably well reproduce the interferometric observables and the SED simultaneously and suggests a luminosity of 29 L_sun and the presence of relatively large (> 1. 2 micron) Silicate dust grains. Perpendicular to the disk, two bow shock-like structures appear in the associated reflection nebula NGC 6729, suggesting that the resolved sub-AU size disk is the driving engine of a large-scale outflow.

Sizes were determined from 2 H- and 31 P NMR {{on the basis of a}} model that incorporated a planar bilayer and a (half-torus) <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> representing the DMPC and DCPC regions of the bicelle, respectively. Good agreement was shown with sizes determined independently from freeze-fracture electron microscopy images. In the presence of K+ and Na+, bicelles have diameters of ∼ 300 Å while in the presence of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +; their diameter increases to ∼ 500 Å. Bicelle magnetic alignment is considerably improved by the presence of salts. The optimum salt concentration for such an effect ranges from 50 to 200 mM. Bicelles are magnetically aligned for temperatures roughly ranging from 30 °C to 40 °C with monovalent cations; this range is slightly extended in the presence of divalent salts. In this temperature range, the dynamics of the long-chain hydrocarbon region of the bicelle (leading to a bicelle thickness of 38 Å) and of water is about the same independently of cation nature and concentration. However, at higher temperatures, considerable differences in water dynamics are observed between systems with monovalent and divalent cations. In these conditions, the system consists of a mixture of micelles and extended bilayers, which show residual macroscopic alignment in the magnetic field...|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is on the effects caused by α-helical {{peptides}} on liposome structure, the impact of cholesterol on the peptide-membrane interactions, {{and the effect of}} aggregate curvature on the peptide affinity. Results of the studies show that the membrane destabilizing effect of the cationic α-helical peptide melittin is modulated by cholesterol. Melittin induces leakage from pure phospholipid liposomes {{in a manner that is}} compatible with the presence of small pores. In the case of cholesterol-supplemented liposomes leakage coincides, however, with major structural transformations and rupture of the liposomes. Cholesterol decreases the affinity of melittin for phospholipid bilayers, but once the peptide has adsorbed to the membrane the presence of cholesterol does not offer any resistance against melittin-induced membrane destabilization. Our investigations indicate that cholesterol affects the alamethicin-lipid bilayer interactions in a similar way. PEG-stabilized bilayer disks are formed upon addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) -lipids to lipid mixtures with high bending rigidity. The partial segregation of components within the bilayer disk, suggested by theoretical calculations and experimental observations, was verified by small angle neutron scattering.

However, more and more bacterial strains develop resistance and the risk to public health can hardly be overstated. New types of antibiotics are urgently needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as potential antibiotics because of their broad-spectrum activities and non-conventional mechanism of action. More recently, they have also received attention as promising anticancer agents. The clinical and commercial development of AMPs as a new generation of antibiotics and anticancer drugs is hampered, however, by issues concerning the toxicity, specificity and stability of the peptides. The aim of this thesis has been to explore if formulation in a novel type of nanocarriers, referred to as lipodisks, can be used to increase the therapeutic potential of AMPs as antimicrobial and anticancer agents. Focus has been on AMPs classified as cationic amphiphilic peptides. Encouragingly, the data presented suggests that the therapeutic potential of the AMP melittin as an antimicrobial and anticancer agent can be substantially increased by formulation in lipodisks. When formulated in the lipodisk, melittin is protected against enzymatic degradation. The lipodisk also offer a slow-release effect that sustains the bacterial cell-killing effect. We also show that specific delivery of melittin to tumour cells can be obtained by formulating the peptide in small EGF-targeting lipodisks. Melittin contains a tryptophan residue and its interaction with lipodisks can be characterized by means of fluorimetric binding assays. In order to investigate the binding behavior also for peptides that lack intrinsic fluorescence, we developed a method based on measurements using the QCM-D technique. Studies using this, and other techniques, confirmed that it is a general behavior for cationic amphiphilic peptides to preferentially bind to the highly <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> of lipodisks. Results of our binding studies show that the peptide to lipid ratio in the lipodisks can be tuned and optimized by varying the size and charge of the disks.

The test specimens consisted of the SLA- 561 V ablator bonded to the honeycomb structure. The primary objective was to evaluate the ablation materials performance and to measure temperatures within the ablator, at the structural bondline and at the back sheet of the honeycomb structure. Other objectives were to evaluate the effect of ablative repair plug material treatment and voids in the heat shield. A total of 29 models were provided for testing in the Ames 60 MW arc-jet facility. Of these, 23 models were flat-faced and six remaining models were curved edge ones, intended to simulate the conditions on the <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> of the forebody where the maximum shear occurred. Eight sets of test conditions were used. The stagnation point heating rates varied from 47 to 240 W/cm 2 and the stagnation pressures from 0. 15 to 0. 27 atm. (The maximum flight values are 132 W/cm 2 and 0. 25 atm) The majority of these runs were made at a nominal stagnation pressure of 0. 25 atm. Two higher pressure runs were made to check the current (denser) ablation material for spallation, {{or other forms of}} thermal stress failure. Over 60 % of the flatfaced models yielded good thermocouple data and all produced useful surface recession information. Of the five curved-edge models that were tested, only one gave good data; the remaining ones experienced model-holder failure. The test results can be summarized by noting that no failure of the ablative material was observed on any model. Also, the bondline temperature design limit of 250 C was never reached within an equivalent flight time despite a stagnation point heat load that exceeded the maximum flight value by up to 130 %. At heating rates of over 200 W/cm 2 and stagnation pressures of 0. 25 atm, or greater, the average surface recessions exceeded 0. 5 cm on some models. The surface roughness increased dramatically at pressures above 0. 25 atm and was four times greater at 0. 27 atm than at 0. 25 atm.

The two closeups show 10 minute renders using original MLT, Manifold Exploration (MEMLT) and MLT with our proposed mutation (HSLT+MLT). Note that BDPT cannot efficiently explore indirect caustics even at high sample counts. All MLT variants used 1 million initial samples, MEMLT used λ 50. There was no special handling of direct illumination. The average number of samples per pixel: MEMLT 621, MLT 1424, HSLT+MLT 612. Our new mutation estimates the optimal sampling density of difficult specular and glossy transport and excels at capturing hard features like thin highlights along highly <b>curved</b> <b>rims.</b> The path integral formulation of light transport {{is the basis for}} (Markov chain) Monte Carlo global illumination methods. In this paper we present half vector space light transport (HSLT), a novel approach to sampling and integrating light transport paths on sur-faces. The key is a partitioning of the path space into subspaces in which a path is represented by its start and end point constraints and a sequence of generalized half vectors. We show that this represen-tation has several benefits. It enables importance sampling of al...|$|R

In particular, models predict that in the innermost AU around the star, the dust disk forms a “puffed-up” inner rim, which should result in a strongly asymmetric brightness distribution for disks seen under intermediate inclination. Aims: Our aim is to constrain the sub-AU geometry of the inner disk around the Herbig Ae star R CrA and search for the predicted asymmetries. Methods: Using the VLTI/AMBER long-baseline interferometer, we obtained 24 near-infrared (H- and K-band) spectro-interferometric observations on R CrA. Observing with three telescopes in a linear array configuration, each data set samples three equally spaced points in the visibility function, providing direct information about the radial intensity profile. In addition, the observations cover a wide position angle range (~ 97 °), also probing the position angle dependence of the source brightness distribution. Results: In the derived visibility function, we detect the signatures of an extended (Gaussian FWHM ~ 25 mas) and a compact component (Gaussian FWHM ~ 5. 8 mas), with the compact component contributing about two-thirds of the total flux (both in H- and K-band). The brightness distribution is highly asymmetric, as indicated by the strong closure phases (up to ~ 40 °) and the detected position angle dependence of the visibilities and closure phases. To interpret these asymmetries, we employ various geometric as well as physical models, including a binary model, a skewed ring model, and a puffed-up inner rim model with a vertical or <b>curved</b> <b>rim</b> shape. For the binary and vertical rim model, no acceptable fits could be obtained. On the other hand, the skewed ring model and the curved puffed-up inner rim model allow us to simultaneously reproduce the measured visibilities and closure phases. From these models we derive the location of the dust sublimation radius (~ 0. 4 AU), the disk inclination angle (~ 35 °), and a north-south disk orientation (PA ~ 180 - 190 °). Our curved puffed-up rim model can reproduce reasonably well the interferometric observables and the SED and suggests a luminosity of ~ 29 Lȯ and the presence of relatively large (⪆ 1. 2 μm) Silicate dust grains. Our study also reveals discrepancies between the measured interferometric observables and the puffed-up inner rim models, providing important constraints for future refinements of these theoretical models. Perpendicular to the disk, two bow shock-like structures appear in the associated reflection nebula NGC 6729, suggesting that the detected sub-AU size disk is the driving engine of a large-scale outflow. Conclusions: Detecting, for the first time, strong non-localized asymmetries in the inner regions of a Herbig Ae disk, our study supports the existence of a puffed-up inner rim in YSO disks.
