2500|$|Rubber {{tires on}} the Montreal Metro {{transmit}} minimal vibration {{and help the}} cars climb uphill more easily and negotiate turns at high speeds. However, the advantages of rubber tires are offset by noise levels generated by traction motors, which are noisier than the typical North American subway car. Trains can climb grades of up to 6.5% and economize the most energy when following a humped-station profile (track profiles that descend to accelerate after leaving a station and climb before entering the station). Steel-wheel train technology has undergone significant advances and can better round tight curves, and climb and descend similar grades and slopes but despite these advances, steel-wheel trains still cannot operate at high speeds (...) on the same steep or tightly <b>curved</b> <b>track</b> profiles as a train equipped with rubber tires.|$|E
2500|$|The two spans are {{lenticular}} trusses {{with the}} top chord of each truss comprising a heavy tubular arch in compression, while the bottom chord comprises a pair of chains. Each of the trusses is simply supported and therefore no horizontal thrust is exerted on the piers, which is crucial {{in view of the}} <b>curved</b> <b>track</b> on either side. Between these two chords are supporting cross-bracing members and suspension standards which hang beneath the bottom chord to carry the railway deck which is a continuous plate beam.

We build {{adaptive control}}lers that identify the unknown control gains and stabilize equilibria corresponding to a fixed constant {{distance to the}} curve and zero bearing. Our strict Lyapunov function method allows us to prove robust performance under actuator errors in terms of integral input-to-state stability under a bound on the disturbance that maintains forward invariance of a class of invariant hexagons. This extends existing <b>curve</b> <b>tracking</b> results to allow controller uncertainty and parameter identification. We demonstrate our work in simulations.

40|$|This study studied {{an effect}} of a new guard rail on the {{stability}} of <b>curve</b> <b>tracks</b> with CWR and revealed a mechanism of the new guard rail for improving the stability of small radius <b>curve</b> <b>tracks</b> with CWR and also analyze the degree of the new guard rail for enlarging the pave range of small radius <b>curve</b> <b>tracks</b> with CWR. In order to achieve these, an improved load-deformation method for calculating the stability of tracks with Continuous Welded Rails (CWR) is suggested and verified. The {{results indicate that the}} improved load-deformation method not only has the same accuracy as the improved unified formula in specification, but also has the same clear and simple characteristics as the original load-deformation method. The mechanism of the new guard rail for improving the stability of small radius <b>curve</b> <b>tracks</b> with CWR is that the CWR stability can be greatly improved by increasing the stiffness of the track framework under conditions of maintaining the same cross-sectional area of the rails. The CWR with the new guard rail can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 230 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be relaxed 23. 3 %. If combined with the roadbed strengthening measures, the new guard rail can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 140 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be further relaxed 53. 3 %...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} basic switch designs for roller coasters. Flexing, substituting and table {{rotating}} rails {{have all been}} used. Flexing the entire rail truss, fixed at one end, to point towards an alternate destination requires manipulating a long segment of rail. Substituting a segment requires placing two or more segments of rail on flat plate that is moved in its entirety to provide straight or <b>curved</b> <b>track.</b> Alternatively these substitution track segments can be wrapped around a rotating cylinder, creating a triangular truss or a two sided plate. Rotating {{a table with a}} <b>curved</b> <b>track</b> segment in a Y junction is the less used third option. If the <b>curved</b> <b>track</b> turns the cars 60 degrees, and three rail lines meet as three equally spaced spokes, 120 degrees apart, then the <b>curved</b> <b>track</b> sitting on a turn table can be rotated to connect any two of the three rail lines at this junction, creating a triangle junction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There are {{algorithms}} {{for finding}} zeros or fixed points of nonlinear systems of equations that are globally convergent {{for almost all}} starting points, i. e., with probability one. The essence of all such algorithms is {{the construction of an}} appropriate homotopy map and then <b>tracking</b> some smooth <b>curve</b> in the zero set of this homotopy map. HOMPACK is a mathematical software package implementing globally convergent homotopy algorithms with three different techniques for tracking a homotopy zero curve, and has separate routines for dense and sparse Jacobian matrices. The HOMPACK algorithms for sparse Jacobian matrices use a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for the computation of the kernel of the homotopy Jacobian matrix, a required linear algebra step for homotopy <b>curve</b> <b>tracking.</b> Here variants of the conjugate gradient algorithm are implemented in the context of homotopy <b>curve</b> <b>tracking</b> and compared with Craig’s preconditioned conjugate gradient method used in HOMPACK. The test problems used include actual large scale, sparse structural mechanics problems.

40|$|The era of {{high speed}} railway {{has come and}} the most {{important}} issue of the high speed train is the safety, which is directly related to billions of families. One of the most serious threats to the safety of the high speed train is the vibration of train body at <b>curve</b> <b>track,</b> which may cause the train off the track. Semi-active vibration control method is a possible solution compared with active control method which has robust problem and passive control method which has efficiency issue. Magnetorheological technology is a typical semi-active vibration control method which has been widely used in the automobile, architectural construction and aerospace. The high speed train using magnetorheological technology has not been fully investigated especially for the dynamic performance at <b>curve</b> <b>track.</b> In this paper, a high-speed train model with MRF dampers is simulated by a combined ADAMS and MATLAB simulation. The dynamic performance of high speed train operating at different speeds and turning radius is investigated to reveal the mechanism of how the MRF damper affects the train’s stability and vibration.
