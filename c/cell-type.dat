40|$|Accurate lineage tracing {{is crucial}} to {{understanding}} of developmental and stem cell biology, but is particularly challenging for transient and highly dispersive <b>cell-types</b> like the neural crest (NC). The authors report in this article a new zebrafish transgenic line Tg(- 4725 sox 10 :Cre) ba 74. This line expresses Cre {{under the control of}} a well-characterized portion of the sox 10 promoter and, by crossing to a floxed-reporter line, the authors show in this article that expression in this line is consistent with those described for GFP reporter lines using the same promoter. Reporter expression is readily detected in patterns consistent with the early expression domains. Thus, the authors see all major groups (pigment, neural, and skeletal) of NC-derived <b>cell-types,</b> as well as <b>cell-types</b> derived from the known non-NC sites of sox 10 expression, including otic epithelium and oligodendrocytes.

25|$|Although the {{physiological}} role of calpains is still poorly understood, {{they have been}} shown to be active participants in processes such as cell mobility and cell cycle progression, as well as <b>cell-type</b> specific functions such as long-term potentiation in neurons and cell fusion in myoblasts. Under these physiological conditions, a transient and localized influx of calcium into the cell activates a small local population of calpains (for example, those close to Ca2+ channels), which then advance the signal transduction pathway by catalyzing the controlled proteolysis of its target proteins. Other reported roles of calpains are in cell function, helping to regulate clotting and the diameter of blood vessels, and playing a role in memory. Calpains have been implicated in apoptotic cell death, and appear to be an essential component of necrosis. Detergent fractionation revealed the cytosolic localization of calpain.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{function}} of CASS4 {{and its role}} in development and human pathologies have been subject to little investigation compared to other family members. The primary study exploring CASS4 function was the initial report by Singh et al., who showed the direct interaction between CASS4 and FAK, and CASS4 regulation of FAK activation, affecting cellular adhesion, migration and motility. Unusually, CASS4 depletion had a bimodal affect, causing some cells to have lower velocity and others to have higher velocity than control cells, suggesting a potential role in maintaining homeostasis. This work also suggested the {{function of}} CASS4 may be <b>cell-type</b> specific and dependent upon {{the presence or absence of}} expression of other CAS family members. Direct binding has also been identified between CASS4 and CRKL, an SH2- and SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein that has been also shown to interact with another CAS family member, p130Cas/BCAR1, in regulation of cellular motility and migration. Because of the high degree of homology in interaction domains and some identified common partners, CASS4 is likely to share some functions with other CAS family members. [...] These include association with FAK and Src family kinases at focal adhesions to transmit integrin-initiated signals to downstream effectors, which results in cytoskeleton reorganization and changes in motility and invasion.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of distinct <b>cell-types</b> within the basal ganglia {{has played a}} critical role in our understanding of basal ganglia function and the treatment of neurological disorders. As discussed in the introduction, the use of transgenic animals and bevy of emerging tools available to isolate, manipulate and control distinct populations of neurons have revolutionized neuroscience. We are gaining insight into the underlying structure of neural circuits that previously was inaccessible. Here, we defined cellular diversity within the globus pallidus externa (GPe), a nucleus within the motor-suppressing pathway of the basal ganglia, and investigated its contributions to circuit function in health and disease. First, we defined two genetically distinct populations of GPe neurons using transgenic mouse lines. Utilizing a combination of anatomy and physiology, we found significant difference between the two populations of GPe neurons. Briefly, viral expression of EYFP revealed that Limhomeobox 6 (Lhx 6 -) and Parvalbumin (PV-) GPe neurons differed in their axonal projection patterns as well as electrophysiological properties measured in slice recordings. These results provide a new set of tools to target molecularly, anatomically, and electrophysiologically distinct <b>cell-types</b> in the GPe which will enables studies of the organization and function of GPe circuits in health and disease. Next, we demonstrate that optogenetic interventions that dissociate the activity of these two neuronal populations in the GPe – elevating the activity of PV-GPe neurons over that of Lhx 6 -GPe neurons – restores movement in dopamine depleted mice and attenuates pathological activity of basal ganglia output neurons for hours beyond stimulation. These results establish the utility of cell-specific interventions in the GPe to target functionally distinct pathways, with the potential to induce long-lasting recovery of movement despite the continued absence of dopamine. In the final chapter, we will discuss the evolving and often-controversial field of GPe cellular heterogeneity and the future of these neural <b>cell-types.</b> Secondly, we will provide potential mechanisms for which GPe <b>cell-types</b> exert profound therapeutic benefit during the disease state that could build on current treatments. Taken together, these results demonstrate the anatomic, physiological and functional differences that exist within the GPe <b>cell-types</b> and its potential to disrupt pathological activity and restore behavior during disease...|$|R

2500|$|The {{organization}} of microtubules {{in the cell}} is <b>cell-type</b> specific.

[...] After nucleation, the minus-ends are released and then re-anchored in the periphery by factors such as ninein and PLEKHA7. [...] In this manner, they can facilitate the transport of proteins, vesicles and organelles along the apical-basal axis of the cell. [...] In fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cell-types, [...] microtubules are anchored at the centrosome and radiate with their plus-ends outwards towards the cell periphery (as shown in the first figure). [...] In these cells, the microtubules play important roles in cell migration.

40|$|Here {{we study}} the {{properties}} {{and the evolution}} of proteins that constitute the Centrosome, the complex molecular assembly that regulates the division and diﬀerentiation of animal cells. We found that centrosomal proteins are predicted to be signiﬁcantly enriched in disordered and coiled-coil regions, more phosphorylated and longer than control proteins of the same organism. Interestingly, the ratio of these properties in centrosomal and control proteins tends to increase with the number of <b>cell-types.</b> We reconstructed indels evolution, ﬁnding that indels signiﬁcantly increase disorder in both centrosomal and control proteins, at a rate that is typically larger along branches associated with a large growth in <b>cell-types</b> number, and larger for centrosomal than for control proteins. Substitutions show a similar trend for coiled-coil, but they contribute less to the evolution of disorder. Our results suggest that the increase in <b>cell-types</b> number in animal evolution is correlated with the gain of disordered and coiled-coil regions in centrosomal proteins, establishing a connection between organism and molecular complexity. We argue that the structural plasticity conferred to the Centrosome by disordered regions and phosphorylation {{plays an important role in}} its mechanical properties and its regulation in space and time.
