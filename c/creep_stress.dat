Many mechanical properties of polymers have an Arrhenius type relationship with respect to time and temperature (for example, <b>creep,</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation, and tensile properties).

50|$|When a {{material}} undergoes permanent deformation {{from exposure to}} radical temperatures or constant loading, the functionality of the material can become impaired. This time-dependent plastic distortion of material is known as <b>creep.</b> <b>Stress</b> and temperature are both major factors of the rate of creep. In order for a design to be considered safe, the deformation due to creep must be {{much less than the}} strain at which failure occurs. Once the static loading causes the specimen to surpass this point the specimen will begin permanent, or plastic, deformation.|$|E
50|$|Another design {{technique}} to prevent failures is called physics of failure. This technique relies on understanding the physical static and dynamic failure mechanisms. It accounts for variation in load, strength, and stress {{that lead to}} failure {{with a high level}} of detail, made possible with the use of modern finite element method (FEM) software programs that can handle complex geometries and mechanisms such as <b>creep,</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation, fatigue, and probabilistic design (Monte Carlo simulations/DOE). The material or component can be re-designed to reduce the probability of failure and to make it more robust against such variations. Another common design technique is component derating: i.e. selecting components whose specifications significantly exceed the expected stress levels, such as using heavier gauge electrical wire than might normally be specified for the expected electric current.|$|E

40|$|Time-dependent <b>creep</b> <b>stress</b> {{redistribution}} {{analysis of}} thick-walled FGM spheres subjected {{to an internal}} pressure and a uniform temperature field is investigated. The material creep and mechanical properties through the radial graded direction are assumed to obey the simple power-law variation throughout the thickness. Total strains {{are assumed to be}} the sum of elastic, thermal and creep strains. Creep strains are time temperature and stress dependent. Using equations of equilibrium, compatibility and stress-strain relations a differential equation, containing creep strains, for radial stress is obtained. Ignoring creep strains in this differential equation, a closed form solution for initial thermo-elastic stresses at zero time is presented. Initial thermo-elastic stresses are illustrated for different material properties. Using Prandtl-Reuss relation in conjunction with the above differential equation and the Norton’s law for the material uni-axial creep constitutive model, radial and tangential <b>creep</b> <b>stress</b> rates are obtained.

A series of forward creep and elastic follow-up experiments have been conducted. A summary is provided of empirical creep equations for forward creep and <b>creep</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation (elastic follow-up) tests, including the link to the experimental procedure.

The algorithm allows to obtain a {{crack growth rate}} diagram in terms of <b>creep</b> <b>stress</b> intensity factor. The proposed algorithm is realized on steel compact tension specimens (12 Х 1 MF). Crack growth rate was determined on standard compact specimens under temperature 550 °C. The waveforms for the loading and unloading portions were trapezoidal, and the loading/unloading times were held constant – 5 s. A hold time of predetermined duration, 60 s, was superimposed on the trapezoidal waveforms at maximum load. The potential drop and the unloading compliance methods were used to monitor crack length during the creep–fatigue tests. For the experimental crack paths in tested specimens the governing parameter for the 3 D-fields of the stresses and strains at the crack tip {{in the form of}} In-integral was calculated by finite element analysis along crack front.

This paper proposes a new creep rupture assessment method under the Linear Matching Method framework, where the creep rupture limit is evaluated through an extended shakedown analysis using the revised yield stress, which is determined by the minimum of the yield stress of the material and the individual <b>creep</b> rupture <b>stress</b> at each integration point. Various numerical strategies have been investigated to calculate these <b>creep</b> rupture <b>stresses</b> associated with given temperatures and allowable creep rupture time.
