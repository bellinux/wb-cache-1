40|$|The translaminar {{fracture}} toughness determines {{in many cases}} the damage tolerance of composite components, and this property is strongly influenced by the microstructure. A finite element model was developed that can aid in the optimisation of the microstructure for maximising the translaminar {{fracture toughness}} of composites hybridised at the tow level. The model proved that the toughness is increased when the crack has to grow through an interface between carbon and glass in a hybrid composite. This implies that the microstructure can be optimized to maximize the translaminar fracture toughness. Hybridisation at the tow level is now possible by using micro-tow placement machines. Therefore, samples were 3 D-printed with <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres.</b> Therefore, samples were 3 D printed with <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres.</b> Compact tension tests indicated that the toughness can indeed be increased by fibre-hybridization.

On the lower side is a rigid mould and on the upper side is a flexible membrane made from silicone or an extruded polymer film such as nylon. Reinforcement materials can be placed manually or robotically. They include <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> forms fashioned into textile constructions. Most often, they are pre-impregnated with the resin {{in the form of}} prepreg fabrics or unidirectional tapes. In some instances, a resin film is placed upon the lower mould and dry reinforcement is placed above. The upper mould is installed and vacuum is applied to the mould cavity. The assembly is placed into an autoclave. This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.|$|E

This model is based on the analysis of the stress and displacement of the yarn combining continuity conditions.

40|$|Long {{glass fibre}} {{compression}} mouldings {{are prone to}} significant variations in mechanical properties. Stiffness and strength tend to vary across an individual moulding and in addition there are also variations when different mouldings arc compared. Compression mouldings {{in the form of}} a top hat section were produced. This component was first modified to have ribs, then samples of both batches were reinforced with a thin thermoplastic composite plate with <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres.</b> In this way, four different batches were produced, which were tested under 3 -point-bending. Further, this work investigated the changes in mechanical properties across the manufactured top hat section mouldings. Tensile test results strongly indicate that the scatter of mechanical properties increases towards the edges of the compression moulding. When the mouldings were tested under 3 -point-bending, the experimental results were prone to a large scatter and it was not possible to predict the position of failure or the failure mode. However, this work successfully demonstrated that a targeted reinforcement of the moulding with <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres</b> can significantly reduce the performance variations, particular under loading with large strain. The findings of this work could lead to the development of new lightweight structural components, where there is a need for integrating functions into the moulding in order to reduce weight and costs for mass production...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> {{reinforced}} thermoplastic matrix composites {{have been}} successfully employed in the aircraft, military and aerospace industries due to the excellent properties (Brandt et al. 1993 & Nunes et al 2005 a). In these and many other commercial engineering applications, they can replace other materials, such as thermosetting matrix composites. However, {{the high cost of}} the impregnation of <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> thermoplastic composites, arising from the melting of the polymer or the use of solvents, still restricts their use in commercial applications. Hence, cost reduction largely depends on developing more efficient methods for impregnating fibres with high-viscosity thermoplastics and for processing final composite parts. This chapter summarizes the development of new technologies to fabricate long and <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced composite structures from thermoplastic matrix semi-products (towpregs and PCT – pre-consolidated tapes) for commercial and highly demanding markets. The production of <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced thermoplastic matrix towpregs and PCT’s was done using a recently developed coating line (Nunes et al. 2008, 2010 & Silva, R. F. et al. 2008). Using this prototype equipment, it was possible to produce glass fibre polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) towpregs for commercial markets and towpregs from carbon fibres and Primospire®, an amorphous highly aromatic material developed by Solvay Advanced Polymers, for application in advanced markets (Nunes et al. 2005, 2009 & Silva, J. F. et al. 2010). To process these thermoplastic pre-pregs into composite structures, conventional thermosetting equipments were adapted to fabricate thermoplastic matrix composites. Filament winding, pultrusion and hot compression moulding were the studied technologies. The mechanical properties determined on the final composites were compared with the theoretical predictions and have shown to be acceptable for the targeted markets. As applications, filament wound pressure vessels prototypes for gas and incompressible fluids were produced from towpregs and submitted to internal pressure burst tests [Silva, J. F. et al. 2008 & Velosa et al. 2009). These prototypes have accomplished all requirements of the applicable European standards...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCertain {{material}} have a {{non linear}} stress-strain behaviour under monotonic loading. This non linearity {{can be caused}} by continuous damage. To highlight this phenomena simultaneous strain and damage measurements should be taken. When working with inhomogeneous or anisotropic materials, such as <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> composites, local information is essential. On the one hand, full field strain data can be obtained with Digital Image Correlation (DIC).

The aim of this work is to combine these two techniques to correlate strain measurements and damage location on a complex composite material during a monotonic tensile test.

40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil {{the need for}} {{efficient}} large volume capable production technologies for high performance composite structures, a new processing technology has been developed. The process {{is based on the}} injection moulding technology but differs from this known processing technology by enabling the production of <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced high performance composites with fibre volume contents of over 40 % by volume. The processing technology enables the processing of very low viscosity polymer intermediate products such as caprolactam which is mixed with suitable activator and catalyst additives prior to the injection into the mould cavity. After the infiltration of the continuous dry fibre preform in the mould cavity the polymer intermediate system undergoes an anionic in-situ polymerisation to form the engineering thermoplast polyamide 6. The developed processing technology utilises the automated features of the injection moulding machine to enable a more efficient process than the current available state of the art processing technologies which are used to produce <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced thermoplastic composites such as the resin transfer moulding techniques.

30|$|Composite laminates, {{which are}} made from the <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres</b> and a {{polymeric}} resin, are used for load-carrying structures in aerospace industry due to their high specific stiffness and strength, and good fatigue and corrosion resistance when exposed to harsh environments. However, laminated constructions are vulnerable to foreign object impact, such as from debris or bird strike during landing or take-off and hail storm when in flight. Tools dropped accidently during assembly or maintenance can also introduce barely visible impact damage (BVID) that happens inside the composite (Abrate 2011, 1998). This could lead to sudden failure due to stiffness and strength degradation, if the introduced damage remains undetected. The impact behaviour of materials becomes very crucial for the safety assessment of aircraft (Shi 2014).|$|R

The use of fibre-reinforced polymer laminas as a construction material has increased in recent years. The primary reason for this increase is their non-corrosive nature and long term durability, high tensile strength-toweight ratio, electromagnetic neutrality and resistance to chemical attack.
