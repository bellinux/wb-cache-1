This debate was generated due {{to the adoption of}} a hybrid" economic order (introduced by the new Colombian Constitution in 1991) involving different models (even mutually excluding) underthe idea of a "Social Market Economy". The normativity has created a strong discrepancy between both lawyers and economists regarding the very basis of the model. Due to differences in language, analysis protocols, and decision making processes, it is common to find judicial decisions in economic matters characterized by inefficiency (regarding resources allocation) and inequality(regarding resources distribution).

But competition can not be the only solution to efficiency. Moderate government interference is needed in some circumstances.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a pilot study}} attempting to harness the power of Building Information Modelling (BIM), coupled with Level of Development (LOD), for practicing structural engineers to have greater understanding of design decisions on cost, thereby giving greater <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>economy.</b> This study aimed to exploit the wealth of BIM built environment data in a framework, matching building material data with cost data, in the Microsoft Excel platform {{to allow for a}} raw design cost to be automatically determined. Level of Development (LOD) is a standard which allows for consistent comparisons between BIM models by ensuring each model covers a specified scope. There are multiple LOD's and by applying the framework at each of these, insight can be gained into the design cost over time as it is refined. To achieve the aim of the study, the tool was employed on five separate structures: two blockwork medium-rise buildings and three reinforced concrete high-rise buildings. Results indicate that similar structure types have similar design cost curves when data was standardised. By employing the process over further studies, the empirical curves will be refined with greater certainty, allowing for eventual use as benchmarks to assess economic performance of design solutions...|$|E

40|$|The {{privatization}} {{of the strategic}} sector has been {{the core of the}} privatization process in Albania. This strategy started in 1998 {{for the first time and}} is still in force for the remaining enterprises of the strategic sector. The changes of political and economic system in the early 90 ’s in Albania required a broader reform of the entire legal system by creating a functioning market based in the rules of free market and competition and the {{privatization of}} state enterprises. The economic system of planned economy, which was established in Albania with the centralized <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>economy</b> through five-year plans for 45 years and state ownership (private property was abolished in Albania since the Constitution of 1976) as well as the binding of the enterprise to the priorities of the PPSH or to the fulfillment of the plan, led to the reduction of economic output, the rationing of consumer goods and, ultimately, after the political change to the transformation into a market economy (Åslund, 2013). Privatization and especially the strategic sector privatization was one of the main pillars of free market economy in Albania. My central contention in this paper is to analyse the strategic sector privatization in the perspective of EU standards. In this point of view this process in Albania can only be meaningfully thought through, and I suggest implemented, within the context of the European market (Gärtner 1996), but on the other hand the way this transformation had to be mastered was not clearly defined...|$|E

While market regulation has failed, 'capitalism' as a whole has not. Modern economies are, for the most part, 'mixed economies' already subject to extensive government intervention and regulation but, within which, market failures persist. The GFC suggests that the focus should be on improving the elimination of these failures not on setting aside the efficiencies yielded by markets.
