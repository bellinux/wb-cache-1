5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian <b>code</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the appropriateness <b>of</b> current <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> for predicting the axial load capacity of high-strength Concrete Filled Steel Tubular Columns (CFSTCs). Australian/New Zealand standards and other international <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> for composite bridges and buildings are currently being revised and will allow for the use of high-strength CFSTCs. It is therefore important to assess and modify the suitability of the section and ultimate buckling capacities models. For this purpose, available experimental results on high-strength composite columns have been assessed. The collected experimental results are compared with eight current <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> for rectangular CFSTCs and seven current <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> for circular CFSTCs. Furthermore, based on the statistical studies carried out, simplified relationships are developed to predict the section and ultimate buckling capacities of normal and high-strength short and slender rectangular and circular CFSTCs subjected to concentric loading...|$|R
