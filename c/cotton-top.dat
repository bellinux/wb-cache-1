5|$|Animal Lifestyles, in {{the western}} {{quadrant}} of the zoo, features indoor habitat exhibits. Visitors in the foyer of the building are shown Life in the Water, Life in Air, and Life on Land dioramas. Each diorama holds a carefully controlled environment that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins, meerkats, emerald tree boas, dwarf mongooses, desert monitors, among others. Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals. The Prospect Park Zoo is engaged in breeding species in captivity, {{a part of the}} larger wild life recovery program of the Wildlife Conservation Society.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin makes selective, {{specialized}} vocalizations in {{the presence}} of food. These include the C-call, produced when a <b>cotton-top</b> approaches and sorts through food, and the D-call, which is associated with food retrieval and is exhibited while eating.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooperative}} breeding hypothesis {{predicts that}} <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins engage with this young-rearing paradigm, {{and in turn}} naturally embrace patterns of prosocial behavior. These monkeys engage in such behavior by acting altruistically within their groups in caring for infants, vocalizing alarm calls, and in sharing food. Though some studies indicate that <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins have the psychological capacity to participate in reciprocally mediated altruism, {{it is unclear whether}} the <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{being able}} to {{localize}} auditory signals may help determine predator location, especially {{in the presence of}} a second AC from a different tamarin in the group. This can help confirm predator presence, type (e.g. flying versus ground-based), and support the recipient in triangulating a predator's location. In the context of the <b>cotton-top's</b> cooperative breeding groups, this is postulated as being adaptive for determining the variable risk to one's group members. For example, a call recipient is able to determine which of its kin are and are not at risk (e.g. young offspring, mates, subordinates, relatives, carriers, etc.) and plan subsequent actions accordingly.|$|R
25|$|Other studies {{involving}} <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins have {{hinted that}} positive reciprocity and reciprocal altruism are irrelevant in the prosociality of these primates. Some researchers believe these primates tend to cooperate for selfish reasons and {{in situations where}} they incur some benefit for themselves. That is, cooperation in <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins can be better described by mutualism than by true altruism.|$|E
25|$|The illegal pet {{trade and}} {{scientific}} research {{have also been}} cited as factors by the IUCN. While biomedical studies have recently limited their use of this species, illegal capture for the pet trade still {{plays a major role}} in endangering the <b>cotton-top.</b> Before 1976, when CITES listed the species under Appendix I banning all international trade, the <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin was exported for use in biomedical research.|$|E
25|$|Habitat {{destruction}} through forest clearing is {{the main}} cause of this collapse, and the <b>cotton-top</b> has lost more than three-quarters of its original habitat to deforestation, while the lowland forest in which it lives has been reduced to 5% of its historical range. This land is then used for large-scale agricultural production (i.e. cattle) and farming, logging, oil palm plantations, and hydroelectric projects that fragment the <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin's natural range.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin has {{a diet of}} mainly fruit (40%) {{and animal}} {{material}} (40%). This includes insects, plant exudates such as gum and sap, nectar, and occasionally reptiles and amphibians. Due to its small body size and high food passage rate, its diet must be high-quality and high-energy. Insectivory is common in the <b>cotton-top</b> and the species hunts for insects {{using a variety of}} methods: stealth, pouncing, chasing, exploring holes, and turning over leaves.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin {{can live}} {{as long as}} 24 years in captivity, while its {{lifespan}} in the wild averages 13 years.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin {{displays}} {{a wide variety}} of social behaviors. In particular, groups form a clear dominance hierarchy where only dominant pairs breed. The female normally gives birth to twins and uses pheromones to prevent other females in the group from breeding. These tamarins have been extensively studied for their high level of cooperative care, as well as altruistic and spiteful behaviors. Communication between <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins is sophisticated and shows evidence of grammatical structure, a language feature that must be acquired.|$|E
25|$|Despite an {{expansive}} array of altruistic behaviors, <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins engage in great bouts of spite through negative reciprocity and punishment. They {{have been observed}} to immediately start denying cooperation with monkeys that deny them benefits. Further, in captivity, these primates are not observed to increase altruistic behavior with fellow primates that are committed fully to cooperation. Based on this, researchers believe that repeated interactions in a cooperative society {{like that of the}} <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin can heighten the chances that an individual will designate behavioral punishments to others in its group. This reaction has also been observed in other species. However, these reciprocal punishments, or relative lack of altruistic actions, may alternatively happen as a result of response facilitation that increases the chances of a <b>cotton-top</b> punishing another primate after watching that individual perform a similar action.|$|E
25|$|Another {{way to look}} at {{punishment}} in <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins is by observing their aggressive behavioral responses within and between groups, as well as between species. The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin, like many marmosets, other tamarins, and specifically those in the genus Saguinus, stages aggressive displays almost exclusively towards fellow monkeys that belong to the same gender. These intrasexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females, and are vital when a breeding female is forcing both subadult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group.|$|E
25|$|Up to 40,000 <b>cotton-top</b> {{tamarins}} {{are thought}} to have been caught and exported for use in biomedical research before 1976, when CITES gave them the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned. Now, the species is at risk due to large-scale habitat destruction, as the lowland forest in northwestern Colombia where the <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin is found has been reduced to 5% of its previous area. It is currently classified as critically endangered {{and is one of the}} rarest primates in the world, with only 6,000 individuals left in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The Lesser Primates {{exhibit is}} home to lemurs and monkeys {{including}} black-and-white ruffed lemurs, black-capped capuchins, Bolivian squirrel monkeys, common marmosets, <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins, emperor tamarins, pygmy marmosets and ring-tailed lemurs.|$|E
25|$|The Tropics – A {{recently}} finished {{group of}} enclosures exhibiting South American animal species. Here {{you will find}} American alligators, a group of <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins, golden lion tamarins and pygmy marmosets.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin is diurnal and {{sleeps with}} its social group in trees with foliage cover. The group leaves the {{sleeping}} tree together {{an hour after}} dawn and spends the day foraging, resting, travelling, and grooming. The species is thought to rise late and increases the speed of its foraging and travelling before dusk to avoid crepuscular and nocturnal predators. Its main predators include raptors, mustelids, felids, and snakes. The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin is extremely vigilant, always looking for potential predators. When the group is resting, one individual moves apart and acts as a lookout to alert the group if it sees a threat.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, two captive <b>cotton-top</b> {{tamarins}} at the Alexandria Zoological Park in Alexandria, Louisiana, {{died when}} a caretaker left them outside overnight in temperatures {{as low as}} 30°F. One other individual survived.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin has fur {{covering}} {{all of the}} body except the palms of the hands and feet, the eyelids, {{the borders of the}} nostrils, the nipples, the anus, and the penis. The back is brown, and the underparts, arms and legs are whitish-yellow. The rump and inner thighs and upper tail are reddish-orange. The fur is distributed with varying densities throughout the body: the genital region (scrotum and pubic zone), axilla, and the base of the tail have lower densities, while the forward region is much higher. Many individuals have stripes or whorls of fur of striking coloration on their throats. The <b>cotton-top</b> also has whiskers on its forehead and around its mouth.|$|E
25|$|Dominant pairs are {{the only}} {{breeding}} pair within their groups, and the female generally has authority over the breeding male. While nonbreeding group members can be the leading pair's offspring, immigrant adults may also live with and cooperate in these groups. This social grouping in <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins is hypothesized to arise from predation pressure. <b>Cotton-top</b> tamarins exhibit prosocial behavior that benefits {{other members of the}} group, and are well known for engaging in cooperative breeding whereby the group's subordinate adults help in rearing the offspring of the dominant pair. The dominant female is more likely to give birth to nonidentical twins than a singleton, so it would be too energetically expensive for just one pair to raise the young.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the typical}} <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin {{communicative}} vocalizations, the combination long call (CLC) and the alarm call (AC) {{are the most}} heavily represented in the literature. CLCs encompass a range of contact calls that are produced by isolated individuals using chirps and whistles. This type of call is also used for seemingly altruistic alarm calls, thus adding to its range of cooperative behaviors. It is issued {{in the presence of}} kin when a threatening llamas predator is seen. Predators of the <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin include snakes, ocelots, tayras, and most notably, hawks. Early observations by Patricia Neyman even showed that cotton-tops produce diverse sets of alarm calls that can discriminate the presence of birds of prey versus ground-based predators.|$|E
25|$|The Lost Temple is {{constructed}} {{to look like}} an old Central American temple, and highlights Central and South American reptiles and amphibians such as anacondas, caiman lizards, poison dart frogs, Panamanian golden frogs, and bushmasters. Hoffman's two-toed sloths, pygmy marmosets, and <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins are also found in the exhibit.|$|E
25|$|Castro and Snowdon (2000) {{observed}} that aside from inconsistent adult-like chirping, <b>cotton-top</b> infants most often produce a prototype chirp that differs in vocalization structure from anything {{seen in the}} full adult range of vocalizations. Infants are thought to imitate adult speakers, which use differing calls in various contexts, but by using solely the infant prototypical chirp. For instance, adult cotton-tops are known to significantly {{reduce the amount of}} general alarm calling in the presence of infants. This is likely adapted so that adults in close proximity to the group's young do not attract attention of predators to infant-dense areas. Additionally, infants reduce their prototype chirping in the presence of predators. Whether infants are shadowing the calling behavior of adults or they are comprehending danger remains unclear. However, researchers argue that young <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins are able to represent semantic information regardless of immature speech production.|$|E
25|$|The Proyecto Tití ("Project Tamarin") {{was started}} in 1985 to provide {{information}} and support in conservation of the <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin and its habitat in northern Colombia. Proyecto Tití's programs combine field research, education, and community programs to spread awareness about this endangered species and encourage the public to participate in its protection. It now has partner status with the Wildlife Conservation Network.|$|E
25|$|Tamarins {{in captivity}} {{have shown the}} ability to {{distinguish}} other individuals based on cooperative tendencies and past behavior. Cotton-tops ultimately use this information to guide future cooperation. Brief periods of defection tend to cause swift, irreparable breakups between these primates and their cooperators. To avoid this, <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins may make economically driven decisions based on the projected incentives of a potential cooperator.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin is seen {{to produce}} food calls both in the {{presence}} and absence of group members. Additionally, response to food calls are directed back to an original caller independent of visual confirmation of a food source. While this {{may appear to be}} a result from a very primitive form of communication, Roush and Snowdon (2005) maintain that the food-calling behavior confers some mentally representable information about food to recipient tamarins.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{also has}} a Penguinarium which has Humboldt penguins, Inca terns, and Grey gulls near the Penguinarium is the Insect Zoo Hut (which is {{temporarily}} closed and is being {{moved into a new}} educational center). Other exhibits include the Cats of the Amur Region which houses Amur leopards and Amur tigers. The Primate Exhibit features chimpanzees, orangutans, white-cheeked gibbons, mandrills, <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins and an occasional displayed reptile such as black tree monitors and green iguanas.|$|E
25|$|Bordering the paddocks is a {{waterway}} running north-south, {{along which}} the water bus formerly travelled, past island groups of white-faced sakis, Alaotran bamboo lemurs and howler monkeys. A variety of callitrichids, including <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins, were formerly housed on the Bamboo Lemur Island, and the howler monkey and white-faced saki exhibits were formerly home to black-and-white ruffed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs. A nearby island viewable from Bats Bridge has previously held lowland anoa {{and is now}} holding babirusia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin is {{a highly}} social primate that {{typically}} lives in groups of two to nine individuals, but may reach up to 13 members. These small familial groups tend to fluctuate in size and in composition of individuals and a clear dominance hierarchy is always present within a party. At {{the head of the}} group is the breeding pair. The male and female in this pair are typically in a monogamous reproductive relationship, and together serve as the group's dominant leaders.|$|E
25|$|C-call {{chirping}} {{is believed}} to be an honest signal for communicating food preference, and a <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin more often and more rapidly vocalizes with these chirps when approaching a highly favored food source. Functionally, this behavior may inform other tamarins of the actions the caller will take in a feeding context and whether a preferable food source is available. Despite this research indicating that food calls may be informative to fellow group mates, other observations of cotton-tops show that quantity and distribution of food and audience do not significantly alter a caller's food-centered vocalizations.|$|E
25|$|CLCs {{involve the}} {{production}} of complex sequence multisyllabic vocalizations. Researchers have argued that long calls exhibit individual differences, thus can carry information sufficient for recipients to determine caller identity. Using habituation-discrimination paradigms in language experiments, this theory has been confirmed multiple times in literature. However, the individual syllables within a complete CLC vocalization in isolation of each other do not transfer sufficient information to communicate messages between monkeys. Scientists thus consider the whole, intact string of vocalizations to be the unit of perception for CLCs in the <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin. These examinations may confirm that cotton-tops incorporate a lexical syntax in areas of their communication.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only one}} female {{in a group}} breeds, heavy {{investment}} in infant care ensures that all offspring survive until independence. Accordingly, <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins bear excessive costs {{to care for the}} group's young. Male carriers, especially paternal carriers, incur large energetic costs {{for the sake of the}} group's young. This burden may cause some male cotton-tops to lose up to 10–11% of their total body weight. The large weight loss may occur from reduced food intake as infant-carrying inhibits foraging ability for a carrier. The trend of male-carrier weight loss and decreased food intake is in contrast to the dominant female's periovulatory period, when she gains weight after increasing her own food intake and relinquishing much of her infant-carrying duties.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the first}} 20 weeks after a <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin is born, {{it is not}} fully capable of {{producing}} the range of vocalizations that an adult monkey can. Despite this limitation on speech producibility, researchers believe that language acquisition occurs early on with speech comprehension abilities arising first. Infants can at times produce adult-like chirps, but this is rarely done in the correct context and remains inconsistent across the first 20 weeks of life. Regardless, infant cotton-tops are able to respond in behaviorally appropriate ways to varying contexts when presented with adult chirps. This indicates that verbal perception is a quickly acquired skill for offspring, followed closely by auditory comprehension, and later by proper vocal producibility.|$|E
25|$|While caregiving by males {{appears to}} be altruistic, {{particularly}} in <b>cotton-top</b> sires, the costs of infant care {{may in fact be}} tolerated for selfish reasons. Namely, the costs to male weight and foraging ability may in turn promote consecutive pregnancies in dominant females, thereby providing more offspring bearing the sire's genes. Additionally, the cooperative breeding structure of cotton-tops can change with group size and parental experience. First-time sires spend a greater amount of time carrying the infant than experienced ones, and in smaller groups, sires do a greater proportion of carrying and feeding the infant than in larger groups, where helpers take on more of the work. Total care for infants remains constant with varying group size, and infant outcome is not significantly different in groups that have differing levels of experience in raising offspring.|$|E
25|$|In {{cooperative}} breeding, {{the effort}} put into {{caring for the}} dominant breeders' offspring is shared by the group members. Parents, siblings, and immigrant adults share young rearing duties for the breeding pair's young. These duties include carrying, protecting, feeding, comforting, and even engaging in play behavior with the group's young. <b>Cotton-top</b> tamarins display high levels of parental investment during infant care. Males, particularly those that are paternal, show a greater involvement in caregiving than do females. Despite this, {{both male and female}} infants prefer contact and proximity to their mothers over their fathers. Males may invest additional support in rearing offspring as a form of courtship to win favor of the group's dominant female. However, evidence indicates that time spent carrying infants does not correlate with a male's overall copulation frequency.|$|E
25|$|Though {{aggression}} {{can occur}} within groups, the response towards intruders of another species {{is much more}} drastic and can involve a sexual dimorphism in displays. Females typically employ scent-marking intruder response tactics, whereas males {{are more prone to}} vocalizing threats, physical aggression, and piloerection. Scent-marking in <b>cotton-top</b> tamarins is done in two ways: either using anogenital scent-marking, or suprapubic scent-marking. The ability to use both of these separate glandular fields for threat signals may indicate females have developed diverging evolutionary threats through differential use of these markings. These variable signals may be used to sign a territorial encounter, or serve as a reproductive signal. The intensity of female threats are generally comparable when directed at intruders of either genders. In contrast, male cotton-tops are considerably more threatening towards fellow males than towards females.|$|E
25|$|Since {{tamarins}} can {{discriminate between}} predatory threats using varying vocalizations, recipients of an AC {{are thought to}} extract various complex signals from this form of communication. Primarily, cotton-tops are able to glean {{the identity of the}} cooperating tamarin through differences in individuals' alarm calls. Further, adults are able to discriminate the gender of callers from their ACs and determine the range of calls within a related tamarin's alarm calling repertoire. Alarm call-based identification is postulated to play a number of functional roles in the <b>cotton-top</b> tamarin. Firstly, an AC recipient is able to identify a cooperating tamarin, and by recognizing which in their group it is, be able to judge the reliability of the AC from past experience. This may arise from a selective pressure for being able to statistically determine the amount of risk present, and how endangered an individual and its group are.|$|E
