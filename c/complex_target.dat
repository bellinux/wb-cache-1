500|$|The {{conceptual}} {{foundation for}} DNA nanotechnology was first {{laid out by}} Nadrian Seeman in the early 1980s, and the field began to attract widespread interest in the mid-2000s. This use of nucleic acids is enabled by their strict base pairing rules, which cause only portions of strands with complementary base sequences to bind together to form strong, rigid double helix structures. This allows for the rational design of base sequences that will selectively assemble to form <b>complex</b> <b>target</b> structures with precisely controlled [...] nanoscale features. Several assembly methods are used to make these structures, including tile-based structures that assemble from smaller structures, folding structures using the DNA origami method, and dynamically reconfigurable structures using strand displacement methods. The field's name specifically references DNA, but the same principles have been used {{with other types of}} nucleic acids as well, leading to the occasional use of the alternative name nucleic acid nanotechnology.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to k-optimal rule discovery and frequent pattern mining techniques, subgroup discovery focuses on mining interesting patterns {{with respect to}} a specified target property of interest. This includes, for example, binary, nominal, or numeric attributes, but also more <b>complex</b> <b>target</b> concepts such as correlations between several variables. Background knowledge like constraints and ontological relations can often be successfully applied for focusing and improving the discovery results.|$|E
50|$|Epitope {{mapping of}} <b>complex</b> <b>target</b> antigens, such as {{integral}} membrane proteins or multi-subunit proteins, is often challenging {{because of the}} difficulty in expressing and purifying these types of antigens. Human membrane proteins and receptors, key targets for therapeutic antibodies, often have short antigenic regions that fold correctly only {{in the context of a}} lipid bilayer. As a result, mAb epitopes on these types of targets are often conformational, making them difficult to map.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. This thesis represents an initial attempt to demonstrate aspect independent <b>target</b> identification of <b>complex</b> radar <b>targets</b> using annihilation filters {{based on the}} natural resonances of the targets. The Cadzow-Solomon signal processing algorithm is tested to determine its suitability for the task of extracting the poles from <b>complex</b> <b>targets</b> to a degree of accuracy required for successful implementation of an annihilation filtering target identification system. This testing was conducted {{through the use of}} noise polluted synthetic data as well as measured transient scattering data from thin-wire and silver coated scale model aircraft targets. The testing revealed that the Cadzow- Solomon algorithm can return pole clusters at false pole locations when processing the scattered returns from <b>complex</b> <b>targets.</b> Properties of annihilation filters which may affect their ability to discriminate <b>complex</b> <b>targets</b> are examined.

40|$|Abstract: A {{high-order}} locally-corrected Nyström (LCN) {{solution of}} a hybrid volume/surface integral equation is presented for the electromagnetic scattering by <b>complex</b> <b>targets</b> that consist of composite homogeneous and inhomogeneous materials and conducting objects. It is {{found that for}} general scattering objects, the use of mixed-order basis functions accelerates the convergence of the LCN solution, eliminates spurious charges, and significantly reduce the condition number of the resulting linear system of equations. Fast iterative solvers based on a multi-level fast multipole method (MLFMM) and the quadrature sampled pre-corrected FFT (QSPCFFT) are also employed to enable the practical solution of large <b>complex</b> <b>targets...</b>|$|R
50|$|Choi et al. {{proposed}} attribute substitution as {{a mechanism}} for surrogation. Attribute substitution in decision-making involves a <b>complex</b> <b>target</b> attribute being replaced by a more easily-accessible heuristic attribute. For this to occur, the target attribute must be relatively inaccessible, the heuristic attribute must be readily accessible, and the mental substitution must not be consciously rejected by the person. In the case of surrogation, the two attributes are related in that some party intends the heuristic attribute to serve as proxy for the target attribute.|$|E
5000|$|The player {{progresses}} through {{levels in}} Splice by rearranging groups of cells into target structures. The player has {{a limited number}} of moves (or [...] "splices") to create each target structure; finishing a level in the fewest number of moves possible unlocks an [...] "Angelic" [...] achievement result. [...] Over the game's seventy-seven levels, the player will encounter power-up cells with special abilities (for instance, cells that destroy themselves and their children). The player must learn to use these increasingly complex cells to form increasingly <b>complex</b> <b>target</b> structures.|$|E
50|$|The {{output of}} the ICCP system should be {{optimised}} to provide enough current to provide protection to the target structure. Some cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are designed with taps on the transformer windings and jumper terminals to select the voltage {{output of the}} ICCP system. Cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units for water tanks and used in other applications are made with solid state circuits to automatically adjust the operating voltage to maintain the optimum current output or structure-to-electrolyte potential. Analog or digital meters are often installed to show the operating voltage (DC and sometime AC) and current output. For shore structures and other large <b>complex</b> <b>target</b> structures, ICCP system are often designed with multiple independent zones of anodes with separate cathodic protection transformer-rectifier circuits.|$|E

5000|$|As in {{the case}} of {{coefficients}} in conventional series expansions, the s typically decrease monotonically as higher order terms are included to match <b>complex</b> <b>target</b> trajectories. For example, in the s monotonically decreased in the MFOE from [...] to [...] , where [...] for m ≧ 6. The MFOE in consisted of five point, 5th order processing of composite real (but altered for declassification) cruise missile data. A window of only 5 data points provided excellent maneuver following; whereas, 5th order processing included fractions of higher order terms to better approximate the complex maneuvering target trajectory. The MFOE overcomes the long-ago rejection of terms higher than 3rd order because, taken at full value (i.e., [...] ), estimator variances increase exponentially with linear order increases. (This is elucidated below in the section [...] "Application of the FOE".) ...|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the analyst}} {{constructs}} the skeleton {{structure of the}} model, {{the next step is}} to add substance. This is where the analyst must research, gather information, and synthesize to populate the model. For an analyst to successfully populate a model for a <b>complex</b> <b>target,</b> he or she must find information from a wide range of both classified and unclassified sources. This includes retrieving information from the body of existing intelligence. [...] Depending on the target, an analyst may seek out information from open source intelligence (information available to the general public), human intelligence (HUMINT), measures and signatures intelligence (MASINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), or imagery intelligence (IMINT). Even though open source information is inexpensive or free, and easily accessible, it can be just as useful as the more specialized, technical intelligence sources that are expensive to use.|$|E

40|$|Targeting vectors for {{embryonic}} stem (ES) cells typically contain a mouse gene segment of > 7 kb with the neo gene inserted for positive {{selection of the}} <b>targeting</b> event. More <b>complex</b> <b>targeting</b> vectors carry additional genetic elements (e. g. lacZ, loxP, point mutations). Here we use homologous recombination in yeast to construct targeting vectors for the incorporation of genetic elements (GEs) into mouse genes. The precise insertion of GEs into any position of a mouse gene segment cloned in an Escherichia coli/yeast shuttle vector is directed by short recombinogenic arms (RAs) flanking the GEs. In this way, <b>complex</b> <b>targeting</b> vectors can be engineered with considerable ease and speed, obviating extensive gene mapping in search for suitable restriction site...|$|R

Near-atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of native type III Cmr (CRISPR RAMP module) complexes {{in the absence}} and presence of target RNA reveal a helical protein arrangement that positions the crRNA for substrate binding. Thumblike b hairpins intercalate between segments of duplexed crRNA:target RNA to facilitate cleavage of the target at 6 -nucleotide intervals. The Cmr complex is architecturally similar to the type I CRISPR-Cascade complex, suggesting divergent evolution of these immune systems from a common ancestor...|$|R
50|$|Molecular {{engineering}} {{is a dynamic}} and evolving field with <b>complex</b> <b>target</b> problems; breakthroughs require sophisticated and creative engineers who are conversant across disciplines. A rational engineering methodology {{that is based on}} molecular principles is in contrast to the widespread trial-and-error approaches common throughout engineering disciplines. Rather than relying on well-described but poorly-understood empirical correlations between the makeup of a system and its properties, a molecular design approach seeks to manipulate system properties directly using an understanding of their chemical and physical origins. This often gives rise to fundamentally new materials and systems, which are required to address outstanding needs in numerous fields, from energy to healthcare to electronics. Additionally, with the increased sophistication of technology, trial-and-error approaches are often costly and difficult, as {{it may be difficult to}} account for all relevant dependencies among variables in a complex system. Molecular engineering efforts may include computational tools, experimental methods, or a combination of both.|$|E

Through the phase compensation equation, global errors are demonstrated. A Local error bound is also determined for the tracking of a two element target.

40|$|Radar {{signatures}} of <b>complex</b> <b>targets</b> for different frequencies, aspect angles and target positions {{are needed in}} various radar application areas. In addition, specific scattering centers of <b>complex</b> real radar <b>targets</b> have a strong impact on the overall signature of the target. However, measurements are mostly inefficient for providing the required information and for studying the behaviour of such targets, {{as well as for}} performing the required radar tasks. Thus, radar signature predictions are very important in radar applications and are basically derived by applying numerical modeling tools developed within the computational electromagnetics community. In this paper, numerical modeling results of radar signatures for various large and <b>complex</b> <b>targets</b> are presented, which highlight recent advances in two different simulation codes developed at FGAN-FHR. The main objective of the simulations is to study the electromagnetic properties of significant scattering centers like deep cavities, which often arise in real radar targets (aircraft, vehicles etc.). Another important task is to investigate the high resolution range profile (HRRP) behaviour of such structures as well as the effect of those scattering centers to the overall radar cross section (RCS) of the corresponding targets. Further, the presented simulation results provide investigation of the trade-off between computation time and accuracy for the applied numerical modeling methods, which is very important for successful and accurate simulation of <b>complex</b> radar <b>targets</b> with reasonable computation times...|$|R
