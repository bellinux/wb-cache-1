5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a <b>carbon–nitrogen</b> <b>bond,</b> such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E

50|$|Electrophilic amination {{reactions}} can {{be classified}} as either additions or substitutions. Although the resulting product is not always an amine, these reactions are unified by {{the formation of a}} <b>carbon-nitrogen</b> <b>bond</b> and the use of an electrophilic aminating agent. A wide variety of electrophiles have been used; for substitutions, these are most commonly amines substituted with electron-withdrawing groups: chloramines, hydroxylamines, hydrazines, and oxaziridines, for instance.

5000|$|... === Reaction Progress Kinetic Analysis === Blackmond has {{pioneered the}} {{methodology}} of Reaction Progress Kinetic Analysis (RPKA), which is used for rapid determination of concentration dependences of reactants. RPKA allows for in situ measurements to produce a number of rate equations that enable analysis of a reaction using a minimal number of experiments. The purpose {{for this type of}} analysis is to help understand what the driving force of a reaction might be and describe possible mechanistic pathways. This technique distinguishes rate processes occurring on the catalytic cycle from those occurring off the cycle. Notable applications of RPKA include asymmetric hydrogenation, asymmetric organocatalytic reactions, palladium catalyzed carbon-carbon and <b>carbon-nitrogen</b> <b>bond</b> forming reactions, and transition-metal catalyzed competitive reactions.|$|E

50|$|In one {{application}} the asymmetry in an atropisomer {{is transferred}} in a chemical {{reaction to a}} new stereocenter. The atropisomer is an iodoaryl compound synthesised starting from (S)-valine and exists as the (M,S) isomer and the (P,S) isomer. The interconversion barrier {{between the two is}} 24.3 kcal/mol (101.7 kJ/mol). The (M,S) isomer can be obtained exclusively from this mixture by recrystallisation from hexanes. The iodine group is homolytically removed to form an aryl radical by a tributyltin hydride/triethylboron/oxygen mixture as in the Barton-McCombie reaction. Although the hindered rotation is now removed in the aryl radical, the intramolecular reaction with the alkene is so much faster than is rotation of the <b>carbon-nitrogen</b> <b>bond</b> that the stereochemistry is preserved. In this way the (M,S) isomer yields the (S,S) dihydroindolone.|$|E
50|$|Production of {{polymers}} {{requires the}} repeated joining of two groups {{to form an}} amide linkage. In this case this specifically involves amide bonds, and the two groups involved are an amine group, and a terminal carbonyl component of a functional group. These react to produce a <b>carbon-nitrogen</b> <b>bond,</b> creating a singular amide linkage. This process involves the elimination of other atoms previously part of the functional groups. The carbonyl-component {{may be part of}} either a carboxylic acid group or the more reactive acyl halide derivative. The amine group and the carboxylic acid group can be on the same monomer, or the polymer can be constituted of two different bifunctional monomers, one with two amine groups, the other with two carboxylic acid or acid chloride groups.|$|E
