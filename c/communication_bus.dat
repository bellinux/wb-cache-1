Communication and processing takes place on finite stream basis. This keeps control and communication overhead low and control logic small. To reduce control overhead even more, the memory is made accessible by abstract instructions from the program controller which do not involve physical addresses. To reduce flow irregularity effects, data as well as instructions are queued before being consumed, and the pipeline is able to compress bubbles in the pipe. The architecture of Jacobium processing elements is highly parameterized, [...] ...|$|R
