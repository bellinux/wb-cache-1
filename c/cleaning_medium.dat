B ecause {{of the high}} costs of waste disposal and treatment, regula- tory pressures, and concerns about legal liabilities, industries are scrutinizing their hazardous-waste-generation practices. This applies not only to process wastes, but also to wastes from the cleaning of process equipment. A primary objective of these waste-minimization efforts has been to reduce the quantity and/or the toxicity of the waste. For equipment-cleaning resi-dues, this can be done, as outlined here, by determining: Why is the deposit present and how was it formed? How can cleaning frequency be reduced?

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an emerging technology called centrifugal shear carbon dioxide (CSCD) <b>cleaning.</b> It provides <b>medium</b> to high volume parts cleaning capacity for both general and precision cleaning applications. It {{is a very}} economical nd high performance alternative to both supercritical fluid (SCF) and water-based cleaning processes. CSCD cleaning is a dynamic separation process which combines dense fluid chemistry, centrifugal force and aggressive scouring action. CSCD cleaning and operating characteristics meet or exceed standards associated with banned organic solvents, semi-aqueous, and aqueous cleaning processes and do not produce air pollution, wastewater, or spent cleaning agents. Applications for this new cleaning technology are diverse, ranging from degreasing hundreds of pounds of oily machined metal parts per day to extracting delicate implantable medical devices...|$|R

40|$|The {{most recent}} efforts in {{developing}} the Dense Medium Separation (DMS) technology have been particularly directed towards {{the treatment of the}} fines (in the range 0. 5 to 0. 1 / 0. 3 mm), the separation at high density, the high sharpness separation and the use of multistage dynamic separation system. To this end, the control of the rheological properties of the suspensions used in dense medium separation is of primary importance. This means that: (a) a knowledge of the influence of the operating media composition on the rheological properties is necessary; (b) the <b>medium</b> <b>cleaning</b> circuits have to be properly designed in order to obtain the required composition of the medium. This implies the need of a model for describing the rheological behaviour of dense media. The model has been developed after test programmes conducted on suspensions of magnetite, ferrosilicon and various non-magnetic contaminants, under different conditions of volume concentration, proportion of components of the solid phase and shear rate. Basic data for using the model are the rheological properties of media made up of pure components or corresponding to selected compositions. In this paper the model has been checked for suspensions of ferrosilicon containing different types of contaminants. The principles underlying the design of medium regeneration circuits in modern dynamic DMS plants are highlighted. Some workable enhancements of the complex plant circuitry aimed at obtaining and controlling the required composition of the medium and, hence, modulating the viscosity of operating media are described...|$|R

I report here on Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus) cleaning capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) in southeastern Brazil, and postulate {{a sequence of}} steps that might have given origin to cleaning in omnivorous scavenging birds. The first step would be the familiarity these scavengers have with carcasses, from which they remove small tisues pieces and organic debris, and parasites, followed by a few intermediate steps with behavioural adjustments between the cleaners and their clients, and culminating in <b>cleaning</b> symbiosis with <b>medium</b> to large herbivorous mammals. Moreover, four instances of tick-removal by birds (Molothrus oryzivorus, Milvago chimachima, Machetornis rixosa and Crotophaga ani) from medium to large herbivorous mammals are described, {{and a list of}} 12 species of tick-removing birds recorded for Brazil is presented. The similarity between the habits of cathartid vultures and Caracarini falcons is pointed out, tick-removing being recorded for both groups. I suggest that species of Phalcoboenus (Falconidae) and Cyanocorax (Corvidae) might be potential cleaners. Parasite-removing birds are here grouped in two broad categories that would accommodate additional records of this type: 1) omnivorous scavengers and widely foraging birds that dwell in the open and associate with capybaras, wild ungulates, and/or livestock; and 2) largely insectivorous, widely foraging birds that dwell in the open and which also associate with capybaras, wild ungulates, and/or livestock.

40|$|The {{range of}} fuels fed to waste {{incineration}} plants extends from well-sorted domestic refuse through mixed waste fractions to fuel mixtures that may additionally contain various types of hazardous waste and biomass. This diversity results in {{a great number of}} fuel and ash compositions. Among these are fuels with a high calorific value as well as with a low calorific value and simple fuel ashes just as highly problematic fuel ashes. The latter can lead to increased slagging in the combustion chamber and fouling in the open passes of {{waste incineration plants}} as well as accelerated corrosion. The plant operator is consequently faced with considerable challenges associated with unscheduled boiler downtime and production losses.

40|$|Regarding the {{automotive}} industry, {{the trend of}} substituting mechanical products by mechatronic and electronic ones becomes apparent. Correspondingly, the requirements for the industrial sector of remanufacturing have to be adapted, too.

Therefore, the demand for clearly defined specific processes increases. Here, especially the topic of technical cleanliness has to be considered. The research project eCleanER is exploring new cleaning technologies and equipment to remove these sealants by using various CO 2 based cleaning technologies. Beside the relatively high technical effort, cleaning with CO 2 shows lots of advantages.

40|$|Recently, a fluid turbine {{which has}} a brush {{attached}} to it has been designed and tested with water as fluid. The purpose of the turbine-brush is to clean up fouling in a tube. The Montreal Protocol prohibits the use of CFC products from refrigeration industry or from industry in general as a cleanser in 1996.

Based on the energy conservation and the Bernoulli equation along with an empirical relationship of drag force obtained from an experimental apparatus, a relationship of the rotational speed, the number of blades, and geometric variables of the turbine-brush was obtained. The predicted rotational speeds were compared with the experimental observations. Further work was recommended for improvements...|$|E

40|$|An Ar- 10 vol%H 2 plasma {{was applied}} as a <b>cleaning</b> <b>medium</b> on UBMs (Under Bump Metallizations) {{to improve the}} {{bondability}} of solder balls prior to plasma reflow. Each UBM area comprised four layers deposited on a Si-wafer. Sequentially, the deposit comprised 0. 4 mm of Al, 4 mm each of Ni and Cu, and 20 nm of Au from bottom to top of the metallization. Two compositions of lead-free solder balls (Sn- 3. 5 mass%Ag and Sn- 3. 5 mass%Ag- 0. 7 mass%Cu) and a lead containing one (Sn- 37 mass%Pb) as a reference were selected for the experiment. The solder balls, of 500 mm diameter, {{were placed on the}} UBM’s and fluxlessly soldered under Ar- 10 %H 2 plasma (with or without prior plasma cleaning). Additionally, air reflow with flux was also performed for comparison. Experimental results showed that the spreading ratios of the solders by plasma reflow after plasma cleaning were 20 – 40 % higher than those plasma reflowed without cleaning. The shear strengths of the solder balls processed by the plasma-cleaned plasma reflow showed around 58 – 65 MPa, which is 60 – 80 % and 15 – 35 % higher than that of plasma reflow without plasma cleaning, and that of fluxed air reflow, respectively. From this study, plasma cleaning of UBM’s using Ar- 10 %H 2 gas was shown to be quite effective to improve the bond strength of solder balls...|$|E
40|$|Syfte Studiens syfte var att undersöka om användningen av olika tandborsttyper påverkar böjhållfastheten på varmpolymeriserad PMMA. Material och metod Trettio provkroppar tillverkades i Ivocap High Impact Akrylat med mått enligt en modifierad ISO 20795 - 1 : 2013 och utsattes för slitagetest med fyra olika tandborsttyper, Oral-B Precision (TP), Oral-B Trizone (TT), TePe Select Soft (TS) och TePe Denture Brush (TD). Rengöringsmediumet bestod av en tvål- och vattenlösning. Ytan granskades före och efter slitagetest. Böjhållfastheten testades med hjälp av ett trepunkts-böjhållfasthetstest. Resultatet analyserades med one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s test och signifikansnivån sattes till α = 0, 05. Resultat Ingen signifikant skillnad kunde påvisas mellan grupperna (p = 0, 38) och inga till små förändringar i form av repor på ytan kunde observeras i mikroskop. Slutsats Med {{reservation}} för de begränsningar som studien har kan följande slutsats dras: Oberoende av vilken tandborsttyp som användes påverkades inte böjhållfastheten på materialet och ytan påverkades inte nämnvärt. Det kan behövas fler studier där materialet åldras, flera protesbasmaterial testas och med mer utvecklad utrustning. Nollhypotesen kan bekräftas. Purpose The {{purpose of}} the study was to investigate whether the use of different toothbrushes affects the flexural strength of heat-polymerized PMMA. Methods Thirty specimens were manufactured of Ivocap High Impact resin with dimensions according to a modified version of ISO 20795 - 1 : 2013. The specimens were divided into five groups and the surface was examined before and after a wear test. The groups were Oral-B Precision (TP), Oral-B Trizone (TT), TePe Select Soft (TS), TePe Denture Brush (TD) and Control group (KG). The <b>cleaning</b> <b>medium</b> consisted of a soap and water solution. Ultimate flexural strength was tested with a 3 -point bending test. The result was statistically analyzed with one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s test with a significance level set to α = 0, 05. Results No significant difference was found between the groups (p = 0. 38) and none to small changes in the form of scratches on the surface could be observed in microscope. Conclusion Within the limitations of the study the following conclusion can be drawn: Regardless of the toothbrush type used, the flexural strength of the material was not affected and the surface was not significantly affected. There is a need for further studies where the material is subjected to aging, several other prosthetic base materials is tested and with more advanced test equipment.
