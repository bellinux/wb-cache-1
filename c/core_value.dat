Taking these stores, he and his partners created a new company called <b>Core</b> <b>Value</b> Partners to renovate and update the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee groups at the time. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners.|$|E

The new company, which started out as <b>Core</b> <b>Value</b> Partners and eventually became Heartland Foods, also purchased 120 additional stores from distressed owners and completely revamped them.

Other purchasers included a three-way group of NFL athletes Kevin Faulk, Marcus Allen and Michael Strahan who collectively purchased 17 stores in the cities of Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; and Cincinnati-based franchisee Dave Devoy, who purchased 32 AmeriKing stores. After investing in new decor, equipment and staff retraining, many of the formerly failing stores have shown growth upwards of 20 percent.|$|E

40|$|Purpose–The {{concept of}} {{learning}} organization has been inspiring {{both public and}} private sectors since the early 90 s. This paper discusses the implementation of learning organization ideas along with the organization’s <b>core</b> <b>values</b> at one of the public universities in Malaysia. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the components of <b>core</b> <b>values</b> that support the development and maintenance of learning organization ideas. It also aims to examine the potential integration of the learning organization idea with organizational <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> Design/methodology/approach– The study analyses the application of learning organization principles based on Örtenblad’s (2002) four understandings of learning organization, which are organizational learning, learning at work, learning climate and learning structure, along with the five <b>core</b> <b>values</b> initiatives at the university. Findings– This study suggests that the university <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and the learning organization idea work harmoniously with each other. This paper provides examples of the application of the learning organization idea and the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> attribute and how both fit into each other in one of the Malaysian public universities. A learning organization– <b>core</b> <b>values</b> matrix is proposed at the end of the paper. Research limitations/implications– This research uses the specific case of organizational <b>core</b> <b>values</b> that are established based on Islamic principles. Opportunities for further research can be a study of learning organizations in other <b>core</b> <b>values</b> environment and also from a different belief system. Practical implications– Learning organization is relevant and in harmony with Islamic environment.

The President congratulated the pilgrims for {{successfully}} completing the journey and praised the Chinese Muslim Association as an important asset of Taiwan, saying that the association has successfully promoted the frequent contacts and exchanges between Taiwan and the Muslim worlds, and serves as the communication window for Taiwan to those nations. He said that Islam is the current fastest growing religion in the world and has a major role and contribution to mankind and civilization. The <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of Islam is {{that there is only one}} God, people should do good deeds and people should love their fellow men and citizens. He personally believes that Taiwanese Muslims must emphasize the principle of Islam that stresses peace and love in order to enable others to understand the true nature of Islam. He further added that in recent years, Taiwan has made significant progress in expanding affairs with the Muslim world, creating a win-win situation for all parties involved and also triggering more interest in Islam among Taiwanese people. Although there are only around 60,000 Taiwanese Muslims, this community has made Taiwan becomes more diverse and richer in culture. He assured to the local Muslims that the Muslim people in Taiwan will always enjoy religious freedom and that the government will pay close attention to any raising needs to the group. He also hoped that Taiwanese Muslims will participate in Islamic-related international affairs and play even more role in helping Taiwan solidifies itself with the Islamic nations.|$|E

The aim is on one hand {{to look at the}} widely spread use of corporate branding strategies and on the other hand, which is the main focus of this project, to explore and utilize some of the tools used in Danish pragmatic text analyses. The <b>core</b> <b>values</b> from Alfa Laval consist of 4 values and a describing text, which is presented in a brochure containing Alfa Laval’s mission, vision, <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and code of conduct. To unfold the text I examine the text genre PR texts using literature on this topic from Rita Therkelsen. The <b>core</b> <b>values</b> speech acts is analysed with {{the use of}} Jürgen Habermas and a part of his language philosophy. Alfa Laval’s <b>core</b> <b>values</b> do not have a consistent use of pronouns, and to examine the possible consequences of this breach I use Ole Togeby’s work on Danish functional grammar. To define <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and corporate branding strategies, I use Ole Thyssen and Lars Thøger Christensen and Mette Morsing. The focus of my analysis is whether it is an appropriate way to formulate the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> as a regulative speech act, with a breach in the use of pronouns, based on the knowledge of how <b>core</b> <b>values</b> are used in a corporate branding strategy. At the end of the analysis I make two new suggestions on how to formulate the <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> The conclusion is that it is recommended to use a constative speech act, and to be consistent in the use of pronouns in the <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> so that the ownership of the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> remains clear...|$|R

A pre-test, post-test design was used to evaluate recruit (n = 302) motivational internalisation of <b>core</b> <b>values</b> during a structured 5 -day training week, where recruits undertook a mixture of rock climbing, caving, canoeing, kayaking, and hill walking activities, and were required to complete tasks in unfamiliar and challenging environmental conditions. Reflecting the influence of the training, Bonferroni corrected, pair-samples, ttests conducted on the Relative Autonomy Index were significant for the motivational internalisation of All <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and four of the six independent <b>core</b> <b>values</b> (Selfless Commitment, Courage, Loyalty and Respect for Others). Further examination at external, introjected and integrated regulations additionally revealed significant results for all <b>core</b> <b>values</b> with the AT week appearing to have the most robust effect on introjected regulation. A second hypothesis was concerned with the effects of the leadership of AT instructors in developing recruit <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and asked specifically whether high levels of transformational leadership behaviours were associated with an enhanced internalisation of <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> Fifty nine instructors took part in the study and four transformational leadership behaviours were hypothesised to be associated with greater gains in the internalisation of all <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> Analyses revealed mixed results regarding individual transformational leadership behaviours; however, individual consideration was found to be the most significant behaviour.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this article}} is to {{introduce}} a conceptual framework for a corporate brand building process based on <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> The nature, role, and function of <b>core</b> <b>values</b> are considered a central part of the value foundation of a corporate brand. In line with this reasoning, a distinction is also made between three groups of values: organisational <b>values,</b> <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> and added values. This article is based on research into the brand building efforts of more than 50 major companies over a period of 10 years. The Volvo case is used as an illustration and places special emphasis on internal processes. The role of the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> in the ten steps of the framework is explored and illustrated. The work is based on first-hand experiences, interviews, and unique internal strategy documents from Volvo. The discussion defines <b>core</b> <b>values</b> as overarching concepts that summarise the identity of the corporate brand and as guiding lights for the brand building process. Another conclusion drawn from the article is that <b>core</b> <b>values</b> are vital for continuity, consistency and credibility in a value creating process. The theoretical and practical implications of using <b>core</b> <b>values</b> as a unifying common thread are discussed in relation to the paradigm of brand orientation...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} suggests organizations have unique guiding principles, called <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> which {{play a central}} role in strategic decision making, sustaining high-performance cultures, and guiding organizational culture change. Although the Competing Values Framework (CVF) has been widely used to identify a standardized set of <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> it has not been used to identify unique <b>core</b> <b>values</b> at a given organizations. Unique <b>core</b> <b>values</b> help to distinguish organizations and drive market success. The present research focused on development of a technique to extend the application of the CVF to identify the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> unique to a given organization. The CVF-based <b>Core</b> <b>Values</b> Identification Technique (CCVI) was developed and empirically tested at three companies. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, review of documents, participant observation and the standard CVF-based Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI). The data analysis employed grounded theory methods in conjunction with the standard OCAI analysis. The primary research result is the iteratively developed and empirically tested tool, the CCVI Technique. Secondary research results include the identification of unique <b>core</b> <b>values</b> at each of the three participating companies. Lessons learned and the rationale for making modifications to the technique based on the case studies, along with best practices for utilization and opportunities for informing organizational change efforts are discussed...|$|R
