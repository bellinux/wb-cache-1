25|$|A {{compound}} locomotive is a steam locomotive which {{is powered by}} a <b>compound</b> <b>engine,</b> a type of steam engine where steam is expanded in two or more phases. Colloquially referred to as a <b>compound</b> <b>engine,</b> the locomotive is only one application of the compounding principle.|$|E
25|$|In 1824, the Allaire Works {{built the}} engine for , the first {{steamship}} {{in the world}} fitted with a <b>compound</b> <b>engine.</b> The high-pressure cylinder was 12inches in diameter and the low-pressure cylinder 24inches, with both having a stroke of 4 feet. In the same year, the Allaire Works also supplied a <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> for a 200-ton towboat called Post Boy, and another for a small steamer, Linnaeus.|$|E
25|$|The first {{steamboat}} with a <b>compound</b> <b>engine,</b> {{the commercial}} passenger-cargo steamer PS Henry Eckford, built in 1824 by Mowatt Brothers and Company and in service until 1841, {{was named for}} Henry Eckford.|$|E
50|$|<b>Compound</b> <b>engines</b> gave further {{improvements}} in efficiency. By the 1870s triple expansion engines {{were being used}} on ships. <b>Compound</b> <b>engines</b> allowed ships to carry less coal than freight. <b>Compound</b> <b>engines</b> were used on some locomotives but were not widely adopted because of their mechanical complexity.|$|R
25|$|Other vessels {{equipped}} with <b>compound</b> <b>engines</b> from the Allaire Works to 1828 included Sun, Commerce, Swiftsure and Pilot Boy. The Allaire Works built <b>compound</b> <b>engines</b> decades before {{the advantages of}} such engines became widely recognized in the shipbuilding industry.|$|R

25|$|A {{method to}} lessen the {{magnitude}} of the continual heating and cooling of a single-expansion steam engine that leads to inefficiency was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf. Woolf patented his stationary Woolf high-pressure <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> in 1805.|$|E
25|$|Less obviously, {{steamship}} design {{had taken}} a large step forward in 1866 with Agamemnon, using higher boiler pressure and a <b>compound</b> <b>engine,</b> so obtaining a large improvement in fuel efficiency. Ships of this type could compete with clippers before the Suez Canal opened.|$|E
25|$|Henry Eckford {{was a small}} passenger-cargo {{steamboat}} {{built in}} New York in 1824. She is notable for being the first steamship {{in the world to}} be installed with a <b>compound</b> <b>engine,</b> almost fifty years before the technology would become widely adopted for marine use.|$|E

25|$|A triple-expansion {{engine is}} a <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> that expands the steam in three stages, i.e. an engine which has {{cylinders}} operating at three different pressures. A quadruple-expansion engine expands the steam in four stages, and so on. The first successful commercial use was an engine built at Govan in Scotland by Alexander C. Kirk for the SS Aberdeen in 1881.|$|E
25|$|Amongst {{the many}} notable {{achievements}} of the Allaire Works, it supplied the engine cylinder for the first steamship to cross the Atlantic, Savannah, pioneered {{the use of the}} <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> in steamships, and built the engines for two winners of the coveted Blue Riband. The company also supplied the engines for at least 17 U.S. Navy warships during the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Note that a <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> (including multiple-expansion engines, see below) {{can have}} more than one set of variable-pressure {{cylinders}}. For example, an engine might have two cylinders operating at pressure x and two operating at pressure y, or one cylinder operating at pressure x and three operating at pressure y. What makes it compound (or double-expansion) as opposed to multiple-expansion is that there are only two pressures, x and y.|$|E
50|$|In August 1871, Roach {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} the U.S. Navy for refitting several warships with <b>compound</b> <b>engines,</b> asserting that the new engines would save space and reduce running costs {{by as much as}} 40%. The Navy agreed to an experimental engine refit for one vessel, , for which Roach would receive $300,000 for two <b>compound</b> <b>engines</b> plus the ship's original engines for their scrap value.|$|R
50|$|The Binghamton <b>engine,</b> {{a double}} <b>compound</b> marine steam <b>engine,</b> {{is of an}} axially {{symmetric}} design, like the double ended ferryboat Binghamton. Double <b>compound</b> <b>engines</b> were superseded by more efficient Triple expansion steam engines.|$|R

25|$|While {{the higher}} {{pressure}} {{was necessary for}} the <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> to fully utilize its greater efficiency, it {{may account for the}} fact that this type of engine remained unpopular in marine applications long after its invention, as boiler explosions were not uncommon on early steamboats and higher pressures made for more violent explosions. After Henry Eckford, Allaire would go on to install several more steamboats with compound engines, decades before the technology was to achieve widespread acceptance in marine applications.|$|E
25|$|Fortuitously, Cramp & Sons {{had built}} its first <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> only the {{previous}} year, and Charles Cramp had also recently travelled to the United Kingdom to acquaint {{himself with the}} latest developments in engine technology, hiring a consultant engineer along the way. The company was thus in a position to fit engines of the latest design. Many parts for the ships however, such as iron plates, anchor chains, joinery for the first class cabins, gas fixtures etc., came from specialist Philadelphian manufacturers under subcontract.|$|E
25|$|In 1891, Pennsylvania {{had a major}} {{overhaul}} when her outdated <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> {{was replaced by a}} new triple-expansion engine supplied by the original builder, William Cramp & Sons. The new engine was smaller, allowing for more cargo space, and was more economical to run. By this time, the ship was beginning to show her age in comparison with newer and more modern vessels, and she no longer carried first class passengers. In the same year, the ship was switched to the less important Antwerp-Philadelphia route, which she maintained until 1898, making her last transatlantic crossing that year.|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} these three boats, the 4,600-ton Puritan, built in 1887, was fitted with the largest walking beam engine ever built. She {{was also the first}} {{steamboat}} built for service on Long Island Sound to have a steel hull. The second was a smaller vessel, the 3,800-ton Plymouth, built in 1889. As it was decided that the walking beam engine had reached its practical limit in Puritan, Plymouth was installed with a more modern triple expansion engine instead. The last of the three vessels was the 5,300-ton Priscilla, built in 1894, which had a double <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> and Scotch boilers. All three of these vessels were considered in their day to be the epitome of elegance and sophistication and gave many years of service on Long Island Sound.|$|E
25|$|Charles John Galloway had a {{particular}} interest in exhibitions. The firm displayed two 40 horsepower Galloway boilers at the 1873 Vienna Universal Exhibition, and a 35 horsepower <b>compound</b> <b>engine.</b> In 1876 the firm was gazetted for an award for Services to the American Executive in Machinery Department at the Philadelphia International Exhibition, and {{he was awarded the}} title of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour after the Paris Exhibition of 1878, raised to the rank of Officer after the similarly titled event of 1889. He was very active in the organisation of the Royal Manchester Jubilee Exhibition of 1887. John Galloway junior was chairman of the organising committee for the latter event. Some years later, in 1894, Galloways won the Grand Prix in the Motive & Machines section of the Antwerp International Exhibition.|$|E
25|$|Melville mounted Maines engines {{with the}} {{cylinders}} in vertical mode, {{a departure from}} conventional practice. Previous ships had had their engines mounted in horizontal mode, {{so that they would}} be completely protected below the waterline. Melville believed a ship's engines needed ample room to operate and that any exposed parts could be protected by an armored deck. He therefore opted for the greater efficiency, lower maintenance costs and higher speeds offered by the vertical mode. Also, the engines were constructed with the high-pressure cylinder aft and the low-pressure cylinder forward. This was done, according to the ship's chief engineer, A. W. Morley, so the low-pressure cylinder could be disconnected when the ship was under low power. This allowed the high and intermediate-power cylinders to be run together as a <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> for economical running.|$|E

25|$|After the Vanderbilt takeover, an {{increasing}} {{percentage of the}} company's contracts came from Vanderbilt himself, who from this point had most of his new steamboats and steamships engined there, just as most of his shipbuilding contracts {{went to the same}} firm, that of his trusted nephew, Jeremiah Simonson. Vanderbilt brought his own ideas to the field of marine steam engineering. Defying the prevailing wisdom, he began powering oceangoing steamships with American walking beam engines, believing that their relative lightness of construction, economy of operation and low maintenance requirements made them preferable to the low center-of-gravity, but more complex, British-designed side-lever and oscillating types. Other American marine engine manufacturers quickly followed his example, and walking beams became the preferred engine type for oceangoing American sidewheel steamships until the introduction of the much more economical surface condensing <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> in the early 1870s.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of Holt's package of boiler pressure, <b>compound</b> <b>engine</b> and hull design gave {{a ship that}} could steam at 10 knots on 20 long tons of coal a day. This fuel consumption was a saving from between 23 and 14 long tons a day, compared to other contemporary steamers. Not only did less coal need to be carried to travel a given distance, but fewer firemen were needed to fuel the boilers, so crew costs and their accommodation space were reduced. Agamemnon was able to sail from London to China with a coaling stop at Mauritius on the outward and return journey, with a time on passage substantially less than the competing sailing vessels. Holt had already ordered two sister ships to Agamemnon {{by the time she}} had returned from her first trip to China in 1866, operating these ships in the newly formed Blue Funnel Line. His competitors rapidly copied his ideas for their own new ships.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 the Italian {{engineer}} Enrico Plancher {{developed a}} new and curious design of <b>compound</b> <b>engine,</b> which first appeared on the Rete Adriatica 500 class express locomotive; it was notable for being an asymmetrical four-cylinder design, {{in which the two}} AP and the two LP cylinders were grouped together, with each couple being served by a single piston valve which admitted steam simultaneously to the opposite ends of the two cylinders. The prototype of the class was presented at the International Railway Congress of 1900 in Paris and was looked at with interest, while not meeting with outstanding success; however, on the long run the asymmetrical design, while simple, proved to be rather awkward, as it was difficult to equalize the work of each side of the locomotive and this caused hunting. The Plancher engine was used again on some Ferrovie dello Stato designs like the FS Class 680 express locomotives and the FS Class 470 heavy freight locomotives, but no further application was approved after the widespread adoption of the superheater.|$|E
50|$|After a very {{exhaustive}} {{study of}} the subject, they recommended the introduction of <b>compound</b> <b>engines</b> and the abandonment of the simple form, and the conversion {{of a number of}} the engines which were on hand into <b>compound</b> <b>engines.</b> Four sets of these simple engines were so converted and were fitted to the Vandalia, Marion, Quinnebaug and Swatara. The tests of these engines were very satisfactory and showed a coal economy for short runs of not much over two pounds of coal per horsepower hour.|$|R
