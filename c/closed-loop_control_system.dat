Now, when the car goes uphill, {{the difference between the}} input (the sensed speed) and the reference continuously determines the throttle position. As the sensed speed drops below the reference, the difference increases, the throttle opens, and engine power increases, speeding up the vehicle.

2500|$|Optimal {{control is}} a {{particular}} control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain [...] "cost index": for example, {{in the case of}} a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are Model Predictive Control (MPC) and linear-quadratic-Gaussian control (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the [...] "optimal control" [...] structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the <b>closed-loop</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in process control.|$|E

40|$|Performances of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> {{operated}} over a {{data network}} are typically degraded by network-induced delays. Furthermore, the <b>closed-loop</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> can become unstable. The {{purpose of this}} research has been to develop a control methodology to handle network-induced delay effects using optimal gain scheduling on existing controllers. The proposed gain scheduling technique adapts controller gains externally by modifying a controller output to enable the controller for uses over a data network. Since existing controllers can still be utilized, the proposed methodology can reduce <b>control</b> <b>system</b> reinstallation and replacement costs. First, {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed gain scheduling technique on networked DC motor speed control using a PI (Proportional-Integral) controller is investigated. Also, the concept of network traffic condition measurement to select optimal controller gains is presented. Then, a middleware framework to measure network traffic conditions on an IP network based on delays and delay variations and to modify controller gains is described. Suggestion of using neural network in the gain scheduling scheme is also given. Finally, the gain scheduling technique with the middleware framework is then extended to mobile robot path-tracking control...|$|R

For a constant voltage, the conveyor will move at a different speed depending on the load on the motor (represented here by the weight of objects on the conveyor).

50|$|Brown {{and colleagues}} are {{establishing}} {{a new paradigm}} for waking patients up following general anesthesia. They {{have shown that the}} anesthetic state can be rapidly reversed by administering methylphenidate (Ritalin) or activation of dopaminergic systems. This suggests a new, feasible way to actively restore cognitive function in patients after anesthesia and sedation. They have received FDA approval to undertake a clinical trial to test this idea in humans (NCT 02051452). They have also shown that burst-suppression, a state of profound brain inactivation seen in deep general anesthesia, hypothermia, coma and developmental brain disorders, can be simply explained by a unifying neural-metabolic model. Brown’s group have also shown that burst suppression can be precisely controlled to maintain a therapeutic, medically-induced coma. This research uses a <b>closed-loop</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> based on his SSPP paradigm.

5000|$|The {{oxygen sensor}} {{is the basis}} of the <b>closed-loop</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> on a spark-ignited rich-burn engine; however, it is also used for diagnostics. In {{vehicles}} with OBD II, a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O2 levels. The O2 levels are monitored to see the efficiency of the burn process. The on-board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors. The readings are taken by voltage measurements. If both sensors show the same output or the rear O2 is [...] "switching", the computer recognizes that the catalytic converter either is not functioning or has been removed, and will operate a malfunction indicator lamp and affect engine performance. Simple [...] "oxygen sensor simulators" [...] have been developed to circumvent this problem by simulating the change across the catalytic converter with plans and pre-assembled devices available on the Internet. Although these are not legal for on-road use, they have been used with mixed results. Similar devices apply an offset to the sensor signals, allowing the engine to run a more fuel-economical lean burn that may, however, damage the engine or the catalytic converter.|$|E
