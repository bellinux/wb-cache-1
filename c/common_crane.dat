There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged buzzard, merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn.

40|$|The {{significance}} of mortality from collision with power lines for {{several species of}} birds has been evaluated by collision rates - i. e., number of birds hitting a power line/number of birds crossing a power line. We estimated mortality from power-line collisions for a wintering population of <b>common</b> <b>cranes</b> (Grus grus) and a resident population of great bustards (Otis tarda) in 2 study areas in Spain during 1992 - 1995. We estimated collision rates at 3. 93 x 10 - 5 for <b>common</b> <b>cranes</b> and at 6. 34 x 10 - 3 for great bustards. Risk exposure (i. e., power-line crossings per unit of time) for <b>common</b> <b>cranes</b> was 714 times greater than for great bustards. Therefore, despite a high collision rate, minimum annual collision mortality for great bustards, present the whole year, was less than for <b>common</b> <b>cranes,</b> present only 4 months - 1. 58 and 2. 36 /km/year, respectively. Collision rate, which defines the chance of collision for a certain bird species, should be combined with risk exposure and population size to evaluate the impact of collision mortality on bird populations.

The nest is either in or very near shallow water, often with dense shore vegetation nearby, and may be used over several years.
