40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comBACKGROUND: In the debate about legalization of euthanasia very little attention {{has so far been}} given to the opinion of the patient. OBJECTIVE: To assess the opinion of persons with HIV infection in Europe. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of persons with HIV infection attending HIV/AIDS treatment <b>centres</b> <b>or</b> HIV support <b>organizations</b> in 11 European Union Member States was performed. A total of 2751 anonymous patient self-administered questionnaires were distributed between August 1996 and September 1997. The questionnaire contained 108 questions concerning a variety of topics about HIV care, including five questions on euthanasia. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred and seventy-one people with HIV infection completed the questionnaire, of whom 1341 (98 %) responded to the questions concerning euthanasia. Seventy-eight percent of respondents agreed with the legalization of euthanasia in case of severe physical suffering, 47 % if there was severe psychological suffering and 24 % simply at the patient's request. For physical suffering and at a clear patient's request, accepted practices were: alleviation of pain with double effect (81 %), medical euthanasia (62 %) and physician assisted suicide (45 %). Fifty percent would consider euthanasia for themselves if all treatment options were exhausted. Social indicators such as educational level and employment seemed to play a more significant role in determining attitudes towards legalization, and personal interest in, euthanasia than indicators related to disease status. CONCLUSION: In this study a majority of HIV infected persons in Europe favoured the legalization of euthanasia...|$|R
