2500|$|In {{the circuit}} {{involving}} Q16 (variously named rubber diode or VBE multiplier), the 4.5k resistor must be conducting about 100μA, with the Q16 VBE roughly 700mV. Then the VCB must be about 0.45V and VCE at about 1.0V. Because the Q16 collector {{is driven by}} a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector <b>current</b> <b>sink,</b> the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of ≈ 1V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor exp(100mV / VT [...] ) ≈ 36 smaller than the 1mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the op amp. This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the crossover distortion of this stage.|$|E
2500|$|In {{considering}} {{where to}} place reserves, protecting source habitat is often assumed to be the goal, although if {{the cause of a}} sink is human activity, simply designating an area as a reserve has the potential to convert <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> patches to source patches (e.g. no-take zones). [...] Either way, determining which areas are sources or sinks for any one species may be very difficult, and an area that is a source for one species may be unimportant to others. [...] Finally, areas that are sources or sinks currently may not be in the future as habitats are continually altered by human activity or climate change. [...] Few areas can be expected to be universal sources, or universal sinks. [...] While the presence of source, sink, or trap patches must be considered for short-term population survival, especially for very small populations, long-term survival may depend on the creation of networks of reserves that incorporate a variety of habitats and allow populations to interact.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether the {{associative}} interactions between synapses {{that lead to}} long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) can occur between spatially segregated synapses of the medial and lateral temporodentate pathway of the rat. Coconditioning of crossed and ipsilateral pathways resulted in LTP of the crossed system only when the <b>current</b> <b>sinks</b> of the two conditioned pathways overlapped sufficiently. Likewise, conditioning of an ipsilateral pathway alone resulted in LTD of the crossed pathway only when those <b>current</b> <b>sinks</b> overlapped sufficiently.

The postsynaptic cell can therefore serve as more than one unit of integration for synaptic modification...|$|R
40|$|During {{disinhibition}} the neocortex generates synchronous activities. In neocortical slices {{application of}} GABAA and GABAB receptor antagonists transformed slow oscillations into large amplitude spike-wave discharges that contained a rhythmic ∼ 10 Hz neocortical oscillation. The 10 Hz oscillations caused by disinhibition were highly region specific and were generated only in frontal agranular regions of neocortex, {{such as the}} primary motor cortex, but not in granular neocortex. Pharmacological manipulations showed that the 10 Hz oscillations were critically dependent on α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionate (AMPA) receptors. Current source density (CSD) analyses in slices using 16 -site silicon probes revealed that the 10 Hz oscillations were expressed with large <b>current</b> <b>sinks</b> in the upper layers and smaller <b>current</b> <b>sinks</b> in the lower layers that precede them. The results indicate that blocking GABAB receptors in the agranular neocortex unmasks recurrent synaptic activity mediated by AMPA receptors that results in the generation of these oscillations...|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} electrostatic shielding zones made of electrode {{graphite powder}} {{and used them}} as {{a new type of}} ionic and electronic <b>current</b> <b>sinks.</b> Because of the local elimination of the applied electric field, voltage and current within the <b>current</b> <b>sinks,</b> ions are led inside them and accumulate there.

50|$|Current source density {{analysis}} (which {{could more}} accurately be called current source and sink density analysis) is {{the practice of}} placing a microelectrode in proximity to a nerve or a nerve cell to detect current sourcing from, or sinking into, their plasma membranes. When positive charges, for example, flow quickly across a plasma membrane {{to the inside of}} a cell (sink) this creates a transient cloud of negativity {{in the vicinity of the}} sink. This is because the flow of positive charges into the interior of the cell leaves behind uncompensated negative charges. A nearby micro-electrode with substantial tip resistance (on the order of 1 MΩ) can detect that negativity because a voltage difference will develop across the tip of the electrode (between the negativity outside the electrode, and the electroneutral environment inside the electrode). Put another way, the electrode internal solution will donate some of the positive charge needed to compensate the negativity caused by the <b>current</b> <b>sink.</b> Thus, the inside of the electrode will become negative relative to ground for as long as the extracellular negativity persists. The extracellular negativity will persist as long as the <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> is present. Thus, by measuring a negativity relative to ground, the electrode indirectly reports the presence of a nearby <b>current</b> <b>sink.</b> The size of the recorded negativity will vary directly with the size of the <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> and inversely with the distance between the electrode and the sink.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{the term}} current source {{refers to a}} {{boundary}} where charge flows from locations where it is not measured to locations where it is measured. In a similar fashion, a <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> may refer to the boundary where charge flows from locations where it is measured to locations where it is not measured. By analogy to the flow of water, a current source {{would be like a}} mountain spring - water flows from its source (a hidden location underground) to the surface where it is easily observed. Using the same analogy, a <b>current</b> <b>sink</b> would be like water flowing down a drain - water travels from where it is observed to where it is not observed.|$|E

40|$|We investigatedwhether {{a frontal}} area that lacks {{granular}} layer IV, supplementary eye field, exhibits features of laminar circuitry {{similar to those}} observed in primary sensory areas. We report, for the first time, visually evoked local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity recorded simultaneously across all layers of agranular frontal cortex using linear electrode arrays. We calculated current source density from the LFPs and compared the laminar organization of evolving sinks to those reported in sensory areas. Simultaneous, transient synaptic <b>current</b> <b>sinks</b> appeared first in layers III andV followed bymore prolonged <b>current</b> <b>sinks</b> in layers I/II andVI. We also found no variation of single- or multi-unit visual response latency across layers, and putative pyramidal neurons and interneurons displayed similar response latencies. Many units exhibited pronounced discharge suppression that was strongest in superficial relative to deep layers. Maximum discharge suppression also occurred later in superficial than in deep layers. These results {{are discussed in the}} context of the canonical cortical microcircuit model originally formulated to describe early sensory cortex.
