25|$|Remote Desktop Services (RDS), {{known as}} Terminal Services in Windows Server 2008 and earlier, {{is one of}} the {{components}} of Microsoft Windows that allows a user to take control of a remote computer or virtual machine over a network connection. RDS is Microsoft's implementation of thin client, where Windows software, and the entire desktop of the computer running RDS, are made accessible to a remote client machine that supports Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With RDS, only software user interfaces are transferred to the <b>client</b> <b>system.</b> All input from the <b>client</b> <b>system</b> is transmitted to the server, where software execution takes place. This is in contrast to application streaming systems, like Microsoft App-V, in which computer programs are streamed to the client on-demand and executed on the client machine.|$|E
25|$|With version 6.0, if the Desktop Experience {{component}} is {{plugged into the}} remote server, remote application user interface elements (e.g., application windows borders, Maximize, Minimize, and Close buttons etc.) will take on the same appearance of local applications. In this scenario, the remote applications will use the Aero theme if the user connects to the server from a Windows Vista machine running Aero. Later versions of the protocol also support rendering the UI in full 32-bit color, as well as resource redirection for printers, COM ports, disk drives, mice and keyboards. With resource redirection, remote applications can use {{the resources of the}} local computer. Audio is also redirected, so that any sounds generated by a remote application are played back at the <b>client</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, a remote session can also span multiple monitors at the <b>client</b> <b>system,</b> independent of the multi-monitor settings at the server. RDC {{can also be used to}} connect to Windows Media Center (WMC) remote sessions; however, since WMC does not stream video using RDP, only the applications can be viewed this way, not any media.|$|E

Regardless of these victories, Dacian towns began to take {{defensive}} measures. In Sucidava, the townspeople hurriedly erected a trapezoidal stone wall and defensive ditch, most likely {{the result of a}} raid by the barbarian tribes around 246 or 247 AD. [...] In 248 AD, Romula enhanced the wall surrounding the settlement, again most likely as an additional defensive barrier against the Carpi. An epigraph uncovered in Apulum salutes the emperor Decius (reigned 249–251 AD) as restitutor Daciarum, the [...] "restorer of Dacia". On July 1, 251 Decius and his army were killed by the Goths during their defeat in the Battle of Abrittus (modern Razgard, Bulgaria). Firmly entrenched in the territories along the lower Danube and the Black Sea's western shore, their presence affected both the non-Romanized Dacians (who fell into the Goth's sphere of influence) and Imperial Dacia, as the <b>client</b> <b>system</b> that surrounded the province and supported its existence began to break apart.|$|E
