50|$|The South African Railways <b>Class</b> <b>MB</b> 2-6-6-0 of 1910 was a steam {{locomotive}} from the pre-Union {{era in the}} Colony of Natal.|$|R
50|$|In November 1910, the Natal Government Railways placed five 2-6-6-0 Mallet {{articulated}} compound steam locomotives in service. In 1912, {{when they}} were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered and designated <b>Class</b> <b>MB.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1912, {{these five}} {{locomotives}} were renumbered {{in the range}} from 1602 to 1606 and designated <b>Class</b> <b>MB</b> on the South African Railways. They had a relatively short service life and were withdrawn from service by 1924. Their early demise was probably brought forward considerably by the appearance of the Garratt locomotive type on Cape Gauge in 1921.|$|R
50|$|Some of the MCW Metrobuses were {{converted}} to open-top for use by The Original Tour, which is <b>classed</b> as <b>MB</b> <b>class.</b> These were withdrawn by December 2007, replaced by modernised buses. London Pride Sightseeing also has MCW Metrobuses, but these were sold to Ensignbus.|$|R
5000|$|In 1910, {{following}} on the satisfactory {{performance of}} the experimental Mallet, the NGR placed five more in service, also built by ALCO. These five differed little from the previous Mallet, basically only in respect of larger boilers which made them slightly heavier and tenders with a larger coal capacity. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the SAR, they were designated <b>Class</b> <b>MB.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{augment the}} Mallet {{locomotive}} fleet operating across {{the more difficult}} sections of the Natal mainline, the South African Railways (SAR) placed an order with the North British Locomotive Company for ten compound steam locomotives which were {{very similar to the}} <b>Class</b> <b>MB.</b> They were delivered and placed in service in May 1912, designated Class MC and numbered in the range from 1607 to 1616.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the <b>Class</b> <b>MB</b> {{on which}} the sandboxes were placed {{on top of the}} boiler in {{accordance}} with American practice, the sandboxes of the Class MC were arranged on a different system, the advantages of which were questionable. The sandboxes for the hind engine unit were secured to the running board just {{to the rear of the}} high-pressure cylinders, while those for the front engine unit were placed on the upper sides of the boiler just to the rear of the smokebox.|$|R
50|$|Their Type TM tenders {{were the}} same as those of the Classes 3 and 3B, with a coal {{capacity}} of 8 lt 5 lcwt t and a water capacity of 4000 imp gal. The locomotives differed little from the previous Mallets in size, power and performance and may {{for all intents and purposes}} also have been classified as <b>Class</b> <b>MB.</b> It would seem that, compared to the Cape Government Railways which tended to group locomotives in the same Class which were dissimilar even to the extent of having different wheel arrangements, the early SAR at times took locomotive classification to the other extreme.|$|R

40|$|Object-oriented {{languages}} provide {{little support}} for encapsulating objects. Reference semantics allows objects to escape their defining scope.

A class and its subclasses are confined if all of their instances are encapsulated in their defining package. This simple property can be used to identify accidental leaks of sensitive objects.

40|$|In closed quantum systems, strong {{randomness}} can localize many-body excitations, preventing ergodicity. An interesting {{consequence is}} that high energy excited states can exhibit quantum coherent properties, such as symmetry protected topological (SPT) order, that otherwise only occur in equilibrium ground states. Here, we ask: which types of SPT orders {{can be realized}} in highly excited states of a many-body (MB) localized system? We argue that this question is equivalent to whether an SPT order can be realized in an exactly solvable lattice model of commuting projectors. This perspective enables a sharp definition of MB localizability. Using this criterion, it is straightforward to establish that whereas all bosonic SPTs in spatial dimensions d= 1, 2, 3 are MB localizable, chiral phases (e. g. quantum Hall fluids) are not. We also show that free fermion SPTs in d > 1 (including topological insulators and superconductors) cannot be localized if interactions are weak. A key question is whether strong interactions can render them MB localizable, which we study {{in the context of}} a class of d= 2 topological superconductors. Using a decorated domain wall (DDW) approach we show that some phases in this <b>class</b> are <b>MB</b> localizable, when they correspond to bosonic SPT orders. However, a similar DDW approach faces a fatal obstruction to realizing certain intrinsically fermionic SPT orders, an issue we argue may persist beyond this specific construction.

The reduced 172 <b>MB</b> <b>Class</b> 9 (332000) database was prepared and ordered from 2 CD-ROMS with duplicate records removed. Front-axle weight and gross-vehicle weight (GVW) are combined conceptually by determining the front axle weight in four-quartile GVW categories. The four categories of front axle weight from the four GVW categories are combined in four ways. Three linear combinations are with fixed-coefficient fiducials and one is that optimal linear combination producing the smallest standard deviation to mean value ratio. The best combination gives coefficients of variation of 2 [...] 3 % for samples of 100 trucks, below the expected accuracy of single-event WIM measurements. Time tracking of data shows some high-variation sites have seasonal variations, or linear variations over the time-ordered samples. Modeling of these effects is very site specific but provides a way to reduce high variations. Some automatic calibration schemes would erroneously remove such seasonal or linear variations were they static effects...|$|R

This study was employed quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent control group design. The variables of this research were independent variable (the implementation of the developed job sheet) and dependent variable (students’ achievement {{which is in the}} forms of students’ job grade and students’ working attitude). The population was the total number of class XI SMK Ma’arif Salam Magelang divided into three groups while the sample used in this study consisted of two groups with XI MA class (control group) and XI <b>MB</b> <b>class</b> (experimental group). This study employed purposive sampling technique in which the sample was selected under certain consideration. The data collection techniques were used the pretest-posttest result and observation toward students’ working attitude. The instrument validity of this study used content validity done by consulting the instrument to the expert (expert judgment). Then, the data were analyzed by using t-test. The findings revealed class who implement developed job sheet increasingly achieved toward the enginering practical learning of lathe and student’s working attitude as standard operational procedur and K 3 (after receiving the treatment). Results of classrom learning using previous job sheet there is not a significant improvement. This showed that the the posttest score resulted from t-test between control and experimental group got - 38. 385 with df = 74 with the level of erroneous of 0. 05. Then, it was achieved Sig. (2 -tailed) of 0, 000 which was less than the level of erroneous of 0. 05. Thus, this means that {{there was a significant difference}} toward the students’ engineering learning achievement between the students who implement previous job sheet and who implement job sheet developed. Comparison of the t-test score on the pretest-posttest between the control group and the experimental group was thitung=- 80. 891 with df = 37 and Sig. (2 -tailed) = 0. 000. The value of Sig.
