40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are widely}} used for systemic control of acute and chronic pain and inflammation (Lin et ah, 2000 : 1129), but usage problems and side-effects that occur during the post-marketing phase of these drugs are well documented (Thiefin & Beaugerie, 2005 : 287). Following the demonstration {{of the value of}} anti-inflammatory therapy in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (Boardman & Dudley Hart, 1967 : 268), new NSAIDs appeared on the market (Dieppe et al., 2004 : 867), and the indications steadily broadened from inflammatory diseases to almost any painful condition. Studies have indicated that NSAID-associated serious upper gastro-intestinal (GI) adverse events result in 103 000 hospitalisations (Bombardier, 2002 : 4) and 165 000 deaths per year in the United States. A study in South Africa in 2002 indicated that NSAID utilisation contributed considerably to the total cost of all medicine items from a medicine <b>claim</b> <b>database</b> in the private health care sector (Joubert, 2002 : 260). The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and cost of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs in a section of the private health care sector, and specifically to determine the prevalence, usage and cost of Coxib (Specific cyclo-oxygenase- 2 inhibitor) medicine items before and after the withdrawal of Vioxx® from the market in September 2004 (Merck, 2004). Data from two medicine <b>claim</b> <b>databases</b> for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 (medicine <b>claim</b> <b>database</b> I) and the years 2005 and 2006 (medicine <b>claim</b> <b>database</b> M), were analysed by means of a retrospective drug utilisation review (DUR) study. The usage of Coxib medicine items was determined, and compared for the periods before and after the withdrawal of Vioxx® in September 2004. It was found that between 9 and 10. 5 per cent of prescriptions dispensed through both medicine <b>claim</b> <b>database</b> I and medicine <b>claim</b> <b>database</b> M during the study period were NSAID prescriptions. NSAID medicine items on medicine <b>claim</b> <b>database</b> I represented between 3. 9 % (R 25 942 986) and 2. 9 % (R 8 073 034) of the total cost of all medicine items claimed from 2004 to 2006. NSAIDs represented 3. 1 % (R 58 290 412) and 2. 8 % (R 57 752 267) of the cost of all medicine items claimed through medicine <b>claim</b> <b>database</b> M during 2005 and 2006 respectively, indicating similar trends in the two medicine <b>claim</b> <b>databases.</b> The prevalence of Coxibs on medicine <b>claim</b> <b>database</b> I decreased from almost 20 % (47 938) in 2004 to 8. 4 % (13 276) in 2005, but showed an increase again to 10. 9 % (12 355) in 2006. The prevalence of both cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors, and Coxibs demonstrated a change during 1 September 2004 to 31 December 2004 when COX-inhibitors showed an increase in use, while Coxibs showed and almost equal but opposite trend with a decrease in use. This could possibly be related to perceptions of providers and public with regard to Coxibs and their related safety after the withdrawal of Vioxx® on 30 September 2004 (Merck, 2004) and other Coxibs such as Bextra® (FDA, 2005) in 2005 in USA. It is concluded that most patients who were using Coxibs before the withdrawal of Vioxx®, substituted Coxibs for COX-inhibitors, that are known for their possible gastro-intestinal side-effects. Recommendations for future research regarding NSAID use were also made, and included an investigation of the usage of Coxibs in different age groups, as well as the combination of NSAIDs with gastro-protective medicines in long-term use.

Clinical information for a population-based sample of persons using APDs in 2007 was collected. The authors built a prediction model using demographic variables and APDs as predictors and investigated the additional predictive benefit of including information on dose and regularity of use. Among 1, 114 APD users, 320 (29 %) had PD and 794 (71 %) had another diagnosis as determined by study neurologists. A logistic model including information on cumulative APD dose and regularity of use showed good performance (c statistic = 0. 953, sensitivity = 92. 5 %, specificity = 86. 4 %). Predicted PD prevalence (among persons aged ≥ 18 years) was 6. 66 / 1, 000; correcting this estimate using sensitivity/specificity led to a similar figure (6. 04 / 1, 000). These data demonstrate that drug <b>claims</b> <b>databases</b> can be used to estimate the probability that a person is being treated for PD and that information on APD dose and regularity of use improves models' performances.

40|$|Purpose. To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} glaucoma and costs associated with glaucoma care in South Korea between 2008 and 2013 using the Korean national <b>claims</b> <b>database.</b> Design. Retrospective cross-sectional study from a national <b>claims</b> <b>database.</b> Methods. Patients who were diagnosed with glaucoma between 2008 and 2013 were retrospectively identified in the national <b>claims</b> <b>database</b> using glaucoma diagnostic codes. For each year, the prevalence of glaucoma and direct medical costs associated with glaucoma care were estimated. Result. The prevalence of glaucoma in patients ≥ 40 years of age increased from 0. 79 % in 2008 to 1. 05 % in 2013. The number of patients with glaucoma increased by 54 % between 2008 and 2013 (9 % average annual increase). The prevalence of glaucoma increased with age and was higher in males than in females. The cost to care for glaucoma patients increased from $ 16. 5 million in 2008 to $ 29. 2 million in 2013, which translated into an 81 % increase over the 6 years examined (12. 7 % average annual increase).

Opinions expressed {{are those of the}} authors and do not represent the official position of the BLS. Can health care claims data improve the estimation of the Medical CPI? The Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) recommends that the U. S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) should change Medical Consumer Price Index (MCPI) from an index that is based on input prices for a sample of providers to an index based on prices for a sample of diseases. Additionally, CNSTAT suggests that instead of collecting price quotes directly from providers, the MCPI should use the reimbursement information on retrospective claims data bases. This study uses a retrospective <b>claims</b> <b>database</b> to construct medical price indexes for three PSUs in the Northeast that match the BLS’s priced PSUs: Philadelphia-A 102, Boston-A 103, and New York-A 109. We find that drug prices in the <b>claims</b> <b>database</b> are significantly lower than drug prices that BLS collected from 1999 to 2002. We also construct several experimental medical price indexes using the <b>claims</b> <b>database</b> from 1998 to 2002. One index is constructed using the current methodology of the MCPI. A second index is constructed that is disease based. The difference between disease-based index and the BLS MCPI is decomposed into three potential sources: difference in construction methods, difference in sample sizes, and difference in price distribution between the <b>claims</b> <b>database</b> and the BLS sample. In a month-by-month comparison, we did not find statistically significant differences between disease-based indexes and the BLS MCPI. The cumulative effect of the different methods will be tested. 2 1...|$|E

40|$|Population-based {{screening}} programs forcolo {{rectal cancer}} {{rely heavily on}} the perfor-mance of colonoscopy as either the initial examination or as the follow-up to a positive screening by virtual colonography, double- contrast barium enema or fecal occult blood testing. Colonoscopy is the only screening examination accepted at 10 -year intervals among people at aver-age risk without significant polyps found. It allows direct visualization of the entire colon and rectum and permits removal of adenomatous polyps, pre-cursors of colorectal cancer. The frequency of polypectomy is an important indicator of quality assurance for colorectal cancer screening programs. In the province of Quebec, physicians are re-imbursed for medical services by the Régie de l’Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ), the government agency responsible for administer-ing the provincial health insurance plan. Physi-cians receive additional remuneration for per-forming a polypectomy if they include the procedure code in their claim. Data from physician <b>claims</b> <b>databases</b> are commonly used in health services research, 1 – 7 even though the data are collected for adminis-trative purposes and physician reimbursement. Procedure codes in physician <b>claims</b> <b>databases</b> are presumed {{to have a very}} high level of agree-ment with data in medical charts. 8 A physician making a claim will need to submit the diagnos-tic code and, when applicable, the procedure code.

The accuracy of methods previously used to identify FN in such databases has not been formally evaluated. Methods Data comprised linked electronic medical records from Geisinger Health System and healthcare claims data from Geisinger Health Plan. Subjects were classified into subgroups based on {{whether or not they were}} hospitalized for FN per the presumptive “gold standard” (ANC 9 /L, and body temperature ≥ 38. 3 °C or receipt of antibiotics) and claims-based definition (diagnosis codes for neutropenia, fever, and/or infection). Accuracy was evaluated principally based on positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. Results Among 357 study subjects, 82 (23 %) met the gold standard for hospitalized FN. For the claims-based definition including diagnosis codes for neutropenia plus fever in any position (n= 28), PPV was 100 % and sensitivity was 34 % (95 % CI: 24 – 45). For the definition including neutropenia in the primary position (n= 54), PPV was 87 % (78 – 95) and sensitivity was 57 % (46 – 68). For the definition including neutropenia in any position (n= 71), PPV was 77 % (68 – 87) and sensitivity was 67 % (56 – 77).

In many instances, planning is informed by survey data, which provide epidemiologically estimated need from the dental fieldworkers’ perspective. The aim {{of this paper is}} to determine the validity of this type of information for planning. A comparison of normative (epidemiologically estimated) need for selected treatments, as measured on a randomly-selected representative sample, is compared with treatment actually provided in the population from which the sample was drawn. Methods This paper compares dental treatment need-estimates, from a national survey, with treatment provided within two choice-of-dentist schemes: Scheme 1, a co-payment scheme for employed adults, and Scheme 2, a ‘free’ service for less-well-off adults. Epidemiologically estimated need for extractions, restorations, advanced restorations and denture treatments was recorded for a nationally representative sample in 2000 / 02. Treatments provided to employed and less-well-off adults were retrieved from the <b>claims</b> <b>databases</b> for both schemes. We used the chi-square test to compare proportions, and the student’s t-test to compare means between the survey and <b>claims</b> <b>databases.</b> Results Among employed adults, the proportion of 35 - 44 -year-olds whose teeth had restorations was greater than estimated as needed in the survey (55. 7 % vs. 36. 7 %;p Among less-well-off adults, the proportion of 16 - 24 -year-olds who had teeth extracted was greater than estimated as needed in the survey (27. 4 % vs. 7. 9 %;p Conclusions Significant differences were found between epidemiologically estimated need and treatment provided for selected treatments, which may be accounted for by measurement differences.
