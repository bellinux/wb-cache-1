500|$|Discussions between Iwata, [...] Miyamoto, and Takeda about a {{new home}} console began {{in the first half}} of 2003. With {{encouragement}} from Yamauchi, Iwata pushed for development of a revolutionary product that would later become the Wii. Iwata subsequently assigned Takeda to the project, [...] "telling [...] to go off the tech roadmap." [...] The overall premise was that [...] "a Mom has to like it." [...] During the console's development process Iwata challenged engineers to make the Wii no thicker than three DVD cases stacked together, a feat they ultimately accomplished. Takeda and his team focused on reducing power consumption while retaining or improving levels of performance shown with the GameCube. Alongside the internal hardware designed by Nintendo's engineers, Iwata proposed that the console abandon use of a typical controller to make gaming more accessible to everyone. Miyamoto took the lead on developing a new controller while Takeda's team provided the internal components. After six months and dozens of scrapped prototypes, Takeda procured a <b>CMOS</b> <b>sensor</b> that later became the core aspect of the remote. With the addition of accelerometers, they were able to effectively produce motion controls.|$|E

The advantage of this method is that the image sensor can continue to gather photons during the acquisition process, thus effectively increasing sensitivity.

5000|$|According to the TV program, the {{demonstration}} of imaging an object in a complete darkness was fabricated. The demonstration was performed by comparing the SMPD and the existing <b>CMOS</b> <b>sensors</b> (camera). Their images were compared as the light was dimmed down to a darkness. During {{the demonstration}}, only the SMPD was able to show the image in darkness, while the <b>CMOS</b> <b>sensors</b> could not. The demonstration looked successful; however, later {{it turned out that}} the testing condition was not identical to both cases. Here is the explanation. An object emits both visible lights and infra-red waves. Under darkness, an object emits only infra-red waves. Typical <b>CMOS</b> <b>sensors</b> can detect both visible lights and infra-red waves. However, when they detect both visible and infra-red waves, the images become less identical to what humans see with their eyes. Thus, typically the <b>CMOS</b> <b>sensors</b> has a filter that block infra-red (IR) waves. Thus, the <b>CMOS</b> <b>sensors</b> could not detect anything in the darkness during the demonstration. On the other hand, the SMPD sensor did not have an IR filter, and thus was able to 'see' the images in the darkness. When the TV program put an IR filter in front of the SMPD sensor, the SMPD sensor image disappeared. [...] Thus, the demonstration in the darkness showed the outcome of the existence of an IR filter, instead of the true performance of the SMPD sensor. The performance comparison under the identical environment was never demonstrated since then. This experiment is a main evidence to support the technical fraud by the SMPD technology.|$|R
