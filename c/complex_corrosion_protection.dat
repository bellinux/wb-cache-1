40|$|The {{choice of}} <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> system {{depends on the}} {{environment}} and needed lifetime for the product. The right <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> should be selected in a sustainable point of view, since a well-selected coating system can reduce the environmental and economical impact, by using less and better material. The systems used for classifying <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> often give a passed/not passed result for the number of years it is expected to last in a specific corrosive environment. In the last decades, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has become a popular method for evaluating <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> for organic coatings. EIS can collect quantitative data by monitoring the coatings electrochemical behavior over time, which can be used for optimizing the coating system. The purpose of this thesis was to try to predict how different combinations of coating layers and substrates will perform as a <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection,</b> which could provide information that can optimize the coating process. In this thesis, EIS {{has been used as a}} test method to evaluate organic coating systems for <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection,</b> by looking at barrier properties and adhesion for powder coatings on aluminum substrates. The main part of the coatings were applied in the coating plant at Fagerhult AB, but an external supplier has been used as a reference. The powders used in the coating process were based on polyester resins and the substrates were different aluminum alloys. The EIS measurements were performed in the chemistry lab at the School of Engineering at J√∂nk√∂ping University and depending on the sample setup was each sample evaluated for two or four weeks of testing. Two groups of samples had intact coatings and a third group had samples with an applied defect in the coating. The analysis of sample setups with intact coatings showed that the topcoat absorbed water faster than the primer. The samples showed no significant degradation in <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> for the evaluated period and could thereby not provide enough information to be able to conclude which setup give the best <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> over time. The samples with a defect in the coating indicated that two of the substrates provided similar adhesion in the coating-substrate interface. The coating from the external supplier was also included in the test and it showed the best adhesion of the tested samples. The main conclusion is that the coating system used at Fagerhult AB provides a very good <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection.</b> Longer testing time with EIS measurements on intact coatings is needed to be able to rank the different sample setups by failure of <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|R

Both coatings with and without artificial defects showed completely different <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> performance when immersed in 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution. Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to investigate the corresponding coatings' failure process. The results of these tests expound that the barrier property played the dominant role for the <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> of the intact coatings, while the wet adhesion is the decisive factor when a large defect exists in the coating surface. The effect of wet adhesion in <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> was further investigated through the thinner intact coatings.

40|$|The surface morphology, {{electrochemical}} characteristics, {{and salt}} spray corrosion performance were studied for cerium-based conversion coatings (CeCCs) that were post-treated in heated aqueous solutions of orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and polyphosphate compounds.

40|$|Metal spray {{coatings}} {{are ever}} more recognised {{as a possible}} superior means of <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> in many environments. Extended service life combined {{with little or no}} maintenance provides interesting opportunities for both environmentalists and corrosion engineers. Although many successful applications of <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> using thermal spray coatings have been reported, both in atmosphere as in immersion service, new applications remain limited. The complexity of the coating buildup and the number of parameters that may greatly affect the resulting <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> continues to confuse possible users.

Particularly, concerning the <b>corrosion</b> <b>protection</b> behaviour, the use of both traditional and modem electrochemical tools can provide important information in this respect.
