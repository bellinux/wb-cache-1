5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{only two}} Catholic churches existed in Moscow: the Saint Louis des Français <b>church</b> <b>for</b> the French {{population}} and the St. Peter and Paul <b>church</b> <b>for</b> the Polish parishioners. As the congregation for the Polish church had increased to around 30,000 members, the existing buildings were too small. Following the submission of a petition to the Governor-General of Moscow, the local council voted for a new church in 1894. Construction of a new church was permitted with several conditions, including two pertinent to the building site: the structure was to be built away from the old city centre, and was not to be located in the vicinity of any Orthodox sacred sites.|$|E

5|$|Tregelles {{explained}} {{the origin of}} the Arabic inscription, on which Cyril's statement appears to rest, by remarking that the text of the New Testament in the manuscript begins with Matthew 25:6, this lesson (Matthew 25:1-13) being that appointed by the Greek <b>Church</b> <b>for</b> the festival of St. Thecla.|$|E
5|$|After his death, the WCG reiterated {{its full}} {{acceptance}} of the doctrinal changes implemented by Tkach and published an apology to current and {{former members of the}} <b>church</b> <b>for</b> the impact previous doctrines had had on members. As evidence that Tkach's work was instrumental in the move toward mainstream Christianity, the WCG was accepted into the membership of the National Association of Evangelicals within two years of his death.|$|E
5|$|Ecclesiastical {{heraldry}} {{refers to}} the use of heraldry within the Christian <b>Church</b> <b>for</b> dioceses and Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical heraldry evolved as a system for identifying people and dioceses. It is most formalized within the Catholic Church, where most bishops, including the Pope, have a personal coat of arms. Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches follow similar customs, as do institutions such as schools and dioceses.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{enjoyed a}} good {{relationship}} with Pope Clement V, despite the King's repeated intervention in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English <b>Church</b> <b>for</b> his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and concern for their own protection.|$|E
5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, she told them {{that she was going}} to {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's parents did not hear from her that evening, they first thought that she had stayed at the <b>church</b> <b>for</b> midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department to report their daughter missing.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{was long}} remembered favourably in the Western <b>church</b> <b>for</b> his reputed feat in {{recovering}} the True Cross, {{which had been}} captured by the Persians. As Heraclius approached the capital, Khosrau fled from his favourite residence, Dastagird near Baghdad, without offering resistance. Meanwhile, some of the Persian grandees freed Khosrau's eldest son Kavadh II, who had been imprisoned by his father, and proclaimed him King {{on the night of}} 23–24 February, 628. Kavadh however was mortally ill and was anxious that Heraclius should protect his infant son Ardeshir. So, as a goodwill gesture, he sent the True Cross with a negotiator to sue for peace in 628.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Leigh was {{originally}} the centre of a large ecclesiastical parish covering six vills or townships. When the three townships of Pennington, Westleigh and Bedford merged in 1875 forming the Leigh Local Board District, Leigh became the official name for the town although it had been applied {{to the area of}} Pennington and Westleigh around the parish <b>church</b> <b>for</b> many centuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, {{the church}} was rebuilt with a west tower, 3-bay nave and south porch, in squared and coursed lias with red brick and Hamstone dressings. The attempt at total {{rebuilding}} ended in failure to collect enough money, despite donations from William Pitt the Younger and Admiral Hood, and a <b>church</b> <b>for</b> the community was built instead {{at the foot of}} the hill (Burrowbridge) in 1838. In the mid 20th century the ruin on Burrow Mump underwent some repairs to the north west corner.|$|E

The US Coast Guard Pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour. As production moved back to Mexico, Broccoli became ill, leading to Michael G.

5|$|In September 1932 Nash married Irene Roles in Launceston, with City and Tasmania team mate Ted Pickett {{acting as}} best man. Due to the strict sectarianism of the 1930s, {{there was some}} {{controversy}} as Irene was a Protestant from one of Launceston's establishment families, and the wedding was held in a Protestant <b>church.</b> <b>For</b> years afterwards, Nash was subjected to a campaign by Catholic clergy to hold a Catholic wedding ceremony to legitimise his marriage but refused.|$|E
5|$|In the 1800s–1900s, the Lutheran State Church {{supported}} the Swedish government by opposing both emigration and preachers' efforts recommending sobriety. This escalated {{to a point}} where its ministers even were persecuted by the <b>church</b> <b>for</b> preaching sobriety, and the reactions of many congregation members to that contributed to an inspiration to leave the country (which however was against the law until 1840).|$|E
