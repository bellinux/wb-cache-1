5000|$|<b>Craniotome</b> [...] is a genus {{of plants}} in the mint family (Lamiaceae), first {{described}} in 1825. It contains only one known species, <b>Craniotome</b> furcata, native to Sichuan, Tibet, Yunnan, Sikkim, Bhutan, Himalayas of northern + eastern India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, and Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|A <b>craniotome</b> is a {{tool for}} {{drilling}} simple burr holes (trepanation) or for creating larger openings in the skull (craniotomy). The trepanation tool is generally equipped with a clutch which automatically disengages once it touches softer tissue, thus preventing tears in the dura. For larger openings the <b>craniotome</b> is a surgical instrument that has replaced manually pulled saw wires in craniotomies from the 1980s on. Its working tool tip consists of a spiral blade that is framed by a guard device with an angled cranium guide that rests against the inner layer of the skull bone. The dura guard pushes the dura mater downward while the <b>craniotome</b> is moved forward thus preventing dural tearing.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>craniotome</b> was {{designed}} and created by John H. Bent, a mechanical engineer and owner of Standard Pneumatic Motor Company, under contract with Hall Air Instruments of Santa Barbara, California. When Hall was subsequently acquired by 3M Company (which was then actively developing and marketing surgical instruments), the 3M <b>Craniotome</b> became widely used in neurosurgery, replacing the Gigli saw (manually pulled saw wires) as the primary means of opening the skull {{for access to the}} brain for surgical procedures. Bent designed the original <b>Craniotome</b> around a small, lightweight, very high speed (approximately 70,000 rpm) pneumatic turbine motor he had invented for use in industrial wire-wrapping tools and other air-powered hand-held devices.|$|E
50|$|High-speed <b>craniotomes</b> usually run at 40,000 to 80,000 rpm {{and have}} greatly {{facilitated}} intracranial approaches in neurosurgery. They are also employed to temporarily remove the vertebral arch in laminotomy.|$|R
40|$|Until one {{century ago}} the natural wonder of {{spontaneous}} childbirth was {{the turning point}} in a woman's chances of surviving her pregnancy. When obstructed labor occurred the midwife or surgeon had nothing to offer but patience, blessing and fundal expression, and their frustation was compensated by skillful use of <b>craniotomes</b> in case the mother was alive. At present childbirth is still appreciated as an intriguing and fascinating event, {{but it is not}} considered anymore in the perspective of maternal life and death. This is caused to a large extent by the development of techniques to effectively assist in or bypass vaginal delivery, which became in general use {{in the course of the}} twentieth century...|$|R
50|$|Souttar applied his {{mathematical}} {{background and}} his engineering skills to his surgery. He {{had his own}} workshop where he designed and made many surgical instruments, {{with the aim of}} improving existing operative procedures. His inventions included: a flanged tube to overcome obstructions in the gullet, a steam cautery to sterilize and clean breaking-down tumours and ulcers on the skin, and a <b>craniotome</b> to open the skull in brain operations.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{find out}} the sexual {{variations}} in cranial suture closure. Materials and methods: After reflecting the scalp, coronal, sagittal and lambdoid sutures were studied applying five point scale ectocranially. For endocranial suture closure, same score system was applied after removing the calvaria by <b>craniotome.</b> Lambdoid suture was studied in-situ. Photographs were taken in all cases. Results: When comparison between males and female subjects were made, closure was earlier in females (Mean 6. 97 vs. 4. 94 in case of endo cranial suture closure & 5. 42 vs. 2. 66 in case of ecto cranial suture closure). Conclusion: In the present study we conclude that suture closure contributes to sex determination. Our analyses strengthen {{that there is a}} very close association between suture closure and sex...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oils from the aerial parts of ten wild growing <b>Craniotome</b> furcata (Link.) O. Kuntze {{of the family}} Lamiaceae collected from different locations in Uttarakhand, India, was analyzed by capillary GC and GC/MS. The oils were rich in sesquiterpenoids. The cluster analysis showed the presence of four groups. Group-I was significantly rich in δ-elemene and germacrene D while group-II had germacrene D in abundant quantity. α-Bisabolol oxide A, α-cadinol and germacrene D- 4 -ol were major constituents of group-III. Group-IV showed the presence of α-muurolol and germacrene D as major constituents. Germacrene D {{was found to be}} present in all the samples of C. furcata collected from different locations and was positively correlated with the altitude of the collection regions. Chemical variation in the volatiles was statistically correlated with altitude and soil properties. ...|$|E
40|$|Craniosynostoses are {{recognized}} {{as a group of}} birth defects that impair the skull structures by early closure of one or more sutures, causing an abnormal cranial shape. Among the "simple" craniosynostoses, (a single closed suture) the most common is scaphocephaly. The 3 D CT scan is the most relevant and rapid diagnostic test. The authors present the personal experience of 98 scaphocephaly cases diagnosed and surgically treated in the Neurosurgical Department of "Bagdasar-Arseni" Emergency Hospital during a period of 10 years (2000 – 2009). The procedure of choice was the Stein & Schut (1977) extensive craniotomy that removes the early closed suture. There were no post-operatory death cases and no abnormally closed sutures. The routine use of the <b>craniotome</b> facilitates the lateral osteotomy that allows a normal brain growth and a normal symmetrical skull shape development. The authors advocate for early surgery during the first 6 months of life...|$|E
