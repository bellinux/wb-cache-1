500|$|Jeffrey [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Beck, a star {{investment}} banker {{at the time}} with Drexel Burnham Lambert, {{was one of the}} film's technical advisers and has a cameo appearance in the film as the man speaking at the meeting discussing the breakup of Bluestar. Kenneth Lipper, {{investment banker}} and former deputy mayor of New York for Finance and Economic Development, was also hired as <b>chief</b> <b>technical</b> <b>adviser.</b> At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique. For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be [...] "morally bankrupt". Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the trading floor, the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, and the kinds of extras that should be seated at the annual shareholders meeting where Gekko delivers his [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone agreed with Lipper's criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot {{on the floor of the}} New York Stock Exchange during trading hours. Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Fifth Population and Housing Census of Sudan", of Sudan as a whole, was {{conducted}} in April 2008. However the census results of Southern Sudan were rejected by Southern Sudanese officials as reportedly [...] "the central bureau of statistics in Khartoum refused to share the national Sudan census raw data with southern Sudan centre for census, statistic and evaluation." [...] The census showed the Southern Sudan population to be 8.26 million, however President Kiir had [...] "suspected figures were being deflated in some regions and inflated in others, and that made the final tally 'unacceptable'." [...] He also claimed the Southern Sudanese population to really be one-third of Sudan, while the census showed it to be only 22%. Many Southern Sudanese were also said to not have been counted [...] "due to bad weather, poor communication and transport networks, and some areas were unreachable, while many Southern Sudanese remained in exile in neighbouring countries, leading to 'unacceptable results', according to southern Sudanese authorities."
