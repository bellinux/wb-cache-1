The first is Germany, where since early 2006 Minister of Interior Affairs Wolfgang Schäuble has repeatedly warned against the danger posed by German converts to Islam (e. g., Schmid 2007). Recently, after two German Muslims were caught collecting chemicals used to make explosives, the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>Union</b> (CDU) faction's leader Wolfgang Bosbach and its Bavarian Interior Minister Günther Beckstein suggested the government register and follow all who have converted to Islam (Küchen 2007).

Pagal atliktą interviu su Seimo nariais, Lietuvos krikščionių demokratų partijos pirmininku ir politikos mokslų dėstytojais bandoma aptarti pagrindines krikščioniškosios demokratijos problemų priežastis. Straipsnio pabaigoje pateikiamos galimos krikščioniškosios pakraipos partijų ateities perspektyvos. We {{can name}} three Christian {{democratic}} ideology parties on Lithuania political scene: Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania, <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>Union</b> and Modern <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Modern <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> seceded from the matrix (parent) party of Lithuanian <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> in 2000. Analyzing the Christian democracy process in post- communistic Lithuania {{it is important}} to state that {{it is one of the}} trends under a tradition which is difficult to assign to right or left economic frames. The <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> parties were named leftist because they contradicted the liberals and they aspired to limit the economic capital influence on politics in the XXth century. After few decades the main opponents of the right parties were socialists and the policy contemptuous human rights. The experience of politic democracy accumulated in the period of Lithuania between the two wars was a relevant factor in for mation of the contemporary system of political parties. In 1989 restored the Party of Lithuanian <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> became unambiguous reforms orientated and was classified as a right party. Experience of democracy of the party in inwar Lithuania was also a meaningful factor which formed the modernist party system. The <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> Party of Lithuania (Lietuvos krikscionių demokratų partija, LKDP) - 16 seats – was founded in 1905 and re-established in 1989 likewise the Homeland <b>Union</b> the <b>Christian</b> <b>democrats</b> are right of centre. Prior to the 1996 elections the party had agreed to form a coalition with the conservatives (even though it stands closer to the social democrats of the LSDP regarding economic issues). Some time in 1994 the <b>Christian</b> <b>democrats</b> were very popular - exactly when the Homeland Union became more radical. Lithuanian Christian democracy can be proud of its past experience and its successful activity after reestablishing the independence...|$|R

50|$|On {{economic}} issues, <b>Christian</b> <b>democrats</b> {{normally do}} not completely oppose capitalism {{as an economic}} system, unlike their repudiation of atheistic communism and similar ideologies, though they do see the economy as being {{at the service of}} humanity. The duty of the state towards society is of real importance for <b>Christian</b> <b>democrats,</b> though some would see this duty as being mostly to create the conditions for civil society to flourish, while others would see it as a more direct duty of the state towards citizens. In recent decades, some right-leaning Christian democratic parties in Europe have adopted policies consistent with an economically liberal point of view but still support a regulated economy with a welfare state, while by contrast other <b>Christian</b> <b>democrats</b> at times seem to hold views similar to Christian socialism, or the economic system of distributism. The promotion of the Christian Democratic concepts of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity {{led to the creation of}} corporatist welfare states throughout the world that continue to exist to this day. In keeping with the Christian Democratic concept of the cultural mandate, Christian justice is viewed as demanding that the welfare of all people must be protected because every human being has dignity, being made in the image of God. In many countries, <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> organized labor <b>unions</b> that competed with Communist and social democratic unions, in contrast to conservativisms stance against worker organizations. Standing in solidarity with these labor <b>unions,</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrats</b> have lobbied for Sunday blue laws that guarantee workers, as well as civil servants, a day of rest in line with historic Christian Sabbath principles.|$|R
