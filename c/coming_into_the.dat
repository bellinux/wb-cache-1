5|$|With Ore {{still not}} fully {{recovered}} from his injury and two inexperienced {{players on the}} Georgia side, {{it appeared that the}} teams' passing offenses would have to take up the slack. Virginia Tech's Eddie Royal, with 452receivingyards, led both teams in receiving yardage <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game. Georgia's receiving corps was led by wide receiver Mohammed Massaquoi and tight end Martrez Milner.

5|$|Early Neolithic era began around 5500 BCE {{with the}} arrival from the middle Danube area of people, who kept livestock, {{cultivated}} crops, made pottery and smooth-surface tools.

They formed the first settled rural communities, thus forging the most fundamental civilizational advance.|$|E
5|$|Freshman Sam Richardson {{came into}} the game the starter at quarterback, a role he held since the Cyclones' 53–21 win against the Kansas Jayhawks, which made them bowl eligible. Iowa State's leading rusher <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game was junior running back James White, who amassed 505 rushing yards during the season. One yard behind White with 504 rushing yards was Shontrelle Johnson, another junior running back. In the {{receiving}} game, Iowa State was led by a trio of senior wide receivers, Aaron Horne, Chris Young, and Josh Lenz, who totaled 39, 38, and 31 receptions respectively. Iowa State's offensive line had a few question marks <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game, including at right tackle where sophomore Jacob Gannon had made his first career start in the previous game. In total, Iowa State ranked 80 out of 120 in total offense averaging 364.2 yards per game.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans {{opened fire}} at about 11.45am, {{followed}} by the Russians slightly later.

5|$|Linton Park, {{formerly}} Linton Place or Linton Hall, {{is a large}} 18th-century {{country house}} in Linton, Kent, England. Built by Robert Mann in 1730 to replace an earlier building, the house and estate passed through the ownership of several members of Mann's family before <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Cornwallis family.

5|$|Bond {{proceeds}} to the enclave, {{where he is}} met by Breed, who accepts Bond's cover as a journalist. Bond meets Solomon Adeka and realises that the leader will shortly die of cancer: his mission to kill Adeka is needless. Bond sees supply flights of arms and equipment <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> country, all funded by billionaire Hulbert Linck; the aeroplanes all show the AfriKIN name on the fuselage. When Adeka dies a few days later, Bond tries {{to leave the country}} on one of the supply flights, but is confronted by Breed and Blessing, who both shoot him and leave him to die.|$|E

5|$|<b>Coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 2012 season, SMU {{was widely}} {{expected}} to finish {{third in the}} Conference USA West Division. They exceeded that expectation by finishing second in the C-USA West and earning a bid to the Hawaii Bowl. A year after his season ended due to a foot injury, running back Zach Line was poised to have a breakout year and was expected to win the Conference USA Offensive Player of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game, {{both teams}} had sound offenses and {{were led by}} their {{respective}} running backs, sophomore Ka'Deem Carey for Arizona and senior Stefphon Jefferson for Nevada, who ranked number one and number two respectively in total rushing yards during the regular season. Arizona and Nevada ranked third and fourth respectively in total offense. Both teams' defenses were ranked towards the bottom of college football. Consequently, the game was widely expected to be high-scoring.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{race from}} Monaco two weeks earlier, Lucas di Grassi (Audi Sport ABT) {{was leading the}} {{championship}} with 93 points, four ahead of his compatriot Nelson Piquet, Jr. (NEXTEV TCR). Another six points adrift, third placed Sébastien Buemi (e.dams Renault) was the only driver who scored two victories {{over the course of}} the season, but less consistent outings prevented him from placing higher up in the standings. In the teams' championship, e.dams Renault on 160 points had a 45-point lead over Audi Sport ABT.|$|E

In the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton led with 302 points, 66 ahead of Sebastian Vettel and 73 ahead of his teammate, Nico Rosberg. This meant that Hamilton {{would be able to}} win the title with three races to spare, as long as he gathered nine points more than Vettel and two more than Rosberg at the Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Iowa State was led {{by three}} players who {{achieved}} first team all-conference honors: senior defensive lineman Jake McDonough and senior linebackers Jake Knott and A.J. Klein. Knott recorded over 10 tackles in five games while Klein achieved that feat four times. Iowa State was expected to get both safety Durrell Givens and defensive back Jansen Watson back from injury for the game. The remainder of the Cyclone secondary was rounded out by senior Jeremy Reeves and junior Jacques Washington. <b>Coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game, Iowa State ranked 59th {{in the nation in}} pass defense efficiency and 69th nationally in run defense.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125.

5|$|Evers {{rejoined the}} Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed {{managerial}} duties {{himself for the}} 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs had no experience as a field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of the ninth}} inning on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest player in the league for the year.|$|E

This was the Bulldogs' first {{appearance}} in the Hawaii Bowl. <b>Coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 2012 season, Bulldogs' coach Tim DeRuyter said that his team would challenge for a Mountain West Conference title. After making good on that promise, the Bulldogs attempted to achieve their first bowl victory since the 2007 Humanitarian Bowl. A victory in the Hawaii Bowl would have given Fresno State a 10-win season {{for the first time}} since 2001, when quarterback Derek Carr's older brother David was the Bulldogs' quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Kafka shared time {{at quarterback}} with Persa {{due to his}} {{strained}} hamstring on November 7 against the 4th-ranked, and previously undefeated, Iowa Hawkeyes. Northwestern <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game was a 16-point underdog, but still beat Iowa 17–10 in Northwestern's first win over a nationally ranked top-ten team since they won against Ohio State in 2004. Persa {{had to leave the}} game early to receive X-rays for a hand injury, which forced Kafka to play more than original planned. He finished as Northwestern’s leading passer with 72yards on ten completions.|$|E
