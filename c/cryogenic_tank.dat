50|$|Hydrogen has a {{very low}} {{volumetric}} energy density at ambient conditions, equal to about one-third that of methane. Even when the fuel is stored as liquid hydrogen in a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>tank</b> or in a compressed hydrogen storage tank, the volumetric energy density (megajoules per liter) is small relative to that of gasoline. Hydrogen has three times higher specific energy by mass compared to gasoline (143 MJ/kg versus 46.9 MJ/kg).
