40|$|A {{real-time}} unwanted-audio cancellation {{system is}} developed. The system enhances recorded sound by canceling unwanted loudspeaker sounds picked {{up during the}} recording. After cancellation, the resulting sound gives an improved estimation of the live performer’s sound. The cancellation works by estimating the unwanted audio signal and subtracting it from the recorded signal. The canceller is composed of a delay block and two adaptive digital filters. Our work extends conventional echo-cancellation methods to address problems we encountered in music applications. We describe a realtime implementation in Aura and present experimental results in which the proposed canceller enhances {{the performance of a}} real-time pitch detector.

The quadratic Zeeman shift has been measured yielding [delta][nju] = 1296. 8 +/- 3. 3 Hz/G^{ 2 } for magnetically insensitive sublevels (5 S 1 / 2, F = 2,mF = 0 -> 5 S 1 / 2, F = 3,mF = 0) of ^{ 85 }Rb by compensating the magnetic eld and cancelling the ac Stark shift.

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) adaptive self-interference cancellation system (RFAICS) is extensively used {{to suppress}} the self-interference of radios operating in the same platform, such as military command vehicles, airplanes and navy vessels. RFAICS is generally consisted of couplers, attenuators, delay units, amplifiers, and filters and so on. However, RFAICS usually suffers severely from the imperfect attenuators. This paper firstly explores the RFAICS operation process in theory, and then thoroughly investigates and analyzes {{the negative effects of}} non-ideal attenuators on performance of RFAICS. The closed-form expressions fully describing the influences of attenuation bias and response-time respectively on the interference <b>cancellation</b> <b>ratio</b> (ICR) and system convergence time (SCT) are developed with this aim. Simulations are provided for the validity of the limitation analysis and obtained expressions. Results of simulations are in agreement with theoretical analysis, which is significant for component configuration in taking RFAICS into practice...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a general}} {{framework}} for the adaptive feedforward cancellation of higher order intermodulation distortion (IMD) products is presented. By generating only second-order and principal-odd-order IMD reference products in the RF/analog domain and reproducing higher order IMD reference products at digital baseband, the proposed reference distortion scheme minimizes the analog hardware burden on the system. Inherent in this procedure is an approximation that the profile of blocking signals causing IMD is dominated by one very large blocker. The limitations imposed by this approximation are quantitatively examined and shown to permit <b>cancellation</b> <b>ratios</b> of nearly {{the square of the}} ratio between the dominant and nondominant blocking signal RMS amplitudes. An experimental receiver employing the proposed technique was constructed utilizing a wide-swing low-noise transconductance amplifier in order to accommodate a rail-to-rail (+ 12. 4 dBm) out-of-band blocker and a - 16. 3 -dBm nondominant blocker. The measured receiver out-of-band 1 -dB desensitization point is + 12. 5 dBm and the peak uncorrected two-tone third-order intermodulation intercept point (IIP 3) is + 33. 5 dBm. Utilizing the proposed IMD cancellation scheme {{in the presence of a}} modulated dominant blocker improves the total input-referred IMD error power by over 24 dB, resulting in an extrapolated IIP 3 metric of + 43. 5 dBm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this letter, {{we present}} a {{weighted}} linear parallel interference canceller (LPIC) where the multiple access interference (MAI) estimate in a stage is weighted by a factor before cancellation on Rayleigh fading and diversity channels. We obtain exact expressions for the average signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at {{the output of the}} cancellation stages which we maximize to obtain the optimum weights for different stages. We also obtain closed-form expressions for the optimum weights for the different stages. We show that this SIR-optimized weighted LPIC scheme clearly outperforms both the matched filter (MF) detector as well as the conventional LPIC (where the weight is taken to be unity for all stages), in both near-far as well as nonnear-far conditions on Rayleigh fading and diversity channels.

40|$|International audienceNon-linear Ultrasound imaging {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for enhancing the visualization of the accumulation of micro-bubble contrast agents. The goal {{of this study is}} to apply this approach to adipose tissue, a tissue type with a high non-linear coefficient, in order to enhance the visibility of visceral adipose tissue depots using ultrasound. The technique used in this study was pulse subtraction. This technique, implemented on an Ultrasonix RP 500 scanner with a 5 MHz centre frequency probe, is based on taking a single pulse Bb-mode image, then constructing a virtual image for a two pulse b-mode image, then subtracting this virtual image from an actual two-pulse b-mode image. The imaging parameters were first optimized using both oil-based, and aqueous gel phantoms. The parameters were tested ex vivo using a section of pork belly, then the protocol was used in vivo to image the retroperitoneal fat depot on a healthy wistar rat. The ratio of cancellation for each pixel was then calculated and mapped. It was found that tissues with higher non-linear coefficients had a lower <b>cancellation</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCoherent Sidelobe Cancellation (CSLC) is a coherent processing technique {{that has the}} potential of reducing noise jamming through the antenna side lobes. Present CSLCs have the capability of reducing the noise jamming by 25 to 35 dB. The maximum number of side lobe jammers that can be handled by a CSLC is equal to the number of auxiliary antennas. The performance of CSLC is governed by nonlinear stochastic differential equations that are not solvable by analytic means. Therefore this thesis employs simulation techniques to solve these equations. The CSLC becomes saturated as the number of jammers in different directions exceeds the number of loops. Jammer multipath adds an additional degree of freedom for each multipath signal that has a direction different than that of the main jammer. The objective of this thesis was to determine the effect that these multipath or hot clutter signals have on a CSLC. It was found that hot clutter produced substantial degradations on single, double and triple CSLCs. The effect was most pronounced for single cancellers where multipath with a magnitude of 1 % of the jamming signal reduced the <b>cancellation</b> <b>ratio</b> by 18 dB. Comparable numbers for double and triple cancellers were 11 dB. Major, Turkish Air ForceLieutenant Junior Grade, Turkish Nav...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, two {{effective}} linearization {{schemes for}} radio-frequency receivers are introduced. The {{first of these}} comprises a mixed-signal feedforward path which regenerates third-order intermodulation (IM 3) products at radio frequencies, downconverts these products, digitizes them, and then uses them to cancel corruptive IM 3 products in the digital baseband portion of a nominally linear receiver path. The combined implemented receiver represents a SAW-less direct-conversion receiver for UMTS FDD Region 1 that achieves an uncorrected out-of-band IIP 3 of - 7. 1 dBm under worst-case blocking specifications. Under IM 3 equalization, the receiver achieves an effective IIP 3 of + 5. 3 dBm and meets the UMTS BER sensitivity requirements with 3. 7 dB of margin. To enable this mixed-signal feedforward path, a multistage cubic term generator is introduced which uses cascaded nonlinear operations to generate reference IM 3 products. The multistage nature of this circuit is considered {{in the context of}} the aforementioned linearization scheme and is shown to provide sufficient dynamic range for nearly complete IM 3 cancellation while dissipating far less power than the original receiver front end. In particular, the effect of the group delay between stages is analyzed and shown to permit large IM 3 <b>cancellation</b> <b>ratios</b> for interstage group delays less than 1 ns. Expanding upon the first effective linearization approach led to the development of a large signal handling receiver with an out-of-band 1 -dB desensitization point of + 12. 5 dBm. Enabling this large signal handling capability is a passive mixer downconverter preceded by a novel wide-swing LNTA. With a stacked push-pull class-AB common-gate architecture, the LNTA reduces the magnitude of input-referred distortion by up to 40 dB beyond that predicted by an initial slope-of- 3 characteristic while at the same time minimally impacting the effective small-signal gain of the receiver. To compensate for intermodulation distortion terms of order greater than 3, IM 3 and IM 2 products are processed down to digital baseband where they are successively multiplied to generate approximations to higher-order terms. In the case of a + 12. 4 dBm QPSK-modulated signal and a - 16. 3 dBm CW blocker, cancellation improves receiver input-referred error by over 24 dB, resulting in an extrapolated IIP 3 of + 43. 5 dBm...|$|R

Let c denote {{the product of the}} Tamagawa numbers of A/K, and let A(K) tors denote the finite torsion {{subgroup}} of A(K). The quotient c/|A(K) tors | is a factor appearing in the leading term of the L-function of A/K in the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. We investigate in this article possible <b>cancellations</b> in this <b>ratio.</b> Precise results are obtained for elliptic curves over Q or quadratic extensions K/Q, and for abelian surfaces A/Q.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} variations in two dimensions of a paper-and-pencil cancellation task on task performance by participants with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a clinically referred non-ADHD group, and non-referred controls. A total of 84 participants took part, 28 in each group. Each participant completed one of {{two versions of the}} task (a) Grid or (b) Letter. The Grid stimuli were squares divided into nine smaller squares, one of which was filled in black. Participants were presented with pages printed with 400 grids each. Grids with the lower right square filled in were identified as targets (60 per page) and others distractors. Participants were instructed to cancel all grids with the black square in the same place as the target. Similarly. in the Letter version, the letter 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 was the target and 2 ̆ 2 M 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 H 2 ̆ 2. and 2 ̆ 2 E 2 ̆ 2 distractors. Each version of the task was presented to each participant in 2 formats, one a structured Row by Column (RC) format, the other a staggered or Pseudorandom (PR) format. Dependent measures included errors (omissions and commissions), correct <b>cancellations,</b> and a <b>ratio</b> of correct and error scores. ^ Results indicated the performance of participants with ADHD differed significantly from that of their counterparts on total errors (TE) and accuracy ratio (AR), but not on total correct (TC). In general, performance by all participants was superior on the Letter version and the RC format, older participants performed better than younger, and the TE measure appeared to be most useful for distinguishing among groups. ^ It is concluded that cancellation task is potentially viable as an ecologically valid tool for assessment of ADHD, but requires further refinement and evaluation. Implications for current practice and future research are discussed. It is suggested that revisions including use of the Letter version only, more extensive 2 ̆ 2 randomization 2 ̆ 2 of the PR materials, collapsing results across the two formats, and changes in task administration procedures would improve the task. ...|$|R
