5000|$|In {{all cases}} of {{kidnapping}} of children, {{where it is}} alleged that a child has been kidnapped, it {{is the absence of}} the consent of that child which is material. This is the case regardless of the age of the child. A very small child will not have the understanding or intelligence to consent. This means that absence of consent will be a necessary inference from the age of the child. It is a question of fact for the jury whether an older child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to consent. Lord Brandon said: [...] "I should not expect a jury to find at all frequently that a child under fourteen had sufficient understanding and intelligence to give its consent." [...] If the child (being capable of doing so) did consent to being taken or carried away, the fact that the person having <b>custody</b> or care <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of that child did not consent to that child being taken or carried away is immaterial. If, on the other hand, the child did not consent, the consent of the person having <b>custody</b> or care <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of the child may support a defence of lawful excuse. It is known as Gillick competence.|$|R

The first group of essays offers a comparative analysis of the paradigm shift occurring in post-divorce child law away from notions of <b>custody,</b> care <b>and</b> <b>control</b> to that based on “parental responsibility” in diverse jurisdictions such as England, Hong Kong, New Zealand, China and Europe. In the second section, essays focus on the procedural framework within which disputes relating to parenting and care of children post-divorce may be resolved, with particular focus on the development of specialized children’s dispute resolution procedures in various jurisdictions. The final essays highlight the progressive work of the Hong Kong Judiciary in introducing many procedural reforms in family law and children’s dispute resolution (with many involving a greater use of ADR processes), but also lament the lack of legislative reform in family justice. Volume 1 concludes by focusing on the need for greater empirical research and collection of data to allow for better evidence-based and informed policy making in family justice and child law reform in Hong Kong...|$|R

40|$|Relitigation of <b>custody,</b> visitation, <b>and</b> {{child support}} during {{a two-year period}} {{was used as a}} measure of postdivorce adjustment. A sample of highly {{adversarial}} families (n = 58) referred for a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation as part of a contested divorce custody or visitation action was compared to control samples of mother custody (n = 43), father custody (n = 30), <b>and</b> joint <b>custody</b> (n = 54) families in which custody was not contested. Nineteen percent of adversarial families evaluated predivorce relitigated custody, a significantly higher rate than control families. Mother custody cases had a higher rate of relitigation over child support than did father or joint custody arrangements. Joint custody controls had approxi-mately the same rate of relitigation of custody as did father <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> mother <b>custody</b> <b>controls.</b> A sample of families referred for evaluation of a postdivorce custody or visitation dispute (n = 46) had a higher rate of relitigation of problems regarding visitation than did a control sample of postdivorce families (n = 36). Possible explanations for these findings are discussed. Although there is a considerable litera-ture dealing with the conduct of <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> visitation evaluations that arise out of contested divorces, there has been relatively little study of the long-term outcomes of contested <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> vis-itation cases.

Granville, the United States Supreme Court stated that [...] "the {{interest}} of parents in the care, <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of their children--is perhaps {{the oldest of the}} fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court." [...] The Supreme Court also made it clear that this fundamental right is implicated in grandparent visitation cases. The plurality opinion stated at the outset that statutes allowing grandparent visitation orders to be imposed over parental objection [...] "present questions of constitutional import." [...] The Supreme Court declared that a parent's fundamental right to the [...] "care, <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> of their children" [...] was [...] "at issue in this case."

500|$|Project E {{was used}} more widely {{to refer to}} similar {{arrangements}} for providing nuclear weapons the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). NATO began integrating tactical nuclear weapons into its war plans in 1954, and the BAOR adopted a doctrine under which {{they would be the}} dominant arm on the battlefield as NATO forces conducted a fighting withdrawal to the Rhine River. In 1954, the British Army purchased 113 Corporal missiles from the United States. It was intended that they would be equipped with British warheads under a project codenamed Violet Vision, but Project E offered a quicker, simpler and cheaper alternative. Weapons were made available under the same terms as those of the RAF: US <b>custody</b> <b>and</b> dual <b>control.</b> The 47th Guided Weapons Regiment, Royal Artillery, was formed in 1957 and moved to Dortmund, Germany, in 1958. The Mark 7 warheads had to be drawn from US Army storage sites in southern Germany until arrangements were made for local storage in August 1959. The 27th Guided Weapons Regiment, Royal Artillery, which had been re-equipped with the Corporal in 1957, joined the 47th at Dortmund [...] in 1961. The 47th Regiment gave up its Corporals in 1965, and returned to the UK, and the 27th followed in 1967.|$|R
