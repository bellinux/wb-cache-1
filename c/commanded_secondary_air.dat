The heat transfer coefficients were changed along the combustor height. Numerical simulation was continued to determine the pressure profiles and temperature profiles in the hot combustor model. The pressure change at the bottom is greater than that of the top region because of a large amount of primary air input.

Their {{performance}} is reported in terms of flame temperature and length, in order to ascertain the best ratio between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>air,</b> and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumption. To find the best ratio between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>air,</b> the length and temperature of the flame were recorded {{for each of the three}} burners, examined by varying the inlet sections of the primary <b>air</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>air.</b> The data on temperature and the flame length of each burner were processed using multiple regression analysis. The LPG consumption was determined with one of the burners using 10 different pressures in combination with three nozzles. The data obtained were subjected to non-linear regression using two gaseous outflow models. The various combinations of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> inlet sections affected the values of the flame length and temperature. In general, the best combinations of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> inlet for flame temperature did not correspond to those for flame length. However, this experiment showed that the inlet of <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> is critical for the performance of this type of burner, in terms of flame temperature.
