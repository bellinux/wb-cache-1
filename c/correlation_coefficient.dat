25|$|Rank {{correlation}} coefficients, such as Spearman's rank <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> and Kendall's rank <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (τ) {{measure the}} extent to which, as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase, without requiring that increase to be represented by a linear relationship. If, as the one variable increases, the other decreases, the rank correlation coefficients will be negative. It is common to regard these rank correlation coefficients as alternatives to Pearson's coefficient, used either {{to reduce the amount}} of calculation or to make the coefficient less sensitive to non-normality in distributions. However, this view has little mathematical basis, as rank correlation coefficients measure a different type of relationship than the Pearson product-moment <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and are best seen as measures of a different type of association, rather than as alternative measure of the population <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient.</b>|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{hesitant}} fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) {{is a new}} {{and flexible}} tool in representing hesitant qualitative information in decision making. Correlation measures and <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> have been applied widely in many research domains and practical fields. This paper focuses on the correlation measures and <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of HFLTSs. To start the investigation, the definition of HFLTS is improved {{and the concept of}} hesitant fuzzy linguistic element (HFLE) is introduced. Motivated by the idea of traditional <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets and hesitant fuzzy sets, several different types of <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> for HFLTSs are proposed. The prominent properties of these <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> are then investigated. In addition, considering that different HFLEs may have different weights, the weighted <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and ordered weighted <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> are further investigated. Finally, an application example concerning the traditional Chinese medical diagnosis is given to illustrate the applicability and validation of the proposed <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of HFLTSs in the process of qualitative decision making.

25|$|The {{information}} {{given by}} a <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{is not enough to}} define the dependence structure between random variables. The <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> completely defines the dependence structure only in very particular cases, for example when the distribution is a multivariate normal distribution. (See diagram above.) In the case of elliptical distributions it characterizes the (hyper-)ellipses of equal density; however, it does not completely characterize the dependence structure (for example, a multivariate t-distribution's degrees of freedom determine the level of tail dependence).|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of non-parametric statistics {{as opposed to the}} parametric statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman's rank <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson product-moment <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.|$|E

40|$|In Modern Portfolio Theory, the <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{decide the}} risk of a set of stocks in the portfolio. So, to {{understand}} the <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> between returns of stocks, is a challenge but is very important for the portfolio management. Usually, the stocks with small <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> or even negative <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> are preferred. One can calculate the <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of stock returns based on the historical stock data. However, in order to control {{the risk of}} portfolio, we need to well predict the <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of stock returns in the early future. In this thesis, different stock return models, such as Historical Model, Constant Correlation Model, Multi-Group Model, Single-Index model, and Multi-Index Model are studied. For Single-Index Model and Multi-Index Model, the beta parameter adjustment techniques, Blume's technique and Vasicek's technique are applied. We randomly select a sample of 100 stocks from S&P 500 index, and study the historical data from 07 / 01 / 1992 to 07 / 01 / 2012. The data are separated to four periods, five years in each period. We use the data from 07 / 01 / 1992 to 07 / 01 / 2002 to predict the <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and compare with the real <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the period form 07 / 01 / 2002 to 07 / 01 / 2007; and use the data from 07 / 01 / 1997 to 07 / 01 / 2007 to compare the prediction of <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> with the real <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the period from 07 / 01 / 2007 to 07 / 01 / 2012.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purposes}} of this research were to study the relationship between some factors and critical thinking abilities, and to express the description in the variance of <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> from research documents related to critical thinking abilities. 71 samples of experimental and correlation research documents that were published in 1992 – 2009 were synthesized.

25|$|The {{image on}} the right shows scatter plots of Anscombe's quartet, a set of four {{different}} pairs of variables created by Francis Anscombe. The four y variables have the same mean (7.5), variance (4.12), correlation (0.816) and regression line (y=3+0.5x). However, {{as can be seen}} on the plots, the distribution of the variables is very different. The first one (top left) seems to be distributed normally, and corresponds to what one would expect when considering two variables correlated and following the assumption of normality. The second one (top right) is not distributed normally; while an obvious relationship between the two variables can be observed, it is not linear. In this case the Pearson <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> does not indicate that there is an exact functional relationship: only the extent to which that relationship can be approximated by a linear relationship. In the third case (bottom left), the linear relationship is perfect, except for one outlier which exerts enough influence to lower the <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> from 1 to 0.816. Finally, the fourth example (bottom right) shows another example when one outlier is enough to produce a high <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> even though {{the relationship between the two}} variables is not linear.|$|E
25|$|These {{examples}} {{indicate that}} the <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> as a summary statistic, cannot replace visual examination of the data.

25|$|In case of {{a single}} regressor, fitted by least squares, R2 is {{the square of the}} Pearson {{product-moment}} <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> relating the regressor and the response variable.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{definitions}} of R2 {{that are only}} sometimes equivalent. One class of such cases includes that of simple linear regression where r2 is used instead of R2. When an intercept is included, then r2 is simply {{the square of the}} sample <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (i.e., r) between the observed outcomes and the observed predictor values. If additional regressors are included, R2 is the square of the coefficient of multiple correlation. In both such cases, the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 to 1.|$|E
30|$|This study investigates {{quantitative}} methods for assessment of infrared analysis of concrete admixtures using <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> by performing IR scans following the ASTM C 494 /C 494 M- 11 specifications. In {{order to achieve}} this goal, numerous IR scans were performed on specimens supplied by the manufacturer from different batches to ensure uniformity and equivalency. These scans were then analyzed to create <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> for each admixture. The <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> were used to quantitatively evaluate and interpret IR Scans of job samples. The study focused on 23 most commonly used concrete admixtures by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). They include air-entrainers, accelerators, retarders, water reducers, and other combinations of these admixtures. Their <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> were established by analyzing a total of 12 scans of each admixture from three different batches supplied by the manufacturer at different time intervals. In order to validate the obtained <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and establish a target correlation, job samples were tested and compared to the obtained correlations. The study also evaluated the effects of drying time and using different types of KBr on <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficients.</b>|$|R

These measures are essentially equivalent to the Gini for a single prediction point with DeltaP' = Informedness = 2AUC-1, whilst DeltaP = Markedness represents the dual (viz. predicting the prediction from the real class) and their geometric mean is the Matthews <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient.</b>|$|E

Pearson developed the Pearson product-moment <b>correlation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> defined as a product-moment, the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things.
