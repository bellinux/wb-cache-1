40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fiscal {{structure of a}} community as an equilibrium of a non-cooperative game where members of different pressure groups - characterised by conflicting interests - compete to get distributive gains. Their interaction is regulated by a constitution which sets the electoral rules and the institutional framework in which pressure groups' activities take place. We focus on how the equilibrium mix of direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> is determined in a community {{divided into two groups}} working in different sectors which we label regular and shadow sectors, respectively. Our main aim is to investigate the relations between the relative scale of the shadow sector, the fiscal equilibrium between direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation,</b> <b>and</b> the constitutional setting. In this respect we show that the constitutional settings in which the main legislative body is chosen through a strictly proportional electoral rule tend to determine a fiscal equilibrium with a greater emphasis on direct taxation and this in turn gives greater incentives to enlarge the shadow sector. The paper provides empirical evidence on 21 OECD countries for the period 1970 - 90 on the relevance of the features of the electoral mechanisms on the fiscal mix between direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Proceeding {{from the}} changes in direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> {{in the process of}} the EU tax system reform and the fact that new trends bring about vital social changes, the {{research}} in this area could add to the understanding of economic development of these countries. In the EU with its decentralized tax policy, changes in direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> are permanently implemented in the process of tax system reform. Harmonization of direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> in the EU is conducted by means of the adopted community law regulations. In the harmonization of direct taxation there is a tendency towards an increase of the level of fiscal coordination and elimination of barriers to the common market. Thus direct taxation reforms are limited to achieving higher level of coordination and preventing evasion and double taxation. The current policy {{is the result of the}} principle according to which fiscal competition has positive effects on reducing consumption and on the EU economic development. In the harmonization process the systems of <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> are aligned particularly with excise duty and value added tax. Fiscal strategies in the reform process are mostly aimed at fiscal coordination, modernization, informative cooperation, evasion reduction and elimination of malpractices in fulfilling a VAT payment liability. Within the excise tax system minimal excise rates are determined and an environmentally-friendly policy is pursued. The main priorities of taxation changes within the harmonization process are in respect of evasion reduction and irrational fiscal competition on the EU market. A study of direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> changes in the process of the tax system reform is highly significant both from the aspect of efficient tax-system functioning, which results in achieving EU macroeconomic goals, and from the aspect of single states' interests in the process of transition and accession...|$|R

40|$|Through this study, {{we try to}} {{evaluate}} the effects that the direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> <b>and</b> the subsidies provided by the Government have on income inequality. We use Gini coefficient {{as a measure of}} inequality and use annual data for Indian economy for years 1982 - 2015 and employ an ARDL-based bounds test approach for testing co-integration. We ascertain the stationarity properties for all the series, separately using the ADF test, the DF-GLS test and the KPSS test. We estimate the long-run and short-run coefficients and find that a long-run negative relationship exists between Gini coefficient and subsidy-related expenditure. The long-run coefficients of direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> terms are positive but are significant only at 10 %. The short-run coefficients obtained from ECM show that a negative relationship exists between expenditure on subsidies and Gini coefficient. In short run, direct tax seems to have an insignificant positive coefficient while indirect tax seems to have a significant unbalancing effect. We employ the Granger causality tests to confirm direction of causality and find that there runs a unidirectional causality from direct tax, <b>indirect</b> tax <b>and</b> subsidy to Gini coefficient, while any causality from Gini to any series is largely insignificant. The results imply that the government should use the calculated hybrid of tools like direct <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> <b>and</b> subsidies to have an equalizing impact on the economy. Moreover, the significant causal relationship from subsidies to Gini opens up an opportunity for the government to improve the income distribution using targeted subsidies, for example the Aadhaar-linked Direct Transfer Benefits etc...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the long-term effects}} on output of different fiscal policies in Portugal {{in the context of}} unrestricted VAR models that include several public spending and taxation variables. Empirical results suggest that the effects of fiscal policies are within the Keynesian paradigm for public transfers, public consumption, public investment and direct taxation, with public investment showing particularly strong positive effects and direct taxation showing particularly strong negative effects. In turn, non-Keynesian effects dominate in the case of public wages where cuts are expansionary <b>and</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation</b> where raises are neutral. Accordingly, cuts in public wages <b>and</b> raises in <b>indirect</b> <b>taxations</b> are the two most desirable instruments for fiscal consolidation in Portugal. Finally, deficit-neutral policies that offset raises in public transfers, public consumption, and public investment, with raises in indirect taxes have long-term positive effects on output. The same is true for cuts in direct taxation offset with cuts in all forms of public spending except for public investment. policy, budgetary restraint, fiscal consolidation...|$|R
