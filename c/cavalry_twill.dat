50|$|Twills can {{be divided}} into even-sided and warp-faced. Even-sided twills include foulard or surah, herringbone, houndstooth, serge, sharkskin, and twill flannel. Warp-faced twills include <b>cavalry</b> <b>twill,</b> chino, covert, denim, drill, fancy twill, gabardine, and lining twill.|$|E
50|$|The fabric {{whipcord}} is {{a strong}} worsted or cotton fabric made of hard-twisted yarns with a diagonal cord or rib. The weave used for whipcord is a steep-angled twill, essentially the same weave as a <b>cavalry</b> <b>twill</b> or a steep gabardine. However, the ribs of whipcord are usually more pronounced than in either of those fabrics, and the weft (filling) may be visible between the ribs on the right side, which is usually {{not the case for}} gabardines. In practice, marketing considerations, rather than technical details, determine when the specific term whipcord is used.|$|E
5000|$|A vinyl roof in <b>cavalry</b> <b>twill</b> {{pattern was}} optional, but {{examples}} without the vinyl roof were rare. One {{reason for the}} rarity of the plain-roofed version {{is the fact that}} the roof was made in two pieces and required extra preparation at the factory to conceal the seam; consequently, its availability was not widely advertised. Other options included the aforementioned leather interior, air conditioning, further power adjustments for the front seats, a variety of radios and 8-track tape players, tinted glass, and power locks. A limited slip differential could be ordered, as could anti-lock brakes, called [...] "Sure Trak". Cruise control was also an option. Finally, an automatic headlamp dimmer that dimmed the headlights for oncoming cars without driver intervention was available. Full instrumentation could be ordered.|$|E
