5|$|As {{the trial}} against Ayala begins, his {{pregnant}} wife Helena (Zeta-Jones) learns of her husband's true profession from his associate, Arnie Metzger (Quaid). Facing the prospect of life imprisonment for her husband and death threats against her only child, Helena decides to hire Francisco Flores to assassinate Eduardo Ruiz; she knows killing Ruiz will effectively end the trial nolle prosequi. Flores plants a <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> on a DEA car in an assassination attempt against Ruiz. Shortly after planting the bomb, Flores is assassinated by a sniper in retaliation for his cooperation with General Salazar. The <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> meant to kill Ruiz instead kills Agent Castro, but Gordon and Ruiz survive.|$|E
5|$|In the movie, Greene kills Shondor Birns by detonating a bomb on his car. In reality, {{even though}} Birns {{was killed by}} a <b>car</b> <b>bomb,</b> there was no {{evidence}} to link Greene to his murder. Even though it is commonly speculated that Greene killed Birns, his murder remains officially unsolved.|$|E
50|$|The Iraqi insurgency. An {{estimated}} 578 <b>car</b> <b>bombs</b> were detonated in Iraq between June 2003 and June 2006. <b>Car</b> <b>bombs</b> {{continue to}} be commonly used.|$|R
50|$|Mass-casualty <b>car</b> <b>bombing,</b> and {{especially}} suicide <b>car</b> <b>bombing,</b> {{is currently a}} predominantly Middle Eastern phenomenon. The tactic was first introduced to the region by the Stern Gang, who used it extensively against Palestinian and British military targets; it was subsequently taken up by Palestinian bombers as well. The tactic was widely used in the Lebanese Civil War by the Islamic fundamentalist group Hezbollah. A notable suicide <b>car</b> <b>bombing</b> was the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, when two simultaneous attacks killed 241 U.S. Marines and 58 French military personnel. The perpetrator of these attacks has never been positively confirmed. In the Lebanese Civil War, an estimated 3,641 <b>car</b> <b>bombs</b> were detonated.|$|R
50|$|The bombing {{came near}} {{the date of}} the one year anniversary of the 2011-2012 Syrian uprising. There had already been two bombings in Damascus and one in Aleppo. Another Aleppo <b>car</b> <b>bombing</b> came the next day, {{followed}} by a <b>car</b> <b>bombing</b> in Daraa.|$|R
5|$|Greene {{wants to}} open his own restaurant, and asks Shondor Birns to help him. Birns {{arranges}} a $70,000 loan from the Gambinos, but Birns' courier buys cocaine with the money and gets arrested. Birns and Greene argue over which of them should pay back the money; when Greene refuses to pay, Birns hires a hitman to kill him. Greene narrowly escapes, and later kills Birns with a <b>car</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 5 October 2010, a <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> {{exploded}} {{outside a}} branch of the Ulster Bank on Culmore Road in Derry. Two police officers were slightly injured in the blast, which also damaged a hotel and other businesses. Several telephone warnings were received an hour prior to the blast allowing police to cordon off the area. The RIRA later claimed responsibility in a telephone call to the Derry Journal.|$|E
5|$|The Animals in War Memorial {{was opened}} at the {{northeast}} edge of Park Lane in 2004 by Anne, Princess Royal. It commemorates animals that served in wars, and alongside servicemen. In June 2007, a <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> was successfully defused in an underground car park on Park Lane. The road was closed {{for most of the}} day for police investigation.|$|E
5000|$|The Newry <b>car</b> <b>bombing</b> {{is taken}} as {{evidence}} that [...] "hardline Republicans" [...] continue {{to have the ability}} to carry out terror attacks in Northern Ireland, although they no longer have the operational strength to do so in Britain itself. [...] The Newry <b>car</b> <b>bombing</b> was one of several cross-border attacks into Northern Ireland in 2009-10. [...] Others included a <b>car</b> <b>bombing</b> of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. [...] There are fears that the terrorists will be able to use these [...] "successful" [...] bombings to recruit.|$|R

5|$|In 1998, modern Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{asks his}} {{colleague}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{for help with}} a case the Group have not authorized; he remains cryptic as to what it is. They travel to Germany to investigate {{the murder of a}} Dr. Schlossburg, whose lab is found to house a mummified body. The two are arrested by German police, but when the police realize they have apprehended fellow investigators they promise cooperation. However, the pair learn that Schlossburg has already been cremated; later they narrowly escape death when their rental car has been rigged with a <b>car</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|In mid-2006, the {{organisation}} declared a ceasefire, and conversations between Batasuna, ETA and the Basque and Spanish governments started. Peace talks ended in December, when ETA broke the truce {{with a massive}} <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> at the Madrid-Barajas Airport. ETA officially ended the ceasefire in 2007 and resumed its attacks around Spain. At the same time, dozens of members were arrested by Spanish and French police. Despite that, {{the organisation}} did not lose the capacity of carrying out attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} the first time ETA had killed in Majorca, one of the Spanish regions less {{targeted}} by ETA. On August 18, 1977, a bomb was deactivated next to a seafront walk. On July 31, 1991, two people were injured after two bombs went off in Palma. Two months later, a <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> was defused in Palma's main beach. In the summer of 1995, Spanish authorities dismantled a cell of ETA ready to shoot king Juan Carlos I. In 2005, the organisation attempted the magnicide once more in Majorca.|$|E

5|$|At 9:42a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{grounded}} all civilian aircraft {{within the}} continental U.S., and civilian aircraft already in flight {{were told to}} land immediately. All international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico, and were banned from landing on United States territory for three days. The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers. Among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day, {{one of the most}} prevalent said a <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> had been detonated at the U.S. State Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C. Another jet—Delta Air Lines Flight 1989—was suspected of having been hijacked, but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Ranko Marijan, the Justice Minister {{in a new}} government, criticised his {{predecessors}} and the police for their failure to pursue the case, but the authorities failed to protect Levar, who was murdered by <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> on 30 August 2000. The investigation of the killings in Gospić was a contributing factor in the criticism of the government's efforts by seven active duty and five retired Croatian generals who issued the Twelve Generals' Letter making their grievance public. That led to sacking of the seven active duty officers, including by President Stjepan Mesić. The group included Norac, who had held the rank of major general since September 1995.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Washington, D.C., Scully attends a performance hearing, after {{which she is}} transferred. Mulder is devastated to lose his partner. The two are about to share a kiss when Scully is stung by a bee which had lodged itself under her shirt collar, and she quickly loses consciousness. Mulder calls paramedics, but {{the driver of the}} ambulance shoots Mulder and whisks Scully away. Mulder, not severely injured, slips out of hospital with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner. He then meets a former adversary, the Well-Manicured Man, who gives him Scully's location, along with a vaccine against the virus that has infected her. As Mulder leaves, the Well-Manicured Man kills himself in a <b>car</b> <b>bomb,</b> before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered.|$|E

5|$|After {{the border}} reopened, the British {{government}} reduced the {{military presence in}} Gibraltar by closing the naval dockyard. The RAF presence was also downgraded; although the airport officially remains an RAF base, military aircraft are no longer permanently stationed there. The British garrison, which had been present since 1704, was withdrawn in 1990 following defence cutbacks {{at the end of}} the Cold War. A number of military units continue to be stationed in Gibraltar under the auspices of British Forces Gibraltar; the garrison was replaced with locally recruited units of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, while a Royal Navy presence is continued through the Gibraltar Squadron, responsible for overseeing the security of Gibraltar's territorial waters. In March 1988 a British military operation against members of the Provisional IRA (PIRA) planning a <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> attack in Gibraltar ended in controversy when the Special Air Service shot and killed all three PIRA members.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as mayor, Galván {{received}} death threats from organized crime. Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.SMexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route {{where most of the}} cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled through. In May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the headless corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a written message reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters and local officials are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's parking area, injuring several bystanders. On February 2013, the Nuevo Laredo police chief Roberto Alejandro Balmori Garza was kidnapped and his two brothers were found dead. He had been appointed by Galván as head of the police in 2011 following the murder of Manuel Farfán Carriola, the former police chief of Nuevo Laredo.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootings, the {{soldiers}} donned berets to identify themselves. Gibraltar Police officers, including Inspector Revagliatte and his men, began {{to arrive at}} the scene almost immediately. At 16:05, only 25 minutes after assuming control, the SAS commander handed control of the operation back to the Gibraltar Police in a document stating:A military assault force completed the military option in respect of the terrorist ASU in Gibraltar and returns control to the civil power. Shortly after the shootings, soldiers and police officers evacuated buildings {{in the vicinity of the}} Convent, while bomb-disposal experts got to work; four hours later, the authorities announced that a <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> had been defused, after which Savage's white Renault was towed from the car park by an army truck. The SAS personnel, meanwhile, left Gibraltar on a Royal Air Force aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In the 1998 {{feature film}} The X-Files, when Scully is {{infected}} with the black oil and taken to Antarctica, it is the Well-Manicured Man who, having grown disillusioned with the Syndicate, gives Mulder the coordinates needed to find her and {{a sample of the}} vaccine needed to cure Scully. The colonists had kept secret a secondary characteristic of the black oil—that those infected with it for prolonged periods would gestate a new colonist lifeform, killing the host. Upon discovering this, the Syndicate vowed to work more closely with the colonists in the hope of being spared this fate, while only the Well-Manicured Man wished to continue working on a vaccination for resistance. This rejection led to his betrayal of the Syndicate, and to him committing suicide by <b>car</b> <b>bomb</b> before his duplicity was discovered.|$|E
5|$|The 89th Military Police Brigade {{deployed}} for {{a second}} tour in August 2006 to the Iraqi theater of operation in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 2006–2008. During the deployment, it was composed of over 5,000 military police soldiers in the theater. Brigade responsibilities included corrections and security operations. It deployed K-9 units during some operations. The brigade's primary responsibility, though, was the training of Iraqi police units. The brigade focused on local police units throughout the country, as another MP brigade handled the national police. The brigade commander would brief US Department of Defense officials in The Pentagon on the current situation, live from Iraq. It suffered several casualties, including a soldier killed by sniper fire, a soldier killed by a suicide <b>car</b> <b>bomb,</b> and two soldiers who died of non-combat related causes. The brigade returned home in October 2007, replaced again by the 18th Military Police Brigade. After this, the brigade resumed its policing roles at Fort Hood.|$|E
5|$|The {{award was}} given posthumously on three occasions: to David Kaplan, an ABC News {{producer}} {{killed by a}} sniper in Sarajevo in 1992; to Paul Klebnikov, a Russian Forbes journalist {{shot to death in}} 2004 by unknown attackers; and to Atwar Bahjat, an Iraqi journalist for Al Arabiya who was abducted and murdered in February 2006. A number of other laureates had been threatened or attacked in the year preceding their award, such as Guatemalan journalist Byron Barrera (1991), whose wife was murdered in an attack on their car, and Željko Kopanja (2000), who lost his legs in a <b>car</b> <b>bomb.</b> Other laureates have been killed after their awards, such as Irish crime reporter Veronica Guerin (1995), awarded a year before her murder, and Palestinian cameraman Mazen Dana (1991), awarded two years before being fatally shot by a US soldier in Iraq. Eritrean journalist Fesshaye Yohannes (2002) died while still imprisoned; owing to conflicting reports and the secrecy of his confinement, the cause and year of his death remain unclear.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Sadr City bombings were {{a series}} of <b>car</b> <b>bombs</b> and mortar attacks in Iraq that {{occurred}} on 23 November at 15:10 Baghdad time (12:10 Greenwich Mean Time) and ended at 15:55 (12:55 UTC).
