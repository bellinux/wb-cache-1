40|$|Abstract- In {{this study}} the {{suitability}} of using <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> made from renewable natural fiber i. e. Non-oven jute felt, which {{is the second most}} widely used natural fiber for manufacturing of plywood was investigated to minimize the gap between demand and supply of wood veneer. The renewable natural hard jute fibre was impregnated with phenolic resin and was used for the manufacture of plywood. Plywood of 4 mm, 6 mm, 12 mm and 18 mm thick were manufactured by using phenolic resin impregnated jute felt having thickness 16 mm of 1850 GSM (approx.) as a core in place of the natural wood veneer. From the study, it can be inferred that PF Resin impregnated Non oven jute felt as a natural fibre can suitably replace the wooden glue <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> to manufacture ply board up to 80 % as an alternative substitute of wood. The physico-mechanical properties such as surface roughness, moisture content, density, water absorption, swelling, compressive strength, tensile strength, static bending strength, glue shear strength, of the plywood manufactured by using jute felt as <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> with different resin dilution have been studied. Data revels that most of the physico-mechanical properties of the plywood showed satisfactory results meeting the requirement of different grades of plywood tested as per IS: 1734 - 1983. The accelerated study of the glued core after impregnation with jute felt have been carried out for three months before plywood manufacture after storing it in proper temperature and humidity. The data revealed that there is no appreciable change in bond quality and mechanical properties of the plyboard manufactured after storing the veneer up to 30 days. The study concluded that wood substituted jute composites could be an ideal solution with ever depleting forest reserves where utilization of renewable resources will be beneficiary for plywood industries to meet the challenges during scarcity of veneer by reducing the cost of imported veneer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{compared}} the translucency of IPS e. max all-ceramic system of A and D color series veneered and glazed at clinically appropriate thicknesses. Core specimens (n = 5) of IPS e. max were produced and veneered with IPS e. max veneering porcelain to final dimensions (13 mm in diameter, 0. 6 mm in thickness for core specimens with a thickness of 0. 3 and 1. 0 mm for core specimens with a thickness of 0. 5 mm). Luminous reflectance was measured three times each specimen with a calibrated spectrophotometer after veneering and again after glazing cycle. Contrast ratios (CR=Yb/Yw) were measured from the luminous reflectance (Y) of the tested specimens {{with a black}} (Yb) and a white background (Yw). There {{was no significant difference}} in contrast ratios of specimens within the same color series before and after glazing (P> 0. 05). Significant difference was found in the contrast ratios of specimens of the same color but different thickness before and after glazing (P < 0. 05). The specimens with a thickness of 1. 0 mm presents significantly higher contrast ratios than specimens of the same color with a thickness of 0. 6 mm before and after glazing. The contrast ratios of glazed specimens were significantly lower than nonglazed ones. The Contrast ratio increases as the thickness of the <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> materials increase, while luminosity and chroma are not related to relative translucency. The glazing cycle results in decreased opacity for <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> materials...|$|E
30|$|The rolling shear {{strength}} of plywood was evaluated using a flexural vibration test. Test specimens were lauan and Douglas fir three-ply plywoods made from thick veneers. The dynamic shear and Young's moduli were determined using the flexural vibration method, which involved in-plane and out-of-plane flexural vibration. The rolling {{shear strength}} was determined using the static destructive method, which {{is dependent on}} the direction of the lathe check in the <b>core</b> <b>veneer.</b> Before and after accelerated aging treatments were conducted, there were relations between out-of-plane dynamic properties (out-of-plane shear and Young's moduli) and its rolling shear strength. It was concluded that the rolling shear strength is related not only to the shear property of the core but the flexural stiffness of two faces when the deformation of out-of-plane plywood was not restrained.|$|E

40|$|The {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion of <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> porcelains for all ceramic crowns must be compatible to prevent formation of stresses during the firing cycles. The {{purpose of this}} study was to use a thermal shock test to evaluate the crazing resistance of six all-ceramic crown systems. The systems tested were: Vita In-Ceream®, Vita Hi-Ceram®, Dicor™ veneered with Vitadur® N, magnesia <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with Ceramco® II, magnesia <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with Silhouette™, and magnesia <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with Vita VMK® 68. A maxillary central incisor was prepared with 1. 0 mm axial and 1. 5 mm incisal reduction. Refractory dies were prepared and crowns were fabricated using the manufactures recommendations. Six specimens of each system were placed inside a beaker in a furnace at 90 °C. After 15 min heat soak, ice water was poured into the beaker through a funnel. The samples were dried in air, reheated, and inspected for crazing using light microscopy. If crazing was observed, this would constitute a failure at a temperature difference (ΔT) of 90 °C. If no failure occurred, the test was repeated at increasing temperature increments of 10 °C until failure. The crazing resistance of each system, expressed as the mean ΔT, was: > 200 (Hi-Ceram®), 152 ± 19 (Dicor™ / Vitadur® N), 143 ± 5 (magnesia core/Vita VMK® 68), 122 ± 21 (magnesia core/Silhouette™), and 118 ± 10 (magnesia core/Ceramco® II) °C. All systems tested resisted crazing due to quenching in ice cold water from 100 °C. Systems with lower coefficients of expansion showed significantly greater resistance to thermal shock using ANOVA. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze and to compare the {{fracture}} type and the stress at failure of clinically fractured zirconia-based all ceramic restorations with that of morphologically similar replicas tested in a laboratory setup. Methods: Replicas of the same shape and dimensions were made for 19 crowns and 17 fixed partial dentures, all made of veneered zirconia frameworks, which fractured during intra-oral service. The replicas were statically loaded by applying axial load in a universal testing machine. The principles of fractography were used to identify the location and the dimensions of the critical crack and to estimate the stress at failure. Failure was classified according to origin and type (P < 0. 05 was considered significant). Results: Clinically fractured restorations failed due to either: delamination of the veneer ceramic (28. 2 ± 9 MPa), defects at <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> interface (27. 7 ± 6 MPa), the generation of Hoop stresses (884. 3 ± 266 MPa), radial cracking (831 MPa), or fracture of the connector (971 ± 343 MPa). The replicas failed by mainly by cone cracking of the veneer ceramic (52. 4 ± 34. 8 MPa) or by fracture of the connector (1098. 9 ± 259 MPa). The estimated stress at failure was significantly higher for the replicas compared to the clinically fractured restorations (F = 6. 8, P < 0. 01). Significance: Within limitations of this study, careful design of fracture strength test would lead to more clinically relevant data. The performance of zirconia veneered restorations could be further improved with careful design considerations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The bond {{strength}} of zirconia veneer {{has been considered}} a weak link in the layered all-ceramic restoration. In a previous study, this bond was improved using a new category of veneering ceramics adopting the pressing technique; however, the resulting esthetic quality lacked the individual characterization built using the layering technique. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of combining both press-on and layering veneer ceramics in one restoration on the {{bond strength}} with zirconia frameworks. Materials and Methods: Zirconia discs (19. 4 mm in diameter, 3 -mm thick) were veneered with 3 -mm thick press-on veneer ceramic or veneered with 1 -mm thick press-on veneer ceramic and an additional 2 -mm thick of layering veneer ceramic. Two commercial layering veneer ceramics were tested. The specimens were sectioned into microbars, and the zirconia veneer microtensile bond strength (MTBS) was measured in a universal testing machine. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{was used to examine}} <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> interface quality and to assess failure type. Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDAX) was used to analyze the chemical structure of the tested veneer ceramics, which may affect the structural integrity of the double veneered restoration. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey HSD post hoc tests were selected to analyze the data (p < 0. 05 was significant). Results: The MTBS of zirconia and press-on ceramic (34. 4 ± 2. 9 MPa) was not affected by the addition of a second layer of either veneer ceramic. SEM analysis revealed defect-free zirconia press-on veneer interface, while the interface between the press-on and the layering veneer ceramics demonstrated a different crystal structure and glass matrix, which did not affect wetting and contact between the two materials. EDAX analysis revealed differences, which account for the observed structural differences, in the chemical composition between the tested veneers. Conclusion: The double veneer technique combines the high bond strength and superior interface quality achieved using press-on ceramics with the superior esthetics and individual characterization obtained using layering ceramics. The technique promises superior function and performance of the double veneered restoration...|$|E

A biaxial flexure test was conducted on five groups of specimens (Dicor castable ceramic, Vitadur N dentinal porcelain, Dicor Plus dentinal porcelain, Dicor <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with Vitadur N and Dicor <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with Dicor Plus castable ceramic). Each group consisted of 10 disks of nearly identical dimensions with a 1. 98 0. 04 mm thickness and 15. 7 0. 35 mm in diameter. Statistical analysis {{indicated that there was}} neither significant difference (p > 0. 05) between mean flexural strength of Dicor Plus and Vitadur N ceramic or Vitadur N and Dicor/Vitadur N ceramic specimens. The mean flexural strength of Dicor/Vitadur N specimens was significantly lower than the mean flexural strength of Dicor ceramic specimens. Conversely, {{there was no significant difference}} between mean flexural strength of Dicor ceramic and Dicor/Dicor Plus ceramic specimens. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) examinations of Dicor/Dicor Plus ceramic specimens suggested better wetting of Dicor core by Dicor Plus ceramic with lower incidence of porosity at the interface. However, Dicor/Vitadur N ceramic specimens exhibited a higher incidence of porosity at the interface. This indicated that lamination of Dicor castable ceramic material with feldspathic porcelain for esthetics could be attained without sacrificing strength of the original material, provided that appropriate veneering material was selected.

25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the <b>core</b> <b>veneers.</b> The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|R

In groups one to four, Vita <b>Core</b> and <b>Veneer,</b> Vita <b>Core</b> and Ivoclar <b>Veneer,</b> Ivoclar <b>Core</b> and Vita <b>Veneer,</b> and Ivoclar <b>Core</b> and <b>Veneer</b> were used respectively. Afterwards, the samples were put under the static force in the Universal Test machine (UTM) with the speed of 0 / 5 mm per minute to bring about fracture. The type of fracture was determined by electronic microscope. Schmitz-Schulmeyer Test was applied to evaluate the shear bond strength of core-veneer. In order to analyze the data, Two-Way ANOVA and logestic regression were carried out using SPSS 19 (α= 0. 05). Results: The rate of shear bond strength for groups one to four were 10. 85  2. 67, 10. 35  3. 30, 10. 35  3. 30 and 6. 72  2. 47 mega pascal respectively. The type of core had no effects on shear bond strength (P= 0. 869), but the veneer kind was important in the rate of shear bond strength (P= 0. 027). The Vita veneer showed a higher level of shear bond strength. After the microscopic evaluation, samples showed a combination of the cohesive fracture at the veneer layer and mixed (cohesive, adhesive) fracture {{at the edge of the}} two layers; No adhesive fracture between the zirconia <b>cores</b> and <b>veneers</b> was observed.

The importance of different abutment materials was also evaluated. Materials and methods: Eighty cores, 40 in a fully-sintered zirconia material and 40 in a pre-sintered zirconia material were made. Twenty cores of each material were made with a core of even thickness shape (ES) and 20 were made with a core with anatomical shape (AS). The cores were divided into subgroups and veneered with one of two different veneering ceramics: a porcelain and a glass-ceramic material. In total eight groups of 10 crowns were made. They were all cemented onto abutments made of resin. One extra group of 10 AS, pre-sintered zirconia <b>cores</b> <b>veneered</b> with glass-ceramic were made and cemented onto titanium abutments. All crowns underwent thermocycling and mechanical pre-load and were finally loaded until fracture. Results: AS crowns withstood significantly higher loads than ES crowns (P-value < 0. 001), and crowns with titanium abutments withstood significantly higher loads than crowns supported by abutments made of inlay pattern resin (P-value < 0. 001). Three types of fracture were noted: minor and major fracture of the veneering ceramic, and complete fracture through <b>core</b> and <b>veneer.</b> ES crowns showed significantly more major fractures of the veneering ceramic than AS crowns.

40|$|Layered {{structures}} {{can be used}} {{to address}} the competing needs of systems like dental crown restorations where the exterior needs to be aesthetic and the interior needs to be strong and fatigue resistant. Dental crowns typically have an aesthetic porcelain veneer layered on a strong, fatigue resistant ceramic or metallic core. In current restorations, even when the core is shaped by a computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) or solid-freeform fabrication processes, the veneer is applied in sequential layers. This process is labor intensive, time consuming and may not optimize the long-term performance properties of the veneer layer. If the <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> layers were to be independently fabricated and then joined, their individual and the veneer-core system performance could be optimized.

40|$|Background and Aims: The bond {{strength}} between veneer ceramics and zirconia frameworks is the weakest {{component in the}} layered ceramics. Due to the possible effect of adding pigments to the core materials on the {{bond strength}} between <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> {{as well as the}} introduction of new ceramic materials in dentistry, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the zirconia core-veneer microtensile bond strength using two ceramic veneers with or without coloring the core. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 12 disc-shaped specimens were fabricated using a manually aided design- manually aided manufactured (MAD/MAM) zirconia core (Zirkonzahn). Two veneering ceramics of Ceram Kiss and Zirkonzahn ICE were also used to veneer the specimens. Half of the Zirkonzahn discs were remained white and the others were colored by shade A 2. Then, the discs were cut into microbars (30 for each group) and the microtensile bond strength of the core-veneer was calculated. The specimens were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Student's t-test. Results: Significant differences with respect to veneer layer were found (P< 0. 001). No significant differences were seen among colored and uncolored cores (P= 0. 69).

40|$|Introduction: Badly {{broken or}} {{structurally}} compromised posterior teeth are frequently associated with crown/root fracture. Numerous restorative materials {{have been used}} to fabricate indirect full-coverage restorations for such teeth. This study aims to evaluate and compare the effect of restorative materials on the stress distribution pattern in a mandibular first molar tooth, under varying loading conditions and to compare the stress distribution pattern in five commonly used indirect restorative materials. Materials and Methods: Five three-dimensional finite element models representing a mandibular first molar tooth restored with crowns of gold, porcelain fused to metal, composite (Artglass), alumina-based zirconia (In-Ceram Zirconia [ICZ]), and double-layered zirconia-based materials (zirconia <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with porcelain, Lava) were constructed, using a Finite Element Analysis Software (ANSYS version 10; ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA). Two loading conditions were applied, simulating maximum bite force of 600 N axially and normal masticatory bite force of 225 N axially and nonaxially. Results: Both all-ceramic crowns allowed the least amount of stress distribution to the surrounding tooth structure. In maximum bite force-simulation test, alumina-based all-ceramic crown displayed the highest von Mises stresses (123. 745 MPa). In the masticatory bite force-simulation test, both all-ceramic crowns (122. 503 – 133. 13 MPa) displayed the highest von Mises stresses. Conclusions: ICZ crown displayed the highest peak von Mises stress values under maximum and masticatory bite forces. ICZ and Lava crowns also allowed the least amount of stress distribution to the surrounding tooth structure, which is indicative of a favorable response of the underlying tooth structure to the overlying full-coverage indirect restorative material.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{compared}} {{the reliability and}} fracture patterns of zirconia <b>cores</b> <b>veneered</b> with pressable porcelain submitted to either axial or off-axis sliding contact fatigue. Methods: Forty-two Y-TZP plates (12 mm x 12 mm x 0. 5 mm) veneered with pressable porcelain (12 mm x 12 mm x 1. 2 mm) and adhesively luted to water aged composite resin blocks (12 mm x 12 mm x 4 mm) were stored in water at least 7 days prior to testing. Profiles for step-stress fatigue (ratio 3 : 2 : 1) were determined from single load to fracture tests (n = 3). Fatigue loading was delivered on specimen either on axial (n = 18) or off-axis 30 degrees angulation (n = 18) to simulate posterior tooth cusp inclination creating a 0. 7 mm slide. Single load and fatigue tests utilized a 6. 25 mm diameter WC indenter. Specimens were inspected by means of polarized-light microscope and SEM. Use level probability Weibull curves were plotted with 2 -sided 90 % confidence bounds (CB) and reliability for missions of 50, 000 cycles at 200 N (90 % CB) were calculated. Results: The calculated Weibull Beta was 3. 34 and 2. 47 for axial and off-axis groups, respectively, indicating that fatigue accelerated failure in both loading modes. The reliability data for a mission of 50, 000 cycles at 200 N load with 90 % CB indicates no difference between loading groups. Deep penetrating cone cracks reaching the core-veneer interface were observed in both groups. Partial cones due to the sliding component were observed along with the cone cracking for the off-axis group. No Y-TZP core fractures were observed. Conclusions: Reliability was not significantly different between axial and off-axis mouth-motion fatigued pressed over Y-TZP cores, but incorporation of sliding resulted in more aggressive damage on the veneer.

Fatigue was an acceleration factor for all-ceramic systems, but not for the MCR system. The latter presented significantly higher reliability under mouth-motion cyclic mechanical testing.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} thermal and mechanical fatigue on the shear bond strength of different all-ceramic cores and veneering porcelain interfaces. All-ceramic systems tested were lithium disilicate and zirconia veneered by layering technique. Sixty specimens (n= 20) were subjected to shear bond strength. Ten of them were thermal and mechanical cycled. Fracture analysis was performed with stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis was performed across core/veneer interfaces. Thermal and mechanical cycling did not influence on bond strength. However, there was significant difference among systems (< 0. 01). CoCr group presented the highest values, followed by lithium disilicate, and zirconia. Failure modes were predominantly adhesive for CoCr, cohesive in core for lithium disilicate, and cohesive in veneer for zirconia. Energy dispersive X-ray showed interaction zone for CoCr and lithium disilicate groups and was inconclusive for zirconia. Fatigue had no influence on bond strength of groups tested. The results {{suggest that there is}} a chemical bond between <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> materials for CoCr and lithium disilicate groups...|$|R
40|$|Fractures during {{clinical}} function {{have been}} reported as the major concern associated with all-ceramic dental restorations. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the fracture features of glass-ceramic and zirconia-based restorations fractured during clinical use. Twenty-seven crowns and onlays were supplied by dentists and dental technicians with information about type of cement and time in function, if available. Fourteen lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations and 13 zirconia-based restorations were retrieved and analyzed. Fractographic features were examined using optical microscopy to determine crack initiation and crack propagation of the restorations. The material comprised fractured restorations from one canine, 10 incisors, four premolars, and 11 molars. One crown was not categorized because of difficulty in orientation of the fragments. The results revealed that all <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> fractures initiated in the cervical margin and usually from the approximal area close to the most coronally placed curvature of the margin. Three cases of occlusal chipping were found. The margin of dental all-ceramic single-tooth restorations was the area of fracture origin. The fracture features were similar for zirconia, glass-ceramic, and alumina single-tooth restorations. Design features seem to be of great importance for fracture initiation...|$|R
40|$|To {{fabricate}} high-strength diatomite-based ceramics for dental applications, the layer-by-layer {{technique was}} used to coat diatomite particles with cationic [poly(allylamine hydrochloride) ] and anionic [poly(sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) ] polymers to improve the dispersion and adsorption of positively charged nano-ZrO 2 (zirconia) as a reinforcing agent. The modified diatomite particles had reduced particle size, narrower size distribution, and were well dispersed, with good adsorption of nano-ZrO 2. To determine the optimum addition levels for nano-ZrO 2, ceramics containing 0, 20, 25, 30, and 35 wt% nano-ZrO 2 were sintered and characterized by the three-point bending test and microhardness test. In addition to scanning electron microscopy, propagation phase-contrast synchrotron X-ray microtomography {{was used to}} examine the internal structure of the ceramics. The addition of 30 wt% nano-ZrO 2 resulted in the highest flexural strength and fracture toughness with reduced porosity. Shear bond strength between the <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> of our diatomite ceramics and the most widely used dental ceramics were compared; the shear bond strength value for the diatomite-based ceramics was found to be significantly higher than for other groups (P < 0. 05). Our results show that diatomite-based nanocomposite ceramics are good potential candidates for ceramic-based dental materials...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{reliability}} and longevity of ceramic prostheses {{have become a}} major concern. The existing {{studies have focused on}} some critical issues from clinical perspectives, but more researches are needed to address fundamental sciences and fabrication issues to ensure the longevity and durability of ceramic prostheses. The aim of this paper was to explore how "sensitive" the thermal and mechanical responses, in terms of changes in temperature and thermal residual stress of the bi-layered ceramic systems and crown models will be with respect to the perturbation of the design variables chosen (e. g. layer thickness and heat transfer coefficient) in a quantitative way. Methods: In this study, three bi-layered ceramic models with different geometries are considered: (i) a simple bi-layered plate, (ii) a simple bi-layer triangle, and (iii) an axisymmetric bi-layered crown. Results: The layer thickness and convective heat transfer coefficient (or cooling rate) seem to be more sensitive for the porcelain fused on zirconia substrate models. Significance: The resultant sensitivities indicate a critical importance of the heat transfer coefficient and thickness ratio of <b>core</b> to <b>veneer</b> on the temperature distributions and residual stresses in each model. The findings provide a quantitative basis for assessing the effects of fabrication uncertainties and optimizing the design of ceramic prostheses...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the stress levels {{at the core}} layer and the veneer layer of zirconia crowns (comprising an alternative core design vs. a standard core design) under mechanical/thermal simulation, and subjected simulated models to laboratory mouth-motion fatigue. The dimensions of a mandibular first molar were imported into computer-aided design (CAD) software and a tooth preparation was modeled. A crown was designed using {{the space between the}} original tooth and the prepared tooth. The alternative core presented an additional lingual shoulder that lowered the veneer bulk of the cusps. Finite element analyses {{evaluated the}} residual maximum principal stresses fields at the <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> of both designs under loading and when cooled from 900 degrees C to 25 degrees C. Crowns were fabricated and mouth-motion fatigued, generating master Weibull curves and reliability data. Thermal modeling showed low residual stress fields throughout the bulk of the cusps for both groups. Mechanical simulation depicted a shift in stress levels to the core of the alternative design compared with the standard design. Significantly higher reliability was found for the alternative core. Regardless of the alternative configuration, thermal and mechanical computer simulations showed stress in the alternative core design comparable and higher to that of the standard configuration, respectively. Such a mechanical scenario probably led to the higher reliability of the alternative design under fatigue...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Thermal misfit is {{discussed}} as {{one reason for}} chipping of veneered zirconia restorations. The aim of the investigation {{was to assess the}} effect of thermal misfit on the shear strength of zirconia/veneering ceramic composites. METHODS: Shear strengths of 12 different veneering ceramic/zirconia composites were measured (n= 10). The veneering ceramics were fired onto polished Y-TZP. In order to create a strong thermal mismatch, one of the veneering ceramics was intended for use on alumina and one for the metal-ceramic technique. The glass transition temperatures of the veneering ceramics and the coefficients of thermal expansion of all ceramics were measured (n= 6). Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA and a post hoc Bonferroni test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Shear strength ranged from 21. 9 +/- 6. 2 to 31. 0 +/- 7. 1 MPa. The ceramic for the metal-ceramic technique showed spontaneous debonding. The differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion of <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> (Deltaalpha) were calculated. In addition the differences between glass transition temperatures of the veneering ceramics and room temperature (DeltaT) as the effective temperature range for stress formation were calculated. Highest shear strength was observed when DeltaalphaDeltaT approximately 1000 x 10 (- 6). CONCLUSIONS: Thermal expansion and glass transition temperature of the veneering ceramic {{have an impact on the}} shear strength of veneer/zirconia composites...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} to observe the surface and {{interfacial}} characteristic of Zirconia by surface treatment. And it was observed the roughness and contact angle according to processing, and the interfacial properties by surface treatment on zirconia. Methods: The oxide formation and ion diffusion between <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> ceramic were determined by the X-ray Dot Mapping of EPMA(Electron probe micro analyzer). The roughness was measured by 3 D Digital microscope and the contact angle according to processing of zirconia was observed using distilled water on the surface. Results: The surface roughness of the specimens Z 04, Z 12, Z 15 was measured 0. 67 (0. 03), 0. 50 (0. 12), 0. 35 (0. 09), respectively. As results of contact angle test, Z 04, Z 12, Z 15 of specimen group without binder treatment was measured 46. 79 (3. 17), 57. 47 (4. 83), 56. 19 (2. 66), respectively. but, L 04, L 12, L 15 of specimen group without binder treatment was measured 63. 84 (2. 20), 66. 08 (0. 16), 65. 10 (1. 01), respectively. Average contact angle of L 15 was measured 65. 10 (1. 01). In X-ray Dot Mapping results, thickness of binder including Al element was measured that each of L 04, L 12, L 15 were 20, 15, 10. Conclusion: The more rough surface increases the wettability, but the sintered exclusive binder decreases the wettability...|$|R
40|$|Zirconia restorations {{have been}} used {{successfully}} for years in dentistry owing to their biocompatibility and good mechanical properties. Because of their lack of translucency, zirconia <b>cores</b> are generally <b>veneered</b> with porcelain, which makes restorations weaker due to failure of the adhesion between the two materials. In recent years, all-ceramic zirconia restorations have been introduced in the dental sector {{with the intent to}} solve this problem. Besides the elimination of chipping, the reduced occlusal space requirement seems to be a clear advantage of monolithic zirconia restorations. However, scientific evidence is needed to recommend this relatively new application for clinical use. This mini-review discusses the current scientific literature on monolithic zirconia restorations. The results of in vitro studies suggested that monolithic zirconia may be the best choice for posterior fixed partial dentures in the presence of high occlusal loads and minimal occlusal restoration space. The results should be supported with much more in vitro and particularly in vivo studies to obtain a final conclusion...|$|R
