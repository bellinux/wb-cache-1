Liquid spots left on the wafer surface can cause oxidation that damages components on the wafer. To avoid spotting, an alcohol vapor (IPA) or other organic compound in gas, vapor, or aerosol form is blown through a nozzle over the wet wafer surface (or at the meniscus formed between the <b>cleaning</b> <b>liquid</b> and wafer as the wafer is lifted from an immersion bath), and the subsequent Marangoni effect causes a surface-tension gradient in the liquid allowing gravity more easily to pull the liquid completely off the wafer surface, effectively leaving a dry wafer surface.|$|E

40|$|In {{the milk}} industry, the {{production}} {{must be stopped}} daily in order to clean the process equipment from deposits that are formed at the inside surface when the products are heat treated. This leads reduced production time since no products can be treated when the equipment are being cleaned. The heat treatment of milk products is necessary {{to ensure that the}} product is safe to consume. When heat treating the milk, certain compounds in the milk become unstable and form a deposit called fouling inside the heating equipment. This fouling layer reduces the heat transfer from the heat equipment to the product that is supposed to be heat treated. In order to remove the fouling deposit cleaning with first alkaline and then acidic detergent are used. It can take up to a few hours before the equipment is cleaned depending on the degree of fouling. The aim of this master’s thesis is to develop a laboratory method for measuring cleaning efficiency of UHT fouling by using cleaning detergents at different temperatures and concentrations. The method was created by looking on how a Cleaning-In-Place process is performed and imitates these steps at a laboratory level, by performing experiments on storage, drying, size and separation of fouling. The cleaning method was evaluated according to repeatability and ability to distinguish cleaning effects of the different <b>cleaning</b> <b>liquids.</b> A <b>cleaning</b> method for dissolution of UHT fouling was achieved where it was possible to detect trends of degree of dissolved fouling when different temperature and concentration of <b>cleaning</b> <b>liquids</b> were used in the sodium hydroxide step. The repeatability of the cleaning method was sufficient to be able to detect the cleaning trends. The cleaning effect trials showed that higher temperature and concentration leads to more fouling dissolved. It was also seen that with higher concentration of alkaline detergent a lower temperature could be used to achieve a similar cleaning compared to lower concentration of alkaline detergent...|$|R

40|$|Single-wafer {{cleaning}} {{based on}} megasonic nozzle {{systems can be}} used for removing nano-particles. An optimized cleaning process must deliver a high degree of cleaning uniformity with a minimal amount of structural damage. However, the <b>cleaning</b> <b>liquid</b> is confined to a sonicated liquid jet, which is ejected by the nozzle. As a result, a high degree of complexity is introduced to the cleaning process due to the strong interdependencies between acoustic, electric and hydrodynamic characteristics of such systems. In the present work, the influence of the gas content of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>liquid</b> on the performance of a 1 MHz nozzle system is investigated and related to the intrinsic properties of the water jet. Cleaning tests are performed and the cleaning results are correlated to the electrical responses of the driving transducer. The electrical response depends both on the gasification of the liquid and the occurrence of acoustic reflections. Furthermore, Schlieren- and Sonoluminescence-imaging of the cleaning system are performed. The imaging techniques can identify the impact of bubbles on the propagation of acoustic waves and the resonant excitation of cleaning cavitation throughout the liquid column. ...|$|E

Hypothesis: Reducing particle contaminations on solid and delicate surfaces is of great importance {{in a number of}} industries. A new non-destructive method is proposed, which is based on the laser-induced thermocapillary effect for the removal of micron size particles from surfaces. The cleaning mechanism is related to the surface-tension-driven flows produced by the laser heating of thin layer of a <b>cleaning</b> <b>liquid</b> deposited onto a surface contaminated with particles. Experiments: Focusing the laser irradiation into the line laser beam allowed using this method for a large-scale cleaning of surfaces. Hexadecane was used as a <b>cleaning</b> <b>liquid</b> to remove micron-sized polyethylene, Teflon, talc and Al 2 O 3 particles from surfaces of welding glass, carbolite and soft magnetic disc using the line beam of the IR laser. Findings: A good cleaning efficiency was achieved for cases of polyethylene and Teflon particles on both the complete wettable welding glass and the low-wettable soft magnetic disc, while in case of oleophilic talc and Al 2 O 3 particles the effectiveness of the cleaning method was lower on all three substrates investigated. The thermal influence of the laser irradiation on substrates used was measured with infrared camera. It was shown that temperature in the irradiated area during the long-time heating increases insignificantly and cannot cause any damage of the substrate...|$|E
