25|$|Cryptosporidiosis is a {{parasitic}} disease that is transmitted through contaminated {{food or water}} from an infected person or animal. Cryptosporidiosis in cats is rare, but they can carry the protozoan without showing any signs of illness. Cryptosporidiosis can cause profuse, watery diarrhea with cramping, abdominal pain, and nausea in people. Illness in people is usually self-limiting and lasts only 2–4 days, but can become severe in people with weakened immune systems. <b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> (<b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.)</b> Cats transmit the protozoan through their feces. The symptoms in people weight loss and chronic diarrhea in high-risk patients. More than one species of this genus can be acquired by people. Dogs can also transmit this parasite.|$|E

Fecal samples from a total of 552 calves from 27 dairy herds were collected, along with a questionnaire about management factors. <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> oocysts were detected by light microscopy using Kinyoun staining. Putative risk factors were tested for association using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Oocyst shedding calves were found in 67 % (CI 95 %= 49 – 84) of herds (corresponding to a true herd prevalence of 98 %) and 16 % (CI 95 %= 13 – 19) of calves (corresponding to a true calve prevalence of 8 %). Within-herd prevalence ranged from 0 to 60 %, with a median of 8 %. <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> excretion was not associated with the type of liquid diet, gender, time the calf stayed with the dam after birth, use of antibiotics, blood presence in feces, and calving season. However, important highly significant risk factors of oocyst shedding of calves was an age of less or equal than 20 days (OR= 7. 4; 95 % CI 95 %= 3 – 16; P< 0. 0001) and occurrence of diarrhea (OR= 5. 5; 95 % CI 95 %= 2 – 11; P< 0. 0001).

40|$|<b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> are {{protozoan}} parasites {{that cause}} gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals, and are spread directly by fecal-oral transmission or indirectly by fecal contamination {{of water and}} food supplies. In California, {{there is evidence of}} significant fecal pathogen pollution flowing from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems along the coast. To develop ecosystem monitoring and management strategies, we tested the hypothesis that <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> are detectable in nearshore filter feeding bivalves and in terrestrial storm runoff collected from fecal-impacted coastal ecosystems in California. The goals of this dissertation research were 1) to evaluate innovative detection methods for <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> in bivalve and water samples, 2) to evaluate bivalves such as mussels and clams as bioindicators of fecal contamination with <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> in marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems, and 3) to evaluate farm management solutions to reduce the load of Cryptosporidium discharged into downstream waterways from coastal dairies. First, innovative molecular and immunologic methods were evaluated for detection of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> in marine mussels (Mytilus californianus) and freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea) using tissue spiking and tank exposure experiments. The most analytically sensitive detection method was immunomagnetic separation in combination with immunofluorescent detection of oocysts in mussel digestive tissues. Second, field studies tested 4800 mussels and 600 clams from marine, estuarine, and riverine ecosystems along the California coast forCryptosporidium spp. Genotypes detected in bivalves included the anthropozoonotic C. parvum genotype 2, as well as the host specific C. andersoni and C. felis that are shed by cattle and cats, respectively.

Similarly an increases risk of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp</b> infection was found in calves from smallholder dairy units compared to traditional herds (<. 05). The finding highlights that <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp</b> is prevalent among calves in the area under study. The high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis detected in this study suggests that it may {{have a significant impact on}} livestock industry and that the close interaction between cattle and human may play a role in zoonotic transmission to humans...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and Cystoisospora belli are monoxenic {{protozoa}} {{that have}} been recognized as the causative agents of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, especially HIV-infected subjects. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Tri&# 226;ngulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16. 9 %) of the 59 patients studied, while <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> were present in 10. 1 % (6 / 59) and C. belli in 6. 7 % (4 / 59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD 4 + T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 						 3 					, demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and/or C. belli. Parasitism with <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{explosion}} of descriptions of new species of Cryptosporidium {{during the last two}} decades. This has been accompanied by confusion regarding the criteria for species designation, largely {{because of the lack of}} distinct morphologic differences and strict host specificity among <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> A review of the biologic species concept, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and current practices for Cryptosporidium species designation calls for the establishment of guidelines for naming Cryptosporidium species. All reports of new Cryptosporidium species should include at least four basic components: oocyst morphology, natural host specificity, genetic characterizations, and compliance with the ICZN. Altogether, 13 <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> are currently recognized: C. muris, C. andersoni, C. parvum, C. hominis, C. wrairi, C. felis, and C. cannis in mammals; C. baïleyi, C. meleagridis, and C. galli in birds; C. serpentis and C. saurophilum in reptiles; and C. molnari in fish. With the establishment of a framework for naming Cryptosporidium species and the availability of new taxonomic tools, there should be less confusion associated with the taxonomy of the genus Cryptosporidium. The clarification of Cryptosporidium taxonomy is also useful for understanding the biology of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.,</b> assessing the public health significance of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> in animals and the environment, characterizing transmission dynamics, and tracking infection and contamination sources...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} and zoonotic {{potential of}} <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and Giardia duodenalis isolated from dogs in Chiang Mai, Thailand were determined. Fecal {{samples were collected}} from 109 dogs between July and August 2008. <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> infection was determined by immunofluorescent assay (IFA), PCR assays that amplify Cryptosporidium heat-shock protein 70 kDa (hsp 70), and two PCR assays that amplify a small subunit-ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA). Giardia duodenalis infection was identified using zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation, IFA, and four PCR assays that amplify the Giardia glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), beta-giardin (bg), and generic and dog-specific assays of triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) genes. Overall prevalence of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and G. duodenalis was 31. 2 % and 45. 9 %, respectively. Sequence analysis of 22 Cryptosporidium-positive samples and 21 Giardia-positive samples revealed the presence of C. canis in 15, and C. parvum in 7, G. duodenalis Assemblage C in 8, D in 11, and mixed of C and D in 2 dogs. Dogs in Chiang Mai were commonly exposed to <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and G. duodenalis. Cryptosporidium parvum can be isolated from the feces of dogs, and all G. duodenalis assemblages were dog-specific. Dogs could be a reservoir for a zoonotic Cryptosporidium infection in humans, but further studies {{will be required to}} determine the clinical and zoonotic importance...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether clinical manifestations {{are associated with}} genotypes or subtypes of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.,</b> we studied a 4 -year longitudinal birth cohort of 533 children in Peru. A total of 156 infection episodes were found in 109 children. Data from first infections showed that C. hominis was associated with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, general malaise, and increased oocyst shedding intensity and duration. In contrast, C. parvum, C. meleagridis, C. canis, and C. felis were associated with diarrhea only. C. hominis subtype families were identified (Ia, Ib, Id, and Ie); all were associated with diarrhea. Ib was also associated with nausea, vomiting, and general malaise. All C. parvum specimens belonged to subtype family IIc. Analysis of risk factors did not show associations with specific <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> genotypes or subtypes. These findings strongly suggest that <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and subtypes are linked to different clinical manifestations in children...|$|R
40|$|The apicomplexa {{protozoa}} Cryptosporidium infects several mammals, including terrestrial {{and aquatic}} species. In the epidemiology of this infection, the ingestion of water and/or food contamined with oocysts comprises the main mechanism of transmission to susceptible animals. Among the Sirenians, {{the occurrence of}} this coccidium {{has been reported in}} dugongs (Dugong dugon) and Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus). The present study was conducted with the aim of verifying the occurrence of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> in Amazonian manatee. For this purpose, fecal samples were collected from ten free-ranging Amazonian manatees, two specimens in captivity, and 103 supernatants fecal samples. The samples were processed by the sedimentation method in formol-ether and Kinyoun stain technique for the presence of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp</b> [...] The positive samples were then submitted to Direct Immunoflorescence Test. The results showed 4. 34 % (05 / 115) of positive samples. This is the first report of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> in the Amazonian manatee...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and Giardia spp. are parasites {{and have}} been {{reported}} in many species of mammals, including humans. The goal of this research was to investigate the occurrence of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and Giardia spp. in 45 -days-old pigs. Fecal samples of 107 pigs were collected at three alternate days in piggeries in Araçatuba, São Paulo State, Brazil. Cryptosporidium oocysts were observed in 4. 7 % (5 / 107) of animals by Kinyoun acid-fast stain method and cysts of Giardia spp. were observed in 1. 9 % (2 / 107) of the animals by the method of Faust. Of all animals, 85 presented feces with normal consistency and 22 showed diarrhea in at least one collection. Two diarrheic samples showed positivity for both <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> and Giardia spp. From these results it is possible to infer that the occurrence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia was low because of the good management practices and both protozoa were not associated the presence of symptoms...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> are {{protozoan}} parasites {{that can}} cause significant gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals. <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> are usually host-specific; cats are commonly infected with Cryptosporidium felis, but Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium muris have also been reported (Scorza and Tangtrongsup 2010). The majority of the Cryptosporidium DNA amplified from 14, 469 human faecal samples in the UK was Cryptosporidium hominis (51. 4 per cent) or C parvum (44. 0 per cent) (Elwin and others 2012). However, C felis (38 of 14, 469 samples; 0. 26 per cent) was identified among the unusual genotypes that cause human infections in the UK (Elwin and others 2012). Cryptosporidium oocysts or antibodies were first detected in cats in Scotland in 1991 – 1995. These studies reported prevalence rates of <b>Cryptosporidium</b> <b>spp.</b> of 5. 2 per cent (7 of 136), 10. 1 per cent (10 of 99) and 12. 3 per cent (7 of 57) in domestic, feral and farm cats...|$|R
