40|$|We {{consider}} the mathematical {{model in which}} an operating processor serves {{the set of the}} stationary objects positioned in a one-dimensional working zone. The processor performs two voyages between the uttermost points of the zone: the forward or direct one, where certain objects are served, and the return one, where remaining objects are served. Servicing of the object cannot start earlier than its ready date. The individual penalty function is assigned to every object, the function depending on the servicing completion time. Minimized criteria of schedule quality are assumed to be total service duration and total penalty. We formulate and study optimization problems with one and two criteria. Proposed algorithms are based on dynamic programming and Pareto principle, the implementations of these algorithms are demonstrated on numerical examples. We show that the algorithm for the problem of processing time minimization is polynomial, and that the problem of total penalty minimization is NP-hard. Correspondingly, the bicriteria problem with the mentioned evaluation criteria is fundamentally intractable, computational complexity of the schedule structure algorithm is exponential. The model describes the fuel supply processes to the diesel-electrical dredgers which extract non-metallic building materials (sand, gravel) in large-scale areas of inland waterways. Similar models and optimization problems are important, for example, in applications like the <b>control</b> of <b>satellite</b> <b>group</b> refueling and regular civil aircraft refueling.

40|$|Subacute {{repeated}} dose 28 day oral toxicity {{study with}} norfloxacin {{was conducted in}} five groups of Wistar albino female rats. The doses administered orally were Sodium Acetate Buffer (50 mmol/L), pH 4. 5 (vehicle control), 380, 1140 and 3800 mg/kg norfloxacin {{for a period of}} 28 days. The hematological parameters viz., TEC, Hb, Hct and TLC showed significant decreased level in treated (Group II, III and IV) rats compared to their respective control groups. Similarly biochemical parameters viz., aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, BUN and creatinine showed significant increased level in treated (Group II, III and IV) rats compared to their respective <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>Satellite</b> high dose <b>group</b> animals showed partial recovery in terms of haematological as well as biochemical parameters after cessation administration of norfloxacin for 14 days. There was a significant decrease in body weight gain in treatment group rats during the study period. However <b>satellite</b> high dose <b>group</b> animals showed partial recovery in body weight gain after the administration of norfloxacin was stopped. Histopathology of rats revealed toxic effect of norfloxacin on liver, kidney, heart, spleen and intestine. <b>Satellite</b> high dose <b>group</b> showed recovery to normalcy in histopathological study.

The unit was still a Regular Air Force unit and was still stationed at Offutt AFB, NE. In 1994, President William Clinton signed a bill that merged federal weather programs. Prior to the merge, federal programs were deemed to be redundant. This merger would save the government money and allow one entity to control national weather products.
