40|$|This article investigates how {{speakers}} in talk-in-interaction utilize parenthesis {{in order to}} organize information in turns, {{as well as to}} manage local interactive tasks and shape the participant framework. By parenthesis we mean constructions which temporarily suspend the progression of another syntactic construction or wider action sequence. Parentheses provide interesting challenges for practitioners of interactional linguistics. In conversation, using parentheses enables participants to embed several turn constructional units and even speaker change within a single syntactic unit. This paper focuses on interfaces between the frame construction and parenthesis. We first discuss syntactic, prosodic and sequential/textual projection as means of indicating non-completion and suspension of the current turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit.</b> We also investigate how parentheses relate to the trajectory of the main line of conversation. The aim is to show that parentheses are an important resource contributing to the coherence of the conversation’s contents and actions. The paper combines two approaches, conversation analysis and a syntactic approach to spoken language. This double perspective allows us to articulate differences between parentheses and self repairs which also interrupt evolving turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit.</b> The analyses are based on Finnish conversational data. ...|$|E

These sequences record both constructional and destructional phases. <b>Constructional</b> <b>units</b> formed during basinward progradation and avalanching of oolitic sediment from a shallow bench platform down a steeply-dipping bench slope. Reversed grading seen in proximal foresets and normal grading seen in distal foresets {{may have resulted}} from sediment transport by grain flow on {{the upper reaches of}} the slope and fluidized sediment flow on the lower slope surface. Foreset beds dip basinward to the northeast at 26 degrees, and foreset units attain thicknesses of 18 meters. Destructional episodes are recorded by missing sections within the tops of <b>constructional</b> <b>units.</b> Massive beds of thickly coated ooids overlie <b>constructional</b> <b>units</b> and record ooid formalion on the bench platform during transgressions which preceded progradation of subsequent foresets. The inlerpretation of these lacustrine bench sequences in terms of water depths during their formation demonstrates that rates of subsidence and absolute positions of lake level fluctuated greatly during their deposition.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{one aspect of}} interplay between grammar and social interaction: how speak-ers of different languages explicate referents that had been referred to tacitly, i. e., without using an explicit referential expression. The focus is on situations when speakers go on to explicate the referent in the transition space, after bringing the turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> to a possible completion. Depending on the grammatical affordances of the language, rendering a tacit reference explicit may either expose or mask this operation. Focusing on the latter, we show that the grammars of Russian and Brazilian Portuguese (and, to a lesser extent, English) enable speakers of these languages to explicate referents by extending a possibly complete turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> with a grammatically fitted increment and, thereby, embed this remedial operation into the progressive construction of the turn without engaging repair machinery. We discuss how tacit referring and flexible word order can enable speakers {{to carry out this}} repair-like operation in a covert or embedded fashion, and we examine some interactional functions of this referent-explicating operation. This {{article examines}} one aspect of interplay between grammar and social interaction: how speak-ers of different languages explicate referents that had been referred to tacitly.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a type of}} joint utterance construction in Japanese, in which two independent sentential-level units are amalgamated, which has hitherto received little attention in the literature. Unlike traditional joint utterance construction where one speaker maintains authority over the syntactic structure of the forthcoming continuation and the other accedes to this, thereby constituting a single TCU (turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit),</b> our examples demonstrate that both speakers can have authority over the syntactic design of joint utterances. We call such collaborative utterances ‘co-authored joint utterances’ in this paper. The uniqueness of co-authored joint utterances lies in their syntactic architecture. While syntactic and semantic continuity are successfully achieved in constructing co-authored joint utterances, they represent a co-joined structure in which two sentential-level units are involved with their shared part constituting a point of amalgamation, and because of this, {{the structure of a}} co-authored joint utterance can no longer be parsed with extant grammar. In analysing co-authored joint utterances, we examine how they can be treated in relation to the distinction between TCU (Turn <b>Constructional</b> <b>Unit)</b> continuation and new TCUs. Due to the particularities of the syntactic architecture of co-authored joint utterances, their existence raises questions about the way in which this distinction is currently operationalised, because despite being syntactically an incremental continuation, and so seemingly a TCU continuation, the co-authored joint utterance implements an action beyond what was initially instantiated by the antecedent of that joint utterance, and so arguably constitutes a new TCU.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the intellectual {{background for the}} research direction Interactional linguistics, its basic discovery procedures and the central topics. Interactional linguistics {{is based on the}} empirical methods developed in Conversation Analysis, not least sequential analysis which investigates every utterance in a conversation as a response to a prior utterance and as a platform for the next contribution. Central topics include lexical and syntactic resources for turn construction and, in addition to this, prosodic and non-verbal resources for action construction. The topics can be approached {{from the perspective of a}} specific linguistic form and its correlation with social action, or from the perspective of a specific type of action and its correlation with linguistic form. Because talk-in-interaction is constructed in a temporally linear process, the paper discusses especially the interdependency of turn/action construction and sequential organization. With the help of conversational examples, three types of organization are highlighted: the internal directionality of turn <b>constructional</b> <b>units,</b> the sequentiality of turn <b>constructional</b> <b>units</b> as building blocks in multi-unit turns, and the sequentiality of turns in a series of turns. The examples suggest that the linguistic and interactional organization rest on a balance between a global grammar (of a language) and local grammars constrained by the directional and sequential positions of turns and the units within them...|$|R

40|$|Temple {{architecture}} in North India {{has been studied}} {{from a variety of}} perspectives, ranging from anthropological to art historical, but previous interpretations have not sufficiently explained the principles of temple design and construction, particularly the relationship between textual traditions and architectural practice, and between architects and craftsmen. This dissertation investigates these principles and processes from a specifically architectural perspective, through an analysis of temple measurements gathered during fieldwork at Bandhogarh, Madhya Pradesh, from temples dated to {{the latter half of the}} eighth century scCE, supplemented by data from other temple sites. These data are further compared and contrasted with textual references, evidence of craft practices, as well as historical and epigraphic data. ^ An analysis of measurement data indicates two types of measurement procedures, proportional and constructional, corresponding to the two groups directly involved in temple production: priests and craftsmen. While options for overall temple proportions and morphologies were prescribed by communities of priests in textual form, it was necessary for craftsmen to fix the magnitude of these proportions, and thus the dimensions of the temple to be constructed, with fixed units of measure. This unit of construction was found to be based on the width of a hand, probably that of the patron of the temple. ^ Groups of craftsmen may be further subdivided in terms of their experience. Those with the most knowledge and skill, i. e. architects, used the <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> to measure the individual stone blocks of temples, so that the sums of their discrete dimensions conformed to proportional prescriptions. In order to fulfill the proportional relationship between temple widths and heights, these architects employed mathematical progressions to determine the dimensions of the layers of blocks used to form temple superstructures. Other craftsmen then used the <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> to measure and carve specific, repetitive sculptural elements on these blocks. ^ Experienced in the calculation of the terms and sums of these numerical sequences, architects were able to construct a variety of temples that both conformed to the prescriptions of texts and permitted the production of the wide range of superstructure profiles characteristic of temples in North India. ...|$|E

The linguistic object of the analysis is clausal constructions in Swedish that are initiated by the finite predicate verb: polar questions, receipt questions (news receipts), conditional protases and pro-drop declaratives. These constructions share potentially the same syntactic surface pattern but are constrained by different sequential conditions of use. The study proposes an integrated interactional linguistic analysis which takes into account both syntactic and sequential aspects of turn construction. A grammatical attribute-value matrix, based on the framework of construction grammar (CxG), is introduced. The analysis shows that regularities of sequential organization may provide robust distinctive constructional features while a pure syntactic analysis remains less distinctive. The decisive constructional features are systematically captured by a notation designed for sequential and syntactic organization...|$|R

40|$|Temporal adverbs of {{quantification}} (QADV) have a {{great impact}} on the event struc-tures of languages; they seem to limit possible constructions of tense, Aktionsarten, and external information on the event structures. For a subset of QADV in German I will discuss the restrictions that occur within some given temporal contexts. Kratzer’s (1978) interval model will be taken as a basis: Quantification requires either countable entities or some sort of container – a general timespan, in which a quantity can be described. Therefore, the given entities can be quantified within a given interval, or sub-intervals can be quantified separately in order to be well-interpretable. Besides characteristics of the verb or external markers such as frames/spans, the tense sytem is another <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> that sets up intervals. For German, Latzel (1967) and Hauser-Suida/Hoppe-Beugel (1972) point out that some frequency adverbs restrict the usage of Präteritum. For French présent, de Swart (1992) shows problematic con-structions with iterative adverbs (IADV), which have equivalents at least in German.

40|$|A speaker {{sometimes}} halts {{an ongoing}} turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> (TCU) before its completion, inserts a short parenthetical remark into it, and then {{returns to the}} halted TCU. A remarkable organizational feature {{of some of these}} parentheticals is that they are oriented to as something the recipient may respond to. As a consequence, a little sequence develops, which is managed within the borders of the ongoing turn. In the parenthetical sequence, the speaker informs the recipient metacommunicatively and in real time how to listen to the turn in progress. In this paper, I look at the properties of this type of parenthetical and at the sequence that may develop out of it. In particular, I examine the construction and placement of the insert in the ongoing TCU, its prosody, the way the recipient responds to it, and how the speaker accomplishes the return. The analysis describes how linguistic structure is deployed as a resource for performing a subsidiary interactional activity {{in the course of the}} unit with the action it is supportive of. Parenthetical sequences are a solution to a design problem. The device enables a speaker to reconcile the potentially contradictory requirements that the linearity of speech production poses to the speaker's orientation to recipient design.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{one specific}} conversational practice of formulation called ‘notionalization’. It consists {{in the transformation}} of a description by a prior speaker into a categorization by the next speaker. Sequences of this kind are a ‘‘natural laboratory’’ for studying the differences between descriptions and categorizations regarding their semantic, interactional, and rhetorical properties: Descriptive/narrative versions are often vague and tentative, multi unit turns, which are temporalized and episodic, offering a lot of contingent, situational, and indexical detail. Notionalizations turn them into condensed, abstract, timeless, and often agentless categorizations expressed by a noun (phrase) within one turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> (TCU). Drawing on audio- and video-taped German data from various types of interaction, the paper focuses on one particular practice of notionalization, the formulation of purportedly common ground by TCUs prefaced with the connective also. The paper discusses their turn-constructional and morphological properties, pointing out affinities of notionalization with language for special purposes. Notionalizations are used for reducing detail and for topical closure. They provide grounds for emergent keywords, which can be reused to re-contextualize topical issues and interactional histories efficiently. Notionalizations are powerful means for accomplishing intersubjectivity while pursuing (sometimes one-sided) practical relevancies at the same time. Their inevitably perspective design thus may lead to re-open the issue they were deemed to settle. The paper closes with an outlook to other practices of notionalization, pointing to dimensions of interactionally relevant variation and commonalities. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to the discussion of linguistic aspects of turn organiza-tion, especially {{from the point of view}} of Swedish grammar and conversational lan-guage. I propose a general model for interactionally sensitive turn organization and relate it to topological syntactic descriptions of the Swedish clausal structure. The re-sults of this comparative examination suggest that there are remarkable points of con-nection between the syntactic and interactional organization of turn <b>constructional</b> <b>units</b> (TCUs). Syntactic evidence helps one understand the motivation of appo-sitionals as different from genuine sentence starts as well as what may count as the beginning—and indeed, a nonbeginning—of a contribution. I show how the begin-ning edge of transition space may be defined by syntactic means and which diverse syntactic practices may be exploited in the production of postpossible completion in-crements. A study of Swedish, which is a language with a fixed verb-second word or-der, may help reveal certain patterns of interactionally sensitive turn design in the very syntactic array of constituents in turn units. Important examples of such syntac-tic–interactional interplay are provided by an optional appositional coding of ad-verbs (i. e., disjuncts or conjuncts) when used as discourse markers, by an optional appositional coding of action projecting clauses when used as TCU initial markers...|$|R

Electron micrographs of sections of these spherulites after fixation show parabolic patterns of an electron-light component, set in a continuous matrix of protein. Such patterns arise in helicoidal systems (e. g. arthropod cuticle) and microdensito-metric scans of the matrix show a rhythmical electron-density variation consistent with heli-coidal structure. Double spiral patterns identical to those seen in liquid crystal spherulites are illustrated. These properties resemble those of cholesteric liquid crystals. The <b>constructional</b> <b>units</b> appear to be molecular rather than fibrillar as described by previous authors. The helicoidal architecture arises by self-assembly in the gland lumen. Lamellar surface structures self-assembled spontaneously on glass coverslips when the protein was left to stand for several days. When heated to 55 °C, the birefringent liquid crystalline protein abruptly changes to an isotropic gel, with associated loss of parabolic patterning in electron micrographs and of the rhythmical electron-density variation on microdensitometric scans.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{case study}} of a man with dementia, Dan, who sings in everyday conversation with his family. Some of Dan’s singing is not unusual. For example, talk might touch-off singing when it includes words that are in a song’s title or lyrics. Dan also does something unexpected by modifying songs based on prior talk and the physical environment. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze when, how, and to what ends Dan does this type of modified singing. My primary approach uses Conversation Analysis to describe and analyze (1) how singing fits into the turn-taking structure of talk, (2) the emergent structure of a performance, and (3) what singing accomplishes in the moment. My secondary approach addresses why singing might be a particularly useful tool for Dan to participate in interaction. I provide two accounts, one that focuses on performance and identity and the other on cognitive processes involved in his song production. Combined, these perspectives analyze Dan’s singing as an emergent consequence of linguistic, social, and cognitive processes that occur within and between people. There are several key findings. First, Dan’s singing is not random but fits systematically within the sequential organization of interaction. Second, Dan’s song emerges bit-by-bit in conversation. There is evidence for an orientation to a relatively short turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> at the beginning of a song. The performance of an extended song is an achievement that is contingent upon the actions of co-participants. Third, Dan’s singing is a relatively open-ended resource. Dan uses singing to accomplish “main” jobs, such as complimenting, and “off record” jobs, such as managing distribution of knowledge and decision-making rights. Dan’s performances often position him as a humorous and clever singer in the moment and cumulatively construct a more “durable” identity than found in a single performance. His performances thus constitute an important contrast to the top-down medical category of “demented. ” This study makes theoretical contributions to the study of singing in interaction, interaction in general, and communication by people with dementia...|$|E
40|$|In Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson (1974), {{a system}} was {{proposed}} to handle conversational turn-taking. As is well known, that system {{consists of two}} parts: a turn construction component and a turn allocation component. While the broad outline of the latter is fairly well understood and generally accepted, the former is fraud with difficulties {{mainly because of the}} lack of a satisfactory definition of the basic unit, turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> (TCU), or a robust procedure for its identification. In SSJ’s original paper, TCUs were described intuitively as ‘any word, phrase, clause, or sentence’. Realizing that this was a less than rigorous definition, SSJ appealed to linguists for help in a footnote: ‘How projection of unit-types is accomplished [...] . is an important question on which linguists can make major contributions. ’ (p. 703) However, to date there has been little response from linguists to this invitation in spite of the venue of the paper’s publication (Language) and its massive influence. The lack of progress on this matter has led some researchers to come back to this unresolved question in recent years, notably Schegloff (1996, 2000). In this paper, I revisit this central issue and formulate an answer to the question. It is argued that the main thrust of the answer can be derived from Bloomfield’s (1933) discussion of the definition and identification of sentences, once it is realized that the questions of sentence identity and TCU identity in fact run parallel to each other. According to Bloomfield, the sentence can be defined as a combination of a syntactic structure which is in ‘absolute position’ (as opposed to ‘included position’), plus an intonation pattern. The fundamental importance of intonation is stressed in this connection: ‘The pitch phonemes [i. e. intonation patterns] … occur in every utterance, appearing even when a single word is uttered, such as John! John? John. ” (Bloomfield 1933 : 116) Armed with this understanding and the accompanying notions of ‘full sentence’ and ‘minor sentence’, one is in a position to furnish Conversation Analysis with a principled way of distinguishing words or word-strings which are TCUs from ones which are merely parts of TCUs. This conclusion is illustrated and supported with ample evidence from Chinese and English conversational data...|$|E

This is a descriptive qualitative research, using a conversation analysis, a method of understanding the structure of conversation through the natural occurring talks in the language classroom. The data were collected through the recording of the class’ interaction; the collected data were transcribed in a Jeffersonian transcription code. The transcribed data were analyzed through the emic perspective which consists of the unmotivated looking, the repeated listening & viewing, ‘why that now’ method, and a case by case analysis. The researcher analyzed the data by questioning all the possible reasons why those actions were created by the participants through comparing and checking all the symbols the participants made. The analysis {{was also in the}} form of sequences’ analysis and categorized into the structure of the conversation. To prove the validity of the data, the researcher had triangulation by cross-checking to the sources, comparing to the theory and having consultation with other researchers. The result of the research showed that the conversation in the language classroom had almost all the structure in the theory of conversation structure. It showed that the classroom participants had achieved understanding for the communication through the teacher’s instruction in doing the tasks. The process of classroom discourse was shown through 49 data of sequences in the process of conversation. First, the conversation’s structure in Budi Mulia Dua International School was identified in (1) turn-taking organization, (2) the sequencing organization, (3) the overall structuring organization, and (4) the repair organization. The process of the turn-taking organization was identified as: (a) the acknowledgement of Turn <b>Constructional</b> <b>Unit</b> (TCU) and Possible Completion Point (PCP); and (b) the turn allocation from the participants. The participants developed the turn taking into the sequencing process, where it allowed the participants to have (a) the adjacency pair as the relevancy between utterances, (b) the preferences as the alternatives in the sequence of response, (c) the type-specific sequences (as in agreement or disagreement, announcement, compliment, response, offer and request), and (d) the response tokens. The participants also developed the sequences in the overall structuring organization that occurred in the (a) opening and (b) closing of the conversation. There was a process of repair organization in the conversation structure that occurred through (a) self-initiated repair and (b) other-initiated repair. Second, the research also showed that the instructional practices from the analysis of conversation showed the less existence of repair and corrective feedback given both from teacher and students; there were less practice in identifying trouble source and topic initiation. The conversation focused on the classroom task that became the only topic of discussion. Third, the last finding of this research showed that the class talks in SMA International Budi Mulia Dua was not really effective since the lack of topic initiation and response from the students. Moreover, it resulted to the teacher’s domination, since the data showed that the student response were only in the form of question for confirmation and gestures rather than to the topic development and conversation’s management...|$|E

The investigation of flexible screw working organ was conducted and it were shown the dependence and calculated schemes for determining minimum radius of bend of the conveyor with screw sectional working elements. ???????? ?????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?? ???????? ??????????????? ????????. ???????????, ??? ????? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ????? ????????, ? ?????? ???????, ?? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ???????? ?? ????. ???????, ?????? ?? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????????, ????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ??????????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ????????????? ???????. ???????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ??????????...|$|R

The definitive version is available at; [URL] this article, we focus on the activities done by the recipients of crying. In the analysis, we work with a corpus of calls from a child protection helpline in which the caller shows features of crying (14 calls, or about 10 % of the total). Our focus is on two kinds of crying receipts made by child protection officers (CPOs) that are rare in noncrying calls but recurrent in crying calls: take-your-times (TYTs) and empathic receipts (ERs). TYTs are used in environments in which the caller displays an attempt to but failure to articulate talk. This can be shown by inappropriate silence, wet sniffs, sobs, and turn <b>constructional</b> <b>units</b> that are either incomplete or disrupted by sobs, sniffs, or whispering. TYTs offer a license for the late delivery of talk and are affiliative. ERs can replace TYTs but are more common in environments in which callers are unresponsive to CPO actions such as advice giving. ERs have two elements—a formulation of the crying party's mental state and some sort of marker of the contingency of the mental state formulations. The mental state element is built from local features of the caller's talk (displays and metaformulations of upset), and issues of accuracy are managed through the epistemic contingency maker (most of ten treating the formulation as based on hearing). We discuss broader implications of this work for conceptions of empathy...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePlants are modular {{organisms that}} develop by the {{repetition}} of elementary botanical entities or <b>constructional</b> <b>units</b> through the three main and fundamental morphogenetic processes of growth, branching and reiteration (Barthélémy and Caraglio, 2007). Repetition of these entities induces gradual or abrupt changes in their characteristics. These characteristics are quantified through several variables, called the entity attributes. On the one hand, differences between entities reflect different stages of differentiation in the meristems (Nicolini and Chanson, 1999), which are ordered in time and correspond {{to the notion of}} physiological age of meristems (Barthélémy and Caraglio, 2007). The changes of one attribute through the plant structure are referred to as morphogenetic gradient. On the other hand, part of the entity differences can be imputed to environmental factors. Based on this botanical model of plant functioning, our approach jointly relies on categories of entities with similar characteristics, a description of those within-category characteristics and the category topological organisation within the plant. This constitutes a useful summary of the plant architecture, which is the basis for 1) highlighting hidden regularities in plant structures, for {{a better understanding of the}} gradients and organisation rules; 2) proposing and validating ecophysiological hypotheses, and new sampling protocols; 3) adopting a powerful paradigm for modelling plant development. In this work, the entity categories are identified using a hidden Markov tree (HMT) model, in which local dependencies only (i. e. interactions between connected entities) are accounted for. This is not sufficient to accurately describe the topological distribution of the entities within the plant, and the changes of the plant topology. This is why various complementary methods and models (among which edit distance algorithms and sequence analysis using Markovian models), performed at different scales, are used in our approach to provide a more detailed description of the architecture, and to assess how various controlled factors affect architecture plasticity...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} {{study of the}} forms and functions of the French particle hein in mundane talk-in-interaction between French native speakers. This study was conducted using Conversation Analysis (CA) as methodology. The {{data for this study}} consist of four different sets of videotaped and audio-taped, non-elicited mundane conversation, yielding a total of 6 hours of conversation. Speakers included six family members and one friend. All data were collected with the subjects??? consent and in accordance with the regulations of the University of Illinois??? Institutional Review Board. After a thorough description of the methodology (chapter 1), I provide a literature review (chapter 2). I first report findings of previous studies on other discourse particles conducted with CA. I then present findings of non-CA studies previously done on French particles. Lastly, I present a literature review on hein. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 present the findings of my study on hein with respect to the place of hein in a turn <b>constructional</b> <b>unit</b> (TCU). My data show that hein can appear in four different positions: as a stand-alone particle, {{at the end of a}} TCU, at the conjunction of two TCUs uttered by the same party, and within a TCU. Chapter 3 is devoted to the functions of hein as a stand-alone particle. I demonstrate that in this position, the main function of hein is that of a repair initiator. However, a stand-alone hein can also be used as an attention getting device, a summons and/or an agreement pursuit. Chapter 4 focuses on the functions of hein at the end of a TCU, that is, in tag position. This hein appears to perform four main functions. The first function is that of an agreement pursuit. Furthermore, hein appears to be used as a device to stress important information and insist on taking the floor. In this position, hein also appears to be used as a device to intensify the act of hedging done in the previous TCU. Lastly, my data show that hein may be considered as a facilitative tag in the context of long tellings. Chapter 5 treats the functions of hein in two different sequential environments: hein at the conjunction of two latched TCUs uttered by the same party, and hein within a TCU. I argue that when hein is uttered between two latched TCUs, it is found in dispreferred environments (e. g., request + hein + account). Additionally, I show how the talk after the hein is linked with the part that is uttered before the hein. I present two instances of hein used in such environments. As for the hein within a TCU, my data show that in this environment, hein performs two main functions. First, an intra-TCU hein is interactively proven efficient as a device to stress the term(s) that immediately precede(s) the hein. Second, in some instances, a speaker produces what initially appears to be a complete TCU followed by hein, after which, it then becomes apparent that the remainder of the talk is built as a continuation of the prior TCU. Put differently, as the talk unfolds a tag-hein becomes an intra-turn hein. The conclusion situates the findings of this study in relation to prior research. In this discussion, the methodological advantages of using a conversation analytic approach are highlighted. The conclusion also points out the limitations of the study and avenues of future research...|$|E
40|$|Shallow-marine and paralic clastic depositional {{systems are}} {{described}} by a large volume of sedimentological, architectural and geomorphological data. A new method that enables the convergence of these datasets into a common descriptive scheme facilitates the identification and application of potential outcrop and modern hydrocarbon-reservoir analogs. To this end, a database has been developed for the collation of data in standardized format, {{in a way that}} allows significant comparisons between different depositional systems, and the derivation of consistently defined attributes that can be applied in subsurface studies. The Shallow Marine Architectural Knowledge Store is a relational database devised to include data on the sedimentary architecture of shallow marine and paralic ancient depositional systems, and on the geomorphic organization of corresponding modern environments. The database incorporates data on sedimentary bodies and surfaces and geomorphic units, which are classified on descriptive (e. g. grain size) and interpretive (e. g. sub-environment) categories, and characterized on a variety of attributes (e. g. geometries, spatial relationships, hierarchical relationships). Depositional systems, and stratigraphic intervals or planform segments thereof, are classified on descriptive parameters (e. g. shelf gradient) and controlling factors (e. g. tidal regime) to allow the selection of relevant outcrop or modern analogs. The database can be queried to return a quantified characterization of multiple analogs, and data can be synthesized in models that incorporate uncertainty related to variability in sedimentary heterogeneity. To illustrate the range of genetic units types, depositional systems, associated data and potential applications, example database output is showcased relating to: - the hierarchical arrangement and scaling relationships of architectural elements that form <b>constructional</b> <b>units</b> in Quaternary deltas of different types; - the facies organization of nearshore sandstone belts and the geometry of associated parasequences, from the Upper Cretaceous of the Western Interior Seaway in Utah (USA); - the geometry of modern geomorphic features, and their relations with the geometry of architectural elements interpreted as the preserved product of the morphodynamic evolution of corresponding landforms. Particular attention is paid to how the database output {{can be applied to the}} construction of accurate, quantitative 3 D geological models...|$|R
5000|$|Compared {{to other}} {{directions}} of structuralism in architecture, the following clarifications are noted: [...] "In the new architectural movement {{there is often}} a tendency to call everything Structuralist that resembles a woven texture and has a grid. This would be a superficial way of looking at things. By nature Structuralism is concerned with the configuration of conditioned and polyvalent units of form (spatial, communicational, <b>constructional</b> or other <b>units)</b> at all urban scales. Only when the users have taken possession of the structures through contact, interpretation or filling-in the details, do the structures achieve their full status. Any architecture that has a tendency to formalism is thus excluded. Flexible form, which has been much discussed, is also rejected as a neutral enclosing system, since it does not offer the appropriate solution for any spatial programme. In the architecture of Herman Hertzberger Structuralist form can be found from the smallest detail up to the most complicated structure, whether it is in terms of spatial, facade or environmental design."
