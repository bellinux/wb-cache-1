5|$|While {{being treated}} for various injuries, Favre {{developed}} an addiction to Vicodin, which became publicly known when he suffered a seizure during a hospital visit.

5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study that explores {{the experiences of}} Latin as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children. Research supports that women <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children experience cultural expectations and negative social feedback regarding their decision. Given the research findings regarding the experiences {{of women in the}} general population who <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> to have children, the researcher was curious about the culture-specific themes that might be identified that are relevant to the experience of being a female <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children in the Latino culture. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was selected and 10 Latina participants from Central America were interviewed about their experiences with <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children. Four broad themes were identified: participants 2 ̆ 7 perspectives regarding their decision process to not have children, factors influencing their decision, social interactions experienced regarding their decision, and their sense of identity as women and Latinas <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children. The findings suggest that interpersonal approaches toward understanding gender do not take into account complex gender identities that include non-traditional traits and behaviors, such as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children. The results also suggest that the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s decision process in <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children is a multidimensional process involving cultural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal factors that may occur concurrently and vary with time and situation. In addition, the findings suggest that despite cultural expectations, negative social interactions, and complex intrapersonal process, Latinas <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children are able to continue with their decision through the help of social support and perseverance. It is not clear that there are culture-specific themes describing the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s experience with <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children. It is suggested that these findings have implications for all women choosing non-traditional lifestyles, such as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> to have children. Further research implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research were discussed...|$|R

5|$|During the war the Wallenberg bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank {{collaborated with}} the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. {{considered}} Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the family may have <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, {{and they may have}} considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Local {{forecast}} {{offices of}} the National Weather Service, radio and television stations, and emergency planners often use the forecasts to gauge the potential severe weather threats to their areas. Even after the marginal and enhanced risk categories were added in October 2014, some television stations have continued to use the original three-category system to outline forecasted severe weather risks (though stations that do this may utilize in-house severe weather outlooks that vary to some degree from the SPC convective outlooks), while certain others that have switched to the current system have <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to outline marginal risk areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} has {{said earlier that}} {{it will be able to}} allocate different payment amounts to different people. To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} to not feature {{either of the two}} previous holders of the office, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, who had run against each other in 2008 and 2012. Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds. Through his victory, Khan became the second Labour Party Mayor of London after Livingstone, and the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital city.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman {{supported}} {{the work of}} the Legislative Assembly which began in December 1948. He saw it as the first time that Sudan's political and religious groups had been able to meet each other in a venue where the British could not stir up disputes between the different factions. He said that Isma'il al-Azhari opposed the Assembly purely because it would bring Sudan away from Egypt and nearer to full independence. In December 1950 a member of the Umma tabled a resolution asking the Governor-General to demand that Egypt and Britain grant Sudan independence at once. The British strongly opposed the measure, saying the Assembly was not truly representative since the Khatmiyya had <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to participate. The resolution was passed by one vote. Abd al-Rahman and al-Azhari both claimed victory: Abd al-Rahman since the vote had been passed, and the al-Azhari since the British had said the Assembly was not representative.|$|E

5|$|In 1129, Emperor Gaozong {{designated}} the site at Hangzhou (known then as Lin'an) {{to be the}} temporary settlement of the court, {{but it was not}} until 1132 that it was declared the new Song capital. Hangzhou and Nanjing were devastated by the Jin raids; both cities were heavily repopulated with northern refugees who outnumbered the remaining original inhabitants. Hangzhou was <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> only for its natural scenic beauty, but for the surrounding topographic barriers of lakes and muddy rice-fields that gave it defensive potential against northern armies comprising mostly cavalry. Yet it was viewed by the court as only a temporary capital while the Song emperors planned to retake Kaifeng. However, the rapid growth of the city from the 12th century to the 13th necessitated long-term goals of residency. In 1133 the modest palatial residence of the imperial family was improved upon from a simple provincial lodging to one that at least accommodated strolls with new covered alleyways to deflect the rain. In 1148 the walls of the small palace compound were finally extended to the southeast, yet this was another marginal improvement.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 2009 Stockport {{agreed to}} allow Gannon to hold talks with Brighton & Hove Albion, who were seeking to fill the {{managerial}} position left vacant by Micky Adams. He suggested that his family would play a large part in his decision to move clubs, with Stockport's financial troubles looming but uprooting his family to move to Brighton being undesirable. Gannon was made favourite {{to be given the}} job by several bookmakers, and he met with Brighton chairman Dick Knight on the 25th, before announcing on the 26th that he had <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to take the job. Knight had indicated that Gannon was his first choice for the job, and former Stockport players now at Brighton had shown their desire for Gannon to be given the job. However, Gannon turned down the opportunity and vowed stay with at the Edgeley Park club.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 2013, media {{reported}} that Apple Inc. had prohibited {{the sale of}} issue 12 of Saga through iOS, because two panels that depicted oral sex between men in a small, in-set image violated Apple's restrictions on sexual content. This resulted in criticism by artists and writers, who pointed to similarly explicit content in previous issues and in other works sold through iTunes. William Gibson and others suggested that the restriction could have occurred specifically because the drawings in question depicted gay sex. A day later, digital distributor Comixology announced {{that it had been}} they, not Apple, who had <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to make the issue available based on their interpretation of Apple's rules, and that after receiving clarification from Apple, the issue would now be sold via iOS.|$|E

5|$|The Dodgers {{cut into}} {{the lead in the}} fourth, as Snider doubled to lead off, {{advanced}} to third on a Tommy Davis single, and scored on a groundout by Frank Howard. The Giants threatened against Podres {{in the top of the}} sixth with singles by Cepeda, Ed Bailey, and Jim Davenport on a bunt to load the bases. However, Ed Roebuck relieved Podres and escaped the inning without allowing a run. The Dodgers took a 3–2 lead in the bottom of the inning as Snider singled and scored on a home run by Tommy Davis. They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted. Manager Alvin Dark had <b>chosen</b> <b>not</b> to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning. Gilliam was put out for the second out of the inning, but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him. This extended the Dodgers' lead to 4–2. The Dodgers further threatened in the bottom of the eighth. Don Larsen entered in relief of Marichal midway through Davis' at bat but Davis walked to lead off the inning regardless. Ron Fairly sacrificed him to second base and Davis then stole third as Howard struck out. However, Larsen intentionally walked both Roseboro and Willie Davis to load the bases and induced a ground out by Roebuck to end the inning.|$|E
