25|$|On 29 January 1940 Flight Lieutenant Caesar Hull led {{a section}} of 43 Squadron to {{intercept}} an unidentified aircraft caught on radar. Ten miles south-west of Hartlepool at 90:45 GMT, they engaged a Heinkel He 111. It was one of nine He 111s that had separated form its formation upon reaching the English coast. Hull, Carey and Pilot Officer H. L North fired at it as they chased it out over the sea. They observed no results and returned to base. Hull found a bullet hole in his Hurricane upon landing. The He 111 was from 6. Staffel (Squadron), Kampfgeschwader 26 (4./KG 26). On 30 January Frank and Hull were on patrol near Coquet Island. They intercepted 26 He 111s from KG 26 that were targeting merchant shipping and fishing boats. The German bombers were flying at low altitude just below the <b>cloud</b> <b>line</b> at approximately 1,000ft. This tactic enabled the German bomber pilot to easily escape into the cloud if spotted. The two pilots dropped to sea-level and engaged an enemy unseen. The He 111, from, 4./KG 26, crashed into the sea. Pilot Feldwebel Helmut Höfner were posted missing in action. The observer was confirmed to {{have been killed in}} action when his body was recovered.

40|$|During the ‘Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study’ (COPS) {{performed}} in summer 2007, deep convection developed on July 15, although convective available potential energy was only moderate and convective inhibition was high. Convection {{was restricted to}} an area east of the Black Forest crest. Data analysis revealed that the convection was triggered by different mechanisms. Due to a surface high which was situated east of the Black Forest and a surface low which approached the investigation area from the west, a mesoscale convergence zone was established between the two regions and moved eastwards. Secondly, high insolation favoured the development of slope and valley winds and high evapotranspiration resulted in an increase of moisture in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The thermally driven circulation systems formed a convergence zone along the mountain crest. When the synoptically induced mesoscale convergence zone reached the Black Forest, the different convergence zones superimposed optimally, such that strong updraughts were observed above the mountain. These updraughts penetrated the PBL-capping inversion and nearly reached the level of free convection. About 15 min after the convergence zone had passed the Black Forest crest, first clouds developed east of it. While moving further eastwards, the convergence zone intensified and became visible as a north-south oriented <b>cloud</b> <b>line</b> in the satellite images.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of occurrence and formation mechanisms of wave-cloud lines off the northwest coast of Australia are investigated. Prior to the present study, little was known about these wave-cloud lines. Apart from being spectacular atmospheric phenomenon in their own right, these wave clouds can {{have a role in}} the secondary initiation of convection and can be a hazard to low-flying aircraft. A climatology of wave clouds, produced from visible satellite imagery, suggests two main types of <b>cloud</b> <b>lines</b> form over northwest Australia. The first are bore-like waves, similar in structure to the ‘morning glory’ of northeast Australia, and occur at least 2 to 3 times per month throughout the entire year. The second type are convectively generated <b>cloud</b> <b>lines,</b> which are more circular in shape, appear to originate from convective storms and occur at least 0. 5 to 1. 5 times per month during the wet season. High-resolution, nested simulations are performed with the Met Office Unified Model for case-studies of each type of wave. The bore-like waves occurred in the presence of synoptic-scale, low-level southeasterly flow and a heat low along the northwest coast of Australia. At night, the offshore southeasterlies accelerate into the heat low and collide with the onshore sea breeze. The southeasterlies override the sea breeze and the wave-cloud lines form at the leading edge of this front. The convectively generated waves radiate outwards from the convective storms producing compensating subsidence and adiabatic warming. These waves take the form of n= 2 mode wave fronts, which span the entire depth of the troposphere and are similar in structure to waves produced by deep convection which are described in previous studies...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} second study from the FUSE survey of {{molecular}} hydrogen in translucent clouds, for the line of sight toward HD 110432. This star lies beyond the Coalsack dark nebula, and with E(B-V) = 0. 40, and A_V = 1. 32 this line of sight bridges the gap between less extinguished diffuse cloud lines of sight with A_V ∼ 1, such as Zeta Oph, and the translucent clouds with A_V ≳ 2 such as HD 73882. Through profile fitting and a curve-of-growth analysis, we have derived rotational populations for H 2 for J = 0 [...] 7. The line of sight has a total molecular hydrogen column density, log N(H 2) = 20. 68 ± 0. 05 cm^- 2, nearly identical to that toward Zeta Oph, but a factor of three less than HD 73882. The ratio of N(J= 1) to N(J= 0) yields a kinetic temperature T_kin = 63 ± 7 K, similar to other lines of sight with A_V ≳ 1. The high-J lines show considerable excitation above this temperature. The high-J excitation {{is similar to that}} toward Zeta Oph, but much smaller than that toward HD 73882. Chemical modeling indicates that the physical conditions in the cloud(s) are very similar to those in the cloud(s) toward Zeta Oph. An analysis of IUE spectra of the Lyman-alpha line gives log N(H I) = 20. 85 ± 0. 15 cm^- 2. Combined with N(H 2), we derive a hydrogen molecular fraction, f_H 2 = 0. 58 pm 0. 12, statistically identical to that found for the lines of sight toward Zeta Oph and HD 73882. We also report column densities for the HD and CO molecules. From the combined measurements of hydrogen and carbon- containing molecules, the line of sight toward HD 110432 appears quite similar to the diffuse <b>cloud</b> <b>line</b> of sight toward Zeta Oph, and quite dissimilar to the translucent <b>cloud</b> <b>line</b> of sight toward HD 73882.

40|$|Observations of H 3 + in the Galactic diffuse {{interstellar}} medium (ISM) {{have led to}} various surprising results, including {{the conclusion that the}} cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta_ 2) is about 1 order of magnitude larger than previously thought. The present survey expands the sample of diffuse <b>cloud</b> sight <b>lines</b> with H 3 + observations to 50, with detections in 21 of those. Ionization rates inferred from these observations are in the range (1. 7 +- 1. 3) x 10 ^- 16 s^- 1 <zeta_ 2 <(10. 6 +- 8. 2) x 10 ^- 16 s^- 1 with a mean value of zeta_ 2 =(3. 5 ^+ 5. 3 _- 3. 0) x 10 ^- 16 s^- 1. Upper limits (3 sigma) derived from non-detections of H 3 + are as low as zeta_ 2 < 0. 4 x 10 ^- 16 s^- 1. These low upper-limits, in combination with the wide range of inferred cosmic-ray ionization rates, indicate variations in zeta_ 2 between different diffuse <b>cloud</b> sight <b>lines.</b> A study of zeta_ 2 versus N_H (total hydrogen column density) shows that the two parameters are not correlated for diffuse molecular <b>cloud</b> sight <b>lines,</b> but that the ionization rate decreases when N_H increases to values typical of dense molecular clouds. Both the difference in ionization rates between diffuse and dense clouds and the variation of zeta_ 2 among diffuse <b>cloud</b> sight <b>lines</b> are likely the result of particle propagation effects. The lower ionization rate in dense clouds is due to the inability of low-energy (few MeV) protons to penetrate such regions, while the ionization rate in diffuse clouds is controlled by the proximity of the observed cloud to a site of particle acceleration.
