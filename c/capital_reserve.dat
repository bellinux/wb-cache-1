25|$|In early April 2009, the Georgia General Assembly {{created a}} budget crisis for MARTA {{by failing to}} pass a bill that would allow it to access its own <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> account, in order to {{compensate}} for a severe drop in sales-tax revenue during the late-2000s recession. MARTA stated that this could force the agency to discontinue operations one day out of the week, possibly a weekday. The agency's budget crisis forced MARTA to lay off 700 employees. Service cuts and other budget-stabilizing measures began in fiscal year 2011, with the first affected service mark-up in September 2010. Governor Sonny Perdue refused to call a special session as requested, and did not issue an executive order as he stated it would not be legal to do so.|$|E
500|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, Chemical had one of the strongest reputations in banking but as a {{business}} was in decline, losing accounts each year. [...] Unlike many of its peers, Chemical had been reluctant to expand into securities and other businesses and had not paid interest on bank accounts. [...] Both practices, considered to be highly conservative, had allowed Chemical to develop a large <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> but were not attracting customers. [...] William H. Porter, a prominent banker of the era, was named president of the bank in 1903 after the death of the previous president George G. Williams. [...] Porter would leave Chemical seven years later to become a partner at J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1910 and was succeeded by Joseph B. Martindale, who was named president in 1911.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{of these}} {{measures}} may include raising interest rates, which tends to make investors become more risk averse and thus avoid leveraged capital because the costs of borrowing may become too expensive; others may include certain countermeasures that may be taken pre-emptively during periods of strong economic growth include having the central monetary authority increase <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements and attempting to implement regulation that checks and/or prevents processes leading to over-expansion and excessive leveraging of debt.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this article is}} to present the role of {{reserves}} and provisions in determining the level of profitability of Polish public companies, especially the level of ROE (Return on Equity). This article presents also a relationship between reserves and financial results of the enterprises, such as R (net revenues from sales of product, goods and materials), EBIT (earnings before interest and tax), EBT's (profit on commercial activity; EBT - earn before tax) and EAT (earnings after tax). This paper describes three kinds of reserves: reserves as the liability (reserve for income tax, social security reserves and other reserves), accruals and deferred income, and <b>capital</b> <b>reserves,</b> such as <b>reserve</b> <b>capital,</b> revaluation <b>reserve</b> <b>capital</b> and other <b>reserve</b> <b>capital.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The {{world economy}} crisis is traced back by Sinn to {{an abuse of}} {{liability}} limitation by American investment banks. The lack of <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements gave these banks the possibility to pursue their business with inadequate capital reserves and encouraged them to gamble. In addition the lack of personal liability for homeowners created {{in a similar way}} an exaggerated willingness to take risks and thus caused the United States housing bubble. To correct this situation Sinn has called for considerably higher <b>capital</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements, the balancing of offshore business and a return to the accounting principle of the lower of cost of the German Commercial Code (HGB).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} and quantifies {{the idea}} of model risk in the environment of internal model building. We define various types of model risk including estimation risk, model risk in distribution and model risk in functional form. By the quantification of these concepts we analyze {{the impact of the}} modeling process of an econometric model on the resulting company model. Utilizing real insurance data we specify, estimate and simulate various linear and nonlinear time series models for the inflation rate and examine its impact on pension liabilities under the aspect of model risk. Under consideration of different risk measures it is shown that model risk can differ profoundly due to the specification process of the econometric model resulting in remarkable monetary differences concerning <b>capital</b> <b>reserves.</b> We furthermore propose a specification strategy for univariate time series models and demonstrate that thereby market risk and <b>capital</b> <b>reserves</b> can be reduced distinctively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} credit union loan and deposit rate setting when net income flows are uncertain and subj ect to taxation. Optimal rates are chosen to maximize the expected va lue of a performance measure based on {{a comparison of the}} credit unio n's rates to alternative rates, subject to a probabilistic constraint on the net change in <b>capital</b> <b>reserves</b> relative to a capital adequacy standard. Taxation will alter the end-of-period trade-off between th e change in <b>capital</b> <b>reserves</b> and the immediate distribution of surplu s, and would likely affect credit unions in a nonuniform manner and p erhaps be regressive in nature.

40|$|We {{report a}} study of the {{estimation}} of credit exposure and credit loss of a portfolio of derivative transactions. The estimation is performed using a Monte Carlo simulation.

We show that the simulation method provides a much richer set of information for credit risk managers. Also, depending on the current exposure {{and the nature of the}} transactions, the BIS method can fail to account for potential exposure. In addition, depending on the level or prudence one requires in setting <b>capital</b> <b>reserves,</b> the BIS reserves can be either excessive or grossly insufficient. 7 KH GUDPDWLF LQFUHDVH LQ RYHU WKH FRXQWH...|$|R
