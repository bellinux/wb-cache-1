5|$|For several years, {{between the}} March 1841 arson and 1848, court convened in various private residences. Without a {{courthouse}} in Oregon, the <b>county</b> <b>seat,</b> proposals {{to move the}} <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> began to circulate. Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand Detour and Daysville were all in contention for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it retained its status as <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> of Ogle County.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Mount Carmel {{was located}} in Edwards County. After a drought in 1820 killed a {{majority}} of the settlers, the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> was moved from Palmyra, Illinois to Albion. At that time Albion was settled primarily by English immigrants. The Americans from Mount Carmel and surrounding settlements were resentful and tried to return the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> to Mount Carmel by force. During the bickering for the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> location, Hinde ran for county commissioner in 1821 against John Buckles, receiving only two votes against Buckles' 151. In 1822 Hinde ran for the office of Illinois House of Representatives and narrowly lost to Gilbert T. Pell. On December 24, 1824 the Illinois Legislature resolved the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> issue by creating Wabash County from the eastern half of Edwards County.|$|E

5|$|By 1634, the English {{colony of}} Virginia {{consisted}} of a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It was divided into eight shires of Virginia, which were renamed as counties shortly thereafter. The area of Newport News became part of Warwick River Shire, which became Warwick County in 1637. By 1810, the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> was at Denbigh. For a short time in the mid-19th century, the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> was moved to Newport News.|$|E
5|$|During April 1887, J.I.

Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the railroad and freight service after the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.|$|E

5|$|Scott County {{was formed}} {{by an act of}} the Wisconsin Territorial {{legislature}} in 1837. Both Davenport and its neighbor Rockingham campaigned to become the <b>county</b> <b>seat.</b> The city with the most votes from Scott County citizens in the February 1838 election would become the <b>county</b> <b>seat.</b> On the eve of the election, Davenport citizens acquired the temporary service of Dubuque laborers so they could vote in the election. Davenport won the election {{with the help of the}} laborers. Rockingham supporters protested the elections to the territorial governor, on the grounds the laborers from Dubuque were not Scott County residents. The governor refused to certify the results of the election. A second election was held the following August. To avoid another import of voters, the governor set a 60-day residency requirement for all voters. Davenport won by two votes. Because the margin of victory was so close, a third election was held in the summer of 1840. As the August election drew nearer, Rockingham residents grew tired of the <b>county</b> <b>seat</b> cause. Davenport easily won the third election. Consequently, to avoid questions about the <b>county</b> <b>seat,</b> Davenport quickly built the first county courthouse.|$|E
