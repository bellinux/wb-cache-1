Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments {{cast doubt on the}} theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.|$|E
25|$|NatA {{may also}} {{regulate}} co-translational protein folding and protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum, possibly through competition with SRP and NAC {{for the same}} ribosomal binding sites or through yet unknown interference with other ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factors, such as the MetAPs, the chaperones Hsp70/Hsp40, SRP and NAC, which act on newly synthesized proteins {{as soon as they}} emerge from the ribosome exit tunnel. However, the exact mechanism of such action is obscure. Apart from this, Naa15 has been linked to many cellular processes, including the maintenance of a healthy retina, endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>permeability,</b> tumor progression, generation and differentiation of neurons apoptosis and transcriptional regulation; however, it is not well understood whether these are NatA-independent or -dependent functions of Naa15.|$|E
25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{membrane}} theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations {{such as the ability}} of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties). Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form, and that the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water. They demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and fibrin gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.|$|E
40|$|Drug {{efficacy}} {{depends on}} the amount of a preparation reaching the target tissue (grade of tissue transfer). In this experiment, we established the normal albumin concentration of a healthy adult (600 μ M) or a low-albumin state indicating marked liver hypofunction (100 μ M) on a cell membrane plate, and evaluated the <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> of the probe agents. The <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> of phenytoin or valproate depended on the concentration of albumin. Probe agent site-I and -II inhibitors, bucolome and oleic acid, respectively, increased the <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability.</b> In the future, the <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> of probe agents should be further investigated to estimate the tissue transfer of agents based on various laboratory data (albumin, free fatty acids, uremic toxins, and bilirubin) ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{order to}} perform {{analysis}} of apoptotic versus necrotic (necroptotic) cells, {{one can do}} analysis of morphology by time-lapse microscopy, flow fluorocytometry, and transmission electron microscopy. There are [...] also various biochemical techniques for analysis of cell surface markers (phosphatidylserine exposure versus <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> by flow cytometry), cellular markers such as DNA fragmentation (flow cytometry), caspase activation, Bid cleavage, and cytochrome c release (Western blotting). It {{is important to know}} how primary and secondary necrotic cells can be distinguished by analysis of supernatant for caspases, HMGB1, and release of cytokeratin 18. However, no distinct surface or biochemical markers of necrotic cell death have been identified yet, and only negative markers are available. These include absence of apoptotic markers (caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation) and differential kinetics of cell death markers (phosphatidylserine exposure and cell membrane permeabilization). A selection of techniques {{that can be used to}} distinguish apoptosis from necroptotic cells could be found in these references.|$|E

50|$|Osmotic diuretics (e.g. mannitol) are {{substances}} that increase osmolality but have limited tubular epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>permeability.</b> They work primarily by expanding extracellular fluid and plasma volume, therefore increasing {{blood flow to}} the kidney, particularly the peritubular capillaries. This reduces medullary osmolality and thus impairs the concentration of urine in the loop of Henle (which usually uses the high osmotic and solute gradient to transport solutes and water). Furthermore, the limited tubular epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> increases osmolality and thus water retention in the filtrate.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that ultrahigh frequency sound (ultrasound) {{may be used to}} drive chemicals into living tissues. This process is called phonophoresis. It is thought that ultrasound's demonstrated ability to increase <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> may be a major factor in this process, allowing whole molecules of a particular medication (if small enough) to be driven into the tissues (hydrocortisol is a prime cited example). Additionally, it is thought that increased <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> may be augmented by radiation pressure produced by the ultrasound, forcing the medication away from the transducer head into the tissues...|$|R
5000|$|Emamectin {{works as}} a {{chloride}} channel activator by binding gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor and glutamate-gated chloride channels disrupting nerve signals within arthropods.The compound stimulates the release of GABA from the synapses between nerve cells and while additionally increasing GABA’s affinity for its receptor on the post-junction membrane of muscle cells in insects and arthropods. [...] The stronger binding of GABA increases the <b>cells</b> <b>permeability</b> to chloride ions within the cell due to the hypotonic concentration gradient. [...] Neurotransmission is thereby reduced by subsequent hyperpolarisation {{and the elimination of}} signal transduction.|$|R

In diabetic mellitus type 2 patients with postinfarct heart failure who were undergoing surgical coronary revascularization, myocardial levels of CA1 were sixfold higher than nondiabetic patients. Elevated CA1 expression was mainly localized in the cardiac interstitium and endothelial cells. Furthermore, high glucose-induced elevation of CA1 hampers endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> and determines endothelial cell apoptosis in vitro.|$|E
50|$|Blockage of the Leloir pathway by GALE {{deficiency}} or dysfunction activates alternate pathways of {{glucose metabolism}} {{and leads to}} galactitol and galactonate formation. Galactonate is metabolized by the pentose phosphate pathway, and is not considered toxic. Galactitol, however, may accumulate in lens fibers, perturbing lens epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> and leading to cell death and cataract formation. GALE deficiency also perturbs glycolipid and glycoprotein biosynthesis due to decreased production of UDP-GalNAc from UDP-GlcNAc.|$|E
40|$|A laboratory-derived mutant of Candida albicans B 311 (L) and a {{clinical}} isolate (C) of C. albicans, both lacking membrane ergosterol, were {{less susceptible to}} amphotericin B (AmB) -induced <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> to K+ and lethality than was the wild-type laboratory strain (B 311) which contained ergosterol. The resistance of L and C to AmB-induced killing was {{much greater than the}} level of resistance to AmB-induced <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability.</b> L and C were also less susceptible to killing by H 2 O 2 than was B 311, and when treated with menadione, they each produced less H 2 O 2 than did B 311. In addition, their levels of catalase activity were 3. 8 -fold (L) and 2 -fold (C) higher than that of B 311. The ergosterol deficiency in L and C probably impaired AmB binding to the cells, thereby lowering AmB effectiveness as measured by both <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> and killing. Resistance of strains L and C to oxidation-dependent damage likely contributed to a diminished response to AmB-induced lethality...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} large polyenes (heptaenes and the "degenerate heptaene" nystatin) on human {{erythrocytes}} {{were found to}} occur in three separate stages. Stage I was a reversible increase in <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> to monovalent cations and occurred at low antibiotic concentrations. At intermediate antibiotic concentrations, an irreversible increase in <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> to cations (stage II) occurred, which then led to swelling of cells and hemolysis (stage III). Hemolysis could be prevented by sucrose, mannitol, or melezitose, but stages I and II still occurred under these conditions. The effects of the small polyenes (pentaenes and a tetraene) occurred in only one stage. Changes in <b>cell</b> membrane <b>permeability</b> (stages I and II) were not noted before hemolysis (stage III) even {{in the presence of}} carbohydrate. Carbohydrates gave only weak, transient protection from the hemolytic action of small polyenes, probably because the membrane damage induced by these antibiotics was more extensive than that induced by the large polyenes. In the presence of sucrose, large polyenes were able to inhibit the hemolytic action of small polyenes, implying that both antibiotics have the same binding sites...|$|R

The alteration of <b>cell</b> surface <b>permeability</b> was confirmed by NPN and crystal violet assay, performed under identical experimental conditions. In the present research work we have selected a range of concentration, along with different time intervals 30, 60, 90 and 120  min for studying the effect of both concentration as well as time of exposure, for {{a better understanding of}} the drug action.|$|R
5000|$|Low-level {{quinolone}} resistance {{has been}} linked to changes in <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> and efflux pumps.

It is also known that a point mutation upstream of the norM gene will causes overexpression of NorM, and mediate elevated resistance.|$|E
50|$|L-690,330 is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of IMPase activity with very good activity in vitro however with limited bioavailability in vivo. Due to its increased specificity compared to Lithium, L-690,330 {{has been used}} extensively in characterizing the results of IMPase inhibition in various cell culture models. L-690,488, a prodrug or L-690,330, has also been developed which has greater <b>cell</b> <b>permeability.</b> Treatment of cortical slices with L-690,488 resulted in accumulation of inositol demonstrating the activity of this inhibitor in tissue.|$|E
50|$|P. paulista {{features}} a peptide Polybia-MP1 that causes increased permeability in cells featuring phospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) {{on the outer}} membrane. As cancer cells feature the PS and PE phospholipids {{on the outside of}} the cell membrane, unlike with non-cancerous cells where they usually remain on the inside of the cell membrane, they are susceptible to the peptide which causes increased <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> to a degree that molecules critical for cell function may leak out.|$|E
30|$|The {{work was}} carried out to {{establish}} a relationship between altered surface potential of the bacteria (represented as Zeta potential) with that of <b>cell</b> surface <b>permeability</b> and poly dispersity index, following exposure to surface acting agents. Hence, in the present study, the cells (Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria) were treated with surface active agents [cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and polymyxin B] and also with ampicillin, an antiobiotic, known to work through inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis. Thus {{an attempt was made}} to understand the role of these agents on cell membrane architecture, using Zeta potentials a tool for studying the alteration in bacterial <b>cell</b> surface <b>permeability</b> and subsequent bacterial viability.|$|R

Oligodendrocyte response to perforin attack was heterogeneous, ranging from small, transient increases in cytosolic calcium to rapid cell death. Changes in cytosolic calcium occurred in all cells and about half of the cells also became permeable to propidium iodide. Only a minority of these cells proceeded to lysis, as evidenced by loss of fura- 2.

50|$|The {{chemical}} structure of SOD mimetics generally consists of manganese, iron, or copper (and zinc) coordination complexes.

Manganese (II) and iron (III) complexes are commonly used due to their high kinetic and thermodynamic stability, increasing the half-life of the mimetic. However, manganese-based SOD mimetics {{are found to be}} more therapeutically effective than their counterparts due to their low toxicity, higher catalytic activity, and increased stability in vivo.|$|E
50|$|The azide {{group is}} {{particularly}} bioorthogonal {{because it is}} extremely small (favorable for <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> and avoids perturbations), metabolically stable, and does not naturally exist in cells and thus has no competing biological side reactions. Although azides are not the most reactive 1,3-dipole available for reaction, they are preferred for their relative lack of side reactions and stability in typical synthetic conditions. The alkyne is not as small, but it still has the stability and orthogonality necessary for in vivo labeling. Cyclooctynes were selected as the smallest stable alkyne ring which increases reactivity through ring strain which has calculated to be 19.9 kcal/mol.|$|E
50|$|Glufosfamide, being a {{conjugate}} of glucose {{and active}} alkylating moiety of ifosfamide, has the better <b>cell</b> <b>permeability</b> than the parent compound — ifosfamide — or its metabolites.

And the glucose uptake mechanism is grossly overexpressed and upregulated in certain cancer cell lines, especially pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme. This, theoretically, should render them {{more sensitive to the}} alkylating effects of glufosfamide while relatively sparing (doing relatively little collateral damage) to the normal cells in which the glucose uptake mechanism is not so upregulated.|$|E
