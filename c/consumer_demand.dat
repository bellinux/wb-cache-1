It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom, a stringer who records violent events late at night in Los Angeles, and sells the footage to a local television news station.

5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. <b>Consumer</b> <b>demand</b> is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E
40|$|In {{smart grid}} paradigm, the <b>consumer</b> <b>demands</b> are random and time-dependent, owning towards {{stochastic}} probabilities. The stochastically varying <b>consumer</b> <b>demands</b> {{have put the}} policy makers and supplying agencies in a demanding position for optimal generation management. The utility revenue functions are highly dependent on the <b>consumer</b> deterministic stochastic <b>demand</b> models. The sudden drifts in weather parameters effects the living standards of the consumers that in turn influence the power demands. Considering above, we analyzed stochastically and statistically the effect of random <b>consumer</b> <b>demands</b> on the fixed and variable revenues of the electrical utilities. Our work presented the Multi-Variate Gaussian Distribution Function (MVGDF) probabilistic model of the utility revenues with time-dependent <b>consumer</b> random <b>demands.</b> Moreover, the Gaussian probabilities outcome of the utility revenues {{is based on the}} varying <b>consumer</b> n <b>demands</b> data-pattern. Furthermore, Standard Monte Carlo (SMC) simulations are performed that validated the factor of accuracy in the aforesaid probabilistic demand-revenue model. We critically analyzed the effect of weather data parameters on <b>consumer</b> <b>demands</b> using correlation and multi-linear regression schemes. The statistical analysis of <b>consumer</b> <b>demands</b> provided a relationship between dependent (demand) and independent variables (weather data) for utility load management, generation control, and network expansion...|$|R
30|$|On the consumer’s side, {{the process}} of {{monitoring}} and controlling <b>consumer’s</b> <b>demand</b> energy usage profile is called home energy management (HEM) (Hosseini et al. 2017). This process {{involves the use of}} smart meters, smart appliances, information and communication technology etc. the smart meters collect data about <b>consumer’s</b> <b>demand</b> at the different time period and transmit this collected data to the power generation unit. On the power generation unit side, this data is analyzed and response according to the <b>consumer’s</b> <b>demand.</b> Sometimes, <b>consumer’s</b> <b>demands</b> exceed from available energy power at the grid side. This creates unbalance situation of the power system. To handle this issue, the concept of demand response management (DRM) (Soares et al. 2017) has been introduced.|$|R

5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive <b>consumer</b> <b>demand</b> as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{introduction}} of a veal-based sandwich raised the ire of animal rights groups. By 1982, several groups were alleging that the veal being sourced to Burger King was most likely kept in battery cages, unable to move, and fed a low iron diet designed to produce the lightly toned meat associated with veal. As {{a result of this}} protest, these groups lead a three-country boycott of Burger King in April 1982. Critics of the boycott claimed that the type of veal that was being used was more-likely to be free range veal due to cost issues, claiming that there is simply no way a $2.00 sandwich would use the higher quality $15.00/lb veal. The rights groups refused to back down despite the cost claims because Burger King would only release the name of the meat processor, not its veal suppliers. The chain eventually announced that it intended to pull the sandwich from the market, stating that it was not because of the boycotts but because {{there was a lack of}} <b>consumer</b> <b>demand.</b> In fact, the chain said the sandwich sold best in the markets where the majority of the protests were occurring.|$|E
