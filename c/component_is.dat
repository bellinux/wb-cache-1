5|$|On September 13, 2017, it was {{announced}} via Nintendo Direct that Doom would release on Nintendo Switch during {{the fourth quarter of}} 2017. The retail Switch version differs from the other console versions in that the multiplayer <b>component</b> <b>is</b> not included in the base product, but is instead offered as a free download, whereas the SnapMap <b>component</b> <b>is</b> not included at all, both changes as a result of cartridge limitations. It was released on November 10, 2017.|$|E
5|$|After initial aliveness {{testing that}} showed no issues, STIS {{was taken into}} {{functional}} testing, and issues were seen when the telescope put itself into safe mode due to a low thermal limit sensor. Ground controllers at Goddard would restart the testing once the thermal limit sensor was back in normal sensor range, but it is believed the <b>component</b> <b>is</b> in good shape.|$|E
5|$|Gamma Circini is {{a binary}} star 450light-years away, whose {{components}} need a telescope of 150mm to be seen, {{as they are}} only 0.8 arcseconds apart. The brighter <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a bluish Be star of spectral type B5IV+ and magnitude 4.51, while the dimmer <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a yellow star of magnitude 5.5. They orbit each other every 180 years. Delta Circini is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5.1 and 13.4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3.9 days. The brighter <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a close eclipsing binary (specifically, a rotating ellipsoidal variable), with a minor dip of magnitude (0.1). Both are hot blue stars of spectral types O7III-V and O9.5V, respectively, and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times the Sun's mass. Over 3600light-years away, this system would outshine Venus at magnitude −4.8 if it were 32light-years (10parsecs) distant. The two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds, resolvable {{to the naked eye}} for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with a telescope.|$|E

50|$|To {{make the}} {{illumination}} {{of an image}} more even, the high-frequency <b>components</b> <b>are</b> increased and low-frequency <b>components</b> <b>are</b> decreased, because the high-frequency <b>components</b> <b>are</b> assumed to represent mostly the reflectance in the scene (the amount of light reflected off the object in the scene), whereas the low-frequency <b>components</b> <b>are</b> assumed to represent mostly the illumination in the scene.

5|$|Iota1 Normae is a {{multiple}} star system. The AB (mag 5.2 and 5.76) pair orbit {{each other with}} a period of 26.9years; they are 2.77 and 2.71times as massive as the Sun respectively. The pair are 128 ± 6light-years distant from Earth. A third <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V with an apparent magnitude of 8.02.|$|E
5|$|The {{star system}} is the {{prototype}} {{of a group of}} eclipsing binary stars named Algol variables, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a triple star system. The brightest <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary <b>component</b> <b>is</b> an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose primary <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other. The primary star is a Be star of spectral type B0.5, possibly a giant star, and the secondary companion is likely a stellar remnant. The secondary has a similar spectral type to O-type subdwarfs.|$|E
5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width. One {{possible explanation is}} that the ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited by a small moonlet just inside it. The sharp outer edge of the δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow <b>component</b> <b>is</b> 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad <b>component</b> <b>is</b> about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad <b>component</b> <b>is</b> geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E

5|$|The η ring has zero orbital {{eccentricity}} and inclination. Like the δ ring, {{it consists of}} two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow <b>component</b> <b>is</b> 1.9–2.7km and the equivalent depth is about 0.42km, which corresponds to the normal optical depth of about 0.16–0.25. The broad <b>component</b> <b>is</b> about 40km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.85km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 2×10−2. It was resolved in Voyager 2 images. In forward-scattered light, the η ring looked bright, which indicated {{the presence of a}} considerable amount of dust in this ring, probably in the broad component. The broad <b>component</b> <b>is</b> much thicker (geometrically) than the narrow one. This conclusion is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the η ring demonstrated increased brightness, becoming the second brightest feature in the ring system. This is consistent with the behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring. Like the majority of other rings, the η ring shows significant azimuthal variations in the normal optical depth and width. The narrow component even vanishes in some places.|$|E
5|$|Vesta's {{surface is}} covered by {{regolith}} distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark <b>component</b> <b>is</b> {{probably due to the}} infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright <b>component</b> <b>is</b> the original Vesta basaltic soil.|$|E
5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either an edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests in which every <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a 1-tree.|$|E

The main differences between renewable diesel and jet blending <b>components</b> <b>is</b> that the jet blending <b>components</b> <b>are</b> more volatile, have a lower cetane number and a much lower cloud point. In this study, different percentages of hydrotreated renewable diesel and jet <b>components</b> <b>were</b> blended into an ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel and their effect on homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion and emissions performance was investigated.

5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} value of a sport depends on the culture and country {{in which it is}} played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social <b>component</b> <b>is</b> more important than the competitive.|$|E
5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture {{may have contributed to}} the historic Shoshones, but it is not well understood. Another poorly understood early cultural <b>component</b> <b>is</b> called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One <b>component</b> <b>is</b> a {{red dwarf star}} of {{spectral}} type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E

5|$|The linear <b>component</b> <b>is</b> active {{when the}} tissue {{pressure}} exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of these emissions {{are thought to be}} produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce {{back and forth between the}} poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk. The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM <b>component</b> <b>is</b> about 100GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1GW.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{component}} of the F-FDTL was established in December 2001 when Portugal transferred two small Albatroz-class patrol boats from the Portuguese Navy.
