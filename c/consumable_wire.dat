In this paper, results on the optimization of this geometry with an adapted laser scan width are presented. An average connection angle of 93 degrees has been achieved on the side of the weld, where additional seams are placed.

50|$|Wire arc spray {{is a form}} {{of thermal}} {{spraying}} where two <b>consumable</b> metal <b>wires</b> are fed independently into the spray gun. These wires are then charged and an arc is generated between them. The heat from this arc melts the incoming wire, which is then entrained in an air jet from the gun. This entrained molten feedstock is then deposited onto a substrate with the help of compressed air. This process is commonly used for metallic, heavy coatings.|$|R

40|$|Spray forming {{produces}} cast microstructures with comparatively low macro- and micro-structural chemical {{segregation and}} is thus well-suited for the manufacture of complex chemistry, multi-component alloys that otherwise show strong elemental segregation. Although spray formed Ni superalloys have shown properties equivalent or superior to their conventionally cast/wrought counterparts, {{they have not been}} adopted commercially because of the difficulties in ensuring a high process yield and the complexity and associated cost of large-scale Ni superalloy melting. In this paper, we describe a hybrid arc spray forming (HASF) process in which costly, large-scale alloy melting as pre-cursor to spray forming is avoided by the use of a <b>consumable</b> <b>wire</b> feedstock. To achieve thermal conditions of melt spray forming - essential to produce a refined, polygonal grain structure - a customised secondary atomisation system has been developed.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} work was to build and {{validate}} a back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) to predict the level of diffusible hydrogen (HD) based {{on a variety of}} flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) parameters such as welding current, contact-tip to work piece distance (CTWD) and shielding gas type for single run, horizontal bead-on-plate steel welds using seamed and seamless rutile <b>consumable</b> <b>wires</b> (Model 1). A probabilistic artificial neural network model (PANN) was then applied to determine the likelihood of hydrogen assisted cold cracking (HACC) in a gapped bead-on-plate (GBOP) test based on the level of HD and welding preheat temperature (Model 2). This approach could be applied to ‘real life’ situations with the availability of sufficient data. Results are also presented for a sensitivity analysis for Model 1, which identifies the key input variables and the effect they have on the output, HD. It was determined that the consumable type and the CTWD were the key variables. A seamless consumable with a H 5 classification and an increase in the CTWD, as well as increases in current led mostly to a decrease in the level of diffusible hydrogen. Additionally, Model 1 predicted that using a 25 %CO 2 – 75 %Ar shielding gas, instead of 100 %CO 2, and an increase in absolute humidity (a function of relative humidity and temperature) in the surrounding atmosphere led to an increase in diffusible hydrogen deposited into the weld metal (WM). Finally, based on the predictions of Model 2 it was established that for the given welding conditions hydrogen cracking in a GBOP test could be avoided by maintaining hydrogen levels at less than ∼ 3 mL/ 100 g or using a preheat temperature slightly higher than 100 °C. Analysis of the data also led to the conclusion that further data were required for the GBOP tests when the hydrogen levels were between 4 and 8 mL/ 100 g to correct and improve confidence {{in this part of the}} model...|$|R

40|$|Cast nickel {{aluminum}} bronze (NAB) alloy {{is widely}} used for large engineering components in marine applications due to its excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Casting porosity, as well as coarse microstructure, however, are accompanied by a decrease in mechanical properties of cast NAB components. Although heat treatment, friction stir processing, and fusion welding were implemented to eliminate porosity, improve mechanical properties, and refine the microstructure of as-cast metal, their applications are limited to either surface modification or component repair. Instead of traditional casting techniques, this study focuses on developing NAB components using recently expanded wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). <b>Consumable</b> welding <b>wire</b> is melted and deposited layer-by-layer on substrates producing near-net shaped NAB components. Additively-manufactured NAB components without post-processing are fully dense, and exhibit fine microstructure, as well as comparable mechanical properties, to as-cast NAB alloy.

40|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) of {{stainless}} steel to carbon steel plate can produce a number of quality problems. Lack of control of the <b>consumable</b> <b>wire</b> position within the weld preparation can lead to uneven dilution from the parent plates. In addition a relatively heavy but equal dilution from both parent plates will also create problems. In the situation of SAW of duplex stainless steel to carbon steel with a Y weld preparation, which had a 4 mm nose on it, an undesirable situation was created, in which hard zones in the weld metal were observed. In addition, {{it was found that}} a bias of the electrode wire to the carbon steel side of the weld preparation created a situation where excessively high hardness measurements occurred (> 600 HV 10). Those specific regions were found to contain martensite, which was positively identified using selected area electron diffraction in a TEM investigation on thin foils taken from the high hardness region. A V weld preparation with central positioning of the consumable resulted in acceptable hardness levels in the root region combined with a skeletal ferrite microstructure. This allowed the dilution in the root area to be reduced, whilst achieving a balanced parent plate dilution in the remainder of the weld from the SAW process...|$|E
40|$|Extending the {{weldability}} {{of novel}} materials, {{and improving the}} weld quality by tailoring weld microstructures are key factors to obtain the welding techniques demanded in the modern manufacturing industries. This can be done, for example, by feeding chemical elements from a <b>consumable</b> <b>wire</b> into the weld pool during welding. The mixing of chemical components in the weld pool and the resulting post-solidification weld microstructures are influenced by weld pool hydrodynamics. Weld pool hydrodynamics {{is known to be}} primarily driven by Marangoni forces acting at the free liquid surface, i. e by tangential gradients in surface tension along the liquid surface due to pronounced lateral gradients in temperature and surface active element concentration. In this research, we develop a Computational Fluid Dynamics model to study steel weld pool hydrodynamics during conduction mode laser spot welding. It is concluded that free surface deformations and instabilities have a strong impact on the fluid flow and heat transfer in weld pools, and should therefore be accounted for in weld pool simulations. With increasing the surface active element concentration and laser power, the weld pool flow becomes highly unstable and can no longer be accurately modeled with a flat surface assumption. More accurate predictions of weld pool physics can be made if the free surface, solidification stage, and three-dimensionality are taken into account. This reduces the need for the use of unphysical parameter fittings widely reported in literature. Multi Scale PhysicsApplied Science...|$|E
30|$|In {{electric}} arc spray process (also called as the wire arc process), a high direct-current {{is connected with}} two <b>consumable</b> <b>wire</b> electrodes which are fed into the gun. This establishes an arc between them which melts the tips of wire. Atomized molten metal is propelled towards the substrate through a stream of air. As all the input energy is used to melt the metal, therefore, the process is energy efficient [91]. Spray rates are driven mainly by operating current and vary {{as a function of}} both conductivity and melting point. Normally, materials such as iron-base and copper-base alloy sprays at 4.5  kg (10  lb)/ 100 A/h are used. Since no jet of hot air gas is directed towards the substrate, substrate temperature is low. Electric arc spraying can also be done using inert gases or in a controlled-atmospheric temperature [92]. Greater bonding strengths, lower porosity and higher spray rates are attained using flame spraying technique. However, it produces ozone, arc light and fume which may cause problems in many situations. Arc spraying has the maximum deposition rate, with rates of 15  kg/h or higher. The process offers lesser-cost coatings when compared with plasma and HVOF spraying. This is because of high deposition rates, lesser energy cost and lower material costs which is incurred compared with a wire consumable technique. Arc spraying is beneficial in metallizing thermally sensitive substrates such as capacitors and other similar electronic components because of the low heating of substrate. Two dissimilar wires can produce an intimately mixed coating which can be sprayed. Lower porosity levels can be attained by flame spraying. Arc spraying process does not make use of combustion gases or do not generate high-energy plasma, thus possessing lesser health and safety risks than other thermal spray processes [93]. This process can be used to spray only electrically conductive materials that are accessible in an appropriate wire form. It is not fit for spraying cermet or ceramics. Arc-sprayed coatings usually contain extra porosity and higher amounts of oxide and have lesser bond strengths compared with coatings deposited by HVOF and Plasma spraying [94].|$|E

Chemical analyses of the collected fume indicated that in most instances power source type did not have a major influence on the chemical composition.

40|$|The ternary Al-Cu-Mg system 2 xxx series {{aluminium}} alloys were examined as construction materials for armour system applications based upon comparable ballistic properties to the currently employed Al- 7 xxx series alloys. Utilising MIG welding solidification cracking was evident when welding constrained Al- 2024 candidate base material using Al- 2319 filler, the only available <b>consumable</b> <b>wire</b> for this series. A previously developed thermodynamic model suggested that an incompatible weld chemistry resulted when welding with this filler which {{would result in}} hot cracking due to a wide weld pool freezing range and a low volume fraction of eutectic liquid. As this filler wire was the only commercially available Al- 2 xxx filler this {{was seen as the}} principal limiting factor for exploiting this alloy series. The solution was to vary and control weld chemistry. Two approaches were taken. Firstly advanced arc welding was used to control weld dilution with the base material. A clad layer exhibiting a less crack susceptible composition was deposited using the Cold Metal Transfer process and the binary Al- 2319 filler wire. Onto this layer the same filler could then be deposited to provide a structural joint. Although not fully validated, by limiting weld dilution with the base material this technique showed potential as an alternative method for suppressing solidification cracking. The second approach, which forms the core of this work, adapted the conventional tandem MIG welding process to mix different series consumable fillers in a single weld pool to control weld composition. A range of ternary weld mixtures were produced which resulted {{in the development of a}} robust thermodynamic model. Validation using this system resulted in weld cracking being eradicated. The concept was then further developed to weld using three filler wires; this expanded the mixing range and allowed further model validation. A range of crack free compositions were produced with differing mechanical properties. An optimum weld composition was determined that was then used for characterisation of the weldment. By varying heat input, base material HAZ softening was controlled with joint failure confined to the weld / base material interface. This was attributed to grain boundary liquation due to the welding temperatures involved resulting in solute rich grain boundaries. These areas did not deform easily under tensile loading initiating fracture of the joint. Acceptable joint strengths were realised however ductility was reduced due to the identified failure mode. Although not tested to military specifications, acceptable mechanical test values were recorded which were closely compliant with the minimum requirements for armour system specifications. As a consequence a filler wire composition was recommended for future prototype development. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Residual {{stress is}} a complex subject which {{requires}} {{clear understanding of the}} phenomenon before any serious attempt in measuring it can be made. A variety of different phenomena is often lumped together under one collective name as residual stress and to complicate it further, these various types of residual stress can exist simultaneously together in an elastic body. Hence when interest is focussed on a specific type of residual stress, not only a distinction in identifying the type of residual stress is required, but it is imperative to be able to separate the various types of residual stress during its measurement. The magnitude and distribution of residual welding stresses produced in plates due to fusion welding are determined from X-ray diffraction measurements. In the investigation, the gas metal-arc welding process, using CO₂ as shielding gas and 1. 2 mm <b>consumable</b> solid <b>wire</b> as electrode, is employed. Residual stresses arising out of two different methods of metal transfer by this process, namely the spray and short-circuiting arc methods, are measured and compared. Effects of edge preparation and weld length upon the residual welding stress patterns are investigated. Results obtained so far from X-ray measurements have indicated large scatter of experimental points on the residual stress patterns. The author believes it can be attributed to local variation in initial stresses present in the plates before welding. Large variation in initial stress distribution can plausibly obscure the residual welding stress patterns sought in the present investigation. An interesting question immediately arises from this, namely how the initial stresses add on to the residual welding stresses during welding. This problem has been discussed in length in section 1. 2. The main school of throught supports simple additiveness of the two types of residual stress. However, conclusive evidence is lacking in this conjecture. This is mainly attributable to the lack of 'the' method of residual stress measurement upon which reliability can be confidently placed. Various methods of residual stress measurement have been discussed in section 1. 5 and the difference in characteristics is discussed in section 2. 4. It would appear that each method has its own drawbacks which are serious when accurate measurements of residual stress are required. The main drawback with the X-ray methods is the shallow effective penetration of the diffracted x-rays, and thus the method could only reveal surface stresses present in the surface layer of the elastic body. Problems peculiar to the X-ray methods are discussed in Chapter Six where the effects of surface preparation and preferred orientation on X-ray stress measurements are presented...|$|R
