5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent <b>centrifuges</b> were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in <b>centrifuges</b> that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
25|$|Fordow, {{the nuclear}} {{facility}} near Qom, contains 16 cascades, equally divided between Unit 1 and Unit 2, {{with a total}} of 2,710 <b>centrifuges.</b> Iran is continuing to operate the four cascades of 174 IR-1 <b>centrifuges</b> each in two tandem sets to produce 19.75% LEU in a total of 696 enriching <b>centrifuges,</b> the same number of <b>centrifuges</b> enriching as was reported in November 2012.|$|E
50|$|Both the conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> and chamber bowl <b>centrifuge</b> can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the {{advantage}} of conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> over chamber bowl <b>centrifuge</b> is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate. The chamber bowl has a high capacity for solids but there is no solid discharge.Bowl cooling is possible for both conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> and chamber bowl <b>centrifuge.</b> However, cleaning is easier as well as better sludge dewatering in chamber bowl <b>centrifuge</b> as compared to conical plate <b>centrifuge.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reticulated porous {{ceramics}} (RPCs) with uniform structure were fabricated by a two-step <b>centrifuging</b> process. The two-step <b>centrifuging</b> process {{includes two}} <b>centrifuging</b> steps. In the first stage, the polyurethane sponges are coated with thin slurry through high speed <b>centrifuging</b> process. In the second stage, the as-prepared dried green body was recoated with thixotropic slurry through <b>centrifuging</b> process with an appropriate <b>centrifuging</b> speed. According to the results, the RPCs with controlled structure can be fabricated by modulating the rotation speed {{in the second}} <b>centrifuging</b> process...|$|R

25|$|On 21 February, the IAEA {{released}} a report showing continued expansion in Iranian uranium enrichment capabilities.

25|$|By {{the mid-1950s}} Brazil's nuclear program had not {{advanced}} significantly, {{except for the}} US$80,000 purchase of 3 West German <b>centrifuges.</b> Although the <b>centrifuges</b> arrived in Brazil in 1956, they only became operational in the 1970s.

25|$|According to The Washington Post, IAEA cameras {{installed}} in the Natanz facility recorded the sudden dismantling and removal of approximately 900–1,000 <b>centrifuges</b> during the time the Stuxnet worm was reportedly active at the plant. Iranian technicians, however, were able to quickly replace the <b>centrifuges</b> and the report concluded that uranium enrichment was likely only briefly disrupted.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} separation processes {{similar to the}} belt filter press used for dewatering, including <b>centrifuges,</b> vacuum-disc filters, and the {{plate and frame filter}} press. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures.

25|$|In {{order of}} {{increasing}} cost and decreasing product moisture {{the most common}} dewatering options are a thickener, deep bed thickening, belt presses and membrane filter presses. In general <b>centrifuges</b> and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt press filter, for the same cake dryness.

25|$|Stuxnet {{specifically}} targets {{programmable logic}} controllers (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or <b>centrifuges</b> for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four zero-day flaws, Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning <b>centrifuges</b> to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet’s design and architecture are not domain-specific {{and it could be}} tailored as a platform for attacking modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), the majority of which reside in Europe, Japan and the US. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one fifth of Iran's nuclear <b>centrifuges.</b> Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.|$|E
25|$|The worm {{worked by}} first causing an {{infected}} Iranian IR-1 centrifuge to increase from its normal operating speed of 1,064 hertz to 1,410 hertz for 15 minutes {{before returning to}} its normal frequency. Twenty-seven days later, the worm went back into action, slowing the infected <b>centrifuges</b> down to a few hundred hertz for a full 50 minutes. The stresses from the excessive, then slower, speeds caused the aluminum centrifugal tubes to expand, often forcing parts of the <b>centrifuges</b> into sufficient {{contact with each other}} to destroy the machine.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} John Bumgarner, a former {{intelligence}} officer {{and member of}} the United States Cyber-Consequences Unit (US-CCU), published an article prior to Stuxnet being discovered or deciphered, that outlined a strategic cyber strike on <b>centrifuges</b> and suggests that cyber attacks are permissible against nation states which are operating uranium enrichment programs that violate international treaties gives some credibility to these claims. Bumgarner pointed out that the <b>centrifuges</b> used to process fuel for nuclear weapons are a key target for cybertage operations and that they can be made to destroy themselves by manipulating their rotational speeds.|$|E
25|$|A theory {{popular in}} the mid-1990s was that red mercury {{facilitated}} the enrichment of uranium to weapons-grade purity. Conventionally, such enrichment is usually done with Zippe-type <b>centrifuges,</b> and takes several years. Red mercury was speculated to eliminate this costly and time-consuming step. Although this would not eliminate the possibility of detecting the material, it could escape detection during enrichment as the facilities hosting <b>centrifuges</b> normally used in this process are very large and require equipment that can be fairly easily tracked internationally. Eliminating such equipment would in theory greatly ease {{the construction of a}} clandestine nuclear weapon.|$|E

Improved <b>centrifuge</b> recovery at a low feedrate was offset by poorer inclusion body paste purity. This reduced purity resulted in a significant loss of protein during inclusion-body dissolution due to proteolysis. Multiple <b>centrifuge</b> passes improved the inclusion-body paste purity. This resulted in a net improvement in the overall protein yield following dissolution. This work demonstrates that a strong interaction exists between <b>centrifuge</b> performance and inclusion-body dissolution for protease-sensitive products such as Gly-IGF-II...|$|R
