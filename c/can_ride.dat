5|$|In various {{sections}} of the game, the player <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> a Triumph motorcycle, or a snowmobile. Other segments of the game involve boss fights. If the player chooses to be sneaky, they can overhear humorous conversations between non-player characters, such as guards, scientists and civilians. Occasionally, the player can engage in conversations with such characters. In certain cutscenes, the game uses a dialog tree, in which the player can choose between different questions and responses when talking to another character.|$|E
5|$|Players journey between field screen {{locations}} {{on the world}} map, a three dimensional, downsized representation of Final Fantasy IXs world presented from a top-down perspective. Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain like bodies of water or mountain ranges. To overcome geographical limitations, players <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> chocobos, sail on a boat or pilot airships. Like previous Final Fantasy installments, travel across the world map screen and hostile field screen locations is interrupted by random enemy encounters.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} second act, players can journey between field screen {{locations}} via the world map, a downsized representation of Final Fantasy VIIs world. Players can freely navigate the world map screen unless restricted by geographical obstacles, such as water or mountains. To overcome this, players <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> emu-like chocobos and various vehicles available to them, though usage is limited. As in other Final Fantasy-related games, travel across the world map screen and hostile areas is frequently interrupted by random enemy encounters.|$|E

5|$|The 5 o'clock wave is {{a fictional}} theory on {{the reasons for}} Wagga Wagga's {{sporting}} success. According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o'clock arrives a giant wave which flushes a secret nutrient into the Murrumbidgee River following the release {{of water from the}} Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The wave is said to continue down river at high speed, and indeed visitors are told it is so powerful that surfers <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> it along the meandering river until it reaches the town of Narrandera.|$|E
5|$|The Tramway Museum, St Kilda {{is built}} {{on the site of}} the 1902 school and showcases trams and trolleybuses that were either used or built in Adelaide. The museum is {{dedicated}} to preserving and restoring Adelaide’s former transport vehicles. It houses over 30 electric trams, horse trams and electric trolley buses, many of which are restored and operational. Visitors <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> the electric trams along 2km of purpose-built track that runs between the museum and the adventure playground.|$|E
5|$|The River Severn is {{considered}} a navigable river and Gloucester {{used to be an}} important port, with shipping having to deal with the bore. Vessels <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches {{of grass and}} rippling water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This {{is the only way to}} capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can choose}} from a cast of 20 playable drivers divided in 10 pairs. All of the {{characters}} have their own special items which are unique to them, like Mario and Luigi with Fireballs, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong with Giant Bananas, Bowser and Bowser Jr. with Bowser Shells, Yoshi and Birdo with Eggs, Peach and Daisy with Hearts, Wario and Waluigi with Bob-ombs, Koopa Troopa (who previously appeared in Super Mario Kart) and Paratroopa with Triple Shells, Toad and Toadette with Golden Mushrooms, and Baby Mario and Baby Luigi with Chain Chomps. Petey Piranha and King Boo have the unique ability to use {{any of the other}} characters' special items excluding Luigi's Green Fireball and Birdo's Pink Egg. There are 21 karts in all and the character's weight class (light, middle, or heavy) determines the kart in which they <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> as well as their speed, acceleration, and weight attributes.|$|E
5|$|The four-minute ride uses 85-foot IMAX Dome {{screens and}} Sony Projectors. There are 24 ride cars, each seating eight people, and {{approximately}} 2000 people <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> it per hour. The projection system uses four overlapping Sony SXRD 4K resolution projectors on each dome, using custom-made semi-circular fisheye lenses to project undistorted images {{at a rate}} of 60 frames per second (in comparison, most feature films project at 24 frames per second). The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels (each 4feet by two feet) and are approximately 80feet tall and 85feet wide. The animation in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX, rather than the traditional 2-D animation seen on The Simpsons and the queue and pre-show of the ride. The animation reference was provided by Film Roman, the animation studio that animates the series. Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6.1 surround sound, while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers.|$|E

5|$|Underwurlde is a {{platform}} game viewed from a side-angle perspective. The player controls Sabreman, a pith-helmeted adventurer, as he jumps between platforms in a castle and its underground caverns {{to find a}} way to escape past the exit guardians. Sabreman must use a specific weapon—knife, dagger, and torch—that corresponds to each guardian. The player uses the keyboard's QWERT keys to progress through a series of flip screens in which the player's character reaches the boundary of the viewable area on the screen to flip to another area, with 597 screens in all. While Sabreman begins in a castle adorned with clocks, birds, and baskets, the character must also descend down into caverns through several successive vertical screens. Sabreman automatically attaches a rope to the ceiling when the player controls him off of a ledge. The player can then swing Sabreman side to side to jump to another ledge. At the bottom of a cavern, Sabreman <b>can</b> <b>ride</b> a bubble to the top.|$|E
