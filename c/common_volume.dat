50|$|On {{the mixing}} of non-ideal materials, the total final <b>common</b> <b>volume</b> may be {{different}} from the sum of the separate initial volumes, and there may occur transfer of work or heat, to or from the surroundings; also there may be a departure of the entropy of mixing from that of the corresponding ideal case. That departure is the main reason for interest in entropy of mixing. These energy and entropy variables and their temperature dependences provide valuable information about the properties of the materials.|$|E
50|$|In the {{established}} customary usage, {{expressed in the}} lead section of this article, the entropy of mixing comes from two mechanisms, the intermingling and possible interactions of the distinct molecular species, and {{the change in the}} volume available for each molecular species, or the change in concentration of each molecular species. For ideal gases, the entropy of mixing at prescribed common temperature and pressure {{has nothing to do with}} mixing in the sense of intermingling and interactions of molecular species, but is only to do with expansion into the <b>common</b> <b>volume.</b>|$|E

50|$|A Florence flask {{is a type}} of flask used as an item of {{laboratory}} glassware. It is used as a container to hold liquids. A Florence flask has a round body, a single long neck, and often a flat bottom. It is designed for uniform heating, boiling, distillation and ease of swirling; it is produced {{in a number of different}} glass thicknesses to stand different types of use. They are often made of borosilicate glass for heat and chemical resistance. Traditional Florence flasks typically do not have a ground glass joint on their rather longer necks, but typically have a slight lip or flange around the tip of the neck. A <b>common</b> <b>volume</b> for a Florence flask is 1 litre.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the established customary usage, [...] "mixing" [...] might be conducted reversibly at constant volume for each of two fixed masses of gases of equal volume, being mixed by gradually merging their initially separate volumes by use of two ideal semipermeable membranes, each permeable only {{to one of the}} respective gases, so that the respective volumes available to each gas remain constant during the merge. Either one of the common temperature or the common pressure is chosen to be independently controlled by the experimenter, the other being allowed to vary so as to maintain constant volume for each mass of gas. In this kind of [...] "mixing", the final <b>common</b> <b>volume</b> is equal to each of the respective separate initial volumes, and each gas finally occupies the same volume as it did initially.|$|E
5000|$|In New Zealand, a flagon {{refers to}} a glass vessel filled with beer {{available}} in public bars or bottle stores. Drinkers could take their own washed flagons or swap their empties for those pre-filled, corked and ready for sale. The flagon {{was followed by the}} half-gallon (2.27 l) jar and was preceded by the square rigger and the bluey. These were commonly used during the period of six-o'clock closing of bars. A flagon can hold different volumes of beer or wine and is thought to have originated from an amendment to the licensing laws, which took effect in 1881. The amendment allowed winemakers to sell wine from their vineyards for off-licence consumption, so long as the quantity was 2 gallons (9 liters) or more (hence the [...] "2 g" [...] flagon). Before this change winemakers could only sell wine from hotels. A half-gallon flagon was a <b>common</b> <b>volume</b> used for beer.|$|E

30|$|In {{the above}} works, {{the issue of}} insulin {{administration}} methods was not addressed. Yet, many parameters can affect the drug delivery of narrow therapeutics where multiple infusions are involved, as in ICUs. The main parameter to be considered {{seems to be the}} common space volume within the infusion line between drugs simultaneously infused, as shown by Lovich et al. [7, 8]. The time to reach a steady state after initiating or ceasing drug infusion is considerably reduced with a low <b>common</b> <b>volume</b> manifold compared to a high volume design [9]. Several studies have shown the benefits of a reduction in infusion line <b>common</b> <b>volume</b> in predicting drug delivery and so avoiding incidents such as unexpected drug bolus [7 – 16].|$|E
40|$|The need to {{calculate}} effective common volumes (ECVs) {{formed by the}} intersection of antenna beams arises in several communications (and radar) engineering problems.
