25|$|Attaching ionic ligands to {{nanoparticles}} allows {{control over}} enzyme activity. An example of enzyme inhibition {{is given by}} binding of a-chymotrypsin (ChT), an enzyme with a largely cationic active site. When a-chymotrypsin is incubated with anionic (negatively charged) nanoparticles, ChT activity is inhibited as anionic nanoparticles bind to the active site. Enzyme activity can be restored {{by the addition of}} <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactants.</b> Alkyl surfactants form a bilayer around ChT, whereas thiol and alcohol surfactants alter the surface of ChT such that interactions with nanoparticles are interrupted. Though formation of a protein-nanoparticle complex can inhibit enzyme activity, studies show that it can also stabilize protein structure, and significantly protect the protein from denaturization.|$|E

One common use for <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactants</b> is in fabric softeners.

Cationic head groups also increase the disinfecting properties of household cleaners. Some common <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactants</b> head groups include amines and quaternary ammonium ions. Among the many types of surfactants, <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactants</b> are very useful corrosion inhibitors due of their protective effectiveness in neutral and acidic media.|$|E

One toner carrying no surface charge agglomerated well under most conditions, {{while the other}} toner carrying a negative surface charge performed worse. It was found that when mixing these two toners together during pulping and when using 1 -octadecanol as the agglomeration agent alone, there was an additive effect on agglomeration. On the other hand, addition of {{a small amount of}} <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> dramatically enhanced the mixed toner agglomeration efficiency and generated an obvious synergistic effect. The particle number after agglomeration was significantly reduced, and the particle size was greatly increased compared to the single toner agglomeration. The optimal amount of the <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> was close to the optimal <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> demand of the negatively charged toner. Based on these findings it can be recommended that the <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> should be added during agglomeration of the mixed office waste paper, and its optimal dosage needs to be chosen to reach the best performance...|$|R

In this thesis solubilization of naphthalene, a double ringed PAH and anthracene, a triple ringed PAH, in the micellar solution of <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> CTAB has been studied in order to remove PAHs from contaminated soil and ground water. Effect of three electrolytes NaCl, Na 2 So 4 and CaCl 2 on the solubilization of naphthalene and anthracene as additives in the presence of <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> CTAB is also examined. Different physicochemical properties such as critical micelle concentration (CMC), molar solubilization ratio (MSR) and partition coefficient (Km) have been estimated for the <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> and <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> with different electrolyte solutions. The <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> system showed a synergetic behaviour and a maximum synergism was observed for the <b>cationic</b> <b>surfactant</b> in the presence of higher valence counter ion electrolyte. The synergism of CTAB with electrolyte is also confirmed by 1 D 1 H NMR study.
