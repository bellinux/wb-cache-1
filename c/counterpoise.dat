A <b>counterpoise</b> to the dazzling heat of the Indian summer, the Ganges came to be imbued with magical qualities and to be revered in anthropomorphic form. By the 5th century CE, an elaborate mythology surrounded the Ganges, now a goddess in her own right, and a symbol for all rivers of India. Hindu temples all over India had statues and reliefs of the goddess carved at their entrances, symbolically washing the sins of arriving worshippers and guarding the gods within. As protector of the sanctum sanctorum, the goddess soon came to depicted with several characteristic accessories: the makara (a crocodile-like undersea monster, often shown with an elephant-like trunk), the kumbha (an overfull vase), various overhead parasol-like coverings, and a gradually increasing retinue of humans.|$|E

In the Peloponnesian War, the Thebans, embittered by the support that Athens gave to the smaller Boeotian towns, and especially to Plataea, which they vainly attempted to reduce in 431BC, were firm allies of Sparta, which in turn helped them to besiege Plataea and allowed them to destroy the town after its capture in 427BC. In 424BC, at the head of the Boeotian levy, they inflicted a severe defeat on an invading force of Athenians at the Battle of Delium, and for the first time displayed the effects of that firm military organization that eventually raised them to predominant power in Greece.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the {{building}} of Constantine's churches in Palestine there were two chief types of plan in use: the basilican, or axial, type, represented by the basilica at the Holy Sepulchre, and the circular, or central, type, represented by the great octagonal church once at Antioch. Those of the latter type we must suppose were nearly always vaulted, for a central dome would seem to furnish their very raison d'etre. The central space was sometimes surrounded by a very thick wall, in which deep recesses, to the interior, were formed, as at the noble Church of Saint George, Thessaloniki (5th century), or by a vaulted aisle, as at Santa Costanza, Rome (4th century); or annexes were thrown out from the central space {{in such a way}} as to form a cross, in which these additions helped to <b>counterpoise</b> the central vault, as at the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, Ravenna (5th century). The most famous church of this type was that of the Holy Apostles, Constantinople. Vaults appear to have been early applied to the basilican type of plan; for instance, at Hagia Irene, Constantinople (6th century), the long body of the church is covered by two domes.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the cause}} of all this may {{be traced to the}} {{different}} views entertained by the two great Commanders. Blücher's extreme hatred of the French would not allow him to modify, still less to abandon, the opinion which he had imbibed from the first moment he heard of the escape of Napoleon from Elba; that they ought not only to be thoroughly humbled, but also severely punished. Neither he nor his soldiers could ever forget the cruelties and extortions which their own country had been compelled to endure when overrun by the French: and now that they were once more brought into the land of their enemies, and another period of retribution had arrived; but one sentiment pervaded the whole Prussian Army — that those who had not scrupled to inflict the scourge of war throughout the whole continent, should, in their turn, be made duly sensible of its evils. In Siborne's opinion a contrary train of ideas, or a different course of proceeding, {{on the part of the}} Prussians was scarcely to be expected. Hence the value of the excellent and orderly conduct of the British troops operating as a salutary <b>counterpoise</b> to the domineering and revengeful spirit which actuated the Prussians.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the backflashover {{phenomenon}} in HV overhead transmission lines (TLs) with towers grounded by means of long <b>counterpoises,</b> typically used in high resistivity soils. Although long <b>counterpoises</b> are effective in reducing the grounding impedance at power frequency, their impulse response may affect negatively the TL backflashover rate. The study {{is focused on the}} enhancement of TL lightning performance obtainable by adding a small number of vertical grounding rods to horizontal <b>counterpoises.</b> An extensive ATP-EMTP parametric analysis, based on a detailed 161 kVTL model including the leader progression model (LPM) of line insulations and the non-linear transient behaviour of grounding systems, has been carried out taking into account several different values of soil resistivity as well as varying numbers, locations and lengths of additional vertical rods. Critical lightning current ranges causing backflashover have been then predicted for several lightning waveforms, of different severity. The paper shows that the addition of a few vertical grounding rods significantly improves TL lightning performance by increasing critical lightning current values. even if their influence is negligible at power frequency. The authors have ascertained an increment of average critical backflashover current up to similar to 55 % for some typical TL grounding system configurations and lightning waveshapes.

25|$|The guiding {{spirit in}} this anti-Prussian policy, which characterised Bavarian statesmanship {{up to the}} war of 1866, was Baron Karl Ludwig von der Pfordten (1811–1880), who became {{minister}} for foreign affairs on 19 April 1849. His idea for the ultimate solution {{of the question of}} {{the balance of power in}} Germany was the so-called Trias, i.e. a league of the Rhenish states as a <b>counterpoise</b> to the preponderance of Austria and Prussia. In internal affairs his ministry was characterised by a reactionary policy less severe than elsewhere in Germany, which led none-the-less from 1854 onward to a struggle with the parliament, which ended in the dismissal of Pfordten's ministry on 27 March 1859. He was succeeded by Karl Freiherr von Schrenk von Notzing (1806–1884), an official of Liberal tendencies who had been Bavarian representative in the diet of the Confederation. Important reforms were now introduced, including the separation of the judicial and executive powers and the drawing up of a new criminal code. In foreign affairs Schrenk, like his predecessor, aimed at safeguarding the independence of Bavaria, and supported the idea of superseding the actual constitution of the Confederation by a supreme directory, in which Bavaria, as leader of the purely German states, would hold the balance between Prussia and Austria. Bavaria accordingly opposed the Prussian proposals for the reorganisation of the Confederation, and one of the last acts of King Maximilian was to take a conspicuous part in the assembly of princes summoned to Frankfurt in 1863 by the emperor Francis Joseph.|$|E

500|$|By 1787 the {{government}} of New York had almost entirely given up plans to subjugate Vermont, but still claimed jurisdiction. As {{a member of the}} legislature of New York, Hamilton argued forcefully and at length in favor of a bill to recognize the sovereignty of the State of Vermont, against numerous objections to its constitutionality and policy. [...] Consideration of the bill was deferred to a later date. [...] In 1787 through 1789 Hamilton exchanged letters with Nathaniel Chipman, a lawyer representing Vermont. In 1788 the new Constitution of the United States went into effect, with its plan to replace the unicameral Continental Congress with a new Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives.

In 1790 the New York legislature decided to give up New York's claim to Vermont if Congress decided to admit Vermont to the Union and if negotiations between New York and Vermont on the boundary between the two states were successfully concluded.

40|$|The {{economical}} {{insulation co-ordination}} in transmission lines and substations requires to accurately predict the lightning surge overvoltages that may occur. Therefore, to perform this insulation and protection design {{it is necessary}} to model the power system components adequately {{in order to determine the}} magnitude and shape of these overvoltages. There are three system elements which characterisation are extremelly important for an accurate computation of the lightning overvoltages: the transmission line, the tower and the tower footing. The transmission line is represented by a distributed, frequency dependent and non-linear parameters model. This model is based on a finite differences algorithm, developed as a general-purpose transmission line model, thus allowing to represent also the tower, as a non-uniform transmission line, and the distributed nature of long ground electrodes (<b>counterpoises).</b> The most common used tower footing configurations are the vertical rods and the <b>counterpoises.</b> Vertical rods are represented by lumped resistances, while the <b>counterpoises</b> are represented by the finite-differences transmission line model. The non-linear behaviour of towe footing, that occurs when high magnitude lightning currents flow through the earth electrodes to the earth, is also included in the proposed models. In this dissertation a practical application of the general-purpose transmission line model is presented. This application consists on the evaluation of impinging overvoltages at a station consequent to lightning striking an incoming transmission lineAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
