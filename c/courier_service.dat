5|$|Transport Flight (Japan) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{transport}} unit that operated {{in the aftermath}} of the Korean War. It was formed in March 1955 at Iwakuni, Japan, and equipped with three Douglas C-47Dakotas and a CAC Wirraway. The flight's main duty was flying a regular <b>courier</b> <b>service</b> between Japan and South Korea in support of Commonwealth military units based on the peninsula. Transport Flight (Japan) ceased operations in June 1956 and disbanded in September that year.|$|E

Following the relocation of the British Forces Post Office and Defence <b>Courier</b> <b>Service</b> from Mill Hill, a new headquarters and main sorting facility were built for their use which opened in November 2007. New hangar facilities for the use of No. 32 Squadron were also constructed, along with new personnel accommodation.|$|E
5|$|While {{traveling}} from Shandong into North Zhili, Choe noticed {{a multitude of}} boats passing by which held officials from the Ministries of War, Justice, and Personnel. When he questioned his escorts about this, Choe {{was told that the}} newly enthroned Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1488–1505) had recently impeached a large number of officials from office whom he considered inept and unworthy of their positions. Brook writes that it was quite a comfortable privilege for disgraced and dismissed officials to be escorted by the <b>courier</b> <b>service,</b> yet even this saving of face was still a firm reminder of their banishment from court.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{transport}} operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam {{to transfer}} wounded or sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted {{as part of}} the regular <b>courier</b> <b>service,</b> and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers. Separate evacuation flights began on 1July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The Medical Journal of Australia. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972. The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia.|$|E

25|$|The station {{acted as}} the central {{transport}} hub for Brevik. The Strømtangen area also served, until 1934, as a quay for ferries along the coast, and until 1962 for car ferries across the sound to Stathelle. The bus route to Skien also terminated there. Narvesen established a kiosk at the station, but by the 1950s the traffic had fallen sufficiently {{that it had to}} close. There was also a privately run restaurant in the station building and it served as a hub for a <b>courier</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{detachment}} was {{in support}} of the 308th Bomb Wing. The detachment operated off a drained rice paddy adjoining the Lingayan Air Strip and was housed in a Nipa hut {{in the middle of a}} bomb dump. Activities included <b>courier</b> <b>service,</b> delivering weapons to guerrillas behind enemy lines, search missions, marking bombing targets and air sea rescue. One aircraft was damaged when its engine quit over the trees at the end of the landing strip. The pilot, S/Sgt Neil Livesay, received a written commendation from 5th Air Force HQ for his outstanding airmanship. His passenger was the 5th AF Flying Safety Officer.|$|E
25|$|The 1986 film Quicksilver {{featuring}} a bicycle messenger, {{is an early}} expression of the mythology of the messenger as daredevil stunt rider. Star Kevin Bacon rides a racing bike, a fixed gear bike and a trick bike with 1:1 gear ratio and zero-rake forks, to perform the stunts in the film. The 2000–2002 television series Dark Angel had the main character Max Guevara, played by Jessica Alba, as a bicycle messenger at a <b>courier</b> <b>service</b> named Jam Pony.

The airport is a political issue for the locals who argue that the airport should serve its original purpose, i.e., should open up for civilian flights. Since past few years the Indian Air Force has been operating AN-32 air <b>courier</b> <b>service</b> to transport the locals during the winter seasons to Jammu, Srinagar and Chandigarh. A private airplane company Air Mantra landed a 17-seater aircraft at the airport, in presence of dignitaries like the Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, marking the first ever landing by a civilian airline company at Kargil.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the station shifted the center of Brevik closer to Strømtangen. While this {{previously}} had been a less develop part of the village, several merchants, hotels and restaurants were established {{in the vicinity of}} the station. The railway established a section of housing in the Strømstangen and Trosvik area for its employees. The arrival of the railway resulted in a <b>courier</b> <b>service</b> in Brevik. Originally it was part of the station master's wages to hold the privilege to operate a restaurant in the station, which he did until 1922, when it was subcontracted. Its revenue peaked at NOK25,000 annually in 1925, but then declined significantly after the Kragerø Line opened in 1927. In 1920 the station had thirteen employees, consisting of a station master, two secretaries, four telegraphists, five station workers and one courier. In addition there were employees related to other divisions, such as track and rolling stock maintenance, engineers and conductors. The line past the station was converted from narrow gauge to standard gauge in 1921, and was electrified on 19 June 1949.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, No.37 Squadron repatriated former {{prisoners of}} war from Singapore to Australia. On 27July 1946, it moved to RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales, where it came {{under the control of}} No.86 (Transport) Wing along with Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons, also {{operating}} Dakotas. Another unit of No.86 Wing, No.486 (Maintenance) Squadron, was responsible for servicing the Dakotas. On 30September 1946, No.37 Squadron was assigned the regular <b>courier</b> <b>service</b> to Japan that had previously been flown by No.36 Squadron, to support the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. In January 1947, No.37 Squadron handed over the Japan courier run to No.38 Squadron, and the following month took over the Lae <b>courier</b> <b>service</b> previously flown by No.36 Squadron; the Rabaul courier run was added in April. [...] By the end of 1947, No.37 Squadron's personnel numbered fifty-six, including twenty-four officers, and it had an average of ten Dakotas on strength. The unit was disbanded at Schofields on 24February 1948.|$|E

40|$|In Malaysia, the {{national}} postal <b>services</b> and private <b>courier</b> companies significantly contribute towards {{the national}} economy and also provide the employment opportunities. Postal and <b>courier</b> <b>services</b> in Malaysia have undergone a radical change due to the rapid evolution of Information Communication Technology (ICT). Nevertheless, {{the need to have}} efficient postal and <b>courier</b> <b>services</b> is undeniable because of the increase in e-commerce applications these days and the need for integrated supply chain. Unlike the manufacturing sector, the innovation models in the service are still inconsistent. This requires further investigation especially in the postal and <b>courier</b> <b>services.</b> The investment in service innovation is huge but the question remains. Will it lead to customer responsiveness? Hence, this study seeks to develop a model that link three main variables: service innovation, information communication technology (ICT) capability, and customer responsiveness. This link has been given little attention by prior research particularly in the postal and <b>courier</b> <b>services</b> sector. The proposed model is discussed in the paper...|$|R

500|$|No.77 Squadron stood down at Kunsan on 7October 1954 {{and flew}} its Meteors to Iwakuni five days later. It {{departed}} for Australia in November and became operational again at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, on 4January 1955. Its eleven-year absence from Australia, {{beginning in the}} Pacific during World WarII and continuing in Japan as part of BCOF, was a record for an RAAF unit. No.491 Squadron disbanded at Iwakuni on 13December 1954. No.36 Squadron ceased flying on 13March 1955 and returned to Australia, leaving behind three Dakotas and a Wirraway that equipped RAAF Transport Flight (Japan), formed the following day under No.91 Wing. No.391 Squadron and No.91 Wing headquarters were disbanded at Iwakuni on 30April 1955. [...] Transport Flight (Japan) flew a <b>courier</b> <b>service</b> to South Korea and remained operational until 8July 1956, when its last Dakota—the last RAAF aircraft in Japan—departed Iwakuni.|$|E

The {{squadron}} relocated to Garbutt on 20February 1944. During the New Guinea campaign it was responsible for carrying troops and cargo, and undertaking courier runs and supply drops. In 1945, a detachment of No.36 Squadron Dakotas augmented No.84 Wing's operations in Bougainville, flying almost 800 sorties between January and June. [...] The squadron lost two Dakotas on supply missions in Aitape during February 1945. In August, it flew paratroopers into Singapore {{as part of the}} reoccupation of the city, after which it continued to transport troops and cargo, and repatriate prisoners of war.
