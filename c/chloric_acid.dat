500|$|Chlorine forms four oxoacids: {{hypochlorous acid}} (HOCl), chlorous acid (HOClO), <b>chloric</b> <b>acid</b> (HOClO2), and perchloric acid (HOClO3).

500|$|Most of the {{chlorine}} oxoacids may {{be produced by}} exploiting these disproportionation reactions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, sodium chlorite is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. <b>Chloric</b> <b>acid</b> (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is sodium chlorate, mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp. The decomposition of chlorate to chloride and oxygen is a common way to produce oxygen in the laboratory on a small scale. Chloride and chlorate may comproportionate to form chlorine as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|In another process {{manganese}} dioxide is carbothermically reduced to manganese(II) oxide which is dissolved in sulfuric acid. The filtered solution is treated with ammonium carbonate to precipitate [...] The carbonate is calcined in air {{to give a}} mixture of manganese(II) and manganese(IV) oxides. To complete the process, a suspension of this material in sulfuric acid is treated with sodium chlorate. <b>Chloric</b> <b>acid,</b> which forms in situ, converts any Mn(III) and Mn(II) oxides to the dioxide, releasing chlorine as a by-product.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{electronegative}} atoms adjacent to an acidic bond also affects acid strength. Oxoacids have the general formula HOX, where X {{can be any}} atom and {{may or may not}} share bonds to other atoms. Increasing the number of electronegative atoms or groups on atom X decreases the electron density in the acidic bond, making the loss of the proton easier. Perchloric acid is a very strong acid (pKa ≈ -8) and completely dissociates in water. Its chemical formula is HClO4 and it comprises a central chlorine atom with three chlorine-oxygen double bonds (Cl=O) and one chlorine-oxygen single bond (Cl—O). The singly bonded oxygen bears an extremely acidic hydrogen atom, which is easily abstracted. In contrast, <b>chloric</b> <b>acid</b> (HClO3) is a weaker acid, though still quite strong (pKa = -1.0), while chlorous acid (HClO2, pKa = +2.0) and hypochlorous acid (HClO, pKa = +7.53) acids are weak acids. values for HClOn from ...|$|E

40|$|The {{association}} of BeX 2 (X: H, F, Cl) derivatives with azoles {{leads to a}} dramatic increase of their intrinsic acidity. Hence, whereas 1 H-tetrazole {{can be considered as}} a typical N base in the gas phase, the complex 1 H-tetrazole– BeCl 2 is predicted to be, through the use of high-level G 4 ab initio calculations, a nitrogen acid stronger than perchloric acid. This acidity enhancement is due to a more favorable stabilization of the deprotonated species after the beryllium bond is formed, because the deprotonated anion is a much better electron donor than the neutral species. Consequently, this is a general phenomenon that should be observed for any Lewis base, including those in which the basic site is a hydroxy group, an amino group, a carbonyl group, an aromatic N atom, a second-row atom, or the p system of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The consequence is that typical bases like aniline or formamide lead to BeX 2 complexes that are stronger acids than phosphoric or <b>chloric</b> <b>acids.</b> Similarly, water, methanol, and SH 2 become stronger acids than sulfuric acid, pyridine becomes a C acid almost as strong as acetic acid, and unsaturated hydrocarbons such as ethylene and acetylene become acids as strong as nitric and sulfuric acids, respectively.

40|$|Background and Objectives According to Islamic doctrines, {{the use of}} {{gold for}} men has been banned. In general, any advised subject in Islam is useful for the body and what has {{definitely}} forbidden for a man is definitely harmful for him although its reasons have not been exactly specified. However, Muslims {{believe that there is}} certainly a sound reason behind this prohibition. This issue was studied in vitro on fertile men in the city of Babol by means of gold Nano particles. Materials and Methods: A total seminal fluid from 20 healthy individual volunteers from the city of Babol whose fertility had been approved was examined for the gold content through atomic absorption at the wavelength of 242. 8 nm with Hollow gold cathode lamp. Prior to analyzing all the collected samples, they were put into a mixture of thick citrate and per <b>chloric</b> <b>acids</b> at a ratio of 1 to 6. Findings: In the samples studied, the amount of gold in the semen was found to be in the range of 0. 32 to 1. 92 µg/ml with a mean value 0. 89 µg/ml and the standard deviation of 0. 61 µg/ml. Conclusion: In the present study, the existing gold in the full seminal fluid was estimated after complete digestion. (oxidation of organic materials; so the amount of  identified gold and the  plasma levels of semen were separated like  sperm). Therefore, the hypothesis of the presence of gold in sperm seems to be true. Due to the scarcity of articles in this regard and the previous studies, it seems that more studies are needed in order to shed light {{on the role of the}} gold on men&# 039;s fertility. From the viewpoint of Islam, this study proved the presence of gold in seminal fluid. In addition, the decrease in sperm movement after the influx of gold shows the forbiddance of old for men...|$|R

40|$|Iron may be {{determined}} in biologic material by a wet-ash method employing <b>chloric</b> and nitric <b>acids</b> and a non-ash method using trichioroacetic acid treatment.
