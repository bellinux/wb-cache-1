2500|$|Designed in the 1970s, the Nugget was {{intended}} {{to compete with the}} new European fiberglass gliders that were beginning to appear, and as such incorporated mixed construction methods. The fuselage is built with a fiberglass cockpit area, with the fuselage aft of the wing trailing edge made from aluminum. The wing is of Chem-weld bonded aluminum construction, the bonding replacing rivets in an attempt to get a surface as smooth and wave-free as fiberglass. The wing employs a Wortmann FX 67 170/150 airfoil and has flaps. The long span flaps serve both as speed-range drag reducing camber <b>changing</b> <b>devices</b> and full deflection high-lift/high-drag landing flaps. The aircraft can carry up to [...] of water ballast in a center fuselage tank, located at the center of gravity. The landing gear is a retractible monowheel.|$|R

5000|$|Automatic bus {{configuration}} is {{a related}} issue.

For example, [...] may be used by a 24LC02 or 24C32 EEPROM, with incompatible addressing; or by a PCF8563 RTC, which cannot reliably be distinguished from either (without <b>changing</b> <b>device</b> state, which might not be allowed). The only reliable configuration mechanisms available to hosts involve out-of-band mechanisms such as tables provided by system firmware, which list the available devices. Again, this issue can partially be addressed by ARP in SMBus systems, especially when vendor and product identifiers are used; but that has not really caught on. The rev. 03 version of the I²C specification adds a device ID mechanism.|$|E

50|$|TCAD has {{traditionally}} focused {{mainly on the}} transistor fabrication {{part of the process}} flow ending with the formation of source and drain contacts—also known as front end of line manufacturing. Back end of line manufacturing, e.g. interconnect and dielectric layers are not considered. One reason for delineation is the availability of powerful analysis tools such as electron microscopy techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which allow for accurate measurement of device geometry. There are no similar tools available for accurate high resolution measurement of dopant or stress profiles.Nevertheless, there is growing interest to investigate the interaction between front end and back end manufacturing steps. For example, back end manufacturing may cause stress in the transistor region <b>changing</b> <b>device</b> performance. These interactions will stimulate the need for better interfaces to back end simulation tools or lead to integration of some of those capabilities into TCAD tools.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} the term shape resolution, which {{adds to the}} existing definitions of screen and touch resolution. We propose a framework, based on a geometric model (Non-Uniform Rational B-splines), which defines a metric for shape resolution in ten features. We illustrate it by comparing the current related work of shape <b>changing</b> <b>devices.</b> We then propose the concept of Morphees that are self-actuated flexible mobile devices adapting their shapes {{on their own to}} the context of use in order to offer better affordances. For instance, when a game is launched, the mobile device morphs into a console-like shape by curling two opposite edges to be better grasped with two hands. We then create preliminary prototypes of Morphees in order to explore six different building strategies using advanced shape changing materials (dielectric electro active polymers and shape memory alloys). By comparing the shape resolution of our prototypes, we generate insights to help designers toward creating high shape resolution Morphees...|$|R

2500|$|The Kittiwake was a four bay biplane {{with high}} aspect ratio, {{parallel}} chord Consuta covered wings without sweep or stagger. [...] The lower one joined the fuselage {{at the top}} of the hull, with two pairs of struts to just above the chine; the upper wing met the top of the cabin. The three outer wide chord, Consuta faired interplane struts were of I form, which simplified the interplane wire bracing. Aerodynamically, the most unusual features of the Kittiwake's wings were the interlinked camber <b>changing</b> <b>devices</b> on both the leading and trailing edges of upper and lower wings, intended to increase the speed range of a quite heavily loaded aircraft (wing loading 7.2lb/ft2). [...] Because these lift-enhancing devices occupied most of the trailing edges, the ailerons were mounted halfway between the wings on the two outboard interplane struts. [...] The two radial engines were also mounted mid-plane in seven sided nacelles, [...] supported by the innermost duralumin interplane struts and steel strut braced to the fuselage. [...] Their faired fuel tanks sat immediately above them, protruding from the upper wing surface.|$|R
5000|$|The fourteenth {{episode of}} the anime {{introduces}} Misty Honey, a rival and self-proclaimed twin sister of Cutie Honey, whose name was chosen through a contest in Japan. Ironically, Misty Honey {{was one of her}} alter-egos in the original cartoon. Misty Honey, unlike Cutie Honey, cannot turn into anyone she wants; she can only change to Misty Honey. She has a band around her thigh that resembles Honey's choker which acts as the activator for her Airborne Element Fixing Device but she uses a ring to transform with the words [...] "Honey Flash". Seira's heart was [...] "poisoned" [...] by Panther Zora when she was found by Twilight Prince. The darkness in her heart (and her flawed transformation device) creates Panther Claw minions.

30|$|Due to the <b>changing</b> <b>device</b> orientations {{caused by}} body locomotion, such as leg locomotion, it is {{inapplicable}} to compute user heading {{by the most}} commonly used device estimation approach [11], which adds heading offset to device heading. This is because the heading offset between device heading and user heading varies due to the <b>changing</b> <b>device</b> orientations and is difficult to be estimated. For a smartphone put in the pocket, uDirect approach [12] has been proposed by extracting walking direction in a specific region, where the walking direction dominates the acceleration vector. However, the specific region may be easily corrupted by body locomotion. In contrast, the PCA-based approaches [13] are more robust, since it exploits all samples in the walking step. Regardless of the <b>changing</b> <b>device</b> orientations, PCA may extract the walking direction along the maximum variations of the acceleration signals in the horizontal plane.|$|E

5000|$|The two wings, {{both with}} straight, {{slightly}} swept leading edges, were mounted in tandem {{in the top}} of the fuselage. It was well known that such an arrangement led to an aerodynamically inefficient rear wing, as it was in the downwash of the forward wing, so Albessard gave the inner panel of the latter a symmetric section set at 0° angle of incidence that produced no lift or downwash in level flight. This 7.50 m2 area inner panel, with a slightly narrower chord than the outer panels, had a span almost as large as that of the rear wing. The outer, cambered panels, connected to the inner with short junction sections, were set at an incidence of 3° and produced lift. The rear wing was simpler and of constant chord, as broad as the outer forward wing panels and having 1.4 times their area. The wings were separated by about twice the rear wing chord. Together, the two forward outer panels and the rear wing produced a triangle of parallel lift vectors leading, according to Albessard, to the aircraft's stability. [...] There were ailerons both on the forward outer panels and on the full span of the rear wings. These were operated differentially and could be used either as conventional ailerons or as camber <b>changing</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
