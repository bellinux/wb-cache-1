25|$|In 1953, Chanel {{collaborated with}} jeweler Robert Goossens; {{he was to}} design jewelry (bijouterie and gemstone) to {{complement}} the fashions of the House of Chanel; notably, long-strand necklaces of black pearls and of white pearls, which high contrast softened the severe design of the knitted-wool Chanel Suit (skirt and <b>cardigan</b> <b>jacket).</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{got to get}} out somehow," [...] Sir Henry declared. [...] "Mills, my {{oilskins}} and flask at once. I sha'n't {{change a}} thing, but you might bring a <b>cardigan</b> <b>jacket</b> and the whisky and soda." ...|$|E
60|$|I liked saloons. Especially I {{liked the}} San Francisco saloons. They {{had the most}} delicious dainties for the taking--strange breads and crackers, cheeses, sausages, sardines--wonderful foods that I never saw on our meagre home-table. And once, I {{remember}}, a barkeeper mixed me a sweet temperance drink of syrup and soda-water. My father did not pay for it. It was the barkeeper's treat, and he became my ideal of a good, kind man. I dreamed day-dreams of him for years. Although I {{was seven years old}} at the time, I can see him now with undiminished clearness, though I never laid eyes on him but that one time. The saloon was south of Market Street in San Francisco. It stood {{on the west side of}} the street. As you entered, the bar was on the left. On the right, against the wall, was the free lunch counter. It was a long, narrow room, and at the rear, beyond the beer kegs on tap, were small, round tables and chairs. The barkeeper was blue-eyed, and had fair, silky hair peeping out from under a black silk skull-cap. I remember he wore a brown <b>Cardigan</b> <b>jacket,</b> and I know precisely the spot, in the midst of the array of bottles, from which he took the bottle of red-coloured syrup. He and my father talked long, and I sipped my sweet drink and worshipped him. And for years afterward I worshipped the memory of him.|$|E

50|$|Conservatively styled suits {{consisting}} of <b>cardigan</b> <b>jackets</b> and gored skirts might {{be covered with}} textured mixtures of fur, quilted fabric, leather strips, or pieces of wool. A dress of lace might be dramatized by bold appliqué. As many as six materials might be combined in collages of cotton, wool, furs, tweeds, sequins, and leather but all are carried out with a true designer's skill and artistic sensitivity. Indeed, van den Akker has admitted that the designs just flow, working themselves out {{through the process of}} creation, perhaps reflecting a hereditary affinity with Dutch national costume.|$|R

5000|$|Chanel's initial triumph was the {{innovative}} use of jersey fabric, a machine knit material manufactured for {{her by the}} firm Rodier. This fabric was traditionally relegated to the manufacture of undergarments. Chanel's early wool jersey traveling suit consisted of a <b>cardigan</b> <b>jacket,</b> and pleated skirt, paired with a low-belted pullover top. This ensemble, worn with low-heeled shoes, became the casual look in expensive women's wear. Prior to this, jersey tended to be used only in hosiery and for sportswear for tennis, golf and the beach. Considered too [...] "ordinary" [...] {{to be used in}} couture, it was also disliked by designers because the knit made it difficult to handle compared to woven fabrics.|$|E
5000|$|The 1954 {{comeback}} collection {{received a}} [...] "venomous" [...] reception from the French press, {{not only because}} Chanel had yet to regain her reputation following her controversial wartime activities but because the clothes were seen as essentially conservative and offering little new. Bettina Ballard, the influential editor of American Vogue, remained loyal to Chanel, however, and featured Arnaud in the March 1954 issue, photographed by Henry Clarke, wearing three outfits: a red dress with a V-neck, paired with ropes of pearls; a tiered seersucker evening gown; and, to cap it all {{and in response to}} both public - and Ballard's - demand, a piece of timeless Chanel - a navy jersey mid-calf suit. Arnaud wore this outfit, [...] "with its slightly padded, square shouldered <b>cardigan</b> <b>jacket,</b> two patch pockets and sleeves that unbuttoned back to reveal crisp white cuffs", above [...] "a white muslin blouse with a perky collar and bow that stayed perfectly in place with small tabs that buttoned onto the waistline of an easy A-line skirt." [...] Ballard had bought the suit herself, which gave [...] "an overwhelming impression of insouciant, youthful elegance", and orders for the clothes that Arnaud had modelled soon poured in from the States.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 May the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Imperial Mounted Division) {{received}} {{orders to}} [...] "attract {{the attention of}} enemy at Bir Saba from the raid on railway line." [...] A 60 pounder battery {{was attached to the}} division. The brigade marched with their Machine Gun Squadron, Notts Battery, ammunition column and field ambulance from Abasan el Kebir to Gamli on 21 May carrying their <b>cardigan</b> <b>jackets,</b> the men's blankets under the saddle, one day’s iron ration and forage on the horse. One day's supplies [...] "on the mobile scale" [...] were to be dumped at Gamli to be pick up on their way back. Water was to be obtained at Gamli and [...] "full use......be made of any water discovered during operations". All ranks had to make the water they carried [...] "last through the day," [...] though full water carts accompanied the march.|$|R
500|$|Mahesh {{played the}} role of a billionaire's son in the film. For his character's appearance, he chose a casual look replete with <b>cardigans,</b> <b>jackets</b> and scarves. He sported various hair styles, {{including}} a layered look, a messy hair-do, and a conservative cut, for various episodes in the film. Shruti Haasan was selected as the heroine of the film; the role was supposed to be her first on-screen appearance with Mahesh though she had appeared in an item number in Aagadu after signing this film. She charged a remuneration of 12.5 million, which was the highest she had received in her career until then. Haasan said that she would play a [...] "strong, independent, intelligent" [...] and simple girl in the film, adding that the romance between the lead pair would be a [...] "very calm, relaxed and classy" [...] one. Siva chose the name Charuseela for the female lead character after going through the lyrics during the recording of the song of the same name.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, Women's Home Industries {{was in the}} swing of production. A sale {{announcement}} in The Times in January 1951 described a range of goods, including women's <b>cardigans</b> and bed <b>jackets,</b> men's socks and sweaters and layette clothing for babies.|$|R
5000|$|At {{more than}} 70 years old, after having her couture house closed for 15 years, {{she felt the}} time was right for her to {{re-enter}} the fashion world. The revival of her couture house in 1954 was fully financed by Chanel's opponent in the perfume battle, Pierre Wertheimer. Chanel's 1954 comeback collection received a [...] "venomous" [...] reception from the French press, not only because Chanel had yet to regain her reputation following her controversial wartime activities but because the clothes were seen as essentially conservative and offering little new. Bettina Ballard, the influential editor of American Vogue, remained loyal to Chanel, however, and featured the model Marie-Hélène Arnaud - the [...] "face of Chanel" [...] in the 1950s - in the March 1954 issue, photographed by Henry Clarke, wearing three outfits: a red dress with a V-neck, paired with ropes of pearls; a tiered seersucker evening gown; and, to cap it all and in response to both public - and Ballard's - demand, a piece of timeless Chanel - a navy jersey mid-calf suit. Arnaud wore this outfit, [...] "with its slightly padded, square shouldered <b>cardigan</b> <b>jacket,</b> two patch pockets and sleeves that unbuttoned back to reveal crisp white cuffs", above [...] "a white muslin blouse with a perky collar and bow that stayed perfectly in place with small tabs that buttoned onto the waistline of an easy A-line skirt."

5000|$|Boiled wool is {{a special}} type of fabric {{primarily}} used in berets, scarves, vests, <b>cardigans,</b> coats and <b>jackets.</b> Created by a mechanical process using water and agitation, shrinking knitted or woven wool or wool-blend fabrics, compressing and interlocking the fibers into a tighter felt-like mass.|$|R
50|$|Required tops {{include a}} navy blue or white crested golf shirt or a white or light blue dress shirt. Optional tops include a crested <b>cardigan</b> vest, zippered <b>jacket,</b> crewneck {{pullover}} or zip polo, {{all of which}} must be worn over the golf shirt or dress shirt.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the program}} notes, the {{collection}} was a lavish expression of a woman's love for color and drama. The palette included ivory, black, pool blue, pear green, brick red, peony pink, and Clementine orange. The collection's silhouettes dresses, included cocktail shorts, elongated <b>cardigans,</b> and cropped <b>jackets.</b> Leslie Feist's [...] "My Moon, My Man," [...] provided the runway soundtrack.|$|R
5000|$|Ready-made {{garments}} are mass-produced finished {{textile products}} of the clothing industry. They are not custom tailored according to measurements, but rather generalized according to anthropometric studies. They are made from many different fabrics and yarns. Their characteristics depend on the fibers used in their manufacture. Ready-made garments are divided into the following types: Outer clothing: workwear and uniform, leisure wear, sportswear (e.g. suits, pants, dresses, ladies' suits, blouse, blazers, <b>jackets,</b> <b>cardigans,</b> pullovers, coats, sports jackets, skirts, shirts (short- or long-sleeved), ties, jeans, shorts, T-shirts, polo shirts, sports shirts, tracksuits, bathing shorts, bathing suits, bikinis etc.) Underclothing (underwear): jersey goods, lingerie (e.g. underpants, undershirts, briefs, socks, stockings, and pantyhose) ...|$|R
5000|$|By 1958, the {{association}} between the WVS and Women's Home Industries had ended, although Lady Reading continued as chair of both. That year, Alison Settle described the company's new [...] "sweater shop" [...] in West Halkin Street, saying: [...] "They design superbly styled <b>jackets,</b> <b>cardigans</b> and pullovers for men, women and children...this idea has not caught on greatly here but is vastly popular in America, and exports account for the major part of their trade". Settle also described a new sweater elongated into a dress - a novel design first ordered by the store Magnins of California. While this was not to the British taste, the store's woollen party dresses for children were popular with both UK and US buyers.|$|R
500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed to Oceania and North America, many {{commentators}} remarked on the band's popularity and their singing abilities. For the concert at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion, Mike Wass (Idolator) felt One Direction's [...] "surprisingly accomplished effort" [...] of Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] proved that One Direction are [...] "more than capable" [...] of evolving their sound. Cameron Adams (Herald Sun) wrote a positive review for the concert in Melbourne at the Hisense Arena. He assessed that One Direction represented a [...] "cleverly cast pop band {{with plenty of}} personality unleashed at the perfect time and seizing their moment." [...] He opined that the covers performed showcased [...] "strong pop voices." [...] Adams concluded as follows: [...] "Who knows if they'll progress beyond the usual boy band lifespan. But for now they're {{making a lot of}} people very happy." [...] Reviewing the concert in Fairfax at the Patriot Center, Chris Richards (The Washington Post) elaborated on the concert synopsis. He wrote, [...] "Over the course of umpteen songs, its members didn't work the stage so much as loiter on it. They looked comfortable. No silly choreography, just a few ensemble fist-pumps. No ridiculous costumes, just letterman <b>jackets,</b> <b>cardigans</b> and khakis. A no-nonsense backing band — guitar, bass, keyboards and drums — provided steady renditions of nearly all of the songs on the group's debut album, [...] "Up All Night", as well as a few covers, including Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] and Natalie Imbruglia's [...] "Torn." ...|$|R
