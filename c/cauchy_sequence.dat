25|$|A metric space X {{in which}} every <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> converges to an element of X is called complete.|$|E
25|$|Note: A {{sequence}} exhibiting Cauchy-convergence {{is called}} a <b>cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> to emphasize {{that it may not}} be convergent.|$|E

25|$|Every {{convergent}} sequence is a <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence,</b> and the converse {{is true for}} real numbers, and {{this means that the}} topological space of the real numbers is complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{values of}} the exponential, sine and cosine functions, exp(x), sin(x), cos(x), {{are known to be}} ir{{rational}} for any rational value of x≠0, but each can be defined as the limit of a rational <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence,</b> using, for instance, the Maclaurin series.|$|E
25|$|The {{completeness}} {{property of}} the reals is the basis on which calculus, and, more generally mathematical analysis are built. In particular, the test that a sequence is a <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> allows proving that a sequence has a limit, without computing it, and even without knowing it.|$|E

2500|$|In metric spaces, one {{can define}} <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences.</b> <b>Cauchy</b> nets and filters are generalizations to uniform spaces. Even more generally, Cauchy spaces are spaces in which Cauchy filters may be defined. Convergence implies [...] "Cauchy-convergence", and Cauchy-convergence, {{together}} with {{the existence of a}} convergent subsequence implies convergence. The concept of completeness of metric spaces, and its generalizations is defined in terms of <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences.</b>|$|R

25|$|Since the {{definition}} of a <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> only involves metric concepts, it is straightforward to generalize it to any metric space X. To do so, the absolute value |xm - xn| is replaced by the distance d(xm, xn) (where d denotes a metric) between xm and xn.|$|E
25|$|Every {{convergent}} sequence (with limit s, say) is a <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence,</b> since, given any real number ε > 0, beyond some fixed point, every {{term of the}} sequence is within distance ε/2 of s, so any two terms of the sequence are within distance ε of each other.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>Cauchy</b> <b>{{sequence}}</b> of real (or complex) {{numbers is}} bounded (since for some N, all {{terms of the}} sequence from the N-th onwards are within distance 1 of each other, and if M is the largest absolute value of the terms {{up to and including}} the N-th, then no term of the sequence has absolute value greater than M+1).|$|E

30|$|The {{following}} lemma correlates the <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> of {{the spaces}} (Z,p) and (Z,d^p).|$|R
30|$|Hence {gx_n} and {gy_n} are <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> in {{the metric}} space (X, d_p).|$|R
25|$|In {{order for}} the {{integral}} to be well-defined, the space S(X) must have the Radon–Nikodym property, and more specifically, the tangent space is restricted to those vectors that are square-integrable. Square integrability is equivalent to saying that a <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> converges to a finite value under the weak topology: the space contains it's limit points. Note that Hilbert spaces possess this property.|$|E
25|$|Completing {{with respect}} to this {{absolute}} value |.|P yields a field E'P, the proper generalization of the field of p-adic numbers to this setting. The choice of c does not change the completion (different choices yield the same concept of <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence,</b> so the same completion). It is convenient, when the residue field D/P is finite, to take for c the size of D/P.|$|E
25|$|In any metric space, a <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> {{which has}} a {{convergent}} subsequence with limit s is itself convergent (with the same limit), since, given any real number r > 0, beyond some fixed point in the original sequence, every term of the subsequence is within distance r/2 of s, and any two terms of the original sequence are within distance r/2 of each other, so every term of the original sequence is within distance r of s.|$|E
30|$|If every <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> in X converges, X {{is said to}} be complete.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {x n } an d {y n } are <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> in X.|$|R
5000|$|Let R be {{the set of}} <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> of {{rational}} numbers. That is, sequences ...|$|R
25|$|The notions {{above are}} not as {{unfamiliar}} as they might at first appear. The customary acceptance {{of the fact that}} any real number x has a decimal expansion is an implicit acknowledgment that a particular <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> of rational numbers (whose terms are the successive truncations of the decimal expansion of x) has the real limit x. In some cases {{it may be difficult to}} describe x independently of such a limiting process involving rational numbers.|$|E
25|$|These {{last two}} properties, {{together}} with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, yield one standard proof of the completeness of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the Heine–Borel theorem. Every <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> of real numbers is bounded, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. It should be noted, though, that this proof of the completeness of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the least upper bound axiom. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of constructing the real numbers as {{the completion of the}} rational numbers, makes the completeness of the real numbers tautological.|$|E
500|$|Another {{approach}} is to define a real number as the limit of a <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> of rational numbers. This construction of the real numbers uses the ordering of rationals less directly. First, the distance between x and y {{is defined as the}} absolute value |x − y|, where the absolute value |z| is defined as the maximum of z and −z, thus never negative. Then the reals are defined to be the sequences of rationals that have the <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> property using this distance. That is, in the sequence (x0, x1, x2, ...), a mapping from natural numbers to rationals, for any positive rational δ there is an N such that |x'm − x'n| ≤ δ for all m, n > N. (The distance between terms becomes smaller than any positive rational.) ...|$|E
25|$|The real {{numbers are}} {{complete}} under the metric {{induced by the}} usual absolute value, {{and one of the}} standard constructions of the real numbers involves <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> of rational numbers. In this construction, each equivalence class of <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> of rational numbers with a certain tail behavior—that is, each class of sequences that get arbitrarily close to one another— is a real number.|$|R
30|$|This {{implies that}} (T^n(x_ 0,y_ 0)) and (T^n(y_ 0,x_ 0)) are <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> in X.|$|R
30|$|From Lemma  2.5, we {{conclude}} (a) {x_n} and {y_n} are <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequences</b> in (X, p).|$|R
500|$|Unfortunately, {{dealing with}} {{multiplication}} of Dedekind cuts is a time-consuming case-by-case process {{similar to the}} addition of signed integers. Another approach is the metric completion of the rational numbers. A real number is essentially defined to be the limit of a <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> of rationals, lima'n. Addition is defined term by term: ...|$|E
500|$|Relative to a {{distance}} function defined in this way, any inner product space is a metric space, and sometimes {{is known as}} a pre-Hilbert space. Any pre-Hilbert space that is additionally also a complete space is a Hilbert space. Completeness is expressed using a form of the Cauchy criterion for sequences in : a pre-Hilbert space [...] is complete if every <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> converges with respect to this norm to an element in the space. Completeness can be characterized by the following equivalent condition: if a series of vectors ...|$|E
500|$|A way {{to ensure}} the {{existence}} of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any <b>Cauchy</b> <b>sequence</b> has a limit; such a vector space is called complete. Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval , equipped with the topology of uniform convergence is not complete because any continuous function on [...] can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the Weierstrass approximation theorem. [...] In contrast, the space of all continuous functions on [...] with the same topology is complete. A norm {{gives rise to a}} topology by defining that a sequence of vectors vn converges to v if and only if ...|$|E
