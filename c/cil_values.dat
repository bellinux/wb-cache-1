40|$|PURPOSE: {{to verify}} the {{association}} of osteoporosis with periodontal disease. METHODS: the study has included 39 postmenopausal women divided in three groups according to bone mass categories, through evaluation of mineral bone density (MBD), measured by X-ray double emission absorbimetry in the lumbar area (L 1 -L 4) :) : normal bone; osteopenia and osteoporosis. In all the participants the Clinical Insertion Level (CIL) index has been determined at the research onset and after one year, by the same examiner. The periodontal situation data have been submitted to statistical analysis with the paired t-Student test. RESULTS: the periodontal exam has shown that postmenopausal women in the osteopenia presented lower CIL at the initial periodontal clinical exam (2. 1 ± 1. 1 mm), while {{the ones in the}} normal bone showed less teeth support tissue loss after one year (3. 1 ± 1. 6 mm). The statistical analysis has shown that {{there was no significant difference}} for the periodontal situation in the normal bone, but there was significant statistical difference for the osteopenia and osteoporosis patients, when <b>CIL</b> <b>values</b> from both evaluation periods were compared. CONCLUSIONS: it is concluded that postmenopausal osteoporosis may be a possible risk factor for periodontal disease...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of pharmacologic treatment with cilostazol and pentoxifylline on gait biomechanics of ischemic rat hindlimbs compared with nonischemic controls. Methods: An experimental study was designed using 30 Wistar rats divided into five groups (n = 6) : control (C); ischemia (I) - animals submitted to left common iliac artery interruption without pharmacologic treatment; pentoxifylline (Pen) - rats submitted to procedure and treated with pentoxifylline 3 mg/kg twice a day for 6 weeks; cilostazol (Cil) - animals submitted to procedure and treated with cilostazol 30 mg/kg twice a day for 6 weeks; and sham (S) - animals submitted to procedure without artery interruption. Gait analysis was performed using a computed treadmill. Time, number, and duration of each hindlimb contact were obtained. The total number of contacts (TNC) and the total duration of contacts (TDC) were compared between left and right hindlimb and among groups. Left hindlimb ischemic incapacitation index (LHII) was defined by the formula: LHII = (1 - TNCleft x TDCleft/TNCright x TDCright) x 100 Results: Left hindlimb TNC values were twofold lower in I, Pen, and Cil groups than in C and S groups (P <. 01). In I, Pen, and <b>Cil</b> groups, TNC <b>values</b> for the left hindlimb were half of the right hindlimb ones (P <. 01). Left hindlimb TDC values were lower in I and Pen groups than the other groups (P <. 01). Cil group presented twofold increased values, not different from C and S groups (P = 0. 16). Right hindlimb TNC values were greater for I group (P <. 01). LHII was around zero in C and S groups and 82 in both I and Pen groups (P <. 01). Cil group presented a LHII of 42; higher than C and S groups, but lower than I and Pen groups (P <. 01). Conclusions: Cilostazol at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice a day promoted improvement in gait performance in rats submitted to chronic hindlimb ischemia. Pentoxifylline at a dose of 3 mg/kg twice a day did not show this effect. (J Vasc Surg 2012; 56 : 476 - 81. ...|$|R

ConclusionsCilostazol at a dose of 30 mg/kg twice a day promoted improvement in gait performance in rats submitted to chronic hindlimb ischemia. Pentoxifylline at a dose of 3 mg/kg twice a day did not show this effect. Clinical RelevanceTwo medications are mostly used for treatment of intermittent claudication: cilostazol and pentoxifylline. Changes in gait biomechanics have been poorly documented as a result of pharmacologic treatment in these patients. Established experimental studies with animal models of ischemia described effects of medications on maximal distance of deambulation. No study used analysis of gait biomechanics as parameter of evaluation of the effect of pentoxifylline and cilostazol on intermittent claudication.
