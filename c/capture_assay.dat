40|$|The reverse {{transcriptase}} assay, antigen <b>capture</b> <b>assay,</b> and radioimmunoassay were compared {{for the detection}} of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in culture fluids of virus-infected lymphocytes. The {{reverse transcriptase}} assay and the antigen <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> were compared for 962 samples, and the two tests displayed comparable sensitivities (98. 5 % agreement) in detecting HIV antigen. In addition, these two tests displayed similar sensitivities when examined for the kinetics of HIV appearance following in vitro infection of normal lymphocytes. We also found the antigen <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> to be as sensitive as the radioimmunoassay in detecting HIV antigen in culture fluids. Furthermore, all three tests were found to be reasonably concordant when applied simultaneously to the detection of HIV antigen in cultures. The antigen <b>capture</b> <b>assay,</b> however, is relatively fast, can handle a large number of samples, does not require radioactive material, and is less expensive than the other two tests. Therefore, the antigen <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> appears to be the method of choice {{for the detection of}} HIV in routine virus culturing...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{used the}} hybrid <b>capture</b> <b>assays</b> to {{investigate}} the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae among commercial sex workers in Tokyo. Methods: Five hundred forty-six consecutive commercial sex workers (CSW) who visited an STD clinic for STD checkup in 1998 and 1999 were studied. A control group consisted of 233 consecutive women who visited a general gynecological clinic for annual checkup. A cervical sample was obtained for hybrid <b>capture</b> <b>assays</b> for HPV-A (low-oncogenic-risk types), HPV-B (intermediate- and high-oncogenic-risk types), C. trachomatis, and N. gonorrhoeae. Fisher’s exact test was used for statistical analyses. Results: The positive rate for HPV-B among the CSW was 48. 4 %, {{significantly higher than the}} 6. 0 % among the control subjects. The positive rates for HPV-A, C. trachomatis, and N. gonorrhoeae were also significantly higher among the CSW than among the control subjects. Among the microorganisms tested, the positive rate for HPV-B was the highest in both the STD and control groups. Conclusions: The high prevalence of HPV, C. trachomatis, and N. gonorrhoeae infection in CSW poses a risk of further transmission of STD to the general public, suggesting the need for further education and screening for CSW and the general public. We found high- and intermediateoncogenic-type HPV to be the most prevalent infection among both CSW and control subjects. Screening for HPV may be necessary in STD and general clinics to predict the risk of cervical malignancy.

Of 561 blood specimens collected from 402 patients, complete clinical and laboratory data were available for 489. Using consensus definitions for true positives and true negatives, the sensitivities of the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay,</b> antigenemia, shell vial, and tube culture were 95, 94, 43, and 46 %, respectively. The specificities of the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay</b> and antigenemia were 95 and 94 %, respectively. At all three study sites, the detected level of CMV viremia was significantly higher with the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay</b> or antigenemia than with shell vial and tube culture. In a group of 131 healthy nonimmunosuppressed volunteers, the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay</b> demonstrated a specificity of over 99 %. The Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay</b> is a standardized assay that is simple to perform and can utilize whole blood specimens that have been stored for up to 48 h.

40|$|As {{progress}} is made toward elimination of measles, the laboratory confirmation of measles becomes increasingly important. However, both false-positive and false-negative results can occur with {{the routinely used}} indirect measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology tests. The measles IgM <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> {{is considered to be}} more specific, and therefore, its use is indicated for confirmatory testing, but its relative performance has not been fully assessed. Four commercial indirect measles IgM serology test kits (the Behring, Clark, Gull, and PanBio assays) and a commercial IgM <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> (the Light Diagnostics assay) were evaluated for their abilities to detect measles virus-specific IgM antibody with a total of 308 serum samples from patients involved in a measles outbreak and with confirmed cases of measles and 454 samples from subjects without measles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) IgM <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> was also used {{in a part of the}} evaluation. Among the indirect assays, the overall sensitivities ranged from 82. 8 % (Clark assay) to 88. 6 % (Behring assay) and specificity ranged from 86. 6 % (PanBio assay) to 99. 6 % (Gull assay). These rates were 92. 2 and 86. 6 %, respectively, for the Light Diagnostics <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> and 87. 0 and 94. 8 %, respectively, for the CDC <b>capture</b> <b>assay.</b> While the Light Diagnostics <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> had the best detection rate (80 %) with the acute-phase samples compared with those for the rest of the tests (CDC <b>capture</b> <b>assay,</b> 77 %; Behring assay, 70 %; Gull assay, 69 %; PanBio assay, 58 %; and Clark assay, 57 %), all tests showed a significantly improved sensitivity in the range of 92 % (Clark and PanBio assays) to 97 % (Light Diagnostics and CDC capture assays) with the convalescent-phase samples, as expected. The best seropositivity rates (in the range of 92 to 100 %) were observed with samples collected 6 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms. The Gull assay showed the highest positive predictive value (99. 6 %), followed by the Behring assay (97. 8 %) and the CDC <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> (96. 1 %). Overall, the Gull and Behring assays were found to be as good as or better than the capture assays.

We evaluated the amplification efficiencies of both PCR assays and also {{compared the}} specific HPV types detected by each method. The samples positive by the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay</b> were compared to the specific types detected by the PCR-based assays. The concordance between the two PCR assays in producing an HPV amplicon visible by gel electrophoresis or in detecting any HPV type was moderate: kappa values were 0. 61 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 56 to 0. 67) and 0. 51 (95 % CI = 0. 46 to 0. 58), respectively. The McNemar test for correlated proportions indicated that biotinylated PCR was less likely to produce a band (P = 0. 001) and to detect an HPV type (P = 0. 001) than the other PCR assay. In comparing the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay</b> results with the HPV types detected by the PCR-based assays, we found that positivity by the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay</b> {{for a number of}} samples may be due to cross-hybridization with HPV types not included in the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay</b> probe cocktails...|$|E

40|$|Epidemiologists and clinicians {{wishing to}} {{introduce}} human papillomavirus (HPV) testing into cervical cancer prevention programs need standardized, reliable, and accurate HPV DNA tests that can detect {{the full spectrum}} of pathogenic HPV types. The Hybrid Capture System assay from Digene (hybrid <b>capture</b> <b>assay)</b> is a nonradioactive kit designed to detect 14 HPV types in two groups: a mix of 9 high-risk types associated with anogenital cancer (HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, and 56) and another group of 5 low-risk types associated with condyloma acuminatum (HPV types 6, 11, 42, 43, and 44). The assay yields quantitative data meant to reflect viral concentration.

40|$|Virion <b>capture</b> <b>assays,</b> {{in which}} immobilized {{antibodies}} (Abs) capture virus particles, {{have been used}} to suggest that nonneutralizing Abs bind effectively to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) primary viruses. Here, we show that virion <b>capture</b> <b>assays,</b> under conditions commonly reported in the literature, give a poor indication of epitope expression on the surface of infectious primary HIV- 1. First, estimation of primary HIV- 1 capture by p 24 measurements shows a very poor correlation with an estimation based on infectivity measurements. Second, virion capture appears to require relatively low Ab affinity for the virion, as shown by the ability of a monoclonal Ab to capture a wild-type and a neutralization escape variant virus equally well. Nevertheless, in a more interpretable competition format, it is shown that nonneutralizing anti-CD 4 binding site (CD 4 bs) Abs compete with a neutralizing anti-CD 4 bs Ab (b 12) for virus capture, suggesting that the nonneutralizing anti-CD 4 bs Abs are able to bind to the envelope species that is involved in virion capture in these experiments. However, the nonneutralizing anti-CD 4 bs Abs do not inhibit neutralization by b 12 even at considerable excess. This suggests that the nonneutralizing Abs are unable to bind effectively to the envelope species required for virus infectivity. The results were obtained for three different primary virus envelopes. The explanation that we favor is that infectious HIV- 1 primary virions can express two forms of gp 120, an accessible nonfunctional form and a functional form with limited access. Binding to the nonfunctional form, which needs only to be present at relatively low density on the virion, permits capture but does not lead to neutralization. The expression of a nonfunctional but accessible form of gp 120 on virions may contribute to the general failure of HIV- 1 infection to elicit cross-neutralizing Abs and may represent a significant problem for vaccines based on viruses or virus-like particles...|$|R

The enzymes were released by using a gentle lysis procedure that did not interfere with antibody-enzyme interactions. All three enzymes were detected in 93 % (51 of 55) of the E. coli strains tested by coagglutination; two of the three enzymes were identified in the remaining 7 %. Of 42 non-E. coli tested by coagglutination, only four nonspecifically agglutinated either two or three of the anti-enzyme conjugates.

However, the Shh locus loops out from its chromosome territory only in the posterior limb bud (zone of polarizing activity or ZPA), where Shh expression is active. Notably, while Shh mRNA is detected throughout the ZPA, enhancer-promoter interactions and looping out were only observed in small fractions of ZPA cells. In situ detection of nascent Shh transcripts and unstable EGFP reporters revealed that active Shh transcription is likewise only seen in {{a small fraction of}} ZPA cells.

ResultsThe limiting-dilution CMV PCR and the hybrid <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> presented relatively similar changes of sensitivity and specificity at different CMV DNA concentrations. The kinetics of the positive and negative predictive values were also comparable. A higher CMV DNA load corresponded to an increased risk of developing CMV disease. Furthermore, an increase in the endpoint dilution of a positive CMV PCR also corresponded to more severe disease. After antiviral treatment, the CMV PCR decreased by at least 100 -fold (2 log 10) in 10 cases and by 10 -fold (1 log 10) in five cases. Thus, there was a oecrease in 15 of 18 (83 %) patients.

40|$|Background: Wild {{populations of}} Triatoma infestans are now {{believed}} to be the source of reinfestation of dwellings in some Andean areas and could impede the full achievement of vector control campaigns in this region. Given the poor knowledge of these populations in natural conditions, their basic biology traits, such as monthly demographic variations and movements of individuals, were explored. Methods: A previously identified wild population of T. infestans in a field adjacent to a group of isolated houses in an Andean valley (department of La Paz, Bolivia) was explored using regular <b>capture</b> <b>assays</b> over 13 months in 50 sites selected {{at the beginning of the}} study. The capture-mark-recapture method was applied monthly using mouse-baited adhesive traps for captures and fingernail polish of different colors for the marking. Results: The monthly <b>capture</b> <b>assays</b> did not show significant differences between rainy and dry seasons, showing evidence for a certain stability of the wild T. infestans population with only the nymph population tending to decline during the middle of the rainy season when rain is more intensive. Throughout the study, the monthly average number of bugs was 51. 1 +/- 25. 3 per assay, 91. 1 % were nymphs, and they were found at 30 of the 50 sites (60 %). The number of times a site was positive varied from one to 13. Site infestation was associated with the underground position of the traps, and rocks around and in the surroundings of the traps. The recaptures after marking were successful (138 recaptures over the study). The marking made it possible to detect for 14. 5 % of the recaptures significant movements of adults (up to 168 m) and nymphs (up to 34 m). Some bugs (nymphs and females) were recaptured after 5 months. For adults, recaptures (46 in total) mostly occurred between September and March. Females were recaptured twice as frequently as males. Conclusion: The Andean wild populations of T. infestans showed a strong spatial and temporal stability during the year-long study. Dispersal may occur mainly during the rainy season. The capture-mark-recapture method was successful and the longevity of the bugs and the distances covered by nymphs and adults were recorded...|$|R
40|$|An {{antigen capture}} {{immunoassay}} to detect West Nile (WN) virus antigen in infected mosquitoes and avian tissues has been developed. With this assay purified WN virus was detected at {{a concentration of}} 32 pg/ 0. 1 ml, and antigen in infected suckling mouse brain and laboratory-infected mosquito pools could be detected when the WN virus titer was 10 (2. 1) to 10 (3. 7) PFU/ 0. 1 ml. In a blindly coded set of field-collected mosquito pools (n = 100), this assay detected WN virus antigen in 12 of 18 (66. 7 %) TaqMan-positive pools, whereas traditional reverse transcriptase PCR detected 10 of 18 (55. 5 %) positive pools. A sample set of 73 organ homogenates from naturally infected American crows was also examined by WN virus antigen capture immunoassay and TaqMan {{for the presence of}} WN virus. The antigen <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> detected antigen in 30 of 34 (88. 2 %) TaqMan-positive tissues. Based upon a TaqMan-generated standard curve of infectious WN virus, the limit of detection in the antigen <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> for avian tissue homogenates was approximately 10 (3) PFU/ 0. 1 ml. The recommended WN virus antigen capture protocol, which includes a <b>capture</b> <b>assay</b> followed by a confirmatory inhibition assay used to retest presumptive positive samples, could distinguish between the closely related WN and St. Louis encephalitis viruses in virus-infected mosquito pools and avian tissues. Therefore, this immunoassay demonstrates adequate sensitivity and specificity for surveillance of WN virus activity in mosquito vectors and avian hosts, and, in addition, it is easy to perform and relatively inexpensive compared with the TaqMan assay...|$|E

The Hybrid Capture System assay from Digene (hybrid <b>capture</b> <b>assay)</b> is a nonradioactive kit designed to detect 14 HPV types in two groups: a mix of 9 high-risk types associated wit...|$|E
40|$|Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are {{etiological}} {{agents of}} cervical cancer. In {{order to assess}} the epidemiological incidence and frequency of different HPV types, we applied a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -direct sequencing approach based {{on the use of}} MY 09 /MY 11 primers as compared to Hybrid <b>Capture</b> <b>assay.</b> Cervical samples were taken from 1, 500 women, both with normal and abnormal cytological smears, and we found an incidence of 6. 6...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether DNA detection of high-risk human papillomavirus could represent a reliable screening technique and a useful follow-up method, we investigated {{the performance of}} the Hybrid <b>Capture</b> II <b>assay</b> in detecting high-grade cervical lesions. The test positivity at 1. 86 pg/ml had a high sensitivity (94. 7 %) and improved specificity. It was also a suitable follow-up method for detecting the recurrence of cervical intraepithelial disease in patients...|$|R
40|$|Proximity {{ligation}} assays such as circularized chromosome conformation {{capture and}} high-throughput chromosome <b>capture</b> <b>assays</b> have {{shed light on}} the structural organization of the interphase genome. Functional topologically associating domains (TADs) that constitute the building blocks of genomic organization are disrupted and reconstructed during the cell cycle. Epigenetic memory, as well as the sequence of chromosomes, regulate TAD reconstitution. Sub-TAD domains that are invariant across cell types have been identified, and contacts between these domains, rather than looping, are speculated to drive chromatin folding. Replication domains are established simultaneously with TADs during the cell cycle and the two correlate well in terms of characteristic features, such as lamin association and histone modifications. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin cooperate across different cell types to regulate genes and genome organization. CTCF elements that demarcate TAD boundaries are commonly disrupted in cancer and promote oncogene activation. Chromatin looping facilitates interactions between distant promoters and enhancers, and the resulting enhanceosome complex promotes gene expression. Deciphering the chromatin tangle requires comprehensive integrative analyses of DNA- and protein-dependent factors that regulate genomic organization...|$|R
40|$|Competitive binding {{studies and}} antigen <b>capture</b> <b>assays</b> {{were done with}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs) raised against hog cholera virus (HCV) to map the corresponding epitopes. A model was constructed in which the 13 epitopes were situated in four distinct antigenic domains: A, B, C and D. Domain A was subdivided into A 1, A 2 and A 3. The functional relevance of this model was assessed by the characterization of pestivirus strains, by neutralization studies with the MAbs, and by isolation of variants that escaped neutralization. The topographical arrangement of the epitopes, as constructed in the model, was corroborated by the functional assays. The MAbs that defined domains A 1 and A 2 recognized all 94 HCV strains tested. Domains A 3, B, C and D varied among the HCV strains. Neutralization was observed with MAbs defining domains A 1, B and C. Synergistic neutralization occurred using MAbs against domains A 1 and B, and A 1 and C, but not within the domains. With MAbs defining A 1, B or C, variants could be isolated that escaped neutralization and immunostaining by these MAbs...|$|R
