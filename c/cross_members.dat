A heroic figure of a giant man standing at the central anchorage between the two main suspension spans was suggested and quickly canceled; {{all that remains of}} the proposal is a 14-inch study modeled by Ralph Stackpole. The committee of architects succeeded mainly in making the suspension bridge towers more streamlined in appearance by getting rid of the civil engineer's plans for a greater number of horizontal <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Pflueger very likely designed the stepped semicircular tunnel entrance and exit portals and, by mounting a campaign of public pressure, prevented the bridge from being painted black, successfully substituting a silvery aluminum-based paint instead.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{continued}} rapid {{development in the}} increasingly competitive international voiturette class, {{and the introduction of}} the Alfa Romeo 158 and ERA B- and C-type models, forced the Maserati brothers into designing a new, square-bore, inline-4-cylinder engine. This new engine developed 30–50bhp more than the previous inline-6, the increase mostly achieved through an increase to four valves per cylinder, coupled to the use of a more powerful supercharger and a small increase in the compression ratio. Following customary Maserati practice, the engine was mounted into a chassis design almost identical to that of the 4CL's predecessor: the Maserati 6CM. Conventional in its architecture, twin box-section spars ran the length of the car joined, ladder-fashion, by smaller <b>cross</b> <b>members,</b> although the 4CL design did incorporate more aluminium componentry than its forebear.

2500|$|With {{respect to}} the eucharist, the ELCA holds to the Lutheran {{doctrine}} of the sacramental union, that is, that Christ's body and blood is truly present [...] "in, with and under" [...] the bread and wine.

Lutherans, however, reject the philosophical explanation of consubstantiation, preferring to see {{the presence of the}} Lord's body and blood as mysterious rather than explainable by human philosophy. The Lutheran belief in the mysterious character of the consecrated bread and wine is more similar to Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief than most Protestants.

[...] Rotta also got permission from the Vatican to begin issuing protective passes to Jewish converts - and was eventually able to distribute more than 15,000 such protective passes, while instructing the drafters of the documents not to examine the recipients credentials too closely. A Red Cross official asked Rotta for pre-signed blank identity papers, to offer to the sick and needy fleeing the Arrow Cross, and was given the documents, along with Rotta's blessing.

2500|$|Max Gerner's GIIR sport, touring and {{training}} biplane was a development of his one-off G I. [...] The two types had low cost, easily repaired structures built from proprietary steel tubing and [...] unswept, constant chord wings with two truss braced spars; both had lattice girder fuselages and were largely fabric covered. Both also had open, tandem cockpits, fixed undercarriages {{and a single}} engine. However, the GIIR was larger, heavier and had a choice of engines which typically doubled the power. The fuselage was lengthened, mostly by increased cockpit separation, strengthened with diagonal <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> between the longerons, which placed the rear cockpit behind, rather than over, the trailing edge. [...] These changes raised the weight by 25% and so wing area was increased by extending the span by 20%. The GIIR retained the N-form interplane and cabane struts of the G I, though the former no longer leaned outwards and the upper wing was somewhat higher over the fuselage. It had two extra inter-spar trusses (six rather than four) in its lower wing, which alone carried ailerons. A newly patented method cramped, rather than welded, trusses and spars together. The [...] GIIR was easier to transport as it wings could be folded parallel to its fuselage despite the move of the fuel reservoir from behind the engine firewall {{to the top of}} the upper wings, for it now consisted of two side-by-side tanks, one on each wing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models.

The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years.

2500|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Honda’s Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform using approximately 44% high-strength steel across the unibody and seven high-strength steel <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> to create a fully boxed ladder frame that is fully integrated into the unibody. [...] Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] According to Autoweek, The Ridgeline's [...] "unibody has many braces, brackets, and reinforced areas that require more welding than traditional pickups." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted an aluminum hood that supports a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the radiator to support torque production and deep water fording which Honda attempted to patent. [...] This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that are also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to their size, Honda incorporated small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to reduce air turbulence which Honda also attempted to patent. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. [...] This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a rear garnish that shields the rear glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion. [...] The bed is built out of steel-reinforced Sheet Molding Composite (SMC) which is dent resistant, corrosion resistant, and is covered with a non-slip coating. [...] It is supported by high-strength steel crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support heavy loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail or during collisions that would try to force that load into the cab.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{controlling}} road noise transmitted through {{the suspension system}} of an automobile was developed, using a Lincoln LS automobile as the target vehicle. In this vehicle, road surface roughness generates vibrations that are transmitted into the automobile primary through a single bushing (the "point 4 bushing") {{on each of the}} front suspension control arms. An electromagnetic actuator was designed, built, and tested on a Lincoln LS with simulated roads noise. The actuator applies a force across the point 4 bushing, in response to accelerations of the vehicle frame, just inboard of the bushing, with the goal of reducing the net forces transmitted into the vehicle frame, which ultimately produce unwanted interior noise. Several tonal controllers were developed, each designed to operate in a narrow frequency band, and to eliminate the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> (frame) vibration just inside the point 4 bushing. The tonal controllers were able to eliminate <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> vibration at the desired frequency. Eliminating the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> vibration resulted in modest reductions interior sound levels. A successful vibration control system (in this vehicle) would need to eliminate <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> vibrations over frequency range 100 to 200 Hz. However, a broadband controller with this electromagnetic actuator system proved to be difficult, due to undesirable non-minimum phase dynamics. by Kristen Lynn Clements. Thesis (S. M.)
