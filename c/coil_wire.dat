In the experiment, the effects of the <b>coil</b> diameter D, <b>wire</b> diameter d and coil spacing s of the <b>coiled</b> <b>wire</b> on the aerodynamic sound have been clarified.

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} {{was that}} the output voltage was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux. Faraday and others found that higher, more useful voltages could be produced by winding multiple turns of wire into a <b>coil.</b> <b>Wire</b> windings can conveniently produce any voltage desired by changing the number of turns, so they have been a feature of all subsequent generator designs, requiring {{the invention of the}} commutator to produce direct current.|$|E
50|$|Some {{loudspeaker}} designers use a planar-magnetic tweeter, {{sometimes called}} a quasi-ribbon. Planar magnetic tweeters are generally {{less expensive than}} true ribbon tweeters, but are not precisely equivalent as a metal foil ribbon is lighter than the diaphragm in a planar magnetic tweeter and the magnetic structures are different. Usually a thin piece of PET film or plastic with a voice <b>coil</b> <b>wire</b> running numerous times vertically on the material is used. The magnet structure is less expensive than for ribbon tweeters.|$|E
50|$|With {{over-excitation}} the in-rush voltage is momentary. Although {{it would}} depend upon {{the size of the}} coil the actual time is usually only a few milliseconds. The theory is, for the coil to generate as much of a magnetic field as quickly as possible to attract the armature and start the process of acceleration or deceleration. Once the over excitation is no longer required the power supply to the clutch or brake would return to its normal operating voltage. This process can be repeated a number of times as long as the high voltage does not stay in the coil long enough to cause the <b>coil</b> <b>wire</b> to overheat.|$|E

40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} ultrasonic detection methods, the electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) technique {{can be applied}} in many hostile environments such as elevated temperatures, on-line inspections, etc. However, the EMAT technique has a low conversion efficiency. This paper develops a numerical model to {{study the effects of}} the coil configurations on the conversion efficiency of shear-wave EMAT on 7050 aluminum alloy. The numerical model is fully validated by the experiment data. The effects of the configuration parameters, including the coil wires’ cross-sectional area, coil wires’ cross-sectional shape, and distance between <b>coil</b> <b>wires,</b> on the conversion efficiency are then discussed. The results indicate that after using the coil with a square cross-section, the conversion efficiency of EMAT is increased by 22. 5 %.

50|$|This {{ignition}} system uses an ignition coil wound as an autotransformer {{to step up}} the voltage from the 12 volts supplied by the battery (itself supplied, once the engine starts, by the alternator or dynamo in older vehicles). When the points close, current flows through the primary (input) side of the coil, which has a few hundred turns of wire, creating a magnetic field. When the points open, interrupting the current, this field collapses and as it does the lines of flux cut across the secondary (output) coil which has several thousand turns of very fine wire, inducing an open-circuit voltage {{in the range of}} 15 to 30 thousand volts at the coil output terminal. This high voltage pulse is carried by the <b>coil</b> <b>wire</b> to the center terminal of the distributor cap.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{very rare}} that a coil would just stop working in an {{electromagnetic}} coupling [...] Typically, if a coil fails it is usually due to heat which has caused the insulation of the <b>coil</b> <b>wire</b> to break down. The heat {{can be caused by}} high ambient temperature, high cycle rates, slipping or applying too high of a voltage. Bushings can be used in some clutches that have low speed, low side loads or low operating hours. At higher loads and speeds, bearing mounted field/rotors and hubs are a better option. Most brakes are flanged mounted and have bearings but some brakes are bearing mounted. Like the coils, unless bearings are stressed beyond their physical limitations or become contaminated, they tend to have a long life and they are usually the second item to wear out.|$|E

50|$|Latch and Batchelor: Founded by Mr Arthur Latch, Mr Telford Clarence Batchelor and Mr Henry Herbert Horsfall {{to develop}} Mr Batchelor’s patent of Locked <b>Coil</b> <b>Wire</b> Rope and Flattened Strand, it {{was formed in}} 1884 on part of the Hay Mills site owned at that time by Webster and Horsfall Ltd. Due to its smooth outer layer Locked Coil became {{increasing}} popular with its use in aerial ropeways and its unexpected yet excellent non-spinning properties and high breaking-strength-to-weight ratio were recognized by the mining industry and adopted worldwide. Locked Coil development continued {{with the advent of}} the half-lock Colliery Guide ropes and more use being made of galvanized wires. The company was one of the first to come under direct Government control in both World Wars. In the 1914-18 war they were the sole manufacturer of shell fuse spring wire, for example, producing 80,260 miles, along with anti-submarine netting, mine, aircraft and balloon cables.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} woofer specification is {{its power}} rating, {{the amount of}} power the woofer can handle without damage. The electrical power rating is not easily characterized and many manufacturers cite peak ratings attainable only for very brief moments without damage. Woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes: applications requiring high output, amplifier overload conditions, unusual signals (i.e., non-musical ones), very low frequencies at which the enclosure provides little or no acoustic loading (and {{so there will be}} maximum cone excursion), or amplifier failure. In high-volume situations, a woofer's voice coil will heat up, increase its resistance, causing [...] "power compression", a condition where output sound power level decreases after extended high power activity. Further heating can physically distort the voice coil, causing scuffing, shorting due to wire insulation deterioration, or other electrical or mechanical damage. Sudden impulse energy can melt a section of voice <b>coil</b> <b>wire,</b> causing an open circuit and a dead woofer; the necessary level will vary with driver characteristics. In normal listening level music applications, the electrical power rating of woofers is generally unimportant; it remains important for higher frequency drivers.|$|E
50|$|Active pickups {{utilize the}} same type of {{reluctance}} sensor as a passive pickup (although features such as <b>coil</b> <b>wire</b> size and number of windings may vary from those used in a passive pickup). Active pickups require an electrical source of energy (usually one or two 9V batteries) to operate and include an electronic preamp very similar to the preamp or buffer found in most amplifiers and effects circuits. The circuitry my be as simple as a single Transistor, up to several Operational Amplifiers configured as active filters, active EQ and other sound-shaping features. The most common circuitry incorporates JFET transistor technology, with common parts such as 2N5749 and J102 transistors, and TL061 and TL071 Op Amps. These circuits can be designed to give a large range of gain for a large range of possible output power. The circuitry is virtually identical to any preamplifier or buffer found in amplifiers and effects circuits. Unlike the preamp of an amplifier circuit, the Op Amps used need to be of a low power design to optimize battery life and they are unable to utilize a Rail to Rail input power configuration due to the low battery power. This limits the dynamic range of the circuit when compared to a Rail to Rail Op Amp preamp circuit as found in most amplifiers. By adding an additional preamplifier/buffer active pickups are able to filter attenuate or boost the signal from the pickup. Any extra voltage gain added to the output signal will increase clipping and distortion in any subsequent part of the amplification chain. This additional distortion makes active pickups popular among metal and rock guitarists.|$|E
