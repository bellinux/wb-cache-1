5|$|Beginning August 5, these {{divisions}} initiated numerous crossing {{attempts to}} assault the UN {{forces on the}} other side of the river in an attempt to capture Taegu and collapse the final UN defensive line. The U.S. forces were successful in repelling North Korean advances thanks to training and support, but forces in the South Korean sectors were not as successful.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in Europe, Inglis was one of New Zealand's delegates for the Allied Control Commission for Germany, which {{administered}} the now occupied country. He was appointed president of a military court in the British-controlled area of Germany dealing with <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> the occupying forces. After six months in this role, in February 1947 he was promoted to major general and made chief judge of the Allied Control Commission's Supreme Court.

5|$|Born in 1912, Potthast {{began as}} Himmler's {{secretary}} in 1936 and by 1938 {{she was his}} lover.

After the war, Potthast married and lived out {{the rest of her life}} outside the public eye. In post-war interviews, she refrained from answering questions about Himmler's involvement in war <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> the Nazis and her own knowledge of them. She died in 1997.|$|E
5|$|On {{a similar}} note, both {{countries}} {{would continue to}} conceal any war <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> the other side {{for the remainder of}} the war. The Holocaust was systematically concealed by the leadership in Tokyo, just as Japanese war crimes, e.g. the situation in China, were kept secret from the German public. An example would be the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army in Nanking in 1937, which were denounced by German industrialist John Rabe. Subsequently, the German leadership ordered Rabe back to Berlin, confiscating all his reports and prohibiting any further discussion of the topic.|$|E
40|$|<b>Crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> women {{belongs to}} a very {{peculiar}} criminological category due {{to the subject of}} the crime. The woman as a victim is a natural element of social consciousness, but the woman as an offender evokes a variety of emotions from curiosity through disrespect to fear. The aim of this research was to try to answer the question: How does the local community assess the threat of <b>crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> women in Warmian–Masurian voivodeship? The research in form of a survey has been carried out with 220 respondents. The environmental surveying has been carried out with different social groups residing in Warmian–Masurian voivodeship. All the respondents were of legal age. The survey form consisted of ten single–choice questions. All the answers have been treated as declarations. The research has proven that the local community assess the threat of <b>crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> women in Warmian–Masurian voivodeship at a relatively low level compared to other parts of Poland. In {{spite of the fact that}} <b>crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> women does not pose a significant threat in respondents’ opinion, the community of Warmian–Masurian voivodeship takes simple actions in order not to become a victim of a female offender.

In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, which had been set up by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration. Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947, but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2004, after a 19-month trial, Brown {{was convicted}} by a Japanese court of {{attempted}} indecent assault {{and destruction of}} private property and received a one-year suspended prison sentence. As {{a result of this}} incident and others involving <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> U.S. military personnel in Japan, both countries entered into negotiations aimed at modifying the SOFA in July 2003; ultimately, no changes were made to the agreement. In 2005, Brown {{was arrested and charged with}} a separate kidnapping in the United States. He was demoted and involuntarily retired from the military in 2006 and at his trial in 2009 entered an Alford plea, receiving probation on the felony conviction.|$|E
5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E

40|$|The {{verdict of}} {{judge in the}} cases of <b>crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> child {{practically}} goes through criminalization disparity. Therefore, the matter of verdict pronouncement is important not only for the judges and the judicial process, but also the whole legal process, particularly in the law enforcement. The objective of this research is to investigate the cause factors, impact, and model of criminalization policy with the existence of criminalization disparity {{in the cases of}} <b>crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> child. This research used the qualitative method with empirical juridical approach. The data of this research were gathered through interview and library research and analyzed. The results of this research are as follows: (1) there are two cause factors which causes the criminalization disparity to have happened in the cases of <b>crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> child, namely: internal factor which comes from the judges themselves and external factor which comes from either the law and legislation itself or the doer/defendant; (2) the criminalization disparity in the cases of <b>crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> child is going to bring about negative impacts. Such impacts are as follows: a) the convict feels to be harmed due to such verdict of judge if the convict makes comparison to another convict sentenced with lighter sentence; b) the convict sentenced with lighter sentence is going to assume that breaking the law is not scary due to the light sentence; and c) the people who seek justice will feel discontent which eventually causes the trust {{of the people in the}} penal judicial system to disappear; and (3) the criminalization judicial system in the cases of <b>crime</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> child can be made by creating a criminalization guidanc...|$|R

5|$|Of {{the total}} number of deaths in World WarII, {{approximately}} 85 per cent—mostly Soviet and Chinese—were on the Allied side and 15 per cent were on the Axis side. Many of these deaths were caused by war <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> German and Japanese forces in occupied territories. An estimated 11 to 17 million civilians died either as a direct or as an indirect result of Nazi racist policies, including the Holocaust of around 6 million Jews, half of whom were Polish citizens, along with a further minimum 1.9 million ethnic Poles. Millions of other Slavs (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), Roma, homosexuals, and other ethnic and minority groups were also killed. Hundreds of thousands (varying estimates) of ethnic Serbs, along with gypsies and Jews, were murdered by the Axis-aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia, and retribution-related killings were committed just after the war ended.|$|E
5|$|The ICTY charged Milošević {{with the}} {{extermination}} of non-Serb civilians in Erdut, the forcible transfer {{of at least}} 2,500 inhabitants of the village and destruction of their property. Milošević's trial commenced on 12 February 2002, but he died in March 2006 before a verdict could be reached. The SDG, which became the most powerful paramilitary formation in eastern Slavonia, and Ražnatović gained notoriety for war crimes and ethnic cleansing. The SDG systematically plundered villages in the region, turning the area into a source of oak lumber, crude oil and wine for Ražnatović to sell in Serbia, and in Erdut itself. Ražnatović was never charged for any war <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> the SDG in Erdut. The ICTY only charged him with several war crimes committed in or near Sanski Most. He was assassinated in Belgrade on 15 January 2000 before he could stand trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} held Hill 314 for {{the next}} six days and gathered up a large amount of North Korean equipment and ammunition. The North Korean soldiers on Hill 314 wore American uniforms, helmets, and combat boots. Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines. About 200 North Korean dead were on the hill. Of the other 500 estimated to have been there, most of them had been wounded or were missing. Several war <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> the North Koreans came to light during the action on Hill 314. On September 12 while the final action on the hill was taking place, troops discovered an American officer who had been bound, gasoline poured over him, and burned. Two days later members of the battalion found on the hill the bodies of four other American soldiers with their hands tied. The bodies bore evidence that the men had been bayoneted and shot while bound.|$|E

5|$|On 21 November the JNA and the SAO Krajina TO {{destroyed}} the Maslenica Bridge and began reorienting their main effort towards Novigrad, Pridraga, Paljuv and Podgradina, {{on the right}} flank of the Zadar sector. Those efforts culminated on 31 December 1991 1 January 1992, when the four settlements were captured. On 3 January the JNA attacked Poličnik and Zemunik Donji, again threatening the road to Pag and Zadar; however, the advances failed. Zadar was bombarded by artillery during the offensive. A plan by the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps {{to advance to the}} Adriatic coast at Pirovac (east of Zadar) was drawn up by 30 December 1991 under the codename Strike 91 (Udar 91), but was not implemented. This period saw more war <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> SAO Krajina troops, including the killing of nine civilians and a JNA member in the Bruška massacre on 21 December. Fighting stopped again on 3 January when a new cease-fire, based on a peace plan brokered by United Nations Special Envoy Cyrus Vance, went into effect.|$|E
5|$|When {{he became}} president, {{he sent a}} bill to the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to investigate the <b>crimes</b> <b>committed</b> <b>by</b> the military, {{which led to the}} Trial of the Juntas and resulted in the sentencing of the heads of the former regime. Discontent within the military led to the mutinies of the Carapintadas, leading Alfonsín to appease them with the full stop law and the law of Due Obedience. He also had conflicts with the unions, which were controlled by the opposing Justicialist Party. He resolved the Beagle conflict, increased trade with Brazil, and proposed the creation of the Contadora support group to mediate between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. He passed the first divorce law of Argentina. He initiated the Austral plan to improve the national economy, but that plan, as well as the Spring plan, failed. The resulting hyperinflation and riots led to his party's defeat in the 1989 presidential elections, which was won by Peronist Carlos Menem.|$|E
