40|$|With {{aging and}} {{deterioration}} of bridges, evaluation of existing conditions of their structural elements becomes vital to engineers {{and public officials}} when deciding how to repair or replace the structures. The ability to obtain necessary information on these conditions is often expensive and time consuming, especially for concrete bridges where the reinforcement is not available for inspection. Employing the surface-strain relief method could allow for accurate evaluation of aged or damaged prestressed members. The surface-strain relief method was developed to measure initial or pre-existing strains in a concrete member. It involves relieving the strain in the member and measuring the change in strain. Two methods were tested in this study—one used a linear electrical-resistance strain gage and a three-inch-diameter diamond concrete <b>core</b> <b>bit</b> to cut around the gage, and the second method used a laser-speckle imaging device and a diamond cutting wheel to create notches perpendicular to the axis of maximum strain.

30|$|Drilling {{operation}} {{for the second}} IDDP well started {{in the beginning of}} August 2016 with deepening of an existing 2500  m deep production RN- 15 well located in the Reykjanes geothermal field in south–west Iceland. The RN- 15 was a mere vertical production well with a 13 3 / 8 ″ production casing string cemented down to 794  m and an open hole completion. Drilling of the IDDP- 2 well was carried out ‘blind’, i.e., without any drilling fluid returns with an exception of an interval of around 180  m after completed primary cementing operation of an anchor casing at 2941  m depth. Losses of drilling fluid could not be cured with loss circulation material (i.e., polymer pills) nor with multiple cement plugs performed through drill bit as well as through drillable fiber cementing strings. Multiple challenges occurred during drilling operations including weather delays, problems with hole instability that required multiple reaming jobs as well as stuck pipe incidents. The IDDP- 2 well was cemented using reverse circulation method, due to total fluid losses and achieved satisfactory results. As of today, the IDDP- 2 well has the deepest cemented casing in any geothermal well in Iceland. 13 core runs were attempted with rather poor core recovery using an impregnated 8 ½″ diamond <b>core</b> <b>bit</b> and perfect core recovery of nearly 100 % with a 6 ″ PDC <b>core</b> <b>bit</b> beneath the liner pipe. Poor core recovery in the IDDP- 2 well might be explained by fill-in {{at the bottom of the}} well, inclination, heavy dog legs, thermal fracturing of the rock formations as well as the diameter of core barrel being wider than the diameter of heavyweight drill pipe. The IDDP- 2 well was finished at a depth of 4659  m in mid-December 2016 and the perforated liner pipe was lowered to a well depth of 4572  m. At the end of drilling operations, an additional sacrificial 7 ″ casing was set to a depth of 1300  m and cemented. Logging program, including temperature, pressure, and injectivity measurements, was carried out after 6  days of partial heating up. It was confirmed that the IDDP- 2 well successfully penetrated the supercritical conditions of the geothermal brines in the Reykjanes geothermal system with 427  °C and 340 bars of pressure. The main feed zones of the IDDP- 2 well were estimated at depths of 3360  m, 4200  m, 4370  m and 4550  m (Friðleifsson and Elders 2017; Friðleifsson et al. 2017). Right after the drilling operation ceased, an 3 ½″ injection string was lowered close to the well bottom and a 5 -months stimulation operation with cold water pumping started. In May 2017, temperature logs were carried out after few days of heating up and confirmed bottom hole temperature of approximately 535  °C. After well stimulation, an attempt was made to seal off the main feed zone at 3400  m using biodegradable polymers. Unexpectedly, material totally blocked the well from downflowing and cooling was no longer possible. This resulted in week-long heating up of the production casing string and a serious casing damage between 2307 and 2380  m of well depth was discovered using wire-line logs. After retrieving the stimulation string, corrosion of latter assembly sections was observed. Currently, preparation for production tests is ongoing with the first flow tests planned for the first quarter of 2019 (iddp.com).|$|E

40|$|High-frequency/low-frequency {{drilling}} is {{an attractive}} technology for planetary exploration tools, and one which has seen considerable innovation in the techniques used to ensure rotation of the front-end cutting bit. This rotation is essential to prevent tooth imprintation in hard materials, and extracting the rotation from the high-frequency or ultrasonic system has obvious benefits in terms of simplicity and robustness. However, extracting the rotation from an ultrasonic horn raises the possibility of bit-walk if {{it is used to}} operate a coring device and the authors therefore propose an ultrasonic horn which uses an excitation applied to a single input surface to yield torsional and longitudinal vibration on two physically separated output surfaces. By engaging with the two output surfaces, longitudinal vibration can be extracted to achieve initial percussive drilling, even where a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> is applied, and the torsional output can subsequently be added to prevent tooth imprintation once the <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> has settled into the site in question.

50|$|By the 1920s, {{about half}} of the Company's {{drilling}} was outside the continental United States. Robert Longyear (E.J.’s son) became president of the firm in 1924, preserving the chain of family ownership and management that would continue for another 40 years. In 1929, Longyear sold almost US$1.5 million worth of drilling equipment to other drillers. The following year the company formed its first foreign subsidiary in Canada. The company also signed its first contract for work in Africa, sending equipment and a crew to provide drilling for copper ores. However, the stock market crash of October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression reduced earnings to $79,000 in 1933. During the 1930s, Longyear took on a project drilling for core samples for the proposed Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In spite of the financial crisis, the 1930s saw improvements in diamond drilling technology, including the use of industrial-quality diamonds mined in Africa that were called “boarts.” In 1936, South Africa’s Anglo American Corporation formed Boart Products South Africa (Pty) Limited, which was later named Boart International.

Special attention was given to the volume of flushing which could be applied to the core barrel and through the bit while running {{in and out of the}} borehole and while coring. In November 2008 a successful spot coring test using the new core barrel was performed at 2800 m depth in the production well RN- 17 B at Reykjanes, Iceland, where the formation temperature is 322 °C.

A core tube data logger was also designed and placed inside the inner barrel to monitor the effectiveness of cooling. The temperature could be maintained at 100 °C while coring, but it reached 170 °C for a very short period while tripping in.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated rotary percussive drill is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a rotary percussive bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond <b>core</b> <b>bit</b> is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond <b>core</b> <b>bit</b> is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface. Typical adhesion test results comparing tensile strength with shotcrete curing age are shown in Figure 4. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011.

40|$|The two phase program {{addresses}} long-term {{developments in}} deep well and hard rock drilling. TerraTek believes that {{significant improvements in}} drilling deep hard rock will be obtained by applying ultra-high rotational speeds (greater than 10, 000 rpm). The work includes a feasibility of concept research effort aimed at development that will ultimately result {{in the ability to}} reliably drill ''faster and deeper'' possibly with smaller, more mobile rigs. The principle focus is on demonstration testing of diamond bits rotating at speeds in excess of 10, 000 rpm to achieve high rate of penetration (ROP) rock cutting with substantially lower inputs of energy and loads. The significance of the ultra-high rotary speed drilling system is the ability to drill into rock at very low weights on bit and possibly lower energy levels. The drilling and coring industry today does not practice this technology. The highest rotary speed systems in oil field and mining drilling and coring today run less than 10, 000 rpm [...] usually well below 5, 000 rpm. This document details the progress to date on the program entitled ''Smaller Footprint Drilling System for Deep and Hard Rock Environments: Feasibility of Ultra-High-Speed Diamond Drilling'' for the period starting 1 October 2004 through 30 September 2005. Additionally, research activity from 1 October 2005 through 28 February 2006 is included in this report: (1) TerraTek reviewed applicable literature and documentation and convened a project kick-off meeting with Industry Advisors in attendance. (2) TerraTek designed and planned Phase I bench scale experiments. Some difficulties continue in obtaining ultra-high speed motors.

40|$|Overcoring is a {{measurement}} method used for estimating {{the state of}} stress in a rock mass. The method is based on measuring the strains that develop when a sample of rock, by drilling with a hollow <b>core</b> <b>bit,</b> is released from the surrounding rock and the stresses acting upon it. During the current work to find a site suitable for a future underground repository for final disposal of spent nuclear fuel in Sweden, the overcoring stress measurement method {{was used in the}} site investigation programme. In some of these tests temperature effects have been noted, which affect the reliability of the results. The causes and consequences of these effects have not been investigated though. This thesis work was conducted to address part of the issue of temperature effects during overcoring. The main part of the thesis consisted of a study of which of the parameters (i) logger, (ii) glue, (iii) strain gauges and (iv) material type that were most sensitive to temperature effects during overcoring. The temperature sensitivity was determined by measuring the strains recorded by the logger when heating each object in different test cases. All of the factors logger, glue and material showed a response dependent on temperature. The response of the logger was so small in magnitude that it could be neglected on basis of the small magnitude of the absolute error it caused on calculated stresses. The glue showed a response of fairly great magnitude regarding temperature change when not fully cured. When subjected to temperature increase, the curing of the glue was reactivated, causing shrinkage of the material and affecting strain readings to seem smaller in magnitude than the true value. The rock cores tested showed a temperature response of great magnitude. The response was not that of an ideal material as the cores did not expand and contract as expected when subjected to temperature change. The response could thus not be quantified based on the tests performed It is not known if these factors are independent or dependent of each other and hence it is hard to tell which factor that is most sensitive to temperature increase during an actual overcoring. The temperature effects of the glue and rock were difficult to quantify and thus also difficult to compensate for. Therefore they should be avoided by minimizing the temperature increase caused by overcoring. This can be done by better flushing and temperature control, by a larger overcoring diameter or possibly by a different overcoring feed speed or different drill bit. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The two phase program {{addresses}} long-term {{developments in}} deep well and hard rock drilling. TerraTek believes that {{significant improvements in}} drilling deep hard rock will be obtained by applying ultra-high rotational speeds (greater than 10, 000 rpm). The work includes a feasibility of concept research effort aimed at development that will ultimately result {{in the ability to}} reliably drill 'faster and deeper' possibly with smaller, more mobile rigs. The principle focus is on demonstration testing of diamond bits rotating at speeds in excess of 10, 000 rpm to achieve high rate of penetration (ROP) rock cutting with substantially lower inputs of energy and loads. The significance of the 'ultra-high rotary speed drilling system' is the ability to drill into rock at very low weights on bit and possibly lower energy levels. The drilling and coring industry today does not practice this technology. The highest rotary speed systems in oil field and mining drilling and coring today run less than 10, 000 rpm - usually well below 5, 000 rpm. This document provides the progress through two phases of the program entitled 'Smaller Footprint Drilling System for Deep and Hard Rock Environments: Feasibility of Ultra-High-Speed Diamond Drilling' for the period starting 30 June 2003 and concluding 31 March 2009. The accomplishments of Phases 1 and 2 are summarized as follows: (1) TerraTek reviewed applicable literature and documentation and convened a project kick-off meeting with Industry Advisors in attendance (see Black and Judzis); (2) TerraTek designed and planned Phase I bench scale experiments (See Black and Judzis). Improvements were made to the loading mechanism and the rotational speed monitoring instrumentation. New drill bit designs were developed to provided a more consistent product with consistent performance. A test matrix for the final <b>core</b> <b>bit</b> testing program was completed; (3) TerraTek concluded small-scale cutting performance tests; (4) Analysis of Phase 1 data indicated that there is decreased specific energy as the rotational speed increases; (5) Technology transfer, as part of Phase 1, was accomplished with technical presentations to the industry (see Judzis, Boucher, McCammon, and Black); (6) TerraTek prepared a design concept for the high speed drilling test stand, which was planned around the proposed high speed mud motor concept. Alternative drives for the test stand were explored; a high speed hydraulic motor concept was finally used; (7) The high speed system was modified to accommodate larger drill bits than originally planned; (8) Prototype mud turbine motors and the high speed test stand were used to drive the drill bits at high speed; (9) Three different rock types were used during the testing: Sierra White granite, Crab Orchard sandstone, and Colton sandstone. The drill bits used included diamond impregnated bits, a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit, a thermally stable PDC (TSP) bit, and a hybrid TSP and natural diamond bit; and (10) The drill bits were run at rotary speeds up to 5500 rpm and weight on bit (WOB) to 8000 lbf. During Phase 2, the ROP as measured in depth of cut per bit revolution generally increased with increased WOB. The performance was mixed with increased rotary speed, with the depth cut with the impregnated drill bit generally increasing and the TSP and hybrid TSP drill bits generally decreasing. The ROP in ft/hr generally increased with all bits with increased WOB and rotary speed. The mechanical specific energy generally improved (decreased) with increased WOB and was mixed with increased rotary speed...|$|E

40|$|This device takes {{advantage}} of the centrifugal forces that are generated when a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> is rotated, and a granular sample is entered into the bit while it is spinning, making it adhere to the internal wall of the bit, where it compacts itself into the wall of the bit. The bit can be specially designed to increase the effectiveness of regolith capturing while turning and penetrating the subsurface. The bit teeth can be oriented such that they direct the regolith toward the bit axis during the rotation of the bit. The bit can be designed with an internal flute that directs the regolith upward inside the bit. The use of both the teeth and flute can be implemented in the same bit. The bit can also be designed with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. In another implementation, the bit can be designed to collect regolith primarily from a specific depth. For that implementation, the bit can be designed such that when turning one way, the teeth guide the regolith outward of the bit and when turning in the opposite direction, the teeth will guide the regolith inward into the bit internal section. This mechanism can be implemented with or without an internal flute. The device is based on the use of a spinning <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> (hollow interior) as a means of retaining granular sample, and the acquisition is done by inserting the bit into the subsurface of a regolith, soil, or powder. To demonstrate the concept, a commercial drill and a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> were used. The bit was turned and inserted into the soil that was contained in a bucket. While spinning the bit (at speeds of 600 to 700 RPM), the drill was lifted and the soil was retained inside the bit. To prove this point, the drill was turned horizontally, and the acquired soil was still inside the bit. The basic theory behind the process of retaining unconsolidated mass that can be acquired by the centrifugal forces of the bit is determined by noting that in order to stay inside the interior of the bit, the frictional force must be greater than the weight of the sample. The bit can be designed with an internal sleeve to serve as a container for granular samples. This tube-shaped component can be extracted upon completion of the sampling, and the bottom can be capped by placing the bit onto a corklike component. Then, upon removal of the internal tube, the top section can be sealed. The novel features of this device are: center dot A mechanism of acquiring and retaining granular samples using a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> without a closed door. center dot An acquisition bit that has internal structure such as a waffle pattern for compartmentalizing or helical internal flute to propel the sample inside the bit and help in acquiring and retaining granular samples. center dot A bit with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. center dot A design that provides a method of testing frictional properties of the granular samples and potentially segregating particles based on size and density. A controlled acceleration or deceleration may be used to drop the least-frictional particles or to eventually shear the unconsolidated material near the bit center...|$|R

Unlike other drills, the purpose is often to retrieve the core rather than simply to make a hole. A diamond <b>core</b> drill <b>bit</b> is intended to cut an annular hole in the workpiece. Large bits of similar shape are used for geological work, where a deep hole is drilled in sediment or ice and the drill bit, which now contains an intact core of the material drilled with a diameter of several centimeters, is retrieved to allow study of the strata.|$|R
