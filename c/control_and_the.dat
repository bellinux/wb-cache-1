5|$|Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet {{censorship}} and <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{majority of their}} actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring. Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E

Outside these areas, encouragement should be given to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration should be given to pollution <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity.|$|E

Canada's obligation was met by building three dams (two on the Columbia, and one on the Duncan River), the last of which was completed in 1973.|$|E

These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed.

5|$|Pursuant to the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy {{the islands}} of Cres, Lastovo and Palagru≈æa and the cities of Zadar and Rijeka and most of Istria went to {{communist}} Yugoslavia and Croatia, while carving out the Free Territory of Trieste (FTT) as a city-state. The FTT was partitioned in 1954 as Trieste itself and the area {{to the north of}} it were placed under Italian <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest under Yugoslav control. The arrangement was made permanent by the Treaty of Osimo in 1975.
