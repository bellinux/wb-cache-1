5|$|Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet {{censorship}} and <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{majority of their}} actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of censorship. Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring. Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E

This proposes the establishment of protected areas {{around the world and}} the management of these areas to provide suitable habitat for dragonflies. Outside these areas, encouragement should be given to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration should be given to pollution <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the United States and Canada {{signed the}} Columbia River Treaty, {{which focused on}} flood <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{maximization}} of downstream power generation.

Canada's obligation was met by building three dams (two on the Columbia, and one on the Duncan River), the last of which was completed in 1973.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{at about}} 11:00 am, 16 tanks, 2 armored {{personnel}} carriers and 30 cars had been sent from the Officer School of Armored and Mechanized Formations, a Poznań garrison, to protect the designated buildings, but no shots were exchanged {{between them and the}} insurgents. These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed. Then the Soviet General Konstantin Rokossovsky, the Minister of National Defense, who was then in command of all armed forces in Poland, decided to take personal <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> situation changed dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Pursuant to the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy {{the islands}} of Cres, Lastovo and Palagruža and the cities of Zadar and Rijeka and most of Istria went to {{communist}} Yugoslavia and Croatia, while carving out the Free Territory of Trieste (FTT) as a city-state. The FTT was partitioned in 1954 as Trieste itself and the area {{to the north of}} it were placed under Italian <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest under Yugoslav control. The arrangement was made permanent by the Treaty of Osimo in 1975. The former FTT's Yugoslav part was partitioned between Croatia and Slovenia, largely conforming to the area population's ethnic composition.|$|E
