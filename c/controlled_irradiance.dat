This paper investigates ageing of a-Si devices using indoor <b>controlled</b> <b>irradiance</b> and temperature stresses testing. Device maximum power degradation is analyzed against the proposed environmental dose, which is derived from the microscopic model of defects generation and annealing of a-Si material. This dose model well describes the ageing behavior for the devices degraded at different conditions of irradiances from 130 - 500 W/m 2 and temperatures from 25 - 85 °C. This, thus, enables the comparison study of device ageing under different environmental conditions and allows the attempt to correlate the outdoor environment to indoor performance...|$|E

40|$|In this Letter, {{we report}} {{a method to}} prepare a liquid crystal (LC) lens based on a {{variable}} pretilt angle of a photoalignment (PA) layer. With precise <b>control</b> of the <b>irradiance,</b> such PA provides good control on the pretilt angle that can be tuned {{in the range of}} 1 °– 89 °. Therefore, the precise <b>control</b> of the <b>irradiance</b> generates a spatially varying pretilt angle with any desired pretilt angle profile. Thus, the tunable LC lenses have been fabricated and characterized.

40|$|A hierarchically {{structured}} environment that integrates a knowledge- based expert system, adaptive process control and pattern recognition techniques for controlling a {{laser cutting process}} is described. Knowledge of the laser cutting process for different materials is organised and encoded into a rule-based system. An adaptive control algorithm based on on-line recursive parameter estimation and on-line control law synthesis was adopted for the highly non-linear cutting process control. Cutting speed {{was selected as the}} major <b>control</b> variable. <b>Irradiance</b> emitted from the cut front is used for the feedback signal to this adaptive controller. The irradiance signal feeds the recursive parameter estimator for system identification. Techniques of pattern recognition, which have been well developed in coherent optics, were applied to assess cut quality by characterising the exit spark cone images of the gas assisted laser cutting process. Images from the cutting processes were grabbed, edge enhanced and correlated with a synthetic discriminant function filter which was synthesised from reference images to give good cut quality. Results from digital simulations based on these pattern recognition algorithms are also presented. © 1994...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{production}} in the fjords of the Faroe Islands is usually high. Results of productivity measurements in a typical Faroese fjord (Kaldbaksfjord) in 2006 and 2007 reveal values of about 335 g C m 22 year 21, which is {{two to three times}} higher than reported from neighboring regions, such as Icelandic, west Norwegian and west Scottish fjords. The causal mechanism is high flushing rate of the eupho-tic zone and high influx of nutrients, relative to the surface area. On average, the majority of the production is based on new production. The productive season is from late March to early April until October. It is <b>controlled</b> by <b>irradiance</b> and occurs when the critical depth extends below the halocline. The system is highly dynamic and the plankton productivity is largely influenced by short-term fluctu-ations in horizontal flow and vertical mixing, influencing vertical as well as tem-poral variability in P/B ratio and f-ratio. Fast repetition rate fluorescence profiles revealed that Fv/Fm decreases below 0. 5 when the light intensity is above 200 mE m 22 s 21 or when the nitrate þ ammonium concentrations were below a threshold between 0. 8 and 2 mM...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{applications}} {{require the}} simultaneous redistribution of the irradiance and {{phase of a}} laser beam. The beam shape is thereby determined by the respective application. An elegant way to <b>control</b> the <b>irradiance</b> and phase {{at the same time}} is from double freeform surfaces. In this work the numerical design of continuous double freeform surfaces from ray mapping methods for collimated beam shaping with arbitrary irradiances is considered. These methods consist of the calculation of a proper ray mapping between the source and the target irradiance and the subsequent construction of the freeform surfaces. By combining the law of refraction, the constant optical path length and the surface continuity condition, a partial differential equation (PDE) for the ray mapping is derived. It is shown that the PDE can be fulfilled in a small-angle approximation by a mapping derived from optimal mass transport with a quadratic cost function. To overcome the restriction to the paraxial regime we use this mapping as an initial iterate for the simultaneous solution of the Jacobian equation and the ray mapping PDE by an optimization. The presented approach enables the efficient calculation of compact double freeform surfaces for complex target irradiances. This is demonstrated by applying it to the design of a single-lens and a two-lens system...|$|R

Based {{on the assumption that}} HCO, was the carbon source, the maximum discrimination against 13 C in the decalcified E. huxleyi cells was 24. 6 ? & at 4. 8 mol photons m- * d-l and the minimum discrimination was 17. 9 ? & at 0. 5 mol photons m- * d-l. In calcified cells, the range of 13 C isotope discrimination was markedly lower (12 - 217 ~). In both calcified and decalcified cells, the carbon isotopic composition of and carbon isotopic discrimination by E. huxleyi was a significant linear function of irradiance from 0. 5 to 4. 8 mol photons m- * d- I. The relationship between isotopic discrimination and irradiance in E. huxleyi provides new evidence that the 613 C of the oceanic POC samples should not be treated simply as a function of sea surface temperature or [CO,],,.

The APE is shown to be a strong predictor of spectral irradiance distribution for the two datasets after they are filtered to remove low irradiance data. Comparing the irradiance data from the two locations showed that the same APE value defines very similar distributions for global horizontal spectral irradiance recorded at the sites considered.

40|$|Phototrophic biofilms {{are defined}} as {{interfacial}} microbial communities mainly driven by light as energy source and are studied for both ecological and technological reasons. Field investigations of biofilms usually do not offer the opportunity to {{study the effects of}} a large number of external parameters. In order to investigate the temporal development of phototrophic communities a laboratory flow-lane incubator for cultivation of freshwater and marine biofilms was developed. The incubator has four lanes which accommodate microscope slides used as substratum and for sampling. The slides can be of different material and may be employed for characterisation of phototrophic biofilms by means of gravimetry, microscopy, taxonomy, molecular biology and chemical analysis. The design allows <b>control</b> of <b>irradiance,</b> temperature and flow velocity. Furthermore, on-line control of biomass accumulation via specially adapted light sensors was proved to be a suitable indicator of temporal developmental stages (initial adhesion, active growth and mature stage). Spatial heterogeneity of the cultivated phototrophic biofilms along the flow direction within each flow-lane was low. Biofilm growth characteristics (e. g. lag time, net accrual rate, peak biomass) recorded in dependency from external conditions may be used as input data for training of artificial neural networks (ANN) and mechanistic modelling. The material and devices used in combination with low maintenance costs and ease of handling suggests the flow-lane incubator as a useful tool for studying the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the development of freshwater and marine phototrophic biofilms. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Stormwater {{from urban}} land degrades aquatic ecosystems. Nutrients, light and flow regime affect the {{development}} of benthic microalgae (micro-phytobenthos), and all are affected by urban storm-water. The relative influence of these factors on microphytobenthos is unknown and is largely untest-ed. This study investigated the effect of urbanization, <b>controlling</b> for <b>irradiance,</b> on {{the development of}} stream microphytobenthos assemblages. Three light levels were achieved (two were comparable) in four streams of different catchment urbanization. Micro-phytobenthos assemblages were sampled fortnightly from each stream over 79 days in winter. Biomass (chlorophyll a, pheophytin and cell density) increased with catchment urbanization. Light only affected biomass in the more urban streams and scour may have affected microphytobenthos assemblages in the most urban stream. Each stream had distinct assemb-lages, although time and light had no apparent effect on their composition. Physiological analysis suggested that the microphytobenthos was potentially light-limited in all four streams. However, light limitation was overridden by nutrient limitation in the least urbanized streams. The alleviation of nutrient limi-tation in one stream under the highest light treatment was attributed tomicrophytobenthos having sufficient energy to support active uptake of nutrients. Light did not drive differences in microphytobenthos biomass among the four study streams; differences were due to other factors affected by urbanization, most likely nutrient enrichment. To minimize the risk of algal blooms in urban waterways, reducing eutrophication should be a higher management priority than limiting irradiance. Key words.

Bhand., {{which is}} widely {{planted in the}} Tropics and native to African rain forests, {{produced}} new reiterations (new leader shoots) normally and after damage induced by Hurricane Andrew (August 24, 1992). In each new orthotropic shoot, there is a gradient in lateral branch structures from basal thorns, to vegetative leafy branches, to distal leafy flowering branches. We noted that reiterations developing in shade had more thorns than similar reiterations developing in full sun. Tents with clear (66 % photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]) and shaded plastic film (12 %– 14 % PAR) were placed over nodes when the axillary buds began to expand to produce reiteration shoots. After 2 mo of growth inside the tents and in the open, the types of lateral outgrowths (thorn vs. branch) were recorded. Shoots in spectrally neutral shade (red to far red of full sun) and spectrally altered shade (red to far red of canopy shade) produced significantly more thorns at the lower nodes of the shoots as compared to those in full sun. Shoots in control clear plastic tents {{were the same as}} those in full sun. We conclude that the fate of lateral bud development is <b>controlled</b> by <b>irradiance</b> (light level) but not by light quality. Increased thorn production in shade could be advantageous to plants growing in the deep shade of rain forests.

40|$|Mammalian retinal photoreceptors form an {{irradiance}} {{detection system}} that drives many nonvisual responses to light such as pupil reflex and resetting of the circadian clock. To {{understand the role}} of pupil size in circadian light responses, pupil diameter was pharmacologically manipulated and the effect on behavioral phase shifts at different irradiance levels was studied in the Syrian hamster. Dose-response curves for steady-state pupil size and for behavioral phase shifts were constructed for 3 pupil conditions (dilated, constricted, and <b>control).</b> Retinal <b>irradiance</b> was calculated from corneal irradiance, pupil size, retinal surface area, and absorption of ocular media. The sensitivity of photic responses to retinal irradiance is approximately 1. 5 log units higher than to corneal irradiance. When plotted against corneal irradiance, pharmacological pupil constriction reduces the light sensitivity of the circadian system, but pupil dilation has no effect. As expected, when plotted against retinal irradiance all dose-response curves superimposed, confirming that the circadian system responds to photon flux on the retina. Pupil dilation does not increase the circadian response to increasing irradiance, since {{the response of the}} circadian system attains saturation at irradiance levels lower than those required to induce pupil constriction. The main finding shows that due to the different response sensitivities, the effect of pupil constriction on the light sensitivity of the circadian system in the hamster under natural conditions is virtually negligible. We further suggest the existence of distinct modulating mechanisms for the differential retinal irradiance sensitivity of the pupil system and the circadian system, which enables the different responses to be tuned to their specific tasks while using similar photoreceptive input...|$|R

Nitrogen deficiency had only a small effect on the quantum yield of CO 2 assimilation but a large effect on the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. Linear relationships persisted between the quantum yield of CO 2 assimilation and that of photosystem II photochemistry in all circumstances. At high irradiances, large differences in photochemical quenching and nonphotochemical quenching of Chl a fluorescence as well as the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (Fv/Fm) were apparent between nitrogen-deficient plants and nitrogen-replete controls, whereas at low irradiances these parameters were comparable in all plants. Light intensity-dependent increases in nonphotochemical quenching were greatest in nitrogen-deficient plants as were the decreases in Fv/Fm ratio. In nitrogen-deficient plants, photochemical quenching decreased with increasing irradiance but remained higher than in <b>controls</b> at high <b>irradiances.</b> Thermal dissipative processes were enhanced as a result of nitrogen deficiency (nonphotochemical quenching was elevated and Fv/Fm was lowered) allowing PSII to remain relatively oxidised even when carbon metabolism was limited via nitrogen limitation...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{beam shaping}} at focus or focal beam shaping is {{essential}} for many applications. The most common approach makes use of the Fourier transforming properties of lenses to generate at their focal planes the desired irradiance patterns, e. g., the flattop. There are two inherent limitations for this approach. First, the shaping quality depends strongly on the dimensionless parameter β. In {{the case of a}} long focal length or small beam sizes giving a small β value, additional beam expanders are needed to achieve a satisfying irradiance pattern at the focus. Second, without considering the phase, the irradiance patterns beyond the focal plane are not controlled. We propose a different approach with two plano-aspheric lenses that allow <b>control</b> of both <b>irradiance</b> and phase at focus. The design method comprises an extended ray mapping procedure combined with backward wave propagation from focus. With this design approach, the shaping quality is guaranteed without the possible need for extra beam expanders, offering the potential for a more compact system with fewer elements. Through the additional phase control, the depth of focus is enlarged to a large extent and the designed system becomes more tolerant. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in availability {{and application of}} various laser sources poses an increasing threat to the human eye. Not only the actual damage dealt to the retina or {{other parts of the}} eye, but also dazzling during critical tasks has to be faced. However, experiments to verify the actual threat due to dazzling are quite critical, as it is almost never possible or even reasonable, to dazzle human observers. Based on this dilemma, we propose to construct a camera that mimics the perception of laser dazzle by the human eye as close as possible. The human eye camera consists of hardware and a software component, which perform the several tasks of the eye. The hardware controls the eye-movement (saccadic viewing), the adaption of the iris (<b>irradiance</b> <b>control)</b> and the projection of the image onto a sensor.

This paper reports on the competitive light environment of a commercially valuable multi-species regrowth forest in NW Tasmania, in order to define some of the functional interactions and competitive dynamics of these stands. Comparative observations were made of the internal forest light environment in response to small-gap silvicultural treatments, in a young regenerative mix of three codominant tree species. Light measurements were made during periods of maximum external irradiance of the regrowth Eucalyptus obliqua / Acacia melanoxylon forest canopy at age 10. 5 years. This was at a time of vigourous stand development, 4. 5 years following the application of three experimental silvicultural treatments whose effects were observed in comparison with an untreated canopy sample designed as a <b>control.</b> Minimal <b>irradiance</b> was observed within and beneath the dense subcanopy of the native nurse species (Pomaderris apetala) which closely surrounds young blackwood regeneration. Unlike current plantation nurse systems, the dense foliage of the native broadleaved Pomaderris all but eliminated direct side-light and low-angle illumination of the young blackwood, from the beginning of tree establishment. The results demonstrated that retention of these densely stocked native codominants effectively suppressed both size and frequency of blackwood branches on the lower bole, through effective and persistent interception of sunlight. Vigorous young blackwood crowns later overtopped the codominant nurse species, achieving a predictable height of branch-free bole. This competitive outcome offers {{a valuable}} tool for management of blackwood crown dynamics, stem form and branch habit through manipulation of light environment in young native regrowth systems.

40|$|A {{histological}} {{investigation of}} the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation upon the skin of four species of teleost fish was conducted in an attempt to define the sequential pathogenesis of the UV induced lesion. The species used in the experiments, namely plaice Pleuronectes platessa L., turbot Scophthalmus znax. zmus (L.), rainbow trout, Sairno gairdneri Richardson and Atlantic salmon, Salrno salar L. represent species reared commercially and thus likely, in the artificial environment of a fish farm, to receive levels of solar radiation in excess of those encountered in nature. It was found that plaice were the most susceptible species to UV radiation whilst turbot were marginally less so. Rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon showed similar levels of susceptibility when compared with each other but, in addition, had significantly higher tolerance thresholds than either plaice or turbot. Whilst the use of artificial radiation sources allows for more accurate <b>control</b> over <b>irradiance</b> than would natural sunlight, the need to recognise the limitations of such sources has been emphasised. In addition the importance of incorporating filters to remove the shorter wavelengths which would not be encountered at the earth's surface has been demonstrated. The photoreactive capability/capability of fish skin to repair cell damage initiated by UV radiation has been shown by the use of variable light input in the visible spectrum. The use of scanning electron microscopy to examine the surface topography of the radiation lesion confirmed the observations made by light microscopy and demonstrated the vulnerability of the damaged skin surface to the invasion of opportunistic bacteria. The importance of recognising sunlight as an environmental factor in the initiation of dorsal skin damage is no longer in doubt; experimental evidence and clinical observations on high altitude fish farms confirm this. Consideration is also given to the implications of prolonged exposure to sunlight upon fish following transfer and handling. The possible role of sunlight in the aetiology of certain bacterial skin diseases in farmed and wild fish and in dorsal skin neoplasms in wild fish is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Snowmelt in {{mountains}} is {{an important}} part of the water and energy cycles and provides water for 1 / 6 th of the world's population. The downwelling irradiances are the primary drivers of this melt, however, they are rarely observed. The use of estimated irradiances, few observations, lack of evaluation of alternative sources of data, and the unique climate of mountain environments all lead to substantial uncertainties in the radiative fluxes used to force simulations of snow. The net irradiance of snow is determined by external forcing irradiances, the downwelling irradiances, and by the upwelling irradiances, which are functions of the internal model feedbacks. Errors in the forcing irradiances can be masked by errors in the internal processes that <b>control</b> the outgoing <b>irradiances.</b> The impact of uncertainties in the forcing irradiances for simulations of snow is evaluated in a series of idealized modeling experiment that split into two parts: 1) understanding errors in the forcing irradiances alone and 2) understanding the feedback and compensation between errors in the forcing irradiances and the internal processes that <b>control</b> the outgoing <b>irradiances.</b> In the forcing irradiances, it is shown that longwave biases of magnitude greater than 20 Wm- 2 and shortwave biases of magnitude greater than 40 Wm- 2, typical of methods for estimating irradiances in complex terrain, have substantial impacts on simulated snow water equivalent (SWE) and the simulated energy balance across a range of mountain climates. Random noise in the forcing irradiances has a negligible effect on modeled snowmelt and energy balance. The exception is warmer sites, which were found to be sensitive to nearly all errors in the forcing irradiances. The internal processes that control the outgoing fluxes can significantly impact the net irradiance of the snow. Two processes are explored: 1) albedo parameterization that controls the reflected shortwave irradiance and 2) the turbulence parameterization that controls the outgoing longwave irradiance through the surface temperature. Tuning of albedo parameters, an approach typically taken in modeling set-ups, can completely compensate for biases in the forcing irradiances when evaluating model performance using SWE. Varying turbulent flux parameters was found to have a much smaller impact on simulated snowmelt than albedo parameters - calling the role of the stability feedback into question. However, the surface temperature does depend strongly on the turbulence scheme selected. Finally, the application of these results is shown for a variety of mountain environments and methods. In general, the uncertainty in the albedo terms is larger than the uncertainty in the forcing irradiance terms. The structure of errors in the forcing irradiances is either uniform offsets that do not vary substantially throughout the year or shorter punctuated periods where the irradiance values are substantially different...|$|R
40|$|Principles {{of fluid}} mechanics, gas–liquid mass transfer, and <b>irradiance</b> <b>controlled</b> algal growth are {{integrated}} into a method for designing tubular photobioreactors in which the culture is circulated by an airlift pump. A 0. 2 m 3 photobioreactor designed using the proposed approach was proved in continuous outdoor culture of the microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The culture performance was assessed under various conditions of irradiance, dilution rates and liquid velocities through the tubular solar collector. A biomass productivity of 1. 90 g l− 1 d− 1 (or 32 g m− 2 d− 1) could be obtained at a dilution rate of 0. 04 h− 1. Photoinhibition was observed during hours of peak irradiance; the photosynthetic activity of the cells recovered a few hours later. Linear liquid velocities of 0. 50 and 0. 35 m s− 1 in the solar collector gave similar biomass productivities, but the culture collapsed at lower velocities. The effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on productivity was quantified in indoor conditions; dissolved oxygen levels higher or lower than air saturation values reduced productivity. Under outdoor conditions, for given levels of oxygen supersaturation, the productivity decline was greater outdoors than indoors, suggesting that under intense outdoor illumination photooxidation contributed to loss of productivity in comparison with productivity loss due to oxygen inhibition alone. Dissolved oxygen values at the outlet of solar collector tube were up to 400 % of air saturation...|$|R

Modeling {{studies have}} predicted that climate change will have a strong impact on the suitability of current cultivation areas, but these studies have not anticipated possible mitigating effects of the elevated atmospheric [CO 2] because no information exists for the coffee plant. Potted plants from two genotypes of Coffea arabica and one of C. canephora were grown under <b>controlled</b> conditions of <b>irradiance</b> (800 μmol m- 2 s- 1), RH (75 %) and 380 or 700 μL CO 2 L- 1 for 1 year, without water, nutrient or root development restrictions. In all genotypes, the high [CO 2] treatment promoted opposite trends for stomatal density and size, which decreased and increased, respectively. Regardless of the genotype or the growth [CO 2], the net rate of CO 2 assimilation increased (34 - 49 %) when measured at 700 than at 380 μL CO 2 L- 1. This result, together with the almost unchanged stomatal conductance, led to an instantaneous water use efficiency increase. The results also showed a reinforcement of photosynthetic (and respiratory) components, namely thylakoid electron transport and the activities of RuBisCo, ribulose 5 -phosphate kinase, malate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, what {{may have contributed to the}} enhancements in the maximum rates of electron transport, carboxylation and photosynthetic capacity unde...|$|R
40|$|Launching or resupplying food, oxygen, {{and water}} into space for long-duration, crewed {{missions}} to distant destinations, such as Mars, is currently impossible. Bioregenerative life-support systems under development worldwide involving photoautotrophic organisms offer {{a solution to}} the food dilemma. However, using traditional Earth-based lighting methods, growth of food crops consumes copious energy, and since sunlight will not always be available at different space destinations, efficient electric lighting solutions are badly needed to reduce the Equivalent System Mass (ESM) of life-support infrastructure to be launched and transported to future space destinations with sustainable human habitats. The scope {{of the present study was}} to demonstrate that using LEDs coupled to plant detection, and optimizing spectral and irradiance parameters of LED light, the model crop lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Waldmann 2 ̆ 7 s Green) can be grown with significantly lower electrical energy for plant lighting than using traditional lighting sources. Initial experiments aimed at adapting and troubleshooting a first-generation 2 ̆ 2 smart 2 ̆ 2 plant-detection system coupled to LED arrays resulted in optimizing the detection process for plant position and size to the limits of its current design. Lettuce crops were grown hydroponically in a growth chamber, where temperature, relative humidity, and CO 2 level are <b>controlled.</b> Optimal <b>irradiance</b> and red/blue ratio of LED lighting were determined for plant growth during both lag and exponential phases of crop growth. Under optimizing conditions, the efficiency of the automatic detection system was integrated with LED switching and compared to a system in which all LEDs were energized throughout a crop-production cycle. At the end of each cropping cycle, plant fresh and dry weights and leaf area were measured and correlated with the amount of electrical energy (kWh) consumed. Preliminary results indicated that lettuce plants grown under optimizing conditions with red and blue LED lighting required 12 times less energy than with a traditional high-intensity discharge lighting system. This study paves the way for refinement of the smart lighting system and further, major reductions in ESM for space life-support systems and for ground-based controlled-environment agriculture.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 The Department of Energy {{reports that}} {{buildings}} consume more than 40 % of primary {{energy in the}} U. S. and that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, windows constitute a major path for energy losses from buildings and therefore also present a significant opportunity for efficiency improvement and waste reduction. With this in mind, the work in this dissertation is focused on improving the control of solar and thermal radiation through windows. These radiation spectra can be controlled independently because they peak at different wavelengths due to the much higher temperature (5500 °C) of the Sun compared to objects on Earth (25 °C). In this work, a thermochromic material is utilized to <b>control</b> solar <b>irradiance</b> and a low-emissive (low-E) material is used to control thermal radiation. Thermochromic materials possess optical properties that change in response to temperature and low-E coatings are reflective in the mid-infrared (thermal) region. VO 2 is an exciting candidate for thermochromic coatings because its transmittance in the visible region is relatively constant, but its reflectance in the IR increases significantly with temperature. The main technical issues limiting VO 2 are luminous transmittance (Tlum) that is too low and a transition temperature (τc) that is too high. For the low-E coating, (SnO 2) x(In 2 O 3) 1 -x (ITO glass) was chosen because it has both high luminous transmittance and low emissivity. In this dissertation it is shown that τc of VO 2 can be lowered from 50 to 45 °C by reducing the grain size of the film from 70 to 31 nm. In the area of luminous transmittance, TiO 2 is investigated as an anti-reflective coating {{which can be used}} to increase Tlum. Later in this work, it is demonstrated that the energy efficiency gained through VO 2 can be further improved by combining it with a low-E coating. The multilayer design combines anti-reflection in the visible region, thermochromism the near-IR and low emissivity in the mid-IR for an outstanding energy-efficient coating across the solar and thermal spectra. This dissertation contributes knowledge that helps reduce the barriers which currently limit thermochromic materials from being utilized for energy efficiency in built environments...|$|R
40|$|For the {{evaluation}} of radiative transfer models and for investigations {{on the influence of}} parameters like aerosols or clouds on ground level UV irradiance, a combination of spectral measurements and model calculations is required. We show an efficient method for such a combination and present a systematic comparison of the freely available UVSPEC radiative transfer model package with two years of spectrally resolved measurements made at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany (47. 48 deg N, 11. 07 deg E, 730 m above sea level) for cloudless sky and low albedo. More than 1200 spectra have been used for the comparison, covering a wide range of ozone and aerosol conditions. Applying the PSEUDO-SPHERICAL model type, a discrete ordinate model with correction for the sphericity of the Earth, the systematic differences between measurement and model were found to range between - 11 and + 2 per cent for wavelengths between 295 and 400 nm and solar zenith angles up to 80 degree. The small observed statisti cal differences of 2 - 3 per cent can mostly be explained by the random error of the measurement system. Only two input parameters, total ozone column and aerosol optical depth, the latter parameterized by the Angström formula, are required to reach this level of agreement. It was further found that knowledge of the aerosol optical depth is essential for obtaining such a good agreement. The evaluated UVSPEC model package, together with the presented interface SDMODEL, provides an efficient tool for the investigation of the processes that <b>control</b> surface UV <b>irradiance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Laser {{beam shaping}} at focus, or Focal Beam Shaping (FBS), is {{required}} in many laser applications. The difficulty of focal beam shaping is measured by a dimensionless parameter β, which depends on the radii of the input and output irradiance patterns, the wavelength λ and the focal length f. With available design approaches, larger β gives better design results. However there are certain applications requiring small β which {{is not possible to}} achieve yet. This work provides a solution to design a rotationally symmetric plano-apsheric lens pair to shape the laser beam at focus with β smaller than any reported limit. Firstly the required irradiance pattern at the focal plane is propagated backwards to the output plane directly after the second lens using a rigorous free space wave propagation method in the unified optical modeling software “VirtulLab”. The design task is now to design two aspherical refractive surfaces to map the collimated laser beam at the input plane to the obtained optical filed at the output plane. Geometric ray mapping technique is developed to design the two lenses to <b>control</b> both the <b>irradiance</b> and the phase of the laser beam. Finally the complete simulation from the input plane through the designed lenses to the focal plane is performed in VirtulLab to evaluate and to analyze the design. The design versatility is verified by different design examples, including the simple flattop profile (e. g. the Fermi-Dirac profile) and some complex profiles (e. g. the doughnut profile). Also tolerance analysis shows similar performance as for the design obtained from the conventional design approach. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We used microsensors {{to study}} the {{regulation}} of anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis (AP and OP, respectively) by light and sulfide in a cyanobacterium dominating microbial mats from cold sulfidic springs. Both photosynthetic modes were performed simultaneously over all H 2 S concentrations (1 – 2200 μM) and irradiances (4 – 52 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1) tested. AP increased with H 2 S concentration while the sum of oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthetic rates was constant at each light intensity. Thus, the total photosynthetically driven electron transport rate was solely <b>controlled</b> by the <b>irradiance</b> level. The partitioning between the rates of these two photosynthetic modes was regulated by both light and H 2 S concentration. The plastoquinone pool (PQ) receives electrons from sulfide:quinone:reductase (SQR) in AP and from photosystem II (PSII) in OP. It is thus the link in the electron transport chain where both pathways intersect, and the compound that controls their partitioning. We fitted our data with {{a model of the}} photosynthetic electron transport that includes the kinetics of plastoquinone reduction and oxidation. The model results confirmed that the observed partitioning between photosynthetic modes can be explained by a simple kinetic control based on the affinity of SQR and PSII toward PQ. The SQR enzyme and PSII have similar affinities toward PQ, which explains the concurrent OP and AP over an astonishingly wide range of H 2 S concentrations and irradiances. The elegant kinetic control of activity makes the cyanobacterium successful in the fluctuating spring environment. We discuss how these specific regulation mechanisms may {{have played a role in}} ancient H 2 S-rich oceans...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{phytochrome}} B 2 (phyB 2) in {{the control}} of photomorphogenesis in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) has been investigated using recently isolated mutants carrying lesions in the PHYB 2 gene. The physiological interactions of phytochrome A (phyA), phytochrome B 1 (phyB 1) and phyB 2 have also been explored, using an isogenic series of all possible mutant combinations and several different phenotypic characteristics. The loss of phyB 2 had a negligible effect {{on the development of}} white-light-grown wild-type or phyA-deficient plants, but substantially enhanced the elongated pale phenotype of the phyB 1 mutant. This redundancy was also seen {{in the control}} of de-etiolation under continuous red light (R), where the loss of phyB 2 had no detectable effect in the presence of phyB 1. Under continuous R, phyA action was largely independent of phyB 1 and phyB 2 in terms of the control of hypocotyl elongation, but antagonized the effects of phyB 1 in the control of anthocyanin synthesis, indicating that photoreceptors may interact differently to <b>control</b> different traits. <b>Irradiance</b> response curves for anthocyanin synthesis revealed that phyB 1 and phyB 2 together mediate all the detectable response to high-irradiance R, and, surprisingly, that the phyA-dependent low-irradiance component is also strongly reduced in the phyB 1 phyB 2 double mutant. This is not associated with a reduction in phyA protein content or responsiveness to continuous far-red light (FR), suggesting that phyB 1 and phyB 2 specifically influence phyA activity under low-irradiance R. Finally, the phyA phyB 1 phyB 2 triple mutant showed strong residual responsiveness to supplementary daytime FR, indicating {{that at least one of}} the two remaining phytochromes plays a significant role in tomato photomorphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Performance of {{adaptive}} optics (AO) compensation for beam control is quantified via wave-optical propagation, sensing, and control methods using wind tunnel measurements 1 of aero-optical disturbances {{in addition to}} Kolmogorov turbulence distributed over a laser path. For Kolmogorov turbulence the residual phase variance scales as (fG/f 3 dB) 5 / 3, where fG is the Greenwood frequency for the propagation path 2 and f 3 dB is the error-rejection bandwidth of the classical AO control. It is shown that the residual phase variance with classical AO control, when normalized to the open-loop, scales as (fA/f 3 dB) γ, where γ is an arbitrary power and fA is a characteristic frequency of the aero-optical disturbance deter-mined from a linear fit of the compensation data with increasing bandwidth. AO system latency degrades performance, especially with high-bandwidth control. When operating at a fixed but modest sampling frequency with appreciable latency, AO compensation perfor-mance can be significantly enhanced by application of an adaptive control augmentation based on lattice filtering of the residual wavefront sensor gradients, as was implemented in the wave-optics simulations. A classical controller operating at 200 Hz bandwidth with> 400 µsec latency has a limited ability to compensate the aero-optical and free-stream disturbances.
