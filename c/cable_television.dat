40|$|The new Saiki City {{was born}} when nine {{municipalities}} were merged in March 2005. Saiki {{is a rare}} example as all the nine former municipalities had their own local <b>cable</b> <b>televisions.</b> Nowadays this industry, especially in the rural area, is facing with quite a few difficulties, for example the 2 ̆ 2 extraregional rebroadcasting 2 ̆ 2 issue. Local <b>cable</b> <b>televisions</b> need to enrich their community channel programs to survive. Nine <b>cable</b> <b>televisions</b> before the annexation were independent, making their own programs according to their different management policies.
