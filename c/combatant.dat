40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract According {{to the dominant}} position in the just war tradition from Augustine to Anscombe and beyond, there is no ‘‘moral equality of <b>combatants.</b> ’’ That is, on the traditional view the <b>combatants</b> participating in a justified war may kill their enemy <b>combatants</b> participating in an unjustified war—but not vice versa (barring certain qualifications). I shall argue here, however, that in {{the large number of}} wars (and in practically all modern wars) where the <b>combatants</b> on the justified side violate the rights of innocent people (‘‘collateral damage’’), these <b>combatants</b> are in fact liable to attack by the <b>combatants</b> on the unjustified side. I will support this view with a rights-based account of liability to attack and then defend it against a number of objections raised in particular by Jeff McMahan. The result is that the thesis of the moral equality of <b>combatants</b> holds good for a large range of armed conflicts while the opposing thesis is of very limited practical relevance...|$|R

5|$|In his dissent he {{asserted}} that the courts had no jurisdiction for this case for the reasons described in Scalia's dissent above; that Hamdan is an illegal <b>combatant</b> and therefore not protected by the Geneva convention; that the Geneva convention does not prohibit the special court council proposed; and that the President already had authority {{to set up the}} special court council proposed.|$|E

5|$|The case {{considers}} {{whether the}} United States Congress may pass legislation preventing the Supreme Court from hearing {{the case of}} an accused <b>combatant</b> before his military commission takes place, whether the special military commissions that had been set up violated federal law (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice and treaty obligations), and whether courts can enforce the articles of the 1949 Geneva Convention.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} women served as <b>combatants,</b> but how many is not known. Some women became <b>combatants</b> by first joining the army passing as male, {{speaking}} in deep voices, wearing men’s clothing, and wrapping their breasts tightly to hide them. The most obvious role they had as <b>combatants</b> was to fight against opponents in battles.|$|R
50|$|An {{interstellar}} war {{involves a}} warfare between <b>combatants</b> from different planetary systems. The concept provides a common plot device in science fiction, {{especially in the}} space opera subgenre. In contrast, the term intergalactic war refers to war between <b>combatants</b> from different galaxies; interplanetary war refers to war between <b>combatants</b> from different planets of the same solar system.|$|R
50|$|Similarly {{to clinch}} {{fighting}}, ground fighting {{implies that the}} <b>combatants</b> are at a very close range, usually involving one or both <b>combatants</b> grappling the opponent using various grappling holds. Depending on the positioning of the <b>combatants,</b> the proximity can allow for techniques such as biting, chokeholds, fish-hooking, eye-gouging, joint locks, pressure point techniques, or various strikes.|$|R
5|$|The {{provisions}} of the capitulation agreement stipulated that the Home Army soldiers were to be accorded full <b>combatant</b> status and treated as prisoners of war.

5|$|After {{suffering}} over 4,000 {{casualties in}} ten days, {{the failure of}} the last attack ended the 45th Division's role as the only <b>combatant</b> on the Chinese side. The UN forces had gained strong control over most of the area, with the remaining Chinese defenders trapped in tunnels under the UN positions. Despite the initial setbacks, Deng Hua, acting commander of the PVA, considered the situation a golden opportunity to bleed the US military white. In the strategy meeting held on the evening of October 25, the 15th Corps was ordered to retake the two hills regardless of the cost.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion {{that he would like to}} have been a <b>combatant</b> were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort on the side of the Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to sign up for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E
50|$|The {{improper}} {{use of the}} flag is forbidden {{by the rules of}} war and constitutes a war crime of perfidy.

These include the new Type 45 destroyer and the Royal Navy CVF programme, designed to replace the UK's current aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|Losses for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either <b>combatant.</b> Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka {{are difficult}} to establish.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack. The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy <b>combatant.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} phase ( [...] 18 to 1 November December 2011) of regrouping, 9,705 former <b>combatants</b> had chosen {{integration}} into the NA.

[...] The deal provided three options to former PLA <b>combatants</b> - integration, voluntary retirement and rehabilitation. 9,705 <b>combatants</b> opted for integration, 7,286 chose voluntary discharge, and six <b>combatants</b> registered their names for rehabilitation packages.

Like SEALs, SWCCs must have excellent physical fitness, highly motivated, combat-focused and responsive in high stress situations.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Helmand Province {{incident}} was the manslaughter of an injured Taliban insurgent by Alexander Blackman, which occurred on 15 September 2011. Three Royal Marines, known during their trial as Marines A, B, and C, were anonymously tried by court-martial. On 8 November 2013, Marines B and C were acquitted, but Marine A was initially {{found guilty of}} murder of the Afghan <b>combatant,</b> in contravention of section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. This made him the first British soldier to be convicted of a battlefield murder whilst serving abroad since the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Use of CS in war is {{prohibited}} {{under the terms}} of the Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by most nations in 1993 with all but five other nations signing between 1994 and 1997. The reasoning behind the prohibition is pragmatic: use of CS by one <b>combatant</b> could easily trigger retaliation with much more toxic chemical weapons such as nerve agents. Only four nations have not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and are therefore unhindered by restrictions on the use of CS gas: Angola, Egypt, North Korea and Somalia.|$|E
