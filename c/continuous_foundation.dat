40|$|At low {{frequencies}} waves propagate in a rail as bending, extensional or torsional waves. At higher frequencies, above about 1. 5 kHz, the rail cross-section deforms and many higher order wave types exist. This cross-section deformation {{has to be}} taken into account for an accurate evaluation of the dispersion properties at high frequencies. Simulation results in the literature show that a multiplicity of wave modes is possible within this high-frequency range.

Two numerical methods are applied to obtain the dispersion properties for a railway track model including rail pads as a <b>continuous</b> <b>foundation.</b> These are a conventional finite element (FE) method and a wavenumber finite element (WFE) method, each of which can include the effects of cross-sectional deformation.

In order to validate the simulated results, a field measurement has been performed on an operational railway track. From this experiment, train-induced rail vibrations have been acquired for several running trains travelling over a long section of rail.

40|$|AbstractIn urban areas, {{engineers}} {{often need}} to assess tunnelling-induced displacements of piled structures {{and the resulting}} potential for damage. This paper presents an elastic study of tunnel-pile-structure interaction through Winkler-based Two-Stage Analysis Methods (TSAMs), focusing on structural displacements resulting from tunnel excavation beneath piled frames or simple equivalent beams. Comparison of results with 3 D finite element analyses shows that the simple TSAM models are able to provide a good assessment of tunnelling-induced building displacements. Parametric analyses highlight the role of tunnel-pile interaction and the superstructure (stiffness, configuration, and pile-structure connections) in the global response of the tunnel-soil-building system. In particular, the effect that key parameters have on deflection ratios and horizontal strains are investigated. Results illustrate how piled foundations {{increase the risk of}} structural damage compared to shallow foundations, whereas structural stiffness can reduce building deformations. Flexural deformations are predominately induced by tunnel excavations beneath piles whereas horizontal strains at the ground level are negligible when a <b>continuous</b> <b>foundation</b> is included. Furthermore, it is illustrated that results based on buildings modelled as equivalent beams can differ considerably compared to when they are modelled as framed structures. Simple design charts are provided to estimate horizontal strains and deflection ratio modification factors based on newly defined relative axial and bending stiffness parameters which account for the presence of the piles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract During the {{excavations}} for {{the foundations}} of a three storey building on the limestone tuffs of Condeixa, Central Portugal, a large dissolution fissure and smaller dissolution voids were found. Since the area {{has never been the}} subject of engineering geology investigation, it was decided to evaluate the risk associated with the construction of the building. These limestone tuffs were formed in a continental environment by the precipitation of calcite carried by the water coming from the large limestone body in the east. The precipitated calcite mixed with the terrigenous materials and around trunks and leaves of plants, originating a very heterogeneous and porous ground, which is characteristic of limestone tuffs. The study started with a detailed geological survey followed by a large number of destructive drillings, located essentially under the pad foundations. The results revealed several karstic cavities with serious problems for the building foundations and the structure, and many smaller dissolution cavities, often filled with clayey soils. The ground treatment solutions used included, dental cleaning, filling with concrete or granular material the dissolution structures accessible {{at the level of the}} foundation, reinforcement of the footing and the structure of the building and adding a <b>continuous</b> <b>foundation</b> beam to hold the foundations together. The cost of the engineering geology study, site investigation, ground treatment, and the reinforcement of the foundation and building, increased the total construction cost from 2 %, at the design stage, to 4. 8 %.
