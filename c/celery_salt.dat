The dish is normally prepared [...] "family style" [...] with over five pounds of snails mixed in with other ingredients commonly found in seafood dishes. Grinders are submarine sandwiches, with a popular version being the Italian grinder, which is made with cold cuts (usually ham, prosciutto, capicola, salami, and Provolone cheese). Linguiça or chouriço (a spicy Portuguese sausage) and peppers is also popular among the state's large Portuguese community, eaten with hearty bread (though this is also popular in other areas of New England).|$|E

50|$|Possibly {{the least}} known, but vitally important, {{industry}} in Ancoats was {{the manufacture of}} flint glass. More than 25 glassworks {{have been identified in}} Manchester, all built during the 19th century, and many of these were in Ancoats. Thomas Percival and William Yates established one of these on Union Street (now Redhill Street) in 1844. The works was equipped with two furnaces (later three), an annealing house, workshops, a warehouse and offices. In 1852, Thomas Vickers joined the company and William Yates left in 1862. After this, the company became known as Percival Vickers British and Foreign Flint Glass Works. It made a large range of glassware that included tumblers, wine glasses, decanters, vases, <b>celery</b> vases, <b>salts</b> and cake stands. One of the buildings in Ancoats, the Flint Glass Works, still exists today and has been converted into serviced offices.|$|R
25|$|In 1919, {{following}} {{the disruption of}} British Marmite imports after World WarI and prior {{to the introduction of}} Vegemite, Callister's employer, the Australian company Fred Walker & Co., gave him the task of developing a spread from the used yeast being dumped by breweries. Callister had been hired by the chairman Fred Walker. Vegemite was registered as a trademark in Australia that same year. Callister used autolysis to break down the yeast cells from waste obtained from the Carlton & United brewery. Concentrating the clear liquid extract and blending with <b>salt,</b> <b>celery</b> and onion extracts formed a sticky black paste.|$|R

40|$|In celery (Apium graveolens L.), long-distance {{transport}} of reduced carbon occurs {{both in the}} form of sucrose (Suc) and mannitol. The presence of mannitol has been related to the resistance of <b>celery</b> to <b>salt</b> stress. To investigate the transport events occurring during salt stress, we have cloned the H+/Suc transporter of celery AgSUT 1 (A. graveolens Suc uptake transport 1) from a mature leaf cDNA library. The function of the encoded protein was confirmed by expression in yeast. AgSUT 1 is a H+/Suc transporter with a high affinity for Suc (Km of 139 μm). Another closely related cDNA (AgSUT 2) was also identified. AgSUT 1 is mainly expressed in mature leaves and phloem of petioles, but also in sink organs such as roots. When celery plants were subjected to salt stress conditions (30 d watering with 300 mm NaCl) favoring mannitol accumulation (J. D. Everard, R. Gucci, S. C. Kann, J. A. Flore, W. H. Loescher [1994] Plant Physiol 106 : 281 – 292), AgSUT 1 expression was decreased in all organs, but markedly in roots. The results are discussed in relation to the physiology of celery...|$|R
