25|$|It {{is caused}} by the {{breathing}} in and retention of asbestos fibers. It usually occurs after high intensity and/or long-term exposure to asbestos (particularly in those individuals working on the production or end-use of products <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos)</b> and is therefore regarded as an occupational lung disease. People with extensive occupational exposure to the mining, manufacturing, handling, or removal of asbestos are at risk of developing asbestosis.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the ship's destination, Gopal Krishna, an environmentalist and an anti-asbestos activist, filed an application before the Supreme Court of India {{to ensure that the}} ship, reportedly <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos,</b> complied with the Court's 14 October 2003 order which sought prior decontamination of ships in the country of export before they could be allowed entry into Indian waters. On 17 May 2006, Kalraj Mishra expressed his concern to the Indian Parliament over possible hazards the Blue Lady presented, and requested that the government put a halt to the ship's entry. As the Indian Supreme Court had lifted any ban on the ship's entry, the Blue Lady was anchored 100km off the Indian coast in mid-July, coming from Fujairah, UAE.|$|E
25|$|Greater than 80% of {{mesothelioma}} {{cases are}} caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people {{have been exposed to}} asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Asbestos exposure and the onset of cancer are generally separated by about 40 years. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer.|$|E
25|$|Although not all {{vermiculite}} <b>contains</b> <b>asbestos,</b> {{some products}} {{were made with}} vermiculite that <b>contained</b> <b>asbestos</b> until the early 1990s. Vermiculite mines throughout the world are now regularly tested for it and are supposed to sell products that <b>contain</b> no <b>asbestos.</b> The former vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana, did have tremolite asbestos as well as winchite and richterite (both fibrous amphiboles) — in fact, it was formed underground through essentially the same geologic processes as the contaminants.|$|R
25|$|Pure {{vermiculite}} {{does not}} <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos</b> and is non-toxic. Impure vermiculite may <b>contain,</b> apart from <b>asbestos,</b> also minor diopside or {{remnants of the}} precursor minerals biotite or phlogopite.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exceptions}} {{of the last}} few carriages built, all Harris trains <b>contained</b> <b>asbestos</b> insulation. The first sets <b>contained</b> blue <b>asbestos,</b> and the later sets <b>contained</b> white <b>asbestos.</b> Due to the presence of asbestos, most were disposed of in the 1990s, by being buried in an old quarry in Clayton, a south-eastern suburb of Melbourne, some having been wrapped in plastic.|$|R

[...] In 1978, however, Leeds City Council informed T that the factory was still [...] "badly contaminated" [...] with asbestos, with dust found in the basement, lift shaft, roof, ventilation shafts and beneath the floors. Hessian sacks <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibre were still present, and the yard was filled with 'a few hundred tonnes' of blue asbestos waste mixed with soil. R.D. Lunt, T's Safety and Environment manager, wrote of the factory basement: [...] "Every nook and cranny has asbestos fibre in it". T contributed £15,000 towards the clean-up of the factory, and claimed they were doing so out of [...] "a moral, not a legal responsibility" [...] to do so. The surrounding houses and buildings {{were not included in}} this operation, and Leeds City Council and T [...] "agreed to keep the whole matter 'low-key' if approached by the media," [...] while a T internal memo stated [...] "The Principal Inspector of Factories and the Assistant Director of Environmental Health are anxious to play this down and have given us considerable support." ...|$|E

50|$|Many {{building}} {{materials used in}} both public and domestic premises prior to the banning of <b>asbestos</b> may <b>contain</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Those performing renovation works or DIY activities may expose themselves to asbestos dust.

50|$|Friability of {{a product}} <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> means {{that it is so}} soft and weak in {{structure}} that it can be broken with simple finger crushing pressure.

50|$|Until the mid-1980s, the Artex coating {{was made}} with white {{asbestos}} to strengthen it.

50|$|Despite {{the mining}} {{and use of}} {{asbestos}} reaching the country’s Supreme Court, Brazil is the world’s third-largest producer and exporter of chrysotile asbestos.

5000|$|Goor (Dutch for: low, swampy land) {{achieved}} city {{rights in}} 1263. An important city, however, it never became. The [...] "Drost" [...] ( [...] {{a kind of}} mayor) of the Twente region, who ruled this area in behalf of the bishop of Utrecht, had in the late Middle Ages his residence in Goor. In its surroundings some castles were built, among them {{the house of the}} important Heeckeren family in 1412. Goor had a small harbour along the river Regge ( [...] which flows to the Vecht near Ommen), but when the Twente canal was opened in 1936, a new industrial port was built there. The factory Eternit, that produces building materials <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos,</b> brought Goor unwillingly into trouble. For decades, everyone in Goor was permitted to use production refuse <b>containing</b> <b>asbestos</b> in order to pave their own paths and roads. Not earlier than about 1990, it was known in Goor that especially small particles of this material can cause cancer. In major parts of the city the soil has to be removed and either cleaned or replaced by non-polluted material.|$|E
