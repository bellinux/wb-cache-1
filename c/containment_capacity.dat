40|$|International audienceIndustrial {{companies}} and public waste management agencies envision clay-rich materials as efficient barriers for large-scale confinement of nuclear waste and subsurface CO 2. In clays, small pores hinder water flow and make diffusion the dominant solute-transport mechanism. Most clay mineral structures exhibit a negative charge that is balanced by an electrical double layer at the mineral water interface. This clay mineral property delays cation migration through adsorption processes, decreases the accessible porosity and diffusion fluxes for anions {{compared to those}} of water and cations, and gives rise to semipermeable membrane properties. Here we present experimental data that demonstrate {{for the first time}} that anions can be completely excluded from the smallest pores within a compacted illitic clay material, an observation that has important implications for the ability to accurately predict the <b>containment</b> <b>capacity</b> of clay-based barriers. In a series of multitracer diffusion experiments, celestite (SrSO 4) precipitation reduced the porosity of compacted illite to the point where the water tracer diffusion flux decreased by half, while the chloride diffusion flux decreased to zero.

40|$|Release of {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse gas}} emissions to the atmosphere is a concern for global warming. Thus, practical and economic solutions are being sought to combat this problem. One possible methodology for reducing emissions is the geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO₂). The subsurface behaviour of CO₂is influenced by many variables; therefore, accurate appraisal of a potential CO₂storage site requires detailed site characterisation. In particular, potential sites need to be evaluated geologically {{in terms of their}} injectivity, <b>containment</b> and <b>capacity.</b> Detailed site characterisation was undertaken for two possible sites for geological storage of CO₂, located offshore northwest Australia in the Petrel and Barrow sub-basins. The injection targets in the Petrel Sub-basin are the Jurassic Plover and Elang formations, locally sealed by the Frigate Formation, and the overlying Cretaceous Sandpiper Sandstone, regionally sealed by the Bathurst Island Group. The Plover/Elang formations are laterally extensive, fluvio–deltaic sandstones of fair to good reservoir quality, with likely excellent lateral and vertical connectivity. The Frigate Formation may not be an effective seal up-dip, but the overlying secondary reservoir (Sandpiper Sandstone) and thick regional seal (Bathurst Island Group) will ensure continued CO₂containment. The Jurassic–Cretaceous post-rift sediments are structurally simple and dip gently up towards the basin margins with no defined structural closures. Therefore, hydrodynamic, residual and solubility trapping beneath the regional seal will be the dominant storage mechanisms. The potential storage capacity is vast (> 10, 000 Mt), highlighting why deep saline formations may provide a realistic solution to large-scale {{greenhouse gas emissions}} reduction. In the Barrow Sub-basin, the Cretaceous Flag Sandstone is the injection target, sealed by the Muderong Shale. The reservoir units are laterally extensive, amalgamated, basin floor fan sandstones with excellent reservoir quality. Hemipelagic shale drapes may locally restrict the vertical connectivity. The Muderong Shale has excellent seal capacity, with the potential to withhold a CO₂ column height of 565 – 790 m. The structural geometry is a large anticline and the trapping mechanisms are likely to a combination of stratigraphic, residual and solubility trapping along the axis of the anticline, as well as structural trapping within the anticlinal closure. A few large faults exist which could potentially be reactivated if injection pressures are not appropriately managed. The hydrodynamic flow has been altered by production induced pressure decline; however, the impact on the CO₂ migration pathway is likely to be insignificant due to the stronger buoyancy drive. The detailed geological characterisation process identified that both sites are suitable candidates for geological storage of CO₂. Geological storage of CO₂is technically feasible in a variety of different geological settings, as demonstrated by studies like these and CO₂storage projects already in operation. Key to the success of a CO₂storage project is an understanding of the stratigraphic architecture and reservoir heterogeneity. This will allow an optimal injection strategy to be devised to utilise the inherent geological characteristics of the site and maximise the benefits of injectivity, <b>capacity</b> and <b>containment</b> for efficient geological storage of CO₂.

40|$|Roadside {{adjustment}} has {{a remarkable}} effect on road safety. An effective strategy for roadside safety improvement may {{be based on}} safety audits, both of detailed design and of existing roads. Accident data analyses do not always allow to locate the roadside safety problems because usually roadside defects have limited extension and may not have influenced in meaningful way the accident rates. However, a roadside punctual analysis aimed at identifying the accident potential and safety performance may be an effective approach with low costs and great benefits. A roadside safety audit of some Italian highways has underlined a lot of safety problems which, in most cases, are of repetitive nature and may be eliminated or mitigated with low cost measures. Main roadside safety problems have been classified and detailed checklists have been developed. The main dangerous factors singled out relate to the safety barriers structural adequacy (low <b>containment</b> <b>capacity</b> in sites with high dangers, behavior excessively rigid towards the passenger cars), to the safety barriers functional adequacy (inadequate longitudinal extension for the complete protection of the obstacles, inadequate distance from the protected obstacles, installation conditions not suitable, etc.), to the safety barriers transitions and terminals, other than {{to the presence of}} unprotected obstacles inside the clear zone...|$|E

The results of the screening and ranking procedure indicate that the Khmer Basin is the most suitable basin, followed by the Kampong Saom and Tonle Sap basins. A quantitative volumetric assessment-based evaluation of CO 2 storage capacity is performed on these three suitable basins. The evaluation yields a range in the national CO 2 storage capacity of 90 Mt (in structural traps) to 45 Gt (in hydrodynamic traps), representing low- and high-case estimates, respectively. The saline aquifers associated with this storage capacity should be considered prospective storage options as hydrodynamic traps because of containment and capacity issues associated with the structural traps. Eight major point sources of CO 2 are identified that have a combined output (estimated for 2008 – 2024) of 43. 1 Mt annually and 82 billion m 3 in place, and the potentially-prospective matched storage capacity is assumed.

In {{the most common}} benefit-cost analysis aimed at evaluating roadside safety alternatives and in the most common road safety barriers selection procedures, the barrier’s performance limit is assumed as the maximum Impact Severity of the crash tests successfully performed, that is the vehicle’s kinetic energy evaluated by the lateral component of velocity. In this paper the effectiveness of IS has been assessed. At this aim {{a great number of}} collisions of an Heavy Goods Vehicle against a steel road safety barrier were simulated through a non-linear dynamic finite element analysis, each one characterized by the same value of kinetic transverse energy and different values of the parameters that define IS: vehicle’s speed, mass and impact angle. The results obtained show that the collision outcomes noticeably change with these parameters: the smaller the impact angle and mass the greater the barrier’s displacements and vehicle’s rollover risk. Due to this influence the Limit Impact Severity of safety barriers considerably changes with the impact conditions. To address this problem, at least for the barrier and the vehicle considered in the study, an analysis aimed at evaluating the relationships between Limit Impact Severity and vehicle’s impact angle and mass has been carried out.

The outcome for each vehicle that collides with a feature will be different, depending greatly not only on its mass, velocity, and impact angle {{but also on the}} position of its center of mass and on the tire-pavement friction. The ways in which barrier and striking vehicle behaviors are affected by changes in the position of the center of mass and in the tire-pavement side friction were analyzed to identify the most dangerous loading systems. Toward this aim numerous simulations of a collision of a truck against a steel road safety barrier were carried out through nonlinear, dynamic finite-element analysis. The results obtained demonstrate that the position of the center of mass is of greater consequence in collisions in which the impact energy is close to the maximum barrier <b>containment</b> <b>capacity</b> and under conditions that favor friction. The longitudinal position of the center of mass has a large impact on the risk that the vehicle will pass over the barrier or roll over. If it is in the back, the most common loading system, the risk of passing over the barrier is rather limited compared with the risk of rolling over. As the position of the center of mass is pushed forward, the risk of rolling over is reduced but the risk of passing over the barrier increases.

40|$|Longitudinal safety {{barriers}} are tested {{in order to}} assess the {{safety barriers}} <b>containment</b> <b>capacity</b> and the vehicle occupant impact severity. In the EN standards, the occupant impact severity is evaluated with the same test (TB 11) for all the classes of barrier: a 900 kg car colliding with impact speed equal to 100 Km/h and impact angle equal to 20 °. Considering that real world impact conditions may be substantially different, at least two questions arise: 1. 	Which is the distribution of passenger cars kinetic impact energy for different type of roads and which is the relative position of the conventional test? 2. 	Are the values of Acceleration Severity Index (ASI), Theoretical Head Impact Velocity (THIV) and Post-impact Head Deceleration (PHD) obtained in the conventional test TB 11 representative for real world impact conditions? The “correct” answer to these questions requires a very expensive research program. This because a huge number of accident reports has to be collected and each accident event has to be reconstructed, furthermore many computer crash simulations have to be performed. In order to get a “preliminary” problem assessment, a study has been carried out performing an accident analysis and many crash simulation in different impacting conditions. The accident analysis has been carried out by the examination of 160 police run off the road accident reports on a rural dual carriageway road, integrated with the inspection of accident sites. Many accident parameters have been evaluated and distribution probabilities of impact velocity, impact angle and vehicle mass have been drawn. The real world impact conditions obtained have been used as input for the crash simulation of a passenger car against a longitudinal safety barrier. Impact simulations have been carried out by non-linear dynamic finite element analysis performed with the software LS-Dyna. The finite element model used for the vehicle is the result of an extensive modeling activity and is very capable to represent the crash dynamics and consequences. Collision outcomes in terms of THIV, PHD and ASI have been evaluated for each impact condition and, by combining the impact condition distributions with these results, the distributions of the impact severity indices have been assessed. The study carried out show that the probability of outcomes greater than the ones of the TB 11 are equal to 26 % for ASI, and 34 % for THIV and PHD. According to the results of the study, passenger cars crash test conditions more representative of real world impacts, on motorways and on rural dual carriageway roads, would be: - Impact speed = 130 km/h; - Impact angle = 20 degrees; - Vehicle mass = 1500 kg. Such impact conditions would represent the ninetieth percentile of cars kinetic transversal impact energy. Moreover, with reference to the rigid wall fixed to the ground used in the simulations, they give rise to ASI, THIV and PHD values more severe than eighty-five percent of real world run off the road accidents.

The Callovian–Oxfordian (COx) claystone layer located in the north-eastern Parisian basin is currently investigated as a potential host-rock. As the COx contains minerals that can feed the near-field with soluble elements (e. g. Mg) that can enhance the glass alteration, {{the study of the}} COx/glass interactions is of primary importance to evaluate the <b>containment</b> <b>capacity</b> of the glass over the time period required to the decrease of the radioactive elements. Several studies focused on clay behavior in temperature (Gailhanou et al., 2017), on the glass behavior (Gin et al., 2012) and on integrated system: glass/iron/clay (Schlegel et al., 2016) but no modelling study of the COx/glass interactions in situ at the temperature of the COx formation had already been made. This work aims at studying the glass alteration in presence of the COx in purely diffusive conditions. The studied glass is called SON 68 and is the inactive analogous of the of the French R 7 T 7 HLW glass. The vertical descending borehole is twelve meters deep and contains a two meters high test chamber with a series of three stacked clay blocks. Those blocks were drill in order to be filled with glass powder separated from the COx by sintered stainless steel filters (Linard et al., 2015). The test interval was then closed and saturated with synthetic porewater representative of the host-rock (Gaucher et al., 2009). To reach diffusive conditions, the pressure in the test interval was rose to 40 bars close to the expected pressure of the COx formation. A flow rate equal to 15 mL/minute between the interval and a module located in the drift is maintained. The pH, Eh, electrical conductivity, temperature and mass are measured online and samples can be collected at chosen time. A diffusive transport model based on the model developed by Appelo et al. (2008) was built. The hydrological parameters were implemented according to this work and to the particularity of the test (Linard, 2010). The model considers the COx whose parameters (minerals, exchangers) are based on the model published by Gaucher et al. (2009) and the glass (SON 68). A glass alteration model {{based on the work of}} Frugier et al. (2008) has been implemented in Phreeqc. First the deuterium tracer was modeled with a porewater diffusion coefficient of 8 10 - 10 m 2. s- 1. The porosity of the formation was set to 0. 18. Because of the complexity of the perturbation that occurred during the whole test, every external change influences the test is not yet considered in the modelling. Thus, the current model does not enable to reproduce the higher deuterium and iodine concentrations measured at 546 days (Figure 1. a) but match all the bromide data. Despite the difficulties on the hydrological parameters, the pH reaches a steady state in the modelling once the COx buffered the pH (Figure 1. b). The initial high pH is close to 9 that is the value imposed by the glass dissolution. This gap occurs because the system is closed in the model the first 427 days of reaction. However, it appears that several water entrance from the formation lower the pH in the system toward values usually encountered in the clay (pH 7. 2). The modeled chlorine agrees with the measured one (Figure 1. b). This element is only influenced by the porewater chemistry and is not modified during the test. A difference appears for the sodium that is underestimated and remains at the value of the porewater injected at the beginning of the test. This discrepancy can be attributed to an underestimation of the water coming from the formation that is richer in sodium than the injected water and/or from the glass dissolution that is currently underestimated (Figure 1. b). The first explanation is assumed because the porewater measured in the field varies in function of the samples (Vinsot et al., 2008), so a difference with the injected water can occur. The second hypothesis is linked to the first one as a higher solution renewal will lead to higher glass dissolution and then to higher boron, lithium and sodium release in solution. Furthermore, desaturation process occurring during the drilling and leading to salt precipitation cannot be discarded. Those salt will dissolve during the entrance of the water coming from the formation (Vinsot et al., 2013). It is worth noting that the Si concentration is in equilibrium with cristobalite. Furthermore, modelling tests proved that secondary phases usually considered like hydroxyapatite or sepiolite highly influence the results and cannot be considered at thermodynamic equilibrium otherwise glass dissolution is overestimated. This model is a first step to investigate the interaction between the COx and the glass SON 68. The several perturbations occurring during the test (water entrance, leakages, and thermal variations) have to be considered more accurately because they highly influence the system and then the glass dissolution. Improvements concerning these matters are already under progress...|$|E
