40|$|This is a {{follow-up}} to the recent paper by Lazar Babu et al. [V. L. Lazar Babu, R. Batta, L. Lin, Passenger grouping under constant threat probability in an airport security system, European Journal of Operational Research 168 (2006) 633 - 644] which investigated the benefit of classifying passengers into different groups, {{with the idea that}} the number of checks and the degree of inspection may vary for different groups. A basic assumption in that paper was that the threat probability is constant across all passengers. In this paper, we relax this assumption and consider the case where passenger risk levels are incorporated. We assume that passengers are classified into several risk classes via some passenger prescreening system, for example, Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II (CAPPS II). We consider the separate grouping of every class of passengers such that the overall false alarm probability is minimized while maintaining the overall false clear probability within specifications set by a security authority. Meanwhile, we consider the staffing needs at each <b>check</b> <b>station.</b> The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. An illustrative example of the model is presented with comparisons to the model in Lazar Babu et al. (2006) using two performance measures: probability of false alarm and total number of screeners needed. Our conclusion is that incorporation of risk levels through passenger grouping strategies leads to a more efficient security check system.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a 1 -year small mammal biodiversity {{survey conducted}} on the Oak Ridge National Environmental Research Park (OR Research Park). The task was implemented through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Natural Resources Management Program and included researchers from the ORNL Environmental Sciences Division, interns in the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education Higher Education Research Experiences Program, and ORNL Environmental Protection Services staff. Eight sites were surveyed reservation wide. The survey was conducted {{in an effort to}} determine species abundance and diversity of small mammal populations throughout the reservation and to continue the historical inventory of small mammal presence for biodiversity records. This data collection effort was in support of the approved Wildlife Management Plan for the Oak Ridge Reservation, a major goal of which is to maintain and enhance wildlife biodiversity on the Reservation. Three of the sites (Poplar Creek, McNew Hollow, and Deer <b>Check</b> <b>Station</b> Field) were previously surveyed during a major natural resources inventory conducted in 1996. Five new sites were included in this study: Bearden Creek, Rainy Knob (Natural Area 21), Gum Hollow, White Oak Creek and Melton Branch. The 2009 - 2010 small mammal surveys were conducted from June 2009 to July 2010 on the Oak Ridge National Environmental Research Park (OR Research Park). The survey had two main goals: (1) to determine species abundance and diversity and (2) to update historical records on the OR Research Park. The park is located on the Department of Energy-owned Oak Ridge Reservation, which encompasses 13, 580 ha. The primary focus of the study was riparian zones. In addition to small mammal sampling, vegetation and coarse woody debris samples were taken at certain sites to determine any correlations between habitat and species presence. During the survey all specimens were captured and released using live trapping techniques including Sherman and pitfall traps. In total 227 small mammals representing nine species were captured {{during the course of the}} study. The most common species found in the study was the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus). The least common species found were the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius), woodland vole (Microtus pinetorum), and northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) ...|$|E

50|$|In 1984, BAR also {{implemented}} a biennial Smog Check Program, {{also known as}} the motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, pursuant to authority granted by Senate Bill 33 of 1982 (SB 33). SB 33 authorized BAR to implement, maintain, and enforce the Smog Check Program, which licenses Smog <b>Check</b> <b>stations</b> and technicians to reduce air pollution from vehicles through mandatory testing of vehicle emission control components. Smog <b>Check</b> <b>stations</b> must also be registered as ARDs to ensure that consumers receive protection associated with vehicle repairs. In addition, BAR ensures that the equipment used to perform Smog Check inspections and the inspections performed at Smog <b>Check</b> <b>stations</b> by Smog <b>Check</b> Inspectors or Technicians will achieve reductions in vehicle emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. Recently, BAR's authority to protect consumers subject to the Smog Check Program was enhanced by Assembly Bill 2289 of 2010 (AB 2289). AB 2289 authorizes BAR to certify high performing Smog <b>Check</b> <b>stations</b> and technicians as STAR certified, which allows them to inspect and repair vehicles that are likely to be high polluters. Shortly after implementation, BAR was recognized for outstanding environmental achievements in government for the STAR Program and was named one of the 2013 Best of California Award winners and received The Green IT Award. AB 2289 further increased the citation amounts for program violations by stations and technicians.|$|R
