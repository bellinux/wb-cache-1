5|$|This section, {{unlike the}} others, does not {{directly}} generate sound. Instead, it allows users to control other gear connected via MIDI. Common parameters such as zone, channel, and volume are <b>controllable</b> from the Stage.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or <b>controllable</b> electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide <b>controllable</b> consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|Reptile's {{appearance}} caused fans {{to speculate}} {{that he could be}} unlocked and used as a <b>controllable</b> character. Boon noted in a later interview that due to the popularity of the rumors surrounding the character, they decided to include Reptile in subsequent installments of the series as a playable fighter.|$|E
5|$|As with {{equipped}} items, Garment Grids {{often provide}} characters {{with a variety}} of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two <b>controllable</b> support units.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are <b>controllable</b> with {{medication}} in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E
5|$|Image filters. Image filter theory {{grew out}} of {{transmission}} line theory and the design proceeded {{in a similar manner}} to transmission line analysis. For the first time filters could be produced that had precisely <b>controllable</b> passbands and other parameters. These developments took place in the 1920s and filters produced to these designs were still in widespread use in the 1980s, only declining as the use of analogue telecommunications has declined. Their immediate application was the economically important development of frequency division multiplexing for use on intercity and international telephony lines.|$|E
5|$|Most ZnO has n-type character, even in {{the absence}} of {{intentional}} doping. Nonstoichiometry is typically the origin of n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. <b>Controllable</b> n-type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a <b>controllable</b> balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, {{but were}} in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection {{in a manner similar}} to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had sound effects that were volume <b>controllable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Technological adaptations {{have also}} {{utilised}} living beetles as cyborgs. For example, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded project implanted electrodes into adult male Rhinoceros beetles, {{allowing them to}} be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held on its back. Electrical signals delivered via the electrodes command the insect to take off, turn left or right, or hover in midflight. The research was intended to suggest proof-of-concept for surveillance purposes. Similar technology {{has been applied to}} the flower beetle Mecynorhina torquata to stimulate different walking gaits and lengths of a live beetle <b>controllable</b> by a human operator.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant hydraulic flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without hydraulic power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently <b>controllable</b> under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is highly}} maneuverable at both {{supersonic}} and subsonic speeds. Computerized {{flight control system}} and full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and <b>controllable.</b> The Raptor's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60° alpha while having some roll control.|$|E
5|$|The genome of the {{nematode}} worm C. elegans contains 9 serpins, all {{of which}} lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular. However, only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors. One, SRP-6, performs a protective function and guards against stress-induced calpain-associated lysosomal disruption. Further, SRP-6 inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases released after lysosomal rupture. Accordingly, worms lacking SRP-6 are sensitive to stress. Most notably, SRP-6 knockout worms die when placed in water (the hypo-osmotic stress lethal phenotype or Osl). It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and <b>controllable</b> role in determining cell fate.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, <b>controllable</b> and predictable in its performance.|$|E
5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the <b>controllable</b> airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and <b>controllable,</b> {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
5|$|Ultracold atom {{trapping}} in optical lattices is {{an experimental}} tool {{commonly used in}} condensed matter physics, and in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The method involves using optical lasers to form an interference pattern, which acts as a lattice, in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures. Cold atoms in optical lattices are used as quantum simulators, that is, they act as <b>controllable</b> systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems, such as frustrated magnets. In particular, {{they are used to}} engineer one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices for a Hubbard model with pre-specified parameters, and to study phase transitions for antiferromagnetic and spin liquid ordering.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Lara has a stamina meter which depletes while she is performing bouts of climbing: if the bar empties before reaching her destination, she falls. The {{rate at which the}} meter decrease slows if the player performs special actions that increase Lara's strength. These actions are also necessary to progress in many of the levels. The game incorporates elements similar to a role-playing game, whereby Lara can talk with various NPCs found throughout the environments and choose what kinds of answers to give: early in the game, these answers will directly affect her progress through the story. The game also features a second playable character, Kurtis Trent. Initially appearing to be an antagonist, he becomes <b>controllable</b> by the player late in the game. He features mainly identical moves to Lara, and his sections of the game are more based around combat.|$|E
5|$|With {{a record}} of 40 wins and 6 losses (one through concession) in the UK Robot Wars series, Razer is {{recognised}} {{as one of the}} most successful competitors in the programme's history. It was featured on Robot Wars merchandise including a DVD and video games, and had a pull-back toy created in its image—one of which was later modified by Ian Lewis to function as a fully radio <b>controllable</b> miniature version of the team's original heavyweight machine. Razer also competed in the American television series BattleBots, winning three of its five head-to-head battles and the 1999 Gigabot Rumble. The team behind Razer later constructed a new combatant called Warhead specifically for this competition. After retirement, Razer appears in non-combat demonstrations as part of Robo Challenge educational displays and events. It returned to active combat in the 2016 revival of Robot Wars but lost in the first round.|$|E
25|$|This {{state-space}} realization {{is called}} <b>controllable</b> canonical form because the resulting model {{is guaranteed to}} be <b>controllable</b> (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it {{has the ability to}} move every state).|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{this system}} is both <b>controllable</b> and observable.|$|E

25|$|There are twelve {{different}} playable races, {{each with}} its own strengths, weaknesses and resource dependencies. There are roughly a hundred and forty <b>controllable</b> units which will fight and, in some cases, build buildings.|$|E
25|$|While {{enclosed}} stoves {{are typically}} {{more efficient and}} <b>controllable</b> than open fires, there are exceptions. The type of water-heating 'back boiler' open fires commonly used in Ireland, for instance, can achieve more than 80% absolute efficiency.|$|E
25|$|This {{results in}} the {{availability}} of the whole of the display area to reflect light in any desired color. This is achieved by building up a pixel with a stack of three independently <b>controllable</b> colored oil films.|$|E
25|$|Antineutrinos {{were first}} {{detected}} {{as a result}} of their interaction with protons in a large tank of water. This was installed next to a nuclear reactor as a <b>controllable</b> source of the antineutrinos (See: Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment).|$|E
25|$|The PT-22 {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of a single tank mounted forward of the front cockpit. Fuel is gravity fed to the carburetor. The oil system is a dry-sump type, with all oil stored in a tank located on the front side of the firewall in the upper section of the fuselage. The wing flaps are mechanically operated from a lever located {{on the left side}} of each cockpit. Adjustable elevator trim is provided via an elevator trim tab <b>controllable</b> from a handwheel mounted {{on the left side of}} each cockpit. In its original configuration, the aircraft was not equipped with an electrical system. Hydraulic brakes are provided for each wheel, <b>controllable</b> via the rudder pedals in each cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Screening {{endoscopy}} {{is recommended}} among males {{over the age}} of 60 who have reflux symptoms that are of long duration and not <b>controllable</b> with treatment. Among those not expected to live more than 5 years screening is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Few of {{the reforms}} planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three reasons: Firstly, there was an absence of firm {{civilian}} political guidance, with President Yeltsin primarily interested in ensuring that the Armed Forces were <b>controllable</b> and loyal, rather than reformed.|$|E
