But I am detailing a chain of facts--and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with one exception, had fallen in. This exception {{was found in a}} <b>compartment</b> <b>wall,</b> not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in great measure, resisted the action of the fire--a fact which I attributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words [...] "strange!" [...] "singular!" [...] and other similar expressions, excited my curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in bas relief upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. The impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was a rope about the animal's neck.|$|E

The <b>compartment</b> <b>walls</b> were structurally isolated from the concrete slab and columns {{to prevent them from}} influencing the structural response to the fire. One internal column was exposed to the fire and eight additional columns were partially exposed to the fire. The columns were made from high strength concrete (103 MPa compressive cube strength), so 2.7 kg/m 3 of polypropylene fibers were added to the concrete mix to prevent explosive spalling of the columns. The cover to all internal steel reinforcement was specified as 20 mm. The structure was loaded during testing using sand bags, and the fire consisted of timber cribs with a load of 40 kg/m 2.|$|R

40|$|Protected lobbies may be stipulated by fire {{codes to}} protect {{openings}} in <b>compartment</b> <b>walls.</b> Such lobbies will {{in some cases}} impair the communication between different parts in a building. In the circumstances, the use of fire shutters may be considered. However, fire shutters available in Hong Kong's market can only provide resistance to fire in terms of integrity. As heat flux can be transmitted by radiation, such fire shutters cannot {{be regarded as a}} like-to-like substitution to protected lobbies. This paper is to demonstrate that a double fire shutter system can be an appropriate alternative means of protection to the openings against the spread of flame and heat in stead of using lobby. The effectiveness of the double shutter system will depend on the separation between the shutters and the emissivity of the shutters.

40|$|High-rise {{building}} fire is often {{influenced by the}} ambient wind. Study concerning fire behavior in the compartment of high-rise buildings in wind environment is needed for exploring some effective methods used for evaluation of compartment fire smoke movement and control. In this paper, smoke flowing direction and temperature of ventilation-controlled fire in a two-vent compartment are studied when ambient wind blows to the vent at higher altitude. It is found {{that there is a}} critical wind speed, above which the direction of smoke movement is dominated by wind rather than by buoyancy. It is also found that ambient wind has a complex influence on smoke temperature in the compartment. When wind speed exceeds another critical value, only one steady state appears in the smoke temperature rising curve. Otherwise three steady states appear. Heat transfer through the <b>compartment</b> <b>walls</b> has great influence on the second critical wind speed. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on {{the various types of}} Skylab film to establish the total radiation dosages compatible with an acceptable level of film fogging, and on the S 190 borosilicate window to establish radiation limits for an acceptable darkening level. The results verified that most of the films would be unusable when returned to earth, and that the borosilicate window would be darkened beyond allowable limit, unless additional protection was provided. The operational solutions to these problems involve protecting the film with five film vaults and protecting the window with a radiation shield. The largest vault is made of aluminum and weighs over 2000 lb (its thickest <b>compartment</b> <b>wall</b> is 3. 4 in.). The window radiation shield is a light honeycomb structure which is swung away for limited astronaut viewing or when the S 190 experiment is in operation.

40|$|A large {{building}} space {{would be}} compartmented with fire resistant structures to inhibit {{the spread of}} fire. Compartment walls with fire resistance level specified in building regulations serve for this purpose. An opening in a <b>compartment</b> <b>wall</b> for communication between adjoining compartments would be protected by a fire shutter with a fire resistance level {{equal to that of}} the wall in terms of integrity. In a fire emergency, this opening will not be available to building occupants for evacuation and a fire exit door close to the opening is arranged in many local shopping malls. The fire shutters would be heated to an elevated temperature, when subjected to a building fire and emit thermal radiation to any adjacent compartment. An evacuee using the adjacent exit door close to the heated shutter would receive a thermal radiant heat flux and would cause skin injury. This creates problems for evacuation in a fire emergency. This paper surveys the typical fire shutter installations in 14 shopping malls and 47 installations close to exit doors are reported upon. Typical configurations for the shutter-exit door set are identified. The thermal radiant heat flux from these shutters was determined, in order to predict and recommend a safe distance between the fire shutters and individuals standing at a distance where they would be free from skin injury. The implications are that in typical applications, the fire shutter should be properly located at a safe distance from the building exits. The minimum distance between a fire shutter and nearby exits is thus recommended for typical installations. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Full-scale {{experiments}} are conducted {{to study the}} effects of different water-based indirect and combination initial attack methods on the compartment environment and firefighter during compartment fire suppression, with an aim toward improving manual fire suppression effectiveness and firefighter safety. Hot layer temperatures typical of room fire conditions are developed in the test compartment using wood cribs. Five suppression methods including straight stream, penciling, continuous wide and narrow fog, and a wide angle burst method are examined for two different spray angles and nozzle pressures. Temperatures, heat flux, gas velocity, and gas concentrations are monitored for the duration of each experiment in the fire compartment, along with temperatures and gas concentrations {{in the area of the}} firefighter, just outside the compartment. Realistic fire conditions are repeatedly established in the test compartment, with each fuel load allowing up to nine suppression applications per fire. The repeatability of the compartment temperatures are demonstrated by the consistent hot layer temperature stratification in the room, along with the uniformity of the hot layer throughout a test, and the consistency of the temperature from test to test. The repeatability of each suppression method is also demonstrated by comparing results of compartment cooling achieved in repeat tests. Differences in average compartment temperature before and during suppression indicate that penciling tactics provide little cooling of the compartment. In narrow fog attacks, the hot layer is pushed toward the floor, resulting in increased temperatures in the lower layer, generally an undesired result. Wide angle fog methods may have greater impact on compartment temperature as compared to straight stream or narrow fog methods, however, they also result in large increases in temperature at the firefighter. Wide angle burst tactics less effectively cool the compartment gases than continuous methods, but also lead to less impact on the firefighter. Greater numbers of bursts increase cooling of the compartment, but at the expense of increased impact on the firefighter. Including impact on the firefighter, continuous straight stream methods, at a nozzle discharge pressure of 700 kPa and aimed to the top of the rear <b>compartment</b> <b>wall,</b> appear the best choice for initial attack on the fire developed in these experiments. Due to variability between real fire scenarios and experiments such as these, significantly more study of the various suppression tactics is required before the most effective methods of suppression can be determined for a given set of fire scenarios...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the connective framework of the lower extremity hypodermis and the saphenous veins was studied by dissection, stereomicroscopy, ultrasonography and histology in 64 lower limbs. A fibroelastic lamina was evidenced in the hypodermis of the medial aspect of the thigh and leg {{and in the back}} face of the leg. This lamina, together with the underlying muscular fascia, fixed the boundaries of two compartments occupied by the saphenous veins and nerves. The adventitia of the saphenous veins was connected to the <b>compartment</b> <b>walls</b> by thick connective strands. The saphenous veins ran deeply in the hypodermis, closely ensheathed by a fibroelastic sleeve. As a consequence, they could no longer be considered as a truly superficial vein. This term seems to be appropriate only for their tributaries, which ran in a more superficial plane just below the dermis. The role of the saphenous vessels in blood return from the lower limbs may be greater than classically accepted. In fact, due to their close fascial ensheathing and adventitial anchoring, muscular contractions may enhance blood flow within these vessels as occurs in the intermuscular veins. Finally, dilative pathology of the saphenous vein may be resisted by the membranous lamina as a sort of a fibroelastic shield...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a fire field model combined with detailed chemistry to the simulation of sooting propane jet fires in a 135 m 3 compartment. The purpose of the research is to investigate the behavior of under-ventilated jet fires, and the formation of toxic products. The kinetic formation of major species (CO, C 2 H 2) and trace species (soot) has been studied using, a detailed reaction mechanism, for propane. The concept of strained laminar diffusion flamelet was adopted to model the main hydrocarbon combustion and the formation of soot. The turbulence-chemistry, interaction followed the conserved scalar and assumed, probability density function (PDF) description of turbulent diffusion flames. The soot formation was modeled by the two-equation approach. Instantaneous temperatures given by the flamelet were modified to account for radiative heat loss. The predictions for velocity, CO, soot, and other main species are given in the paper, and comparison is made between predictions and measurements on a 1, 5 -MW fire test case that showed the important effect of the entrainment on the formation of toxic species in the enclosure. The predicted result of soot at the vent location is in agreement with the experimental data. The general trend, of temperature distributions have been correctly predicted, but the neglecting of convective heat transfer from the <b>compartment</b> <b>walls</b> and the simplified treatment for radiative heat loss from the jet fire has resulted in some discrepancies on the predictions of temperatures, particularly at the vent location...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics which govern the water {{relations of the}} giant-celled sporangiophore of Phycomyces blakesleeanus were measured with the pressure probe technique and with nanoliter osmometry. These properties are important because they govern water uptake associated with cell growth and because they may influence expansion of the sporangiophore wall. Turgor pressure ranged from 1. 1 to 6. 6 bars (mean = 4. 1 bars), and was the same for stage I and stage IV sporangiophores. Sporangiophore osmotic pressure averaged 11. 5 bars. From the difference between cell osmotic pressure and turgor pressure, the average water potential of the sporangiophore was calculated to be about - 7. 4 bars. When sporangiophores were submerged under water, turgor remained nearly constant. We propose that the low cell turgor pressure is due to solutes in the cell wall solution, i. e., between the cuticle and the plasma membrane. Membrane hydraulic conductivity averaged 4. 6 x 10 (- 6) cm s- 1 bar- 1, and was significantly greater in stage I sporangiophores than in stage IV sporangiophores. Contrary to previous reports, the sporangiophore is separated from the supporting mycelium by septa which prevent bulk volume flow between the two regions. The presence of a <b>wall</b> <b>compartment</b> between the cuticle and the plasma membrane results in anomalous osmosis during pressure clamp measurements. This behavior arises because of changes in solute concentration as water moves into {{or out of the}} <b>wall</b> <b>compartment</b> surrounding the sporangiophore.

40|$|Four {{sandwich}} panel rooms were constructed as prescribed in the ISO 13784 - 1 test. However, the construction followed normal industry practice, and the panels were then subjected to damage typically found in commercial premises. The fire load was increased to simulate fires actually occurring in commercial premises, by stepping-up the propane burner from 300 kW to 600 kW, and placing substantial wooden cribs {{in two of}} the rooms. The results showed significant differences in fire growth rate and burning behaviour between those panels filled with polyisocyanurate (PIR) and those filled with stone wool in both the experiments without and with the wood crib. Most significantly, the PIR pyrolysis products caused ignition (by radiation from above) of the wood crib 1 minute after the burner was stepped up to 300 kW (11 minutes into the test) rather than 2 minutes after the burner had been stepped up to 600 kW (22 minutes into the test) for the stone wool panels. This interaction between building and contents is frequently ignored in assessments of fire safety. After a few minutes, the PIR pyrolysis products that escaped outside the room, from between the panels, ignited. The extra thermal attack from PIR fuelled flames distorted the panels, exposing more PIR and resulting in large flames on both the inside and outside of the enclosure. From a fire safety perspective this is most important as it shows that with larger fire loads typical of those found in commercial premises, steel-faced PIR filled panels are not capable of acting as fire barriers, and support flame spread through <b>compartment</b> <b>walls</b> and ceilings. In addition, the PIR panelled rooms produced very large quantities of dense smoke and toxic effluents, where the stone wool panelled rooms produced small amounts of light smoke of lower toxicity...|$|R
