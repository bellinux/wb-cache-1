In the second part of this thesis, we study the graph cohomology for a more general class of graphs and prove many properties about it.

40|$|Crystallographic group {{theory is}} {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} method of choice for the description of crystal structures and related phenomena such as phase transformations, antiphase domain formation and twinning. Symmetry alone, however, merely comprises a qualitative picture. On the contrary, number theory seems to be far less explored within a crystallographic context, whereas it possibly allows for a more quantitative arithmetic approach. An illustrative example is given by so-called multiplicative congruential generators (MCGs), i. e. recurrence relations of the form Z(n+ 1) = m Z(n) (mod M), first introduced by Lehmer for the generation of pseudorandom number sequences. However, Marsaglia later noted that MCGs exhibit an intrinsic sublattice structure, which was shown to have some implications for the description of crystal structures. Another example {{is due to the}} bit-reversal, quasirandom number sequences of van der Corput, which exhibit features related to quasiperiodic binary substitution tilings. Both approaches share a common basis, as the integer sequences involved for the generation of the corresponding two- or three-dimensional point sets and their coordinate description are mere permutations of a finite set of successive natural numbers. Notably both methods have their primary application in the generation of random numbers, which sheds some light on the subtle interrelations between distinct states of order. Following the aforementioned number-theoretic construction principles allows for the systematic (algorithmic) generation of artificial crystal structures (permutation structures), as well as their <b>combinatorial</b> enumeration and <b>classification.</b> The peculiar structure of beta-Mn has already identified as a near-miss to these envisioned permutation structures. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} the complex simple Lie algebras using elementary algebraic geometry. We use our construction {{to obtain a}} new proof of the classification of complex simple Lie algebras that does not appeal to the classification of root systems. 1 Overview We first present an algorithm that constructs the minuscule varieties using elementary algebraic geometry. The minuscule varieties are a preferred class of homogeneous varieties. They are essentially the homogeneous projective varieties that admit an irreducible Hermitian symmetric metric; see below for the precise definition. The algorithm proceeds iteratively by building a larger space X # P N from a smaller space Y # P n via a rational map P n ### P N, defined using {{the ideals of the}} secant varieties of Y, beginning with Y = CP 1. As a byproduct, we obtain elementary constructions of all complex simple Lie algebras (except for e 8 which has no minuscule homogenous space) and their minuscule representations, without any reference to Lie groups or Lie algebras. Next we present an algorithm that constructs the fundamental adjoint varieties using the ideals of the tangential and secant varieties of certain minuscule varieties. By an adjoint variety, we mean the unique closed orbit in the projectivization Pg of a simple complex Lie algebra g. We say that an adjoint variety is fundamental if the adjoint representation is fundamental. In particular, we construct all complex simple Lie algebras without any reference to Lie theory. Complex simple Lie algebras were first classified by Cartan and Killing 100 years ago. Their classification proof proceeds by reducing the question to a <b>combinatorial</b> problem: the <b>classification</b> of irreducible root systems, and then classifying root systems.
