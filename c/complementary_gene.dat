Such differential investment may amplify {{the effects of}} genetic quality on fitness. Attractiveness can include 'good gene' and 'complementary gene' components, but how the latter affects parental investment remains unknown. We found that nestling song sparrows with genetically dissimilar parents grew faster than did nestlings whose parents were genetically more similar to one another. A cross-fostering experiment revealed <b>complementary</b> <b>gene</b> effects on growth; nestlings produced by genetically dissimilar parents grew faster than their adoptive 'siblings' reared in the same nest but produced by parents that were more genetically similar. To explore whether parental investment exaggerates these <b>complementary</b> <b>gene</b> effects on growth, we monitored parental nest visits.

Thus, we tried to isolate E. coli mutants deficient in the biosynthesis and their <b>complementary</b> <b>genes</b> by use of an artificial phenotypic screening system employing three carotenoid biosynthetic genes, crtE, crtB, and crtl.

Among large numbers of red colonies, we identified 117 white colonies. Next, we transformed each mutant with an E. coli genomic library. Twenty-nine <b>complementary</b> <b>genes</b> that restore red color of host colonies were isolated. A homology search and further complementation study using subcloned genes revealed that the true <b>complementary</b> <b>genes</b> encode isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, subunits of ATP synthase, enzymes of the Krebs cycle, some aldehyde dehydrogenases, phosphate acetyltransferase, and enzymes which relate to the biosynthesis of ubiquinones and menaquinones.

Although these new bacterial genomes are partitioned into discrete cell types, the intergenome patterns of gene loss and retention are almost perfectly complementary. These results defy easy classification: they show genomic patterns consistent with those observed after both speciation and whole-genome duplication.

Independent recessive mutations in each of these genes caused cell wall thickening in a highly specific grain “disarticulation zone,” converting the brittle floral axis (the rachis) of the wild-type into a tough, non-brittle form that promoted grain retention. By tracing the evolutionary history of allelic variation in both genes, we conclude that spatially and temporally independent selections of germplasm with a non-brittle rachis were made during the domestication of barley by farmers in the southern and northern regions of the Levant, actions that made a major contribution to the emergence of early agrarian societies...|$|R
