Instead she calls Annie, and the two reconcile and decide to meet together before going home for winter break.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2015 AFL season {{synthetic}} turf {{was installed}} {{around the perimeter}} of the playing surface. The most controversial sections were around the AFL interchange gates as well as where the goals are located where the synthetic turf <b>comes</b> <b>right</b> up to the playing area (the synthetic turf at the goals was moved several meters closer to the fence in March 2017). This was highlighted after a Brisbane Lions player suffered a season ending ACL injury and one coach labeling the surface 'dangerous' after a game at the venue.|$|E

25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just <b>comes</b> <b>right</b> together again.|$|E
500|$|Buzz Aldrin, {{the second}} man {{to walk on the}} Moon, and {{musician}} James Taylor both guest star as themselves in this episode. Some of the writers were concerned about Aldrin's line, [...] "second <b>comes</b> <b>right</b> after first", feeling it was insulting to Aldrin. An alternative line was written: [...] "first to take a soil sample", but Aldrin had no problem with saying the original line. A version of James Taylor's [...] "Fire and Rain" [...] was recorded specifically for the episode containing some altered lyrics. Taylor's original recording session was included as an extra on the DVD.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers often {{praised the}} game's {{graphical}} style and presentation, while criticising the gameplay. GamePro {{called it a}} [...] "rejuvenating, jaw-dropping experience". IGN said [...] "XIII has a great story-driven sheen, but at its core, it's weighed down by some occasional bewildering flaws, {{in addition to the}} lackluster weapons and simple combat". GameZone also criticised the combat, stating [...] "If not for the graphics to carry the game through, XIII would have been a boring game. Gunfights are {{the best part of the}} gameplay. It also happens to be the most unbalanced part". Edge said XIII had [...] "true artistic merit: it never gets stale; every episode has been drawn with minute care and attention. It would have been an incredible achievement if the gameplay had matched the outstanding art direction". GameSpy criticised the graphics and the multiplayer mode, and concluded [...] "When it <b>comes</b> <b>right</b> down to it, XIII is a fine game...Just don't expect the FPS of the year because, sadly, this isn't it".|$|E

[...] Connors adds {{that a lot of the}} topspin that Djokovic's opponents drive at him <b>comes</b> <b>right</b> into his zone, thus his ability to turn defence into offence well.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Claire’s open {{disdain for}} her sister, {{she has never}} told Agnes about Tobias’s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, {{almost as if she}} has a hidden weapon that she protects in case she may have to use it one day. When Agnes <b>comes</b> <b>right</b> out and asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire’s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes {{describes}} Claire in this way: “Claire could tell us so much if she cared to [...] [...] [...] Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly [...] [...] [...] You were not named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee’s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.|$|E

Without question, coastal Downeast Maine is beautiful, breathtaking even, but bottom line is this: it's an isolated, harsh and natural beauty, and nature itself is neutral, neither bad nor good.
