Three research hypotheses were developed to investigate to what extent consumers' attitude towards offshore call centres are influenced by their attitude towards Country of Service Origin (ACOSO) perceived service quality (PSQ) and perceived risk (PR) that a consumer attaches to offshore call centers. A linear regression model was developed to investigate to what extent ACOSO, PSQ, and PR {{have the ability to}} predict consumer attitude towards offshored call centers. Data were collected by a self administered questionnaire from 283 consumers from three geographic locations of UK. The consumers' attitude towards <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>services</b> based in five countries namely Canada, Mexico, India, the Philippines and China were evaluated. The findings revealed that the consumers attitude towards offshore call centers tend to be negative and differ according to Country of Service Origin. Thus, even though the overall attitude towards offshore call centres were negative, compared to their attitude towards British call centres, the magnitude of negativity vary as British consumers perceived that British followed by Canadians are best in terms of providing a quality service. Similarly, India and China were rated as poor in terms of service quality. The findings also indicated that British consumers perceive call centres from Asia such as India and China to be more risky.

This could be as simple as establishing a computer-mediated relationship between consumer and business, between business and supplier, or between supplier and manufacturer. It could involve automation of existing business systems, such as transaction or manufacturing processes. On the web, electronic commerce often means marketing, and online sales. Behind this though is a vast range of activities and technologies, powered by back-office systems. Electronic commerce is more than just sales. Initially, the Indian banking system was domestically oriented at the time of nationalization in 1969. National policy objectives where the guiding force and banks were primarily involved in mobilizing domestic savings, lending funds to specific sectors of the economy and raising resources for financing public deficits.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Australian {{government}} sponsored trials {{aimed at}} addressing problems in after hours primary medical care service use in five {{different parts of}} the country with different after hours care problems. The study's objective was to determine in four of the five trials where telephone triage was the sole innovation, if there was a reduction in emergency GP after hours service utilization (GP first call-out) as measured in Medicare Benefits Schedule claim data. Monthly MBS claim data in both the pre-trial and trial periods was monitored over a 3 -year period in each trial area as well as in a national sample outside the trial areas (National comparator). Poisson regression analysis was used in analysis. RESULTS: There was significant reduction in first call out MBS claims in three of the four study areas where stand-alone <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>services</b> existed. These were the Statewide Call Centre in both its Metropolitan and Non-metropolitan areas in which it operated - Relative Risk (RR) = 0. 87 (95 % Confidence interval: 0. 86 - 0. 88) and 0. 60 (95 % CI: 0. 54 - 0. 68) respectively. There was also a reduction in the Regional Call Centre in the non-Metropolitan area in which it operated (RR = 0. 46 (95 % CI: 0. 35 - 0. 61) though a small increase in its Metropolitan area (RR = 1. 11 (95 % CI: 1. 06 - 1. 17). For the two telephone triage services embedded in existing organisations, there was also a significant reduction for the Deputising Service - RR = 0. 62 (95 % CI: 0. 61 - 0. 64) but no change in the Local Triage centre area. CONCLUSION: The four telephone triage services were associated with reduced GP MBS claims for first callout after hours care in most study areas. It is possible that other factors could be responsible for some of this reduction, for example, MBS submitted claims for after hours GP services being reclassified from 'after hours' to 'in hours'.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Australian {{government}} sponsored five local trials {{aimed at}} addressing problems in after hours (AH) primary medical care (PMC). The study's {{objective was to}} determine if the four trials, where telephone triage was the sole innovation, led to a reduction in AH service utilisation and change in service mix towards AH GP clinics. Changes in utilisation and mix of AH GP clinic and home visits, ED and ambulance use were monitored in the trial areas, and in a national sample to adjust for the effects of secular trend. Pre- and post-trial telephone surveys of two separate random samples of approximately 350 AH PMC user households in each area were conducted. RESULTS: Some types of AH PMC use became more frequent in both of the standalone services using nurse-administered proprietary <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> software, which were aimed at better addressing population need (Statewide call centre; Regional <b>call</b> <b>centre).</b> <b>Service</b> use overall (95 %CI: 1. 03 - 1. 83) and GP clinic use (95 %CI: 1. 07 - 2. 00) increased in the metro area of the Statewide <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> and in GP clinic (95 %CI: 1. 04 - 2. 14) and home visits (95 %CI: 1. 03 - 3. 91) in the non-metro area of the Regional <b>call</b> <b>centre.</b> <b>Service</b> mix only changed in the non-metro area of the Regional <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> with increased contact in GP home visits (95 %CI: 1. 02 - 4. 38). Levels of use remained unchanged in both embedded services using other than proprietary software, which were established to support the GP workforce (Deputising service; Local triage <b>centre).</b> <b>Service</b> mix only changed in the Deputising service with a change away from AH GP clinics in both contact (95 %CI: 0. 39 - 0. 97) and frequency (95 % CI: - 2. 12 - - 0. 7). CONCLUSION: Bearing in mind limitations in estimating AH PMC utilisation levels and mix, it is concluded that the impacts of telephone triage were generally smaller in Australia than reported elsewhere. There were different impacts on levels of service utilisation and service mix in standalone <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> and embedded <b>services.</b> Impacts of telephone triage on service utilisation and mix are influenced by the type of telephone triage offered, the goals of the agency providing the service, as well as local factors.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the process of}} implementing decision support by call centre nurses for callers facing values-sensitive health decisions. Design. Exploratory case study guided by the Ottawa Model of Research Use with an embedded randomized controlled trial. Setting. A Canadian province-wide call centre. Intervention. Online autotutorial, skill-building workshop, decision support protocol, and performance feedback using simulated callers. Methods. (1) Barriers assessment using a survey, interviews, focus groups, and quality audit of baseline simulated calls. (2) Comparison of intervention and control groups using a knowledge test, quality audit of simulated calls, and acceptability surveys. (3) Assessment of the uptake and sustainability of decision support using a survey, interviews, and focus groups. Results. (1) Of 108 nurses, 57 responded to the barriers survey. Nurses had positive attitudes toward patient participation in decision making and their role in supporting callers. Main barriers included inadequate nurses' knowledge, skills, and confidence in providing decision support; lack of process to guide decision support calls; patient decision aids not formatted for telephone use; low public awareness; pressure to minimize call length, and unclear program direction. (2) Compared to controls (n= 20), nurses (n= 19) {{who participated in the}} intervention had improved knowledge (M= 74 % vs. 60 %, p= 0. 007) and provided a higher quality of decision support particularly in the domains of discussing values and support (M= 81. 3 % vs. 45. 8 %,p< 0. 0001) without significantly increasing call duration (M= 18. 5 vs. 16. 7 min, p= 0. 73). Nurses were satisfied with the multifaceted intervention. Twelve control group nurses opted to complete the training after the trial concluded. (3) Within 3 months post-intervention, 25 of the 31 nurses (n= 19 + 12) completed the decision support uptake survey. Of these, 44 % had used the protocol with real callers and 88 % intended to use it. Nurses spoke positively about their experiences with real callers. Suggestions to improve sustainability included integrating the protocol in the call centre database, reformatting the patient decision aids, clarifying the program direction, establishing call length guidelines tailored to call type, implementing decision support training for all staff, and publicizing the new decision support services. Conclusions. The multifaceted intervention and process evaluation measures may provide a feasible approach to expanding <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>services</b> to include values-sensitive decision support.

40|$|In recent years, call centres {{have been}} {{considered}} {{as an integral part}} of the modern businesses, since they play an important role in providing service delivery functions to their customers. A well-managed call centre, therefore, is crucial to ensure high level of customer satisfaction in today’s competitive market. In order to achieve a high standard, managers of call centres face a very difficult set of challenges. At the top level, they must strike a balance between two powerful competing interests: low operating costs and high service quality. On a day-to-day basis, while simultaneously keeping low costs and high service quality, those managers must also employ appropriate techniques and tools in order to evaluate the true performance of their operations accurately. Such tools play a vital role in understanding the current system performance, evaluation of any proposed enhancement scenarios, and optimising operations management decisions under any unexpected operating conditions. One of traditional operations management challenges for call centre managers is to tackle the multi-period human resources allocation problem. In this thesis, the staffing and staff scheduling decisions in single-skill inbound call centres were studied. These decisions are normally made under strict service level constrain in the presence of highly uncertain operations and demand of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>services.</b> Neglecting such uncertainty may lead to unrealistic decisions. The objective of this research thesis was to propose a framework to enhance the call centre performance through taking realistic optimal staffing and scheduling decisions. Realistic optimisation requires realistic modeling (evaluation) of call centre operations which is the main focus and contribution of this research. The proposed framework has combined statistical, simulation, and Integer Programming (IP) techniques in achieving realistic optimisation. The framework begins by developing stochastic statistical data models for call centre operations parameters which are divided into service demand (arrival volumes) and service quality (service times, abandonment volumes, and patience time) parameters. These data models are then fed into a simulation model which was developed to determine the minimum staffing levels in daily an-hour periods. Finally, these staffing levels are considered as input to an IP model that optimally allocates the service agents to the different operating shifts of a typical working day. Application of the proposed framework to a call centre in Libya will also be presented to illustrate how its staffing and scheduling decisions could be improved by using the model...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{production}} processes have become increasingly fragmented: they are divided into ever smaller parts considered as separate activities, which are then spread over various locations in different countries. In other words, value chains for many products are becoming global. This implies that inputs into the production process are sourced from both local and foreign suppliers. The latter mode of sourcing is {{commonly referred to as}} offshoring. Expressed as the share of imported in total intermediates, offshoring has grown relatively fast in the recent past. Moreover, its scope has been extended as it increasingly encompasses not only manufacturing but also service activities. A typical example for the former is the sourcing from abroad of parts and components for car assembly. While offshoring of manufacturing activities has been occurring since long and has been largely facilitated by trade liberalisation, the offshoring of service activities such as the provision of accounting or <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>services</b> is a more recent phenomenon that has been fostered by the increased tradability of such services. With the increasing scale and scope of offshoring, it becomes crucial to get a grasp of its drivers as well as the gains and threats associated with it. The latter are {{the focal point of the}} public and academic discussion around offshoring, in particular the potential threats for workers in developed economies. Typical questions that are being raised are whether offshoring leads to job losses in developed countries and whether it favours certain categories of workers and is to the disadvantage of others. These threats are directly linked to the motivations for engaging into offshoring. In this respect, wage costs play a prominent role. But other factors may also influence offshoring decisions, e. g. regulations, in particular those regarding the environment. Last but not least, offshoring may also entail gains for developed economies through the improvements in the efficiency of production. In this PhD thesis, several causes and consequences of offshoring are examined empirically for Belgium. The first issue that is investigated is whether offshoring of materials and business services affects industry-level employment. An improved offshoring intensity measure is introduced. It is a volume measure of the share of imported intermediates in output split into materials and business services and according to the country of origin of imports, i. e. high-wage and low-wage countries. Estimations of static and dynamic industry-level labour demand equations augmented by offshoring intensities do not reveal a significant impact of either materials or business services offshoring on total employment for Belgium. This result holds for both the manufacturing sector and the service sector and it proves robust to splitting the manufacturing sector into high-technology and low-technology industries. These results raise the question whether there are actually productivity gains from offshoring. Therefore, estimates of the impact of materials and business services offshoring on industry-level productivity in Belgium are presented. Two features of the analysis are new compared to the existing literature on this subject: the issue is examined separately for manufacturing and market services industries and the possibility of forward and backward spillovers from offshoring, i. e. that productivity gains from offshoring feed through to upstream and downstream industries, is investigated. Results show that materials offshoring has no effect on productivity, while business services offshoring leads to productivity gains in manufacturing. Furthermore, there is no evidence of either forward or backward spillovers from offshoring. Despite the absence of an industry-level total employment effect, offshoring may alter the within-industry composition of employment. In this respect, a major concern is the worsening of the labour market position of low-skilled workers. This issue is addressed by providing evidence on the impact of offshoring on the skill structure of manufacturing employment in Belgium between 1995 and 2007. Offshoring is found to significantly lower the employment share of low-skilled workers. Its contribution to the fall in the employment share of low-skilled workers amounts to 35 %. This is mainly driven by offshoring to Central and Eastern European countries. Business services offshoring also contributes significantly to the fall in the low-skilled employment share. As a complement to the existing literature, the widely used current price measure of offshoring is compared with a constant price measure that is based on a deflation with separate price indices for domestic output and imports. This reveals that the former underestimate the extent of offshoring and its impact on low-skilled employment. Finally, further results show that the impact of offshoring on low-skilled employment is significantly smaller in industries with a higher ICT capital intensity. Furthermore, attention is drawn to environmental effects of offshoring by asking whether offshoring contributes to reducing air emissions from manufacturing. Indeed, since the mid- 90 ’s, production-related air emissions in Belgian manufacturing have been reduced substantially. It can be shown that the pace of the reduction has been fastest for domestic intermediates. The issue of whether offshoring has played a role in this reduction by replacing domestic intermediates by imported intermediates is widely debated. Here, a decomposition analysis is developed to measure the contribution of offshoring – the share of imported intermediates in total intermediates – to the fall in air emissions for domestic intermediates. Based on the results from this decomposition analysis, it is possible to calculate that 17 % of the fall in greenhouse gas emissions, 6 % of the fall in acidifying emissions and 7 % of the fall in tropospheric precursor emissions in Belgian manufacturing between 1995 and 2007 can be attributed to offshoring. Finally, emission intensities are also considered as a potential determinant of offshoring. An econometric approach for testing the pollution haven effect for imported intermediate materials is developed. The approach is new with respect to the existing literature on pollution havens through its specific focus on imports of intermediates. The test is embedded in a cost function framework from which a system of cost share equations for variable input factors is derived. The set of potential determinants of the demand for imported intermediate materials includes emission intensities for three types of air pollutants. Their impact constitutes a test of the pollution haven effect. The system of cost share equations is estimated by a within ISUR using data for the Belgian manufacturing sector. Results show some albeit relatively weak evidence of a pollution haven effect for imported intermediate materials.

40|$|Fuelled by {{globalization}} – specifically {{advances in}} information technology, plummeting costs of data transmission, {{political and economic}} deregulation, and perennial attempts to control costs – <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> have grown exponentially since the early 1990 s, effectively replacing face-to-face with <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>service</b> provision (Holman et al. 2007; Income Data Services 2005). Despite this, most studies on politeness in service encounters have focused on face-to-face interactions. Perhaps even more than face-to-face <b>service</b> providers, <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents {{are faced with the}} inherently contradictory demands of processing calls efficiently while also providing excellent "customer care", here used synonymously with "politeness". This study considers how this tension is managed in <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>service</b> interactions, the default type of service provision in contemporary society. Drawing on data from an inbound, onshore <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> in Scotland, comprising a corpus of 79 authentic service interactions, interviews, on-site observations and institutional documents, the study combines quantitative and qualitative approaches with a view to explore how agents negotiate the tension between efficiency and customer care in actual customer service interactions. It is found that, while both efficiency and customer care are accorded importance in institutional policy, in practice, efficiency overwhelmingly overrides customer care. Furthermore, in the few cases where agents actually engage in customer care, naming – using the customer’s first or last name (John, Lisa, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Smith) – appears {{to be used as a}} shortcut to customer care, sometimes up to eight times in a short interaction. Presumably, the reason for this is that naming is quicker than striking up a conversation with the customer, which, alongside naming is another institutional prescription. In other words, naming can be seen as a way of “rationalizing politeness” thereby ensuring that the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agent meets at one and the same time the contradictory demands of efficiency and customer care. On the basis of these findings, it is argued that globalization – here exemplified though <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> talk – has the power to transforms linguistic practices and politeness conventions, certainly within a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> context and possibly beyond too. Consequently, it is argued that sociolinguistic theory must be equipped to acknowledge the tremendous impact of globalization on linguistic policies, practices and conventions. ...|$|R

The results show that in spite of favourable factors such as lower cost of labour, English language proficiency, and political stability, Ghana seems less capable of offering strong competition in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> outsourcing market if its telecommunication infrastructure, especially voice over internet protocol (VoIP); contracting strategies; and human skills are not upgraded...|$|R

40|$|Background: A <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> usually {{represents}} the first contact of a customer with a given company. Therefore, {{the quality of}} its service is of key importance. An essential factor of the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> optimization is the determination of the proper number of operators considering the selected performance measure. Results of previous research show that this can be done using the queueing theory approach. Objectives: The paper presents the practical application of the stochastic queueing models aimed at optimizing a Slovenian telecommunication provider’s <b>call</b> <b>centre.</b> Methods/Approach: The arrival and the service patterns were analysed, and it was concluded that the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> under consideration can be described using the M/M/r {infinity/infinity/FIFO} queueing model. Results: An appropriate number of operators were determined for different peak periods of the working day, taking into consideration the following four performance measures: the expected waiting time, the expected number of waiting customers, the probability that a calling customer will have to wait, and the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> <b>service</b> level. Conclusions: The obtained results prove the usefulness and applicability of the queueing models as a tool for a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> performance optimization. In practice, all the data needed for such a mathematical analysis are usually provided. This paper is aimed at illustrating how such data can be efficiently exploited...|$|R
