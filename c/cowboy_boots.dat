25|$|<b>Cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> are a {{specific}} style of riding boot which combines function with fashion. They became popular among cowboys {{in the western}} United States during the 19th century. Traditional <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> have a Cuban heel, rounded to pointed toe, high shaft, and, traditionally, no lacing. They are normally made from cowhide leather but may be made from more exotic skins such as ostrich, anaconda, or elephant skins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> have {{somewhat}} more pointed toes and higher heels than a traditional work boot, modifications {{designed to prevent}} the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall and being dragged.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 1980s, popular trends {{included}} wool sport coats, Levi 501s, Hawaiian shirts, shell suits, hand-knit sweaters, sports shirts, hoodies, flannel shirts, reversible flannel vests, jackets {{with the}} insides quilted, nylon jackets, gold rings, spandex cycling shorts, <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots,</b> and khaki pants with jagged seams.|$|E

25|$|Allen's {{first race}} for the Virginia House of Delegates was in 1979, two years after he {{graduated}} from law school. He ran in the 26th House District which was then composed of two seats. He placed third {{in a field of}} four candidates. Allen states that he lost because he wasn't himself and was listening to the advice of his campaign manager who suggested he wear wingtips instead of his usual <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|E
25|$|He ran {{again in}} 1982 for the House in the 58th House District with the <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> {{and won the}} election, {{defeating}} incumbent Democrat James B. Murray, whose previous 24th House District was eliminated after redistricting, by 25 votes out of nearly 14,000 cast. He faced Murray again in a 1983 rematch, defeating him 53%–47%. He ran unopposed in 1985, 1987, and 1989. The seat he held was the same one held by Thomas Jefferson.|$|E

50|$|The Magic Boot is a scorpion-emblazoned <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot,</b> {{which is}} wired and fed through the Magic Pipe’s audio lines. It is then played as a percussive {{instrument}} by tapping on the sole while pinching the boot’s opening to achieve different sounds, similar to an African talking drum.|$|R
50|$|Each year, {{there were}} several Bunkhouse Stampedes held in the prior weeks, with the winners of each one going to the final Bunkhouse Stampede to battle for the championship. They began in 1985, and the last was held in 1989, after which it was abandoned. The winner was awarded a large bronze <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot.</b>|$|R
25|$|Rayburn {{also had}} a knack for {{dressing}} to suit his occasion. While in Washington, D.C., he would sport expensive suits, starched shirts, and perfectly shined shoes. However, while back in his poorer district in Texas, Rayburn would wear simple shirts, blue jeans, <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots,</b> and cowboy hats. Several politicians have imitated this pattern, including Ronald Reagan's famous example of clearing brush when at home in California, while wearing fine suits in Washington.|$|E
25|$|The Western is a {{genre of}} various arts which tell stories set {{primarily}} in the later half of the 19th century in the American Old West, often centering {{on the life of}} a nomadic cowboy or gunfighter armed with a revolver and a rifle who rides a horse. Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> and buckskins. Other characters include Native Americans, bandits, lawmen, bounty hunters, outlaws, soldiers (especially mounted cavalry), settlers, both farmers and ranchers, and townsfolk.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{activity}} {{for which they}} are designed, some types of footwear may fit into multiple categories. For example, <b>Cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> are considered boots, but may also be worn in more formal occasions and used as dress shoes. Hiking boots incorporate many of the protective features of boots, but also provide the extra flexibility and comfort of many athletic shoes. Flip-flops are considered casual footwear, but have also been worn in formal occasions, such as visits to the White House.|$|E

50|$|The modern {{riding boot}} is {{relatively}} low-heeled, with a heel {{of less than}} one inch, though historically a higher heel was common, as {{it has always been}} critically important for riding boots to prevent the foot from slipping through the stirrup. Today, only some styles of <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot</b> retain a higher heel than other modern riding boots.|$|R
25|$|A {{ceremony}} was held outside Houston City Hall on December 16, 2005 to officially announce the franchise's arrival. Mayor Bill White joined city council members, Harris County officials, local soccer organizers and fans in welcoming team coach Dominic Kinnear and players Pat Onstad and Wade Barrett with <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> and hats. It was disclosed {{that the team}} would train and play at the University of Houston's Robertson Stadium on a three-year lease with the university earning {{a percentage of the}} revenues from concessions, parking and other sources.|$|E
25|$|Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. <b>Cowboy</b> <b>boots,</b> {{which have}} pointed toes and higher heels than a {{traditional}} riding boot, {{are designed to}} prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged—most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes {{both men and women}} wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.|$|E
25|$|The {{long history}} of the West in popular culture tends to define those clothed in Western {{clothing}} as cowboys or cowgirls whether they have ever been on a horse or not. This is especially true when applied to entertainers {{and those in the}} public arena who wear western wear as part of their persona. However, the reality is that many people, particularly in the West, including lawyers, bankers, and other white collar professionals wear elements of Western clothing, particularly <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> or hats, as a matter of form even though they have other jobs. Conversely, some people raised on ranches do not necessarily define themselves cowboys or cowgirls unless they feel their primary job is to work with livestock or if they compete in rodeos.|$|E
40|$|Rather {{than take}} the tourist or the tourist {{place as the}} {{starting}} point of analysis, in this article, I begin with a seemingly superficial souvenir object, the Texan <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot,</b> in order to trace a more complex picture of the material cultures of tourism. I describe the Texan boot at the intersection of three threads: historical legacies, materialities of animal encounters and a political economy of 2 ̆ 7 things 2 ̆ 7 (including their composite materials). The iconic Texas <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot</b> is a mythological but very material object of mobility - made by hand, with wild cowboy flair, by (mostly) Mexican artisans who use slowly accrued haptic skills with a variety of leathers to assemble neocolonial, hyper-masculine artefacts of fashion, fable and travel. Drawing on archival work and interviews in bootmaking workshops, I unravel a historical cultural economy of material production and consumption that entangles animal skins, migrant workers, Western movie stars and tourists...|$|R
5000|$|... "Up and in": Mistakenly {{thought to}} be {{originated}} by World Champion Mike Massey, this shot has much earlier origins, and was done in 1980 in Sweden by European champion Bengt Jonasson of Stockholm. He showed it to the gentleman of the American team (Paul Gerni, Jim Rempe, and Mike Sigel) in an exhibition prior to the 1980 Swedish Open in Gothenburg, using a wooden shoe instead of a floppy <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot,</b> and prompting both Gerni and Rempe {{to stop at the}} gift shop at the Amsterdam airport {{on the way back to}} pick up some wooden shoes. In this shot, the cue ball is jumped off the table into a wooden shoe (a <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot</b> for Massey, 25 years later) on the floor, which made a nice [...] "klack" [...] sound in the case of the wooden shoe. In the U.S., the wooden shoe shot is sometimes referred to as [...] "the boot shot".|$|R
50|$|Riding boots {{had been}} a part of equestrian life for centuries. Until the {{industrial}} age, boots were individually handmade in many different styles, depending on culture. Early <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot</b> designs, along with other cowboy accoutrements, were also heavily influenced by the vaquero tradition imported from Spain to the Americas, dating back to the early 16th century. Military boots designed for cavalry riders also had an influence.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, men's shoes have {{featured}} lower heels than most women's shoes. Some attribute it to Napoleon who disliked high heels; {{others to the}} general trend of minimizing non-functional items in men's clothing. <b>Cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> remain a notable exception, {{and they continue to}} be made with a taller riding heel. The two-inch (5cm) Cuban heel featured in many styles of men's boot derives its heritage from certain Latino roots, most notably various forms of Spanish and Latin American dance, including flamenco, as most recently evidenced by Joaquín Cortés. Cuban heels were first widely popularized by Beatle boots (variant of the Chelsea boot), as worn by the English rock group the Beatles during their introduction to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Other {{items are}} made from {{materials}} such as wood, leather and paper. Wood items include furniture, toys and musical instruments, especially guitars and violins and include miniature musical instruments, which are made in San Joaquín. Leather is fashioned into belts, pistol holders, handbags, wallets and <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots.</b> These are mostly available in CadereytaLanda de Matamoros and San Vicente Ferrer in the municipality of El Marqués. Cardboard is used to fashion masks and items related to mojiganga theater mostly for use in parades and traditional festivals. Mojiganga figures are made with a reed frame to which the cardboard is applied. Bernal is noted for its masks made of paper and plaster which are often molded. In the city of Querétaro they make masks and mojiganga items, as well as large paper sculptures such as the Judas figures, which are burned.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years, Freedman {{and his wife}} Carolyn were one of its attractions, wearing [...] "matching white, leather outfits, replete with {{identical}} <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots</b> and hats". Freedman offered Carolyn's father Nathan a 5% stake in Sands but he declined the offer.|$|E
50|$|During {{the cattle}} drive era of 1866-1884, the cowboy was not apt to ruin a good pair of dress boots while working, but some owned more {{decorative}} dress boots to wear in town. The basic style elements permeated even working boots, {{and made the}} Wellington obsolete. Fashion magazines from 1850 and 1860 show the <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot</b> with topstitching, cutouts of geometric or other natural elements and underslung heel.|$|R
50|$|However, some {{individuals}} also are unaccustomed to the slight slippage of the heel in a new, non-laced <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot,</b> particularly with a cowboy heel, {{and buy a}} too-small boot {{in an attempt to}} stop this slippage. But a small amount of slippage is also normal at first. This slippage is caused by the stiffness of a new boot's sole. As the sole becomes more flexible, the slippage will decrease.|$|R
25|$|Chesney didn't {{acknowledge}} the injury {{during the early}} part of his performance. However, he was visibly limping and seemed to rest near a drum riser while leaning over and holding his knee during the instrumental breaks of his hit songs. As he came offstage, a doctor from the University of South Carolina cut off Chesney’s <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot</b> and immediately began treating the foot injury. X-rays that were taken afterwards revealed several crushed bones in his right foot.|$|R
500|$|King {{initially}} cited Donald DeFreeze, primary kidnapper of Patty Hearst, as {{his inspiration}} for Flagg. Later, he attributed Flagg to {{an image of}} a man walking the roads in <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots,</b> denim jeans, and a jacket, a notion which [...] "came out of nowhere" [...] when he was in college. Flagg's character and the nature of his evil {{have been the subject of}} considerable critical attention.|$|E
500|$|The {{matching}} lilac jackets, made by McCartney's next-door neighbour in Liverpool {{to be worn}} as stage clothes, {{were soon}} threadbare, as were any other items of clothing, so the group bought <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots,</b> jeans and black leather jackets and trousers, from Paul Hundertmark's (Spielbudenplatz 9) and a tailor's shop at Thadenstrasse 6. Lennon said: [...] "We had a bit more money the second time so we bought leather pants ... we looked like four Gene Vincents.|$|E
500|$|During his NFL career, Youngblood {{partnered with}} Los Angeles Rams {{teammate}} Larry Brooks to open [...] "The Wild Bunch" [...] in 1980, a western clothing store that featured high-end western wear, including <b>cowboy</b> <b>boots,</b> cowboy hats, silver belt buckles, jeans, and other country apparel. Additionally, while still active with the Rams, Youngblood worked with BankAmericard, {{in a public}} relations capacity. He also owned and operated the South Coast Club in Huntington Beach, California, during his career.|$|E
60|$|The morning passed, with Wade slowly {{climbing}} {{to the edge}} of the black timber. Then, in a hollow where a spring gushed forth, he saw the tracks of a few cattle that had halted to drink, and on top of these the tracks of a horse with a crooked left front shoe. The rider of this horse had dismounted. There was an imprint of a <b>cowboy's</b> <b>boot,</b> and near it little sharp circles with dots in the center.|$|R
5000|$|The risk {{of being}} dragged by a foot caught in the stirrup spawned an {{adaptation}} in riding footwear: Riding boots have a raised heel {{of at least a}} half-inch, and in special designs like the western <b>cowboy</b> <b>boot,</b> often more. This [...] "ridge" [...] created by the raised heel will usually catch {{on the bottom of the}} stirrup, preventing the foot from slipping through the stirrup and dragging the rider. Riding boots also have a smooth sole that can easily slide in and out of the stirrup.|$|R
