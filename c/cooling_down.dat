5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} {{considered}} to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption. About 20% of this is residual heat from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to heating up or <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> fluids {{in just a}} single phase, heat exchangers can be used either to heat a liquid to evaporate (or boil) it or used as condensers to cool a vapor and condense it to a liquid. In chemical plants and refineries, reboilers used to heat incoming feed for distillation towers are often heat exchangers.|$|E

25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). Steeping too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the steeping technique. Two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water as you drink the tea.|$|E
25|$|Observations of the Red Spot Jr. storm suggest Jupiter {{could be}} in a period of global climate change. This is {{hypothesized}} to be part of an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in Jupiter's atmosphere. These vortices facilitate the heat exchange between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, heat exchange is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> and the equator region heating up. The resulting large temperature differential destabilizes the atmosphere and thereby leads to the creation of new vortices.|$|E

25|$|To {{secure a}} supply of rock salt the factory founders Vorster and Grüneberg {{acquired}} an salt mine in Staßfurt near Magdeburg. The area was known for its deposits of a double salt, a compound of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride named carnallite after its discoverer, the Prussian mining engineer Rudolf von Carnall. The new salt mine Vorster & Grüneberg was rich in deposits of carnallite. Grüneberg developed a new chemical process to produce potassium chloride from carnallite. Initially the carnallite was transported from Staßfurt to Kalk where it was dissolved in a current of stream and after <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> the carnallite crystallized to obtain potassium chloride. To reduce transport costs the two founders decided to build two potassium chloride factories in Staßfurt and Leopoldshall where they had acquired a second salt mine.|$|E
25|$|The French-Prussian {{treaty of}} 1678 meant that Sobieski lost the major foreign ally for his planned {{campaign}} against Prussia; consequently {{he started to}} distance himself from the pro-French faction, which in turn resulted in the <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> of the Polish-French relations. During the Sejm of 1683, the French ambassador was expelled for involvement with a plan to dethrone Sobieski, definitely marking the end of the Polish-French alliance. At the same time Sobieski made peace with the pro-Habsburg faction and started to gravitate towards an alliance with Austria. This did not end the existence of strong internal opposition to Sobieski; however, it changed a number of allegiances, and further opposition was temporarily weakened through the king's successful political maneuvering, including granting the Grand Hetman office to one of the opposition's chief leaders, Stanisław Jan Jabłonowski.|$|E
25|$|Moose also eat many aquatic plants, {{including}} lilies and pondweed. Moose {{are excellent}} swimmers and {{are known to}} wade into water to eat aquatic plants. This trait serves a second purpose in <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> the moose on summer days and ridding itself of black flies. Moose are thus attracted to marshes and river banks during warmer months as both provide suitable vegetation to eat and water to wet themselves in. Moose {{have been known to}} dive underwater to reach plants on lake bottoms, and the complex snout may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are the only deer that are capable of feeding underwater. As an adaptation for feeding on plants underwater, the nose is equipped with fatty pads and muscles that close the nostrils when exposed to water pressure, preventing water from entering the nose. Other species can pluck plants from the water too, but these need to raise their heads in order to swallow.|$|E

40|$|Vacuum {{breakdowns}} {{are major}} limiting {{factor for the}} development of the compactparticle accelerators. Further progress in this domain requires studies of thevacuum breakdowns in well controlled environment, where all important parameters,like mate- rial temperature, can be regulated. Cryocooled DC spark system is one ofthe projects that addresses these demands and it is first setup where temperaturewill be controlled through a wide range, from room temperatures all the way downto 4 K. The main topics of this project are simulations of the <b>cool</b> <b>down</b> time of thepulsed DC system done in the physics simulation software COMSOL. The simulationresults are bench- marked through theoretical calculations. Two design aresimulated and compared, one with a simpli?ed geometry and one with the modelimported from CAD.

25|$|A DAC {{consists}} of two opposing diamonds with a sample compressed between the polished culets (tips). Pressure may be monitored using a reference material whose behavior under pressure is known. Common pressure standards include ruby fluorescence, and various structurally simple metals, such as copper or platinum. The uniaxial pressure supplied by the DAC may be transformed into uniform hydrostatic pressure using a pressure-transmitting medium, such as argon, xenon, hydrogen, helium, paraffin oil or a mixture of methanol and ethanol. The pressure-transmitting medium is enclosed by a gasket and the two diamond anvils. The sample can be viewed through the diamonds and illuminated by X-rays and visible light. In this way, X-ray diffraction and fluorescence; optical absorption and photoluminescence; Mössbauer, Raman and Brillouin scattering; positron annihilation and other signals can be measured from materials under high pressure. Magnetic and microwave fields can be applied externally to the cell allowing nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and other magnetic measurements. Attaching electrodes to the sample allows electrical and magnetoelectrical measurements as well as heating up the sample to a few thousand degrees. Much higher temperatures (up to 7000 K) can be achieved with laser-induced heating, and <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> to millikelvins has been demonstrated.|$|E

500|$|The clay for {{the bricks}} was dug from river banks (of the Waal, Rhine, and IJssel rivers) and other open-air locations, and was left outside (in a mound called the kleibult) {{through the winter}} so that any organic {{material}} could decay; the weather (rain, frost, drought) helped make the clay more manageable. At {{the end of this}} period the clay was mixed with sand and other materials, a process done by foot, by workers stomping on the clay. It was then molded into the proper shape by an artisan, the tichelaar ("brickmaker"). Children handed the brickmaker the raw material and removed the shaped bricks. Child labor was common in the industry: until well into the nineteenth century children eight years old and younger worked 16 hours per day, and children four years old stacked and carried bricks for hours at a stretch. Molds were moistened with water and strewn with sand to enable the shaped brick to be more easily removed.
