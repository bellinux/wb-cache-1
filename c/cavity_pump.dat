50|$|A {{progressive}} <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a type}} {{of positive}} displacement pump and is also known as a progressing <b>cavity</b> <b>pump,</b> progg <b>cavity</b> <b>pump,</b> eccentric screw pump or <b>cavity</b> <b>pump.</b> It transfers fluid by means of the progress, through the pump, of a sequence of small, fixed shape, discrete cavities, as its rotor is turned. This leads to the volumetric flow rate being proportional to the rotation rate (bidirectionally) and to low levels of shearing being applied to the pumped fluid. Hence these pumps have application in fluid metering and pumping of viscous or shear-sensitive materials. The cavities taper down toward their ends and overlap with their neighbours, so that, in general, no flow pulsing is caused by the arrival of cavities at the outlet, other than that caused by compression of the fluid or pump components.|$|E
50|$|When the pumping {{application}} is not {{suited to a}} centrifugal pump, a progressive <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> is used instead. Progressive cavity pumps are single-screw types typically used in shallow wells or at the surface. This pump is mainly used on surface applications where the pumped fluid may contain {{a considerable amount of}} solids such as sand and dirt. The volumetric efficiency and mechanical efficiency of a progressive <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> increases as the viscosity of the liquid does.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 111 The {{design and}} {{construction}} of progressing <b>cavity</b> <b>pumps</b> permits them to pump virtually any fluid from clean, low viscosity fluids like oil or water, to delicate products like whole cherries, to very abrasive, highly viscous fluids. Progressing <b>cavity</b> <b>pumps</b> use a single threaded rotor rolling eccentrically in a double threaded helix with a pitch length twice that of the rotor. This combination results {{in a series of}} sealed cavities 180 degrees apart that progress from the suction end to the discharge end of the stator, as the rotor rotates. As one cavity is closing, the other is opening at exactly the same rate so the sum of the two discharges is constant. The result is pulsationless flow without the use of valves. This makes the progressing cavity concept ideal for metering applications or other applications where predictable flowrates are essential. The primary focus herein on the proper selection of progressing <b>cavity</b> <b>pumps</b> for different types of applications.

40|$|During this quarter, the {{majority}} of activity focused on grout emplacement at the Lodestar Energy Inc. (formerly Costain Coal Co.) surface mine auger holes described in the previous report. Specifically, {{two different types of}} grout pumps were investigated: a piston pump used in previous demonstrations, and a progressive <b>cavity</b> <b>pump.</b> The latter is currently utilized for grouting in underground coal mines, is relatively small and portable, and is capable of receiving dry material (e. g., fly ash) and water, mixing it to produce a grout, and pumping the grout at high pressure. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate it`s potential use in auger mine filling. Several field demonstrations were conducted using the different pumps. Numerous problems were encountered when using the progressive <b>cavity</b> <b>pump,</b> all of which were related to its inability to handle the highly reactive and heterogeneous FBC fly ash. Even relatively small ash agglomerates (< 1 in. in diameter), which were not a problem for the larger piston pump, caused blockages in the progressive <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> which not only proved extremely difficult to clear, but also resulted in significant mechanical failures. Furthermore, mixing of dry fly ash with water within the progressive <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> was inconsistent and difficult to control. Consequently, the pump was unable to completely fill even a single auger hole. It was found that a large proportion of bed ash in the grout generated a large amount of heat and caused early stiffening of the material. During the experiments, cylinders of grout were prepared for compressive strength testing, and moisture contents were determined on-site. A thermocouple assembly was also constructed to record grout temperatures within an auger hole...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressing}} <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a type}} {{of positive}} displacement pump that is capable of moving nearly any fluid. This type of pump transports fluids in a series of discrete cavities formed by the helical geometries of its rigid rotor and elastomeric stator. With appropriate materials for the rotor and stator, this pump can move combinations of liquids, suspended solids, and gasses equally well. Because of its versatility, the progressing <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> is widely used in the oil industry to transport mixtures of oil, water, and sediment; this investigation was prompted by a desire to extend the use of progressing cavity pumps to wet gas pumping applications. One of the progressing cavity pump's limitations is that the friction between the rotor and stator can generate enough heat to damage the rotor if the pump is not lubricated and cooled by the process fluid. Conventional wisdom dictates that this type of pump will overheat if it pumps only gas, with no liquid in the process fluid. If a progressing <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> is used to boost the output from a wet gas well, it could potentially be damaged if the well's output is too dry {{for an extended period of}} time. This project seeks to determine how a progressing <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> behaves when operating at gas volume fractions between 0. 90 and 0. 98. A progressing <b>cavity</b> <b>pump</b> manufactured by seepex, model no. BN 130 - 12, is tested at half and full speed using air-water mixtures with gas volume fractions of 0. 90, 0. 92, 0. 94, 0. 96, and 0. 98. The pump's inlet and outlet conditions are controlled to produce suction pressures of 15, 30, and 45 psi and outlet pressures 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 psi higher than the inlet pressure. A series of thermocouples, pressure transducers, and turbine flow meters measures the pump's inlet and outlet conditions, the flow rates of water and air entering the pump, and pressures and temperatures at four positions within the pump's stator. Over all test conditions, the maximum recorded temperature of the pump stator did not exceed the maximum safe rubber temperature specified by the manufacturer. The pump?s flow rate is independent of both the fluid's gas volume fraction and the pressure difference across the pump, but it increases slightly with the pump's suction pressure. The pump's mechanical load, however, is dependent only on the pressure difference across the pump and increases linearly with that parameter. Pressure measurements within the stator demonstrated that the leakage between the pump's cavities increases with the fluids gas volume fraction, indicating that liquid inside the pump improves its sealing capability. However, those same measurements failed to detect any appreciable leakage between the two pressure taps nearest the pump's inlet. This last observation suggests that the pump could be shortened by as much as 25 percent without losing any performance in the range of tested conditions; shortening the pump should increase its efficiency by decreasing its frictional mechanical load...|$|E
