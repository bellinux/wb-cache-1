5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (<b>capitalism)</b> <b>in</b> 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E
5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all {{charges against him}} but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work {{he noted that the}} rise of industrial <b>capitalism</b> <b>in</b> Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E
5000|$|For Marx, labor <b>in</b> <b>capitalism</b> “must exist <b>in</b> {{the form}} of value” and “necessarily appears {{in a form that}} both expresses and veils it.” When Marx {{contrasts}} social labor and private labor, he did not mean a contrast between the transhistorical category of labor and the specifically capitalist type of labor, or a contrast of essence and appearance, but “two moments of labor <b>in</b> <b>capitalism</b> itself.” Labor <b>in</b> <b>capitalism</b> is, according to Postone, [...] "directly social" [...] because it [...] "acts as a socially mediating activity". An adequate analysis of capitalism is possible [...] "only if it proceeds from an analysis of the historically specific character of labor in capitalism" ...|$|R

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market <b>capitalism.</b> <b>In</b> the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{began his}} {{studies of the}} subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of <b>Capitalism,</b> <b>in</b> which {{he argued that the}} {{redefinition}} of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of calling). The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
5000|$|According to Marx, <b>in</b> <b>capitalism,</b> {{improvements}} <b>in</b> {{technology and}} rising levels of productivity {{increase the amount}} of material wealth (or use values) in society while simultaneously diminishing the economic value of this wealth, thereby lowering the rate of profit—a tendency that leads to the paradox, characteristic of crises <b>in</b> <b>capitalism,</b> of [...] "reserve army of labour" [...] and of “poverty in the midst of plenty”, or more precisely, crises of overproduction in the midst of underconsumption.|$|R

5|$|Many scholars, however, have {{disagreed}} with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis. For example, the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism {{did not begin}} with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy. In Milan, Venice and Florence, the small city-state governments {{led to the development}} of the earliest forms of <b>capitalism.</b> <b>In</b> the 16th century, Antwerp was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been pointed out that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland. Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the labour theory of value.|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over <b>capitalism.</b> <b>In</b> recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been {{controlled}} by many groups, from the Brigantes, the largest Brythonic kingdom of Great Britain, to the Romans, to Anglo-Saxons, Celts and Danes. After the Norman conquest in 1066, the Harrying of the North brought destruction. The area experienced Anglo-Scottish border fighting until {{the unification of}} Britain under the Stuarts, with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the Industrial Revolution began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles {{of many of the}} political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, from trade unionism to Manchester <b>Capitalism.</b> <b>In</b> the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by heavy industry such as weaving, shipbuilding, steelmaking and mining. The deindustrialisation that followed {{in the second half of}} the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in Southern England.|$|E

50|$|Several major {{challenges}} to <b>capitalism</b> appeared <b>in</b> {{the early part}} of the 20th century. The Russian revolution in 1917 established the first socialist state in the world; a decade later, the Great Depression triggered increasing criticism of the existing capitalist system. One response to this crisis was a turn to fascism, an ideology which advocated state-influenced capitalism; whilst others rejected <b>capitalism</b> altogether <b>in</b> favor of communist or socialist ideologies.|$|R
5|$|As UN {{air raids}} against the North Koreans intensified, Dean {{was moved to}} Sunan, north of P'yongyang, to a hut where he lived with several guards. They began daily interrogations {{primarily}} aimed at forcing military intelligence from him or making him sign a written condemnation of the UN intervention in Korea, but Dean adamantly refused to do so. Senior North Korean military leaders continued such interrogations through October 1950 but eventually gave up when Dean would not cooperate and was not intimidated by their threats. Dean continued to suffer from illness related to poor food {{but he was not}} given another interpreter and was not interrogated after October 1950. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did not cooperate but he was never actually tortured. Dean took to playing chess with his guards often and he was allowed to exercise daily. He was kept alone, however, and was never with other American prisoners for the remainder of his confinement. Dean later wrote extensively of his capture and imprisonment in his 1973 autobiography, General Dean's Story. He claimed the North Koreans considered him a war criminal and had many discussions with him about the problems with <b>capitalism</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of <b>capitalism</b> <b>in</b> his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E

In other words, the Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern <b>capitalism.</b> <b>In</b> his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses Lutherans (especially Pietists, but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, and Moravians (specifically referring to the Herrnhut-based community under Count von Zinzendorf's spiritual lead).|$|E
