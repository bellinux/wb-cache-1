5|$|Technical {{analysis}} shows extensive underdrawing, typical for Memling. They were completed {{in a dry}} medium except for the dove and the flask and <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> the sideboard. Revisions during the final painting included the enlargement of the Virgin's sleeves and the repositioning of Gabriel's staff. Incisions were made to indicate the floor tiles and the dove's position.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin and Child at the {{forefront}} might represent the background statues coming to life; at the time such an apparition was considered the highest form of pilgrimage experience. Their poses are similar and her tall crown is typical of those seen on statues rather than either royalty or painted figures of the Virgin. Harbison further suggests that the two pools {{of light on the}} floor echo the two <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> either side of one of the statues, and notes that the copies described below retain the prayer tablet, one bringing it nearer to the foreground.|$|E

5|$|Several legends about Jovan Vladimir {{have been}} {{recorded}} in western Macedonia. One has it that, after he was beheaded, he brought {{his head to the}} Monastery of StJohn of Bigor. On a hill above the village of Pesočani in the Municipality of Debarca, there is a locality called Vladimirovo, at which some ruins can be seen. The locals claimed that Vladimir was born there, and brought his severed head there. The Church of StAthanasius near Pesočani, now in ruins, is reputed to have been built by Vladimir. People from the region gathered there each year {{on the eve of his}} feast day. They lit <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> the remains of the church's walls, and prayed to the saint. Tradition has it that the Monastery of StNaum had a bell tower named after the saint, in the foundation of which a portion of his relics was placed.|$|E
5|$|The Germans placed <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> their {{trenches}} and on Christmas trees, {{then continued}} the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery {{in the region}} fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.|$|E

25|$|Although {{many members}} of the Church of England today would still be uncomfortable or sceptical about certain Catholic liturgical practices, they can be {{astonished}} to be told that, in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> the altar and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the Eucharist could spark riots, put priests in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the prosecution of a bishop – Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantine Christian {{observance}} of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, begins on Thursday {{night with the}} Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels. Scattered throughout this Matins service are twelve readings from {{all four of the}} Gospels which recount the events of the Passion from the Last Supper through the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.|$|E
25|$|The <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> a {{birthday}} cake in one memory indicate {{that she is}} about five years old when first introduced. By {{the time of the}} Dream story arc, she claims to be 902. In Sailor Moon Crystal, it is stated clearly that she is 900 years old. She seems to be the equivalent of a 7 or 8 year old when she returns later. In the manga, after the Infinity Dream story arc, its mentioned she is in second grade; in the Stars story arc, she is in sixth grade; in the Sailor Moon Parallel story arc, she is in the ninth grade.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the arrival of Fr. Hermon Griswold Batterson in 1869 that the parish {{increasingly}} came to be influenced by the theology of the Oxford Movement. During Fr. Batterson's time as rector, the parish adopted many of the liturgical practices associated with the Catholic Revival then taking place within the Church of England. These changes, which included liturgical practices such as the wearing of colored chasubles and stoles, placing lit <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> the altar during Mass, and genuflecting before the Blessed Sacrament, together with new theological emphases, including the encouragement of private auricular confession and absolution and encouraging prayer for the dead, were not uncontroversial.|$|E

25|$|Donald (Stephen Merchant) and Emily (Halle Berry) {{are on a}} date {{together}} at a Mexican restaurant. Tired of typical first dates, Emily challenges Donald to a game of truth or dare. She dares him to grab a man's buttocks, and he follows with daring her to blow out the birthday <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> a blind boy's cake. The game rapidly escalates to extremes, in which both of them get plastic surgery and tattoos, and humiliate themselves. When Donald and Emily arrive back at Emily's apartment, they praise their date. Donald tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming she's not attracted to Asian men (which he was surgically altered to resemble). It is revealed that she was joking and invites him {{to have sex with}} her as she shows him her enlarged breasts.|$|E
25|$|The unnamed {{narrator is}} brought to trial before {{sinister}} judges of the Spanish Inquisition. Poe provides no explanation of why he is there or of the charges on which he is being tried. Before him are seven tall white <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> a table, and, as they burn down, his hopes of survival also diminish. He is condemned to death, whereupon he faints and later awakens to find himself in a totally dark room. At first the prisoner thinks that he is locked in a tomb, but then he discovers {{that he is in}} a cell. He decides to explore the cell by placing a scrap of his robe against the wall so that he can count the paces around the room, but he faints before he can measure the whole perimeter.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, Lucy (called Lucia) is venerated on 13 December in a {{ceremony}} where a girl is elected to portray Lucia. Wearing a white gown with a red sash and a crown of <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> her head, she walks {{at the head of}} a procession of women, each holding a candle. The candles symbolize the fire that refused to take St. Lucy's life when she was sentenced to be burned. The women sing a Lucia song while entering the room, to the melody of the traditional Neapolitan song Santa Lucia; the Italian lyrics describe the view from Santa Lucia in Naples, the various Scandinavian lyrics are fashioned for the occasion, describing the light with which Lucia overcomes the darkness. Each Scandinavian country has lyrics in their native tongues. After finishing this song, the procession sings Christmas carols or more songs about Lucia.|$|E

25|$|On October 22, 2014, {{the federal}} {{government}} stated that Abarca had ordered the arrest {{of the students in}} order to prevent them from obstructing a municipal event. The PGR described him and his wife as the probable masterminds of the mass kidnapping. The director of the Iguala police force, Felipe Flores, was also mentioned as one of the main perpetrators. In Mexico City over 50,000 protesters demonstrated in support of the missing students. Joining the protests in Morelia, Michoacán, were members of Mexico's movie industry – actors, directors, writers and producers- who lit 43 <b>candles</b> <b>on</b> the steps of a Morelia theater. In Venezuela, students also demonstrated in support at the Central University of Venezuela. In the U.S. state of Texas, students and professors rallied at the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso. The name of each disappeared student was read out and signatures were gathered for an open letter of protest to the Mexican consulate. Protests also took place in London, Paris, Vienna and Buenos Aires.|$|E
