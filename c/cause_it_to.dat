5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E

5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|Exposure {{to light}} is {{detrimental}} to the stability of aqueous solutions of psilocybin, and will <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> rapidly oxidize—an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, needle-like crystalline powder with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E

5|$|The cap {{flesh is}} {{composed}} of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and hairy upper layer, and a thick, soft, white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem is similarly divided, with a thin, dark and hairy cortical layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner ochre-colored flesh. A drop of potassium hydroxide applied {{to the surface of}} the mushroom will <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> instantly stain black.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy {{blue whale}} formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by {{expanding}} ice, {{and some have}} stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> have a relatively low genetic diversity.|$|E

5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave spawned Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 {{over the}} Lesser Antilles. Strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> dissipate on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 {{to the north}} of Bermuda. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 southwest of Newfoundland. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became extratropical on August 28. Tropical Storm Dean lightly affected Newfoundland, though no damages were reported.|$|E

5|$|Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented {{creatures that}} perish {{when all of}} their {{segments}} are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore {{the health of the}} player's creature, temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original worm-like creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Holman Hardt {{is actually the}} one controlling the weather. All of the bizarre weather was the side-effect of his long-silent love for Sheila. He felt guilty that his weather-related problem caused Mootz to crash his car, so he would <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> rain for Mootz. Once he realized Mootz had been drunk {{the night of the}} accident, however, he stopped. Unfortunately, Mulder begins to unintentionally attract Sheila, resulting in a massive thunderstorm that materializes due to the meteorologist's emotions. At the town's high school reunion, however, Hardt admits his love for Sheila, who accepts him. The storm stops, and Hardt and Sheila live happily ever after.|$|E
5|$|Once a neuron is in place, {{it extends}} {{dendrites}} and an axon {{into the area}} around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.|$|E
5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach {{themselves to}} the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them. The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and <b>cause</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> enter water, where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.|$|E
