5|$|Two {{years after}} {{the events of the}} first game, Max has been {{reinstated}} as a detective in the NYPD. Max is called on to investigate a gunfight at a warehouse owned by Max's old associate Vladimir Lem and discovers the place has been attacked by a group of hitmen called the <b>Cleaners.</b> He encounters Mona Sax, who was presumed dead {{at the end of the}} previous game. Max heads to a restaurant owned by Lem and rescues him from his old foe Vinnie Gognitti; Lem claims that Gognitti is trying to monopolize the black market gun trade and sees Lem as a threat. After evading an attack by the <b>Cleaners</b> in his Apartment, Max tracks Mona to an abandoned funhouse and learns that the <b>Cleaners</b> are after anyone who knows about the secretive Inner Circle. While attempting to track down a contact, Mona is arrested because of her crimes and is taken in to the police station, despite Max's protests.|$|E
5|$|While at the station, Max overhears his new partner, Valerie Winterson, {{talking on}} the phone about Mona. Suddenly, the station is {{attacked}} by the <b>Cleaners,</b> who are looking for Mona. Mona breaks out of her cell, and after fighting off the <b>Cleaners,</b> Max and Mona begin hunting down the people responsible for the attack. Their search leads them to a construction site, where he and Mona defend themselves against the <b>Cleaners.</b> After their foes leave, Winterson arrives and holds Mona at gunpoint. Mona claims that Winterson is there to kill her, while Winterson claims that she is simply trying to arrest a fleeing fugitive. After several moments of consideration, Max fatally shoots Winterson, allowing Mona to escape. Before she dies, Winterson shoots Max, hospitalizing him.|$|E

40|$|The <b>cleaner</b> fish Labroides dimidiatus {{affected}} the pigmented monogenean parasite Benedenia lolo on the fish Hemigymnus melapterus (Labridae) held in aquaria. The effect of <b>cleaner</b> fish varied {{with the size}} class of fish; only small fish [a posteriori size class 11 · 5 cm LS) was not affected by <b>cleaner</b> fish. The size-frequency distributions of monogeneans on both size-classes of H. melapterus were affected by <b>cleaner</b> fish. Fish exposed to <b>cleaner</b> fish had fewer large (> 3 mm) and more small (< 1 mm) monogeneans than fish not exposed to <b>cleaner</b> fish, suggesting <b>cleaner</b> fish selectively removed larger monogeneans. This difference was more pronounced on large fish. In the absence of <b>cleaner</b> fish, small fish had almost as many monogeneans as large fish; they also had more small monogeneans than the large fish, suggesting small fish were more vulnerable to infection by monogeneans than larger fish. This suggests that the <b>cleaner</b> fish L. dimidiatus {{has the potential to}} control benedeniine monogeneans on captive fish and highlights the importance of taking into account fish size in studies of the effect of <b>cleaner</b> fish on ectoparasites...|$|R

5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode <b>cleaners,</b> are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E

5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as <b>cleaners,</b> providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{attended}} Lafayette High School in Lexington, {{where he}} was a seventeen-time letterman in various sports. During one summer, his father expressed disappointment that he had decided to spend the summer selling vacuum <b>cleaners</b> instead of working on a road construction crew {{with the rest of his}} football teammates. Motivated by his father's disapproval, Brown averaged $1,000 in monthly commissions from vacuum cleaner sales. After high school, Brown matriculated to the University of Kentucky, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1957 and a law degree in 1960. While in law school, he made as much as $25,000 a year selling Encyclopædia Britannica sets, and employed a sales crew made up of classmates to increase his profits.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in the 1990s {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear scoops and nail <b>cleaners,</b> bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement was probably not a town.|$|E

5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum <b>cleaners,</b> and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E

25|$|A vacuum <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first vacuum <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} vacuum <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional vacuum <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first vacuum <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric vacuum <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized vacuum <b>cleaner</b> in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable vacuum <b>cleaner</b> was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|R
