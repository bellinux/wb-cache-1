40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to apply {{discourse}} analysis to the problems of improper tribute, and the solution through the legal figure of the refund of overpayment. The answers found in this analysis were applied in the elucidation of accounting procedures. We used descriptive research, legal dialectics and discourse analysis, along with aspects of tax accounting to address the identification of relevant aspects of the improper tax. The main base is discourse analysis to identify the problem of improper tax. The results show that, from the analysis of speech into five categories presented at the National Tax Code, it was possible to analyze the different discourses of the authors and researchers of the tax law. Face to Accounting Procedures Committee 25, it can be stated that the duly recognized and paid by the taxpayer undue tax regardless of its source for this payment does not constitute a <b>contingent</b> <b>asset...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{transition}} from an economy characterized by idiosyncratic income shocks and incomplete markets a la Aiyagari (1994) to markets where statecontingent assets are available but costly (in order to purchase a <b>contingent</b> <b>asset,</b> households {{have to pay a}} xed participation cost) leads to a large increase of wealth inequality. Using a standard calibration our model can match a Gini of 0. 93 close to the level of wealth inequality observed in the US. In addition, under this level of participation costs, wealth inequality is particularly sensitive to income inequality. We label this phenomenon as the Inequality Accelerator. We demonstrate how costly access to contingent asset-markets generates these e ects. The key insight stems from the non-monotonic relationship between wealth and desired degree of insurance, in an economy with participation costs. Poor borrowing constrained households remain uninsured, middle-class households are almost perfectly insured, while rich households decide to self-insure by purchasing risk-free assets. This feature of households' risk management has crucial e ects in asset prices, wealth inequality, and social mobility. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{extends the}} Robbins and Pearce (1992) {{two-stage}} turnaround response model to include governance factors. In addition to retrenchment and recovery, the paper proposes {{the addition of}} a realignment stage, referring specifically to the realignment of expectations of principal and agent groups. The realignment stage imposes a threshold that must be crossed before the retrenchment and hence recovery stage can be entered. Crossing this threshold is problematic {{to the extent that the}} interests of governance-stakeholder groups diverge in a crisis situation. The severity of the crisis impacts on the bases of strategy <b>contingent</b> <b>asset</b> valuation leading to the fragmentation of stakeholder interests. In some cases the consequence may be that management are prevented from carrying out turnarounds by governance constraints. The paper uses a case study to illustrate these dynamics, and like the Robbins and Pearce study, it focuses on the textile industry. A longitudinal approach is used to show the impact of the removal of governance constraints. The empirical evidence suggests that such financial constraints become less serious to the extent that there is a functioning market for corporate control. Building on governance research and turnaround literature, the paper also outlines the general case necessary and sufficient conditions for successful turnarounds.

There is an informative binary signal that arrives after {{each of the first}} eight trading rounds. In our baseline treatment the realization of the signal is public information, and in another treatment, market participants are randomly sequenced and receive the signal as private information. In the latter case, we observe zero information aggregation and prices lock in on home grown norms, which we call informational price cascades. We test the fragility of the price cascades in two further treatments. First, we break the monopoly on each signal by revealing it to two subjects, and then we increase that number to four. It is only when we inform four participants, or one-half of the market, that cascades fail to form and information starts to aggregate in the market. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses <b>contingent</b> claim <b>asset</b> {{pricing and}} {{exploits}} capital structure priority {{to better understand}} the relation between corporate security returns and interest rate changes (i. e., duration). In particular, we show theoretically and, using a novel dataset, confirm empirically that lower priority securities in the capital structure, such as subordinated or distressed debt and equity, have low or even negative durations. The intuition is that the lower priority securities are effectively short higher priority, high duration fixed rate debt, i. e., they are short the bond market. This finding has important implications for interpreting existing results in the literature on such topics as (i) the time-varying correlation between the aggregate stock market and government bonds, (ii) the Fisher effect and inflation, (iii) the betas of corporate bonds, and (iv) the use of bond factors for multifactor asset pricing models and forecasting bond and stock returns...|$|R

40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{analyzes}} how default externalities {{lead to an}} excessive incidence of systemic private debt crises. An individual defaulting borrower does not internalize that her default leads to a depreciation in the exchange rate because international lenders will sell any seizable assets and flee the country. The exchange rate depreciation in turn reduces the value of non-tradable collateral and induces other borrowers to default, leading to a chain reaction of defaults. The inefficiency of default spillovers can be corrected by strengthening the enforcement of creditor rights, so that private individual borrowers have less incentives to default, reducing the incidence of systemic default episodes. The second chapter analyzes the implications of developing financial markets for <b>contingent</b> <b>assets</b> {{on the degree of}} risk sharing, the incidence of systemic financial crises and credit externalities through collateral prices in emerging economies with limited access to international capital markets. We find that, in an environment with persistent shocks and collateral constraints, even though agents cannot engage in full risk sharing, access to state <b>contingent</b> <b>assets</b> improves the degree of hedging, reduces the need for precautionary savings and lowers the incidence of financial crises. In addition, it further reduces the spillover effect of credit externalities by dampening the effect of an individual's borrowing on the valuation of collateral of other borrowers...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} {{to study the}} effects of policies of uncertain duration on consumption dynamics under both complete and incomplete markets. We focus on the dynamic implications of market incompleteness, specifically on the lack of state-contingent bonds. Two policies are considered: pure output-increasing and tariff-reducing (trade liberalization). With complete markets, the output-increasing policy leads to flat consumption, whereas with no <b>contingent</b> <b>assets,</b> consumption jumps upward on the announcement of the policy, continues rising as long as the policy is in effect, and collapses when it is abandoned. A similar consumption path obtains in a trade liberalization in the realistic case of low elasticity of substitution and no rebate of tariffs.

40|$|The Obama {{administration}} {{has called for}} a heightened amount of transparency in financial reporting culminating from the recent debacle on Wall Street. Interestingly, as our economy wavers between recession and or depression, the worldwide economy is focused on gross domestic product or GDP which measures the total production and consumption of goods in our domestic economy (Curwood, 2004). How much transparency can there be reported when GDP does not include the costs of the 'greening of the economy?'

40|$|It is {{believed}} that a shock, common {{to a set of}} countries with identical fundamentals, has identical outcomes across countries. We show that in general, when specialization in production is such that a common shock creates a missing role for labor mobility across countries, the terms of trade of any country reacts to the shock. This is the case even if state <b>contingent</b> <b>assets</b> can be traded across countries. The transmission mechanism of a monetary shock in a monetary union has in this case an additional channel, the terms of trade. We also show that the country outcomes are significantly different, when compared with the effect of the shock on the union’s aggregate. Monetary shocks impose cycles with higher volatility in "poor" countries relatively o the volatility of "richer" ones. ...|$|E
