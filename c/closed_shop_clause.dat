50|$|After {{a three-month}} {{lull in the}} NRLB's activities, NLRB {{attorneys}} filed a brief with the Board accusing Glimco of having coerced taxicab drivers into joining the union and paying dues. The NLRB's investigator said Glimco had colluded with Yellow Cab and Checker Cab to negotiate and enforce <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> <b>clauses</b> in its collective bargaining agreements {{in violation of the}} Taft-Hartley Act. The investigator alleged that between $125,000 and $650,000 in dues were illegally collected, and demanded that Glimco refund these dues immediately. The 125-page brief led to a second investigation (this time into the making of loans out of union funds to local leaders in violation of the Landrum-Griffin Act) by Department of Labor attorneys. The new pressures on Glimco and Local 777 led to more death-threats against Abata and other DUOC leaders, On July 21, 1960, an NLRB trial examiner found that Glimco and Local 777 had indeed coerced taxicab drivers into joining the union, and ordered the refund of $750,000 in illegally obtained dues. Glimco immediately appealed the NLRB's order. He was granted a delay on May 30, 1961, and refunded dues to just four cab drivers by June.|$|R
5000|$|By 1994, 9 {{percent of}} {{collective}} bargaining agreements in Canada required the <b>closed</b> <b>shop,</b> while 42.3 percent required the union shop and 39.2 percent used the Rand formula.

5000|$|Dunn and Gennard found 111 United Kingdom {{cases of}} {{dismissals}} on {{the introduction of}} a <b>closed</b> <b>shop,</b> involving 325 individuals. They state [...] "While proponents of the <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> may argue that an estimated minimum 325 dismissals is a relatively small number compared with the total population covered by <b>closed</b> <b>shops,</b> critics would see the figure as substantial arguing that one dismissal is one too many." [...] In relation to the pre-entry <b>closed</b> <b>shop,</b> they state [...] "Its raison d'être is to exclude people from jobs by denying them union membership". [...] All forms of <b>closed</b> <b>shops</b> in the UK are illegal following the introduction of the Employment Act 1990. They were further curtailed under section 137(1)(a) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (c. 52) passed by the Conservative government at the time. The Labour Party, then in opposition, had supported <b>closed</b> <b>shops</b> until December 1989, when it abandoned the policy in accordance with European legislation. However, Labour shadow arts minister Thangam Debbonaire announced to an Equity conference in May 2016 that she favoured {{the introduction of a}} [...] "limited" [...] <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> for actors, as part of Jeremy Corbyn's pledge to strengthen and introduce a new package of employment rights beneficial to employees. Equity {{was one of the last}} trade unions in the United Kingdom to offer a pre-entry <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> until the 1990 act.|$|R
50|$|A {{pre-entry}} <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> (or simply <b>closed</b> <b>shop)</b> {{is a form}} {{of union}} security agreement under which the employer agrees to hire union members only, and employees must remain members of the union at all times in order to remain employed. This is different from a post-entry <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> (US: union shop), which is an agreement requiring all employees to join the union if they are not already members. In a union shop, the union must accept as a member any person hired by the employer.|$|R

In New Zealand, as of 1988, the <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> was compulsory where a union organized the workplace. In the Philippines, various types of union security agreements are permitted under labor law. In Mexico, the <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> was mandatory until the early 1990s, when a change in federal law permitted the union shop, agency shop, or no agreement at all. But because of the political ties between unions and the governing party in Mexico and other ways in which Mexican law favors established unions, the <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> is essentially still the norm.|$|R

40|$|Although the Conservative Party {{was always}} ideologically antipathetic towards {{compulsory}} trade union membership, {{in the guise}} of the ‘closed shop’, {{it was not until the}} 1980 s that it finally succeeded in outlawing this aspect of British trade unionism. Hitherto, the Conservatives had sought to secure a balance between two conflicting stances: instinctive and ideological abhorrence at the denial of individual liberty which the trade union <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> represented and pragmatic acceptance that the <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> could actually facilitate industrial order and stability, and that for this very reason, was often tacitly endorsed by many employers. Many Conservatives were also concerned that even if they did outlaw the <b>closed</b> <b>shop,</b> it was likely to be driven underground, whereupon even worse abuses might go undetected. Consequently, the post-war period until the election of the Thatcher Government was characterised by ongoing debates in the Conservative Party over how best to secure a balance between both individual liberty and industrial order and between a majority in a trade union supporting a <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> and a minority opposing it...|$|R
