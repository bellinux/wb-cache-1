40|$|International audienceBatch and <b>column</b> <b>tests</b> allowed {{estimation}} of the mobilization of pollution of standard domestic waste in leachate and biogas. Three laboratory tests (biochemical methane potential (BMP), tank leaching <b>test</b> (TLT), and <b>column</b> <b>tests)</b> have been applied to evaluate the emission of pollutants in liquid and/or gas phase from reconstituted municipal solid waste (MSW) {{on the basis of}} French waste. In the case of the batch tests (BMP and TLT), BMP tests indicated a maximum organic carbon share produced by waste (biogas potential) equal to 59 % of the initial carbon. The maximum quantity of carbon likely to be leached by the waste (TLT) corresponded to 6 % of the carbon contained in the waste. On the other hand, during <b>column</b> <b>tests,</b> 3. 3 % of carbon was leached and 8 % of carbon was evacuated in biogas {{at the end of a}} 440 -day follow-up. It thus appears that the test conditions have a great influence on the remobilization of pollution. In particular it has been proven than the greater the optimization of the liquid/solid ratio, the agitation, the sowing, and the temperature, the greater the pollutant is leached.

40|$|Transport of solute through soils is an {{important}} topic of current interest in groundwater hydrology and environmental geotechnics. Laboratory <b>column</b> <b>test</b> is usually conducted to determine transport parameters that are key to analytical solution of the advection-dispersion equation. Significant uncertainty often exists in the solute transport parameters, as they are obtained empirically through nonlinear curve-fitting of column lest data. In the present study, a series of probabilistic sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of transport parameter uncertainties on the effluent concentration ina <b>column</b> <b>test.</b> The probabilistic sensitivity analyses are performed using @Risk, a macro running on Excel, a popular spreadsheet program. @Risk allows the user to place a random variable in any spreadsheet cell.

40|$|Thin-walled steel {{sections}} {{made from}} high strength thin cold-reduced G 550 steel to Australian Standard AS 1397 - 1993 under compression are investigated experimentally and theoretically in this thesis. This thesis describes three series of compression tests performed on box-section stub columns, box-section long columns and lipped channel section columns cold-formed from {{high strength steel}} plates in 0. 42 mm or 0. 60 mm thickness with nominal yield stress of 550 MPa. The tests presented in this thesis formed part of an Australian Research Council research project entitled: Compression Stability of High Strength Steel Sections with Low Strain-Hardening. For the fix-ended stub <b>column</b> <b>tests,</b> a total of 94 lipped-square and hexagonal section stub <b>columns</b> were <b>tested</b> to study the influence of low strain hardening of G 550 steel on the compressive section capacities of the column members. For the pin-ended long <b>column</b> <b>tests,</b> a total of 28 box-section <b>columns</b> were <b>tested</b> to study the stability of members with sections which undergo local instability at loads significantly less than the ultimate loads. For the fix-ended lipped channel section columns, a total of 21 stub and long <b>columns</b> were <b>tested</b> to study the failure resulting from local and distortional buckling with interaction between the modes. A numerical simulation on the three series of tests using the commercial finite element computer program ABAQUS is also presented {{as part of this}} thesis. The post-buckling behaviour of thin-walled compression members is investigated. The effect of changing variables, such as geometric imperfections and end boundary conditions is also investigated. The ABAQUS analysis gives accurate simulations of the tests and is in good agreement to the experimental results. Theoretical studies using finite strip methods are presented in this thesis to investigate the buckling behaviour of cold-formed members in compression. The theoretical studies provide valuable information on the local and distortional buckling stresses for use in the interaction buckling studies. The finite strip models used are the semi-analytical and spline models. As expected for the stub <b>columns</b> <b>tests,</b> the greatest effect of low strain hardening was for the stockier sections where material properties play an important role. For the more slender sections where elastic local buckling and post-local buckling are more important, the effect of low strain hardening {{does not appear to be}} as significant. The pin-ended and fix-ended long <b>column</b> <b>tests</b> show that interaction, which is between local and overall buckling in the box sections, and between local and distortional buckling in the open channel sections, has a significant effect on their member capacities. The results of the successful <b>column</b> <b>tests</b> and ABAQUS simulation have been compared with the design procedures in the Australian & New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures AS&NZS 4600 and the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members prepared by the American Iron and Steel Institute. The stub <b>column</b> <b>tests</b> show that the current design rules give too conservative predictions on the compressive section capacities of the column members; whereas the long <b>column</b> <b>tests</b> show that the current column design rules are unconservative if used in their current form for G 550 steel.

Semi‐volatile organic compounds in leachates from reclaimed asphalt pavement, measured in field samples and in laboratory <b>column</b> <b>test,</b> were analysed through a GC/MS screen‐test methodology. Sixteen PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) were also analysed in leachates from the column study. The highest concentrations of semi‐volatile compounds, ‐ 400 μg 1 ‐ 1, were measured in field samples from the scarified stockpile. Naphthalene, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) were the most dominant of the identified semi‐volatiles. The occurrence of these compounds in urban groundwater, also indicate high emission rates and persistent structures of the compounds, making them potentially hazardous. Car exhausts, rubber tires and the asphalt material itself are all probable emission sources, determined from the organic contaminants released from the stockpiles. The major leaching mechanism indicated was dissolution of organic contaminants {{from the surface of}} the asphalt gravels. In the laboratory <b>column</b> <b>test,</b> the release of high‐molecular weight and more toxic PAH was higher in the leachates after two years than at the commencement of storage. The concentrations of semi‐volatiles in leachates, were also several times lower than those from the field stockpile.

30|$|Figure  11 c {{shows that}} the growth curves of {{suspended}} biomass varied with time. One indicator of the increased biomass growth was the concentration of suspended biomass in the effluent. The concentration of initial suspended biomass was set at 4.8  mg VSS L− 1 that was experimentally determined {{at the start of}} continuous-flow <b>column</b> <b>test.</b> In the beginning of the <b>column</b> <b>test,</b> the concentration of suspended biomass dropped abruptly and then started to increase with time due to the dilute-in characteristics (Gaudy and Gaudy 1980). The general trend of the effluent for suspended biomass concentration in model prediction was similar to the experimental results obtained from the <b>column</b> <b>test.</b> The model-predicted and experimental results show that there was no significant degradation of 2 -CP by suspended biomass for the first 5  days. The growth rate of suspended biomass rapidly increased at a transient-state condition from 5 to 27  days. At this period, the suspended biomass vigorously degraded 2 -CP. Since the amount of 2 -CP available during bioregeneration was higher than after bioregeneration of activated carbon, the growth rate of suspended biomass during this period should have been higher than that at the steady-state level. The growth curve of suspended biomass showed a peak at 27  days during bioregeneration. The concentration of suspended biomass in effluent was approximately 25.3  mg VSS L− 1 at the steady state. The model predicted the experimental result well with a reduced root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of 0.239.|$|E

However, when the concentration of sodium carbonate was raised, the dye desorption percentage increased from 26 % to 42 % due to economic considerations; 15 mg/L of sodium carbonate was selected to continue the processof desorption. Increasing the desorption temperature can improve the dye desorption efficiency.

The BAM <b>column</b> <b>testing</b> facility is based on a standard column furnace, but rather than simply applying a constant axial testing load during fire, it can use a ‘hybrid’ sub-structuring system where the entire <b>column</b> is <b>tested</b> inside the furnace and measured forces are read and target displacements are controlled via simulated modeling into the substructure in real time (Korzen et al. 2010). The BAM furnace is capable of producing an ISO 834 (ISO 1999) fire on columns of up to 3.55 m in height. The furnace is fired by six oil burners. Six electro-hydraulic control channels are used to actively control mechanical boundary conditions (two bending rotations each at top and bottom, axial displacement at the bottom, and horizontal displacement at the top). This testing methodology allows single elements to be tested in isolation {{while the rest of the}} structure is ‘simulated’ by actively controlling the boundary conditions in real time during the test.

Factors evaluated include time of sediment-water contact, sedi-ment salinity regime, and sediment oxidation status. Background Contaminated dredged material is often placed in confined disposal facilities where movement of contaminants by leachate {{is an important}} environmental con-cern. No laboratory testing protocol has been routinely applied to predict leachate quality and quantity from confined dredged material disposal facilities. In 1984, the US Army Corps of Engineers initiated investigations of confined disposal facility (CDF) leachate by developing a theoretical framework for prediction of leachate quality based on mass transport theory. The theoretical framework in-cluded both batch and <b>column</b> <b>testing</b> in an integrated approach. Batch testing provides a quick, relatively easy method for determining the distribution of con-taminants between dredged material and leachate.

Two <b>column</b> leach <b>tests</b> and one core leach test Were conducted by the U. S. Bureau of Mines on Mn oxide ore using aqueous sulfur dioxide (SO 2) as the lixiviant. The <b>column</b> <b>tests</b> showed that aqueous S 02 could selectively dissolve available Mn oxides from calcite-rich ore in a heap leach system. However, the core test showed that calcite gangue side reactions can have pronounced negative effects on the likelihood of successful in situ leaching of a calcite-rich ore with aqueous S 02. Petrographic and geochemical analyses showed that both Mn (IV, III) oxides and calcite were dissolved. The abundance of dissolved Ca caused precipitation of gypsum. Acid consumption by calcite dissolution caused a rise in pH that caused the SO/S species to shift to S 032 -(sulfIte), which hindered reductive dissolution of Mn oxide. Gypsum precipitation did not affect complete leaching of the rock fragments in the column tests; however, it plugged the natural permeability in the core. Manganese recoveries were high for the <b>column</b> <b>tests</b> and low for the core test...|$|R
