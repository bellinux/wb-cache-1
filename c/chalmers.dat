5|$|Before the 1910 season, Hugh <b>Chalmers</b> of <b>Chalmers</b> Automobile {{announced}} he would present a <b>Chalmers</b> Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball {{at the end of}} the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway, and <b>Chalmers</b> ended up awarding cars to both players.|$|E

5|$|Word of Seymour and Edna's {{relationship}} quickly spreads throughout Springfield, {{with the}} story growing more illicit and exaggerated with each passing turn by the children. An appalled Chief Wiggum, upon hearing his son Ralph's less than accurate version of the events, alerts Superintendent <b>Chalmers.</b> <b>Chalmers</b> gives Seymour an ultimatum – end the relationship or have both of them face dismissal. Seymour decides that love is stronger than his professional goals, so <b>Chalmers</b> fires him and Edna, expecting them to leave the school {{at the end of}} the day.|$|E
5|$|During an {{inspection}} by Superintendent <b>Chalmers,</b> Principal Skinner lures Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson into a utility basement {{with the promise}} of free mountain bikes and locks the door. Bart escapes through a ventilation shaft and takes Groundskeeper Willie's tractor for a joyride, crashing into Superintendent <b>Chalmers.</b> Rather than giving him detention, Principal Skinner instead expels Bart. After Bart is quickly expelled from a new private Christian school, Marge decides to homeschool Bart.|$|E
5|$|Most {{references}} say {{the position}} {{was first used}} in this way on 20 March 1844 to allow Sir George Henry Rose, Member for Christchurch, to resign his seat in Parliament, but the official book containing appointments to the Stewardship (lodged in The National Archives under catalogue reference E 197/1) indicates that Patrick <b>Chalmers,</b> Member for Montrose Burghs, was appointed to this office on 6 April 1842 {{so that he could}} resign due to ill health. The writ ordering the election of a replacement MP was changed so that it appeared <b>Chalmers</b> had been appointed to the Chiltern Hundreds.|$|E

5|$|Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, PewDiePie {{originally}} {{pursued a}} degree in industrial economics and technology management at <b>Chalmers</b> University of Technology. In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, {{he dropped out of}} <b>Chalmers</b> after becoming disinterested with his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, PewDiePie began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and working at a hot dog stand. PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} for the European Cup after winning the 1965–66 Scottish First Division, their 21st title, by two points over rivals Rangers. Celtic entered at the first round where they faced Swiss side Zürich. Celtic won 2–0 at home, with goals from Tommy Gemmell and Joe McBride. They then won the away leg 3–0 as Stevie <b>Chalmers</b> scored and Gemmell got a brace. Celtic faced French side Nantes in the second round, and won the away leg 3–1. Nantes had taken the lead through Francis Magny, before McBride had equalised to level the match at 1–1. In the second half, Bobby Lennox and Bertie Auld scored to seal a victory. Celtic won the home leg by the same scoreline. Jimmy Johnstone put them in front, before Gérard Georgin equalised. Celtic again scored twice in the second half, as <b>Chalmers</b> and Lennox secured the victory.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a BBC Radio 4 {{documentary}} {{explored the}} possibility that the character of James Bond was created by 20th Century author and mentor to Fleming, Phyllis Bottome in her 1946 novel, The Lifeline.

5|$|Season 1964–65 saw Celtic {{back in the}} Inter-Cities Fairs cup. First round opponents were Portuguese side Leixões S.C.. The {{first leg}} away in Portual was ill-tempered and marred by {{eccentric}} referring decisions in a 1–1 draw. Stevie <b>Chalmers</b> and Ian Young were both controversially sent off; <b>Chalmers</b> for a minor collision with the Leixões goalkeeper as they both jumped for the ball, Young for a minor scuffle with an opponent (who was also sent off). Celtic won the return match in Glasgow 3–0 to progress, although the game was again bad tempered. In the next round Celtic faced Barcelona. The Spaniards won 20 at the Nou Camp and held Celtic to a goalless draw at Parkhead {{in a series of}} ties where they clearly outclassed their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Superintendent <b>Chalmers</b> hires Ned {{as the new}} {{principal}} of Springfield Elementary School, but when Ned is hesitant to discipline the children, they run amok, and the school becomes a mad house.

Feeling lonely, Principal Skinner eventually decides to re-enlist in the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} an hour, Gemmell {{finally managed to}} equalise for Celtic when Craig passed {{to him from the}} right wing and he scored with a {{powerful}} 25 yard shot. The balance of play remained the same with Inter defending deeply against sustained Celtic attacking. With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie <b>Chalmers</b> past a wrong-footed Sarti. This proved to be the winning goal.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{original}} Doctor Who series reached its conclusion, some tentative plans {{had been made}} for a proposed 27th season {{under the assumption that}} it would maintain the then-current pattern of two four-part and two three-part stories. As noted in each entry, Big Finish Productions has produced audio adaptations of several scripts as part of their The Lost Stories releases. The safecracking companion introduced in Crime of the Century (see below), who was never named during the planning, has now been given a name, that of Raine Creevey, and she is portrayed by Beth <b>Chalmers.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 2014, Wade and {{teammates}} James and Bosh all opted {{out of their}} contracts in order to cut costs {{with the intention of}} all re-signing.

5|$|The Bank of New Zealand Building, 205 Princes St (cnr. Princes and High Sts) (Category I). Designed in Venetian Renaissance styling, the 1882 BNZ {{building}} stands {{just two}} doors along from the National Bank building. The William Armson-designed building is notable for the richly carved exterior work by Louis Godfrey and moulded ceilings in its interior. The façade combines Doric, Ionic and Corinthian styles, and makes {{good use of}} Port <b>Chalmers</b> bluestone and Oamaru stone, a compact, cream-coloured limestone.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch; Barry White, who had expressed a wish {{to appear in the}} show, guest stars as himself. It was pitched by George Meyer, who wanted to create an episode against the mistreatment of snakes (the episode ended up winning a Genesis Award). The episode includes the first appearance of Superintendent <b>Chalmers,</b> and it features an Itchy & Scratchy parody of Oliver Stone's film JFK.|$|E
5|$|There were, however, {{a number}} of irregularities. In the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, four Liberal workers were convicted of various {{offences}} for adding almost five hundred names to the electoral register. One of the four was also convicted for two counts of perjury. While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate, former MP James Rooney, was not charged, Ontario Chief Justice James <b>Chalmers</b> McRuer, who investigated the matter, doubted that {{this could have been}} done without the candidate's knowledge.|$|E
5|$|William <b>Chalmers</b> invented Plexiglas while a {{graduate}} student at McGill. In computing, MUSIC/SP, software for mainframes once popular among universities and colleges around the world, was developed at McGill. A team also contributed to the development of Archie, a pre-WWW search engine. A 3270 terminal emulator developed at McGill was commercialized and later sold to Hummingbird Software. A team has developed digital musical instruments in the form of prosthesis, called Musical Prostheses.|$|E
5|$|After {{dismissing the}} idea of taking Simpson family home videos and a geode, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to school for show and tell. Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is called in to rescue him. As the firemen are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent <b>Chalmers</b> appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E
5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in danger of being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port <b>Chalmers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie {{looked like it was}} going to end in a draw after <b>Chalmers</b> had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E
5|$|Discovery left Isle of Wight on 6 August 1901, {{and arrived}} in New Zealand via Cape Town on 29 November after a detour below 40°S for a {{magnetic}} survey. Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour {{was used as}} the quarantine station for the expedition's dogs. After three weeks of final preparation she was ready for the journey south. On 21 December, as the ship was leaving Lyttelton to the cheers of large crowds, a young able seaman, Charles Bonner, fell to his death {{from the top of the}} mainmast, which he had climbed so as to return the crowd's applause. He was buried at Port <b>Chalmers,</b> two days later.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the area {{developed}} into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of Dunedin with timber shipped from the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: {{the wreck of the}} passenger-steamer Tararua, en route from Bluff to Port <b>Chalmers,</b> which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 with the loss of all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1919 at the <b>Chalmers</b> Church, North Terrace, Adelaide, Rowell married Blanche May Murison, the {{daughter}} of a Scottish engineer. Blanche had served in the Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps in Australia during the war. Due to his brief overseas service, {{the end of the war}} found Rowell still a lieutenant and thus junior in rank to his contemporaries but the snail-like pace of promotions between the wars allowed him to gradually catch up. He was promoted to captain on 1 January 1920, major on 1 January 1926, and the brevet rank lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1935, with substantive rank on 1 January 1936. His inter-war career consisted of a long series of staff postings, interspersed with training courses.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 1936, {{during the}} first weeks of the Spanish Civil War, Basilisk became {{involved}} {{in the aftermath of the}} naval action known as Convoy de la Victoria, when she was shelled and straddled by the ageing Spanish nationalist gunboat Dato while arriving in Gibraltar. The gunboat misidentified the British warship as a republican destroyer of the Churruca-class. In February 1937 Basilisk arrived at the port of Málaga, Spain, captured a few days before by the Franco's forces. Basilisks captain gained the release of Sir Peter <b>Chalmers</b> Mitchell, a British zoologist resident in Málaga, who was arrested by Franco's troops due to his support of the Spanish Republic.|$|E

Minnesota used the 45th and 47th pick to draft Nick Calathes and Henk Norel respectively. Later, on June 26, 2009. the Dallas Mavericks acquired the draft rights to 45th pick Nick Calathes from Minnesota in exchange for a 2010 second-round draft pick and cash considerations.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his divorce}} from Rosamunde, Gibbs married {{for a third}} time. He wed Doris Mannix at St Matthew’s Church of England in Bondi on 9 September 1948. In 1971, owing to the decline in status and {{significance}} of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that the decoration would be abolished and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals. All six Australian Albert Medal recipients living at the time opted to accept the offer, Gibbs and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, Jack <b>Chalmers,</b> Robert Kavanaugh, William McAloney, Dick Richards and Gibbs, were presented with their George Crosses by Queen Elizabeth II in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1972.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934, Szilard {{began working}} at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Working {{with a young}} {{physicist}} on the hospital staff, Thomas A. <b>Chalmers,</b> he began studying radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. It was known that bombarding elements with neutrons could produce either heavier isotopes of an element, or a heavier element, a phenomenon known as the Fermi Effect after its discoverer, the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. When they bombarded ethyl iodide with neutrons produced by a radon-beryllium source, {{they found that the}} heavier radioactive isotopes of iodine separated from the compound. Thus, they had discovered a means of isotope separation. This method became known as the Szilard–Chalmers effect, and was widely used in the preparation of medical isotopes. He also attempted unsuccessfully to create a nuclear chain reaction using beryllium by bombarding it with X-rays. In 1936, Szilard assigned his chain-reaction patent to the British Admiralty to ensure its secrecy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three Allis <b>Chalmers</b> built Francis turbine-{{generator}}s, all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time. Original plans called for 16large generators, eight {{on each side of the}} river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable. The present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in 2017.|$|E
5|$|McAloney {{retired to}} his home in Sandringham, Victoria, where he indulged his passions in {{gardening}} and golf. He was also an active Freemason, and a voracious reader. In 1971, owing to the decline in status and significance of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that the decoration would be abolished and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were according invited to exchange their medals.
