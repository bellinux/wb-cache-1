40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} Jatropha <b>curcas</b> L. seed <b>oil</b> and microcurrent stimulation on the healing of wounds experimentally induced in Wistar rats. METHODS: Forty-eight animals were divided into four groups: (A) control; (B) treated with microcurrent (10 µA/ 2 min); (C) treated with J. <b>curcas</b> seed <b>oil,</b> and (D) treated with J. <b>curcas</b> seed <b>oil</b> plus microcurrent. Tissues samples were obtained two, six, ten and 14 days after injury and submitted to structural and morphometric analyses. RESULTS: The animals of groups A and C showed similar responses in terms of repair area, total number of cells, number of newly formed blood vessels, epithelial thickness, and percentage of area occupied by mature collagen fibers.

In general, treated plants had a strong deterrent effect on ovipositing M. nigrivenella. The oviposition deterrence index was highest with neem oil at both concentrations, J. curcas at 5 % and H. suaveolens at 20 %. In addition, neem and Jatropha oils adversely affected egg hatch; it decreased with an increase in concentrations of oil emulsions and varied between 3 and 25. 5 % for neem and 6 and 16 % for J. curcas. The lethal concentration 50 values calculated were 1. 3 and 0. 8 %, respectively, for neem and J. curcas. By contrast, larval survival was not affected by the oil treatments. In the field, Furadan, neem and J. <b>curcas</b> <b>oils</b> significantly reduced the number of M. nigrivenella larvae by 16 – 49. 2 %, while aqueous extracts of T. vogelii and H. suaveolens were similar to the emulsified water control.

At the end of this test period, peroxide value of JME increased to (126. 60 meq/Kg),CME(71. 75 meq/Kg),SME(77. 80 meq/Kg),NME(111. 65 meq/K g), COME (59. 65 meq/Kg), RME (162. 55 meq/Kg), kinematic viscosity JM...|$|R
40|$|Jatropa Curcas {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{feasible}} sources for biodiesel feedstock. Some advantages of Jatropa <b>curcas</b> <b>oil</b> are non edible, growing in arid soil, and high oil yield from their seed, while it’s disadvantage is tend to oxidized and form high Free Fatty Acid (FFA) due to the oil composition. Oscillatory Flow Reactor is useful when reaction should performed for a long time in a turbulence flow, the other advantage is OFR have a compact size because substantially smaller length to diameter ratios than conventional tubular reactor. Two step reaction was performed for biodiesel production from High FFA Oil, first reducing FFA by esterification process catalized by H 2 SO 4 and the second is transesterification process catalized by KOH. Initial FFA on Jatropa <b>Curcas</b> <b>Oil</b> is 47 %, the first step was performed in Stirred Tank Reactor for 90 minute, 60 oC, etanol 50 % v/v and H 2 SO 4 1, 5 % v/v stirring on a speed 500 rpm 99 % of the FFA was converted on this step while the second step was performed in Oscillatory Flow Reactor for 60 minute at 600 C, ethanol 25 % v/v, Sodium Metoxide 1 % v/v, 91 % of the oil was converted on this step. It is concluded that OFR is sufficient enough for biodiesel production using High FFA Jatropa <b>Curcas</b> <b>Oil</b> as feedstock...|$|E
40|$|Oil {{insulation}} generally use {{mineral oil}} {{because it has}} good heat absorption and dielectric characteristics as an insulator. Because of mineral oil is less friendly environmental, so important {{to find a solution}} to overcome them. This research aims to determine the feasibility of Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>oil</b> as an alternative oil insulation. This study has used variations of gap and water content to determine the effect on the breakdown voltage. The test result of the breakdown voltage of Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>oil</b> is compared to the breakdown voltage of the Shell Diala S 2 ZU- 1 oil. Futhermore the final result is found that the average of the breakdown voltage of Jatropha curcas is higher than Shell Diala S 2 ZU- 1 oil. The end of this study has achieved average values of breakdown voltage with lesser water concentration i. e. 2, 17...|$|E
40|$|Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>oil</b> was {{extracted}} using n-hexane as solvent in the Soxhlet extraction method. The physicochemical {{properties of}} Malaysian Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>oil</b> were evaluated. The result {{showed that the}} Jatropha seeds consist of 60 % (dry w/w) crude oil. The physicochemical properties showed that the seed oil contained low moisture level of 0. 02 ± 0. 01 %, acid value (1. 50 ± 0. 07 %), iodine value (91. 70 ± 1. 44 mg/g), peroxide value (0. 66 ± 0. 04 miliequivalence/kg) and saponification value of 208. 5 ± 0. 47 mg/g respectively. Gas chromatography analysis showed that oleic acid (46. 00 ± 0. 19 %) appears as dominant fatty acid in seed oil followed by linoleic acid (31. 96 ± 0. 19 %) and palmitic acid (13. 89 ± 0. 06 %).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new vegetable oil that is jatropha <b>curcas</b> seeds <b>oil</b> {{as a substitute}} for mineral oil. This product has several advantages among which {{the fact that it is}} non-food crops and may be grown on low fertile soils and areas where annual rainfall levels are significantly lower than those required by other plants used to extract other vegetable oils such as rape-seeds, sunflower, corn, soybeans, grape-seeds and sesame. The considered natural ester oil is processed by alkali base catalyzed esterification process using potassium hydroxide (KOH) to produce jatropha <b>curcas</b> methyl ester <b>oil</b> (JMEO). The physicochemical (water content, relative density, viscosity, acidity, visual examination, color, iodine number, corrosivity, flash point, pour point) and electrical (breakdown voltage under ac, dc and impulse voltages) properties of JMEO are presented and discussed. A gas chromatography (GC) analysis is also achieved to identify the methyl ester components in JMEO. The breakdown voltage of JMEO is compared to that of mineral oil (MO). It is found that the average breakdown voltage of JMEO and MO under different voltage waveforms are too close...|$|R
