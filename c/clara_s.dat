40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the effect of metronomic (0. 0125 mg/kg twice a week for 4 weeks) zoledronic acid (ZOL) on cancer propagation and osteolysis against both metastatic and primary breast cancer in mice model. From our results, metronomic ZOL resulted in a significant reduction of tumor burden and did not promote lung or liver metastasis. The metronomic ZOL appeared to be more effective than the conventional regimen (0. 1 mg/kg once in 4 weeks) in reducing breast cancer tumor burden, and regulating its movement to lung and liver. This dosing schedule of ZOL showed great potential against metastatic breast cancer. Ke-Wang Luo, Chun-Hay Ko, Grace G. L. Yue, Michelle Y. Y. Lee, Wing-Sum Siu, Julia K. M.

The wild tomato (Solanum habrochaites Knapp & Spooner, formerly Lycopersicon hirsutum Dunal) shows resistance to P. infestans, because of which we investigated an interspecific cross between S. lycopersicum cv. Santa <b>Clara</b> and <b>S.</b> habrochaites accession BGH 6902 maintained at the Horticultural Germplasm Bank at the Federal University of Viçosa (Banco de Germoplasma de Horticultura (BGH), Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV), Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil) The genitors, F 1, F 2, BC 1 and BC 2 were used to study the inheritance of resistance to P. infestans and to estimate the genetic parameters associated with resistance. Analysis of the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) indicated that inheritance is polygenic and that dominance controls character, whereas mean analysis showed that the additive effect was the most important. Although the character presents variability, the heritability is low which generates the need to better control the environment to obtain success with the selection...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} compact, surface-potential-based {{modeling}} approach for deeply scaled digital or radio-frequency {{metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor}} able to account for random doping fluctuations in the device channel. Random dopant fluctuations {{are one of the}} primary causes for device variability in nanometer-scale components. The present approach is based on the Green's function formulation of the device external electrical parameters (such as the output current) small-change sensitivity to distributed, space-dependent doping variations in the channel; furthermore, the methodology is used also to assess the small-signal device parameter variations within the limits of a quasi-static description. The present approach allows for an efficient circuit-level sensitivity analysis and has been applied to the PSP compact model through a Verilog-A code implemented within the ADVANCED DESIGN SYSTEM (Agilent Technologies, Santa <b>Clara,</b> CA, U. <b>S.</b> A.) simulator. Examples are provided to show that the model predictions are in good agreement with far more time-consuming simulation...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to being a keyfigure in the history of filmmaking, Orson Welles was an original theatre director and radio performer and producer. The aim of this thesis is to study Welles' achievements and failures in theatre, radio and film, as well as comparing his craft and techniques in each medium during his early career. Welles' adaptations of Shakespeare will provide the guiding thread of this intermedial exploration. Close reading of these texts will show the recurrence of intermediality in Welles' work, namely, the way techniques from one medium feed into the other two. Borrowing conventions and devices that are proper to other media and importing them into a target medium is his basic innovative strategy. This use of intermediality brings about innovative effects that favour agile and gripping storytelling, though it can also hamper the understanding of the piece. by <b>Clara</b> Fernández-Vara.
