5000|$|The {{shape of}} the cursor is {{restricted}} to a rectangle the full width of the <b>character</b> <b>box,</b> and filled with the foreground color of the character at the cursor's current location. Its height and position may be arbitrary within a character box;. [...] The EGA and many VGA clones allowed a split-box cursor (appearing as two rectangles, one {{at the top of}} the <b>character</b> <b>box</b> and one at the bottom), by setting the end of the cursor before the start, however if this is done on the original VGA the cursor is completely hidden instead. [...] The VGA standard does not provide a way to alter the blink rate, although common workarounds involve hiding the cursor and using a normal character glyph to provide a so-called software cursor.|$|E

He represents the rational counterpart to Hoshino. Although he generally sees through Yoko's pranks he stays silent, preferring to be the onlooker.|$|E
40|$|Financial institutions, {{insurance}} companies, {{and government}} agencies are all aggressively pursuing the integration of automated forms processing into their everyday work flows. To use existing optical character recognition (OCR) technology, the forms that are currently hand-keyed will probably need to be redesigned. This paper presents some of the quantitative results generated by a comprehensive study of three versions of a redesigned tax form. Analyses show that using separately spaced bounding <b>character</b> <b>boxes</b> to represent fields provides superior machine readability over fields without <b>character</b> <b>boxes,</b> fields containing vertical ticks (combs), and fields with adjoining <b>character</b> <b>boxes.</b> It is also shown that <b>character</b> <b>boxes</b> containing two vertically stacked ovals cause writers much more difficulty to complete than do empty <b>character</b> <b>boxes.</b> The analyses also provide quantitative proof that writer idiosyncratic responses on forms are {{the major source of}} errors within the recognition sy [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Simultaneously announced, The Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter (MDPA), often {{shortened}} to Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA), {{which did}} not support pixel-addressable graphics of any sort, offered a high-quality 80x25 character mode, having a relatively high pixel-resolution of 720x350 (<b>character</b> <b>box</b> size 9x14), {{that could be used}} on a monochrome monitor (originally, specifically the IBM 5151 Personal Computer Display).|$|E
50|$|There exists also non-spacing graphic {{characters}}. Most of non-spacing {{characters are}} , also called combining characters in Unicode, such as diacritical marks. Although non-spacing graphic characters are uncommon in traditional code pages, {{there are many}} such in Unicode. A combining character has its distinct glyph, but it applies to a <b>character</b> <b>box</b> of another character, a spacing one. In some historical systems such as line printers this was implemented as overstrike.|$|E
50|$|The 6847 {{is capable}} of a Semigraphics 6 display mode, where two bits select a color and 6 bits {{determine}} which 1/6 of the <b>character</b> <b>box</b> is lit. In this mode only 4 colors are possible but the Colorset bit of the VDG can select two different groups of the 4 colors. Due to a peculiarity of its hardware, only two colors are available in graphics blocks when using Semigraphics 6 on the CoCo.|$|E
50|$|The M24/6300 had an {{enhanced}} CGA video card which, {{in addition to}} standard 200-line CGA modes, also supported an additional 640x400x2 mode (text mode was 400 lines and had 8x16 <b>character</b> <b>boxes).</b> It required a proprietary dual-sync monitor. The 640x400 graphics mode received a moderate level of support from software developers, mostly in applications (Earl Weaver Baseball is however {{an example of a}} game that can use it). Some plasma portables from Compaq and other manufacturers also copied the M24/6300's graphics hardware.|$|R

50|$|Other <b>characters</b> were <b>boxing</b> trainer Neillie (Jake D'Arcy), Hance's mother, Mrs Gordon (Claire Nielson), and Danny, a slow-witted boxer {{at the end}} of his career, {{played by}} Grant Smeaton.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Unicode {{includes two}} graphic characters, [...] and [...] They are compatibility {{equivalent to the}} [...] with non-spacing diacritics [...] and [...] respectively; the latter allows an overline to be placed over any character. As with any combining character, it appears in the same <b>character</b> <b>box</b> as the character that logically precedes it: for example, x̅, compared to x‾. A series of overlined characters usually results in an unbroken line, depending on the font (for example, 1̅2̅3̅).|$|E
50|$|Special effects artists L. B. Abbott and Glen Robinson {{regarded}} Carrousel as {{the most}} difficult part of the film to portray, requiring hidden wires to depict the levitation. For the scene where Logan is interrogated by the Deep Sleep central computer, it was decided genuine holograms would be most convincing, with Saul David advocating a new hologram effect be created. The robot <b>character</b> <b>Box</b> was portrayed by placing actor Roscoe Lee Browne in a robot costume.|$|E
50|$|Over time, however, as new {{offensive}} formations, such as {{the single}} wing, were introduced, and increased the lateral running and passing threats, the seven man front changed in <b>character.</b> <b>Box</b> and letter drawings of the seven man front, by coaches such as Bernie Bierman and Steve Owen show a broadly spread front, with the center and two guards versus the interior five offensive linemen, defensive tackles 2-5 yards from the guards, and ends 2-5 yards outside the defensive tackles, and well outside the offensive ends.|$|E

50|$|The common serial {{dot matrix}} {{printers}} use a horizontally moving print head. The print head {{can be thought}} of featuring a single vertical column of seven or more pins approximately the height of a <b>character</b> <b>box.</b> In reality, the pins are arranged in up to four vertically or/and horizontally slightly displaced columns in order to increase the dot density and print speed through interleaving without causing the pins to jam. Thereby, up to 48 pins can be used to form the characters of a line while the print head moves horizontally.|$|E
50|$|Most graphic {{characters}} are spacing characters, {{which means that}} each instance of a spacing character has to occupy some area in a graphic representation. For a teletype or a typewriter this implies moving of the carriage after typing of a character. In the context of text mode display, each spacing character occupies one rectangular <b>character</b> <b>box</b> of equal sizes. Or maybe two adjacent ones, for non-alphabetic characters of East Asian languages. If a text is rendered using proportional fonts, widths of character boxes are not equal, but are positive.|$|E
5000|$|An overline, that is, {{a single}} line above a chunk of text, should not be {{confused}} with the macron, a diacritical mark placed above (or sometimes below) individual letters. The macron is narrower than the <b>character</b> <b>box.</b> Since ISO and Unicode Consortium assign names to characters in their unique fashion and often ignore the established typographical terminology, Unicode includes two characters [...] (formerly [...] ) and [...] that both look like an overlined space in most fonts, similar to a mirrored underscore symbol. An overline proper can be encoded as a Unicode diacritic; see below.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, Geuder, Paeschke and Frey {{produced}} the first licensed <b>character</b> lunch <b>box,</b> Mickey Mouse. It was a lithographed oval tin, with a pull-out tray inside. It had no vacuum bottle, but {{did have a}} handle.|$|R
50|$|An artbook named Galerians A Head was {{released}} the next year. It contained preliminary sketches, <b>character</b> turnarounds, <b>box</b> art, some storyboards, and general artwork {{from both the}} games and the OVA, all illustrated by Shou Tajima.|$|R
50|$|Cities of Mystery {{describes}} a fantasy city, and includes five adventure scenario suggestions {{and descriptions of}} important non-player <b>characters.</b> The <b>boxed</b> set includes two large maps and 33 cardstock fold-together buildings, enough for an entire city block.|$|R
5000|$|By {{setting the}} SAM {{such that it}} {{believes}} it is displaying a full graphics mode, but leaving the VDG in Alphanumeric/Semigraphics 4 mode, {{it is possible to}} subdivide the <b>character</b> <b>box</b> into smaller pieces. This creates the [...] "virtual" [...] modes Semigraphics 8, 12, and 24. In these modes it was possible to mix bits and pieces of different text characters as well as Semigraphics 4 characters. These modes were an interesting curiosity but not widely used, as the Semigraphics 24-screen consumed 6144 bytes of memory. These modes were not implemented on the CoCo 3.|$|E
5000|$|Semi{{graphics}} is {{a hybrid}} display mode where alphanumerics and chunky block graphics can be mixed {{together on the}} same screen. If the 8th bit of the character is set, it is a semigraphics character. If cleared, it is an alphanumeric. When the 8th bit is set, the next three bits determine the color and last 4 bits determine which [...] "quadrant" [...] of the <b>character</b> <b>box</b> is either the selected color or black. This is the only mode where it is possible (without sneaky tricks) to display all 9 colors on the screen simultaneously. If used to only display semigraphics, the screen becomes a 64×32 nine color graphics mode. The CoCo features several BASIC commands to manage this screen as a low-res graphics display.|$|E
50|$|Until 2010 or so, the Unicode glyph U+221A {{corresponding}} to the square-root sign (the HTML entity is named radic and has decimal code 8730) was usually rendered with a short built-in vinculum. That made it an inadequate graphical replacement for the original character from the Symbol font (itself designed around a slanted line extending {{all the way to}} the upper-right corner of the <b>character</b> <b>box,</b> without any spacing). The more recent renditions of the HTML radic entity (U+221A) no longer feature any vinculum and are thus more compatible with the standard graphical representation introduced in the Symbol font. Both styles of the square-root glyph (with or without a short vinculum) have the same disembodied meaning, so the integrity of the Unicode repertoire is not compromised by this adjustment.|$|E

50|$|There are modes with a <b>character</b> <b>box</b> {{width of}} 9-dots (e.g. the default 80×25 mode), however the 9th column {{is used for}} spacing between characters, so the content cannot be changed. It is always blank, and drawn with the current {{background}} colour. An exception to this is in Line Graphics Enable mode, which causes code points 0xC0 to 0xDF inclusive to have the 8th column repeated as the 9th. These code points cover those box drawing characters which must extend {{all the way to}} the right side of the glyph box. For this reason, placing letter-like characters in code points 0xC0-0xDF should be avoided. The box drawing characters from 0xB0 to 0xBF are not extended as they do not point to the right and so do not require extending.|$|E
50|$|The IBM Personal Computer was {{launched}} in 1981 with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) expansion card and the Monochrome Display And Printer Adapter. The CGA offered two basic operating modes: 320×200 pixel (or 40x25 character) low resolution or a 640x200 (or 80×25 characters) pixels high resolution mode. While the low-resolution mode was very comparable to 8-bit home computers of the era, the higher-resolution mode offered a fair advance, used with a suitable RGBI (or RGB) monitor (such as the IBM 5153 Personal Computer Color Display). Still, since by design CGA {{was able to be}} connected to cheap composite monitors and even to home TVs (via RF modulator), CGA was limited in resolution; its text modes has a <b>character</b> <b>box</b> size of 8x8 pixels, which made text fairly rough-looking, especially in the vertical direction, which had only one pixel row for descenders.|$|E
5000|$|Besides being {{critically}} acclaimed, {{the film}} became the sixth highest grossing {{of the year}} and was declared a 'hit' at the Indian box office. Damini - Lightning is mostly remembered for Meenakshi Sheshadri's career best performance and it is also memorable for Sunny Deol's role as an advocate and gained him a Filmfare as well as National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor for 1993. It strengthened his Bollywood he-man image. His dialogue in the film [...] "Tarikh pe tarikh" [...] became iconic and a pop-culture reference. The film was a milestone in the careers of Meenakshi Sheshadri, Sunny Deol and Amrish Puri who gave some great hits like Ghayal and Ghatak: Lethal together. Aamir Khan acted in a special appearance in the stage show dance song. Damini - Lightning was remade into Oriya as Nari Nuhne Tu Narayani starring Sidhanta Mohapatra and Rachana Banarjee. It was remade into Tamil as Priyanka starring Revathi as the title <b>character.</b> <b>Box</b> Office India declared the film a Hit. This film was remade in Bangladesh as Sottyer Bijoy starring Manna (actor) Moushumi directed by FI Manik. The rights of the movie are now owned by Shah Rukh Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} many {{institutions}} holding papyri have put images of their collections online, while transcriptions previously published in print are now hosted in the Digital Corpus of Literary Papyri. Anagnosis aims {{to provide an}} intuitive and easy-to-use web interface between those images and related digitized texts. The main goal lies in automatic data processing and text-recognition accuracy: Through a dedicated OCR algorithm, letters on the image are identified with single boxes and thus linked to the transcription. A coordinates system of the glyphs on the image can then be transferred and applied to each new image uploaded for the same text section. Once all <b>character</b> <b>boxes</b> are generated, Anagnosis can extract a sample alphabet that users may rearrange to virtually restore lost parts of text directly on the image...|$|R
