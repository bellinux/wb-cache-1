In this review we define and explain two of these methods: linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping and quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN) mapping. The power to detect valid genotype-phenotype associations with LD or QTN mapping depends critically {{on the extent to}} which segregating sites in a genome assort independently. LD mapping depends on markers being in disequilibrium with the genes that <b>condition</b> <b>expression</b> of the phenotype.

40|$|Mechanisms of {{telomere}} replication remain poorly defined. It {{has been}} suggested that G-rich telomeric strand replication by lagging mechanisms requires, in a stochastic way, the WRN protein. Here we show that this requirement is more systematic than previously thought. Our data are compatible with a situation in which, in the absence of WRN, DNA synthesis at replication forks is uncoupled, thus allowing replication to continue on the C strand, while single G strands accumulate. We also show that in cells in which both WRN and POT 1 are limiting, both G- and C-rich telomeric strands shorten, suggesting a complete replication block. Under this particular <b>condition,</b> <b>expression</b> of a fragment spanning the two POT 1 -OB (oligonucleotide-binding) fold domains is able to restore C (but not G) strand replication, suggesting that binding of POT 1 to the lagging strand allows DNA synthesis uncoupling in the absence of WRN. Furthermore, in vitro experiments indicate that purified POT 1 has a higher affinity for the telomeric G-rich strand than purified RPA. We propose a model in which the relative enrichments of POT 1 versus RPA on the telomeric lagging strand allows or does not allow uncoupling of DNA synthesis at the replication fork.

Selecting high-stability reference genes is crucial to interpret real-time qPCR data. This study investigated the expression stability of five top-ranked candidate reference genes in the goat mammary gland through three assays comparing different experimental conditions (physiological states, sample types and experimental treatments). The expression stability of genes including beta-actin, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, 18 S rRNA, cyclophilin A and ribosomal protein large PO was analyzed. Normalization for each experimental <b>condition</b> <b>expression</b> data revealed a different reference gene. Nevertheless, in our various assays, genes encoding for ribosomal proteins, 18 S rRNA and RPLP 0 presented the best expression stability. This result has been confirmed using a combined analysis of stability on the three assays. All genes showed the same distribution within and among the three assays and a different distribution between Ct variability and GeNorm normalization. In addition, the application on Catenin B 1 expression using an inappropriate reference gene confirmed erroneous variations in interpretation. To conclude, {{there is no single}} ideal reference gene for caprine mammary gland studies and we recommend using a panel of top-ranked reference genes, including RPLP 0, {{at the beginning of each}} experiment to validate the most stable(s) gene(s).

Through deletion of rscA and rscB genes, we show that the Rcs system {{is involved in the}} regulation of both CA and PA synthesis in E. coli K 92. Deletion of either rcsA or rcsB genes resulted in decreased expression of cps (CA biosynthesis cluster) at 19 &#x 00 B 0;C and 37 &#x 00 B 0;C, but only CA production was reduced at 19 &#x 00 B 0;C.

Although RcsA and RcsB acted as negative regulators of PA synthesis at 37 &#x 00 B 0;C, their absence did not reestablish PA expression at low temperatures, despite the deletion of rcsB resulting in enhanced kps expression. Finally, our results revealed that RcsB controlled the expression of several genes (dsrA, rfaH, h-ns and slyA) involved in the thermoregulation of CA and PA synthesis, indicating that RcsB is part of a complex regulatory mechanism governing the surface appearance in E. coli...|$|E

Such settlements are thus exposed to unregulated growth which leads to natural surface extension and loss of traditional concept and identity of a settlement. With this respective one would expect a more regulated rural settlement planning, as viewed also from land subdivison plan applicability. In a settlement a land subdivison plan establishes necessary criteria and guidelines for installation sitting on land formed and contributes to a quality relationship old-new formulation.

Scleroderma-like skin thickening {{can be seen}} in some individuals with LP. We undertook a study to characterise the phenotype of LP and identify its genetic basis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping in two families with LP defined microduplications of chromosome 8 q 22. 1 as the cause of this <b>condition.</b> <b>Expression</b> analysis of dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals showed overexpression of two genes, GDF 6 and SDC 2, within the duplicated region, leading to dysregulation of genes that encode proteins of the extracellular matrix and downstream players in the transforming growth factor (TGF) -β pathway. Western blot analysis revealed markedly decreased inhibitory SMAD 6 levels in patients with LP. Furthermore, in a cohort of 330 systemic sclerosis cases, we show that the minor allele of a missense SDC 2 variant, p. Ser 71 Thr, could confer protection against disease (p< 1 × 10 (- 5)). CONCLUSIONS: Our work identifies the genetic cause of LP in these two families, demonstrates the phenotypic range of the condition, implicates dysregulation of extracellular matrix homoeostasis genes in its pathogenesis, and highlights the link between TGF-β/SMAD signalling, growth/differentiation factor 6 and syndecan- 2. We propose that LP is an additional member of the growing 'TGF-β-pathies' group of musculoskeletal disorders, which includes Myhre syndrome, acromicric dysplasia, geleophysic dysplasias, Weill-Marchesani syndromes and stiff skin syndrome.

40|$|Cork oak is an {{economically}} important forest species showing a great tolerance to high temperatures and shortage of water. However, the mechanisms underlying this plasticity are still poorly understood. Among the stress regulators, transcription factors (TFs) are especially important since {{they can control}} {{a wide range of}} stress-inducible genes, which make them powerful targets for genetic engineering of stress tolerance. Here we evaluated the influence of increasing temperatures (up to 55 C) or drought (18 % field capacity, FC) on the expression profile of an R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factor of cork oak, the QsMYB 1. QsMYB 1 was previously identified as being preferentially expressed in cork tissues and as having an associated alternative splicing mechanism, which results in two different transcripts (QsMYB 1. 1 and QsMYB 1. 2). Expression analysis by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed that increasing temperatures led to a gradual down-regulation of QsMYB 1 transcripts with more effect on QsMYB 1. 1 abundance. On the other hand, under drought <b>condition,</b> <b>expression</b> of QsMYB 1 variants, mainly the QsMYB 1. 2, was transiently up-regulated shortly after the stress imposition. Recovery from each stress has also resulted in a differential response by both QsMYB 1 transcripts. Several physiological and biochemical parameters (plant water status, chlorophyll fluorescence, lipid peroxidation and proline content) were determined in order to monitor the plant performance under stress and recovery. In conclusion, this report provides the first evidence that QsMYB 1 TF may have a putative function in the regulatory network of cork oak response to heat and drought stresses and during plant recovery.

40|$|Cellular prostatic acid {{phosphatase}} (cPAcP), an authentic tyrosine phosphatase, is proposed {{to function as}} a negative growth regulator of prostate cancer (PCa) cells in part through its dephosphorylation of ErbB- 2. Nevertheless, the direct interaction between cPAcP and ErbB- 2 has not been shown nor the specific dephosphorylation site of ErbB- 2 by cPAcP. In this report, our data show that the phosphorylation level of ErbB- 2 primarily at Tyr 1221 / 2 correlates with the growth rate of both LNCaP and MDA PCa 2 b human PCa cells. Further, cPAcP reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB- 2 in a non-permissive growth <b>condition.</b> <b>Expression</b> of wild type cPAcP, but not inactive mutant, by cDNA in cPAcP-null LNCaP C- 81 cells results in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB- 2 including Tyr 1221 / 2. Concurrently, Tyr 317 phosphorylation of p 52 Shc, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and cell growth are decreased in these cells. Conversely, decreased cPAcP expression by short hairpin RNA in LNCaP C- 33 cells was associated with elevated phosphorylation of ErbB- 2 initially at Tyr 1221 / 2. Its downstream p 52 Shc, ERK 1 / 2, Akt, Src, STAT- 3, and STAT- 5 were activated, and cell proliferation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and cyclin D 1 expression were increased. Stable subclones of C- 33 cells by small interfering PAcP had elevated Tyr 1221 / 2 phosphorylation of ErbB- 2 and exhibited androgen-independent growth and increased tumorigenicity in xenograft female animals. In summary, our data together indicate that in prostate epithelia, cPAcP interacts with and dephosphorylates ErbB- 2 primarily at Tyr 1221 / 2 and hence blocks downstream signaling, leading to reduced cell growth. In PCa cells, decreased cPAcP expression is associated with androgen-independent cell proliferation and tumorigenicity as seen in advanced hormone-refractory prostate carcinomas...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} the gas-phase density on the process of bubble {{formation}} at a single orifice in a two-dimensional gas-fluidized bed has been studied experimentally and theoretically. Specifically, a detailed comparison between experimentally observed and theoretically calculated bubble growth curves has been made in the case where the density of the gas injected through the orifice (He and SF 6) differs significantly from the density of the primary fluidizing agent (air). The calculations have been carried out using an earlier developed, first principles hydrodynamic model of gas-fluidized beds which has been extended with a species conservation equation to calculate the composition of the fluidizing gas {{in the vicinity of the}} evolving bubbles. Besides, the present experimental and theoretical results were compared with predictions obtained from adapted versions of approximate bubble formation models previously reported in the literature. The advanced hydrodynamic model appears to predict the experimentally observed diameters satisfactorily. In addition, the model correctly predicts {{the effect of the}} gas-phase density on the experimentally observed bubble growth. This effect can be explained satisfactorily in terms of the dependence of the interphase momentum transfer coefficient on gas-phase density. Finally, calculations with a three-dimensional version of our hydrodynamic model have been carried out to account for the effect of the front and back wall of the pseudo two-dimensional gas-fluidized bed used in our experiments. Our preliminary computational results indicate that the magnitude of the wall effect strongly depends on the boundary condition enforced for the gas-solid dispersion at these walls. In the case that the no-slip boundary condition was enforced in the calculations for the solid phase, the wall effect was significant and a considerable deviation between computed and experimentally observed bubble growth curves was found. However, when a more realistic partial slip boundary condition for the solid phase was implemented the agreement between theory and experiment could be improved by altering the slip parameter in the partial slip boundary <b>condition</b> <b>expression...</b>|$|E

First we consider removing the if statements. The if statement is responsible for two things: evaluating and testing a condition, and then transferring control to either the “then ” or “else ” branch. We will arrange it so that the <b>condition</b> <b>expression</b> always evaluates to an integer, which we will store into a temporary t 0. We can then test if t 0 is zero and then goes to the “else ” branch, and otherwise fall through to the “then ” branch.

In the shoot of osnla 1 mutant, transcripts of most of Pi transporters were induced (Fig. 3 c). Compared with the WT, expressions of OsPT 6 and OsPT 8 were greatly induced under both Pi-sufficient and -deficient conditions. Although OsPT 2, OsPT 4 and OsPT 10 were also up-regulated under Pi-sufficient condition, their transcript levels did not change under Pi-deficient <b>condition.</b> <b>Expression</b> of OsPT 1 was induced only when osnla 1 mutant was grown under Pi-deficient condition. However, contrary to our finding, Yue et al. (2017) found that OsPT 2 and OsPT 8 were unchanged in leaf under Pi-sufficient conditions. This might be resulted from transcriptional levels of OsNLA 1 and Pi transporters differed in various tissues (Fig. 1 b; Remy et al., 2012). Unlike Pi transporters induced in the shoot, transcripts of Pi transporters were differentially regulated under Pi-sufficient and -deficient conditions in root of osnla 1 mutant (Fig. 3 c).

In contrast, OsPT 6, OsPT 8 and OsPT 10 were down-regulated under Pi-deficient condition, but unchanged under Pi-sufficient condition. The increased or repressed expression of these Pi transporters was caused, at least in part, by accumulated protein level of Pi transporters in osnla 1 mutant, because {{changing the}} expression of OsPT 4 or OsPT 8 affects the expression of Pi transporters in rice (Jia et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015).

This study aimed {{to clarify the}} underlying cause of gastric ulcer in chronic hypoxic condition, by investigating the H,K-ATPase and CA 9 response in rats. Methods: This study was an in vivo experiment, to know the relationship between hypoxia to expression of H,K-ATPase and CA 9 mRNA, and H,K-ATPase and total CA specific activity of chronic systemic rat gastric hypoxia. The result was compared to control. Data was analyzed by SPSS. If the data distribution was normal and homogeneous, ANOVA and LSD post-hoc test were used. However, if the distribution was not normal and not homogeneous, and still as such after transformation, data was treated in non-parametric using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney test. Twenty five male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups: rats undergoing hypoxia for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days placed in hypoxia chamber (10 % O 2, 90 % N 2), and one control group. Following this treatment, stomach of the rats was extracted and homogenized. Expression of H,K-ATPase and CA 9 mRNA was measured using real time RT-PCR. Specific activity of H,K-ATPase was measured using phosphate standard solution, and specific activity of total CA was measured using p-nitrophenol solution. Results: The expression of H,K-ATPase mRNA was higher in the first day (2. 159), and drastically lowered from the third to seventh day (0. 289; 0. 108; 0. 062). Specific activities of H,K-ATPase was slightly higher in the first day (0. 765), then was lowered in the third (0. 685) and fifth day (0. 655), and was higher in the seventh day (0. 884).

The present investigation is concerned with singular fields in wedge-shaped, antisymmetric, composite laminates on whose edges are imposed typical boundary <b>conditions.</b> <b>Expressions</b> of the form s% u: A r e o v = Br ~ se e (I...|$|R
40|$|Fumarate reductase (encoded by frd) and succinate {{dehydrogenase}} (encoded by sdh) of Escherichia coli {{are both}} known to catalyze the interconversion of fumarate and succinate. Fumarate reductase, however, is not inducible aerobically and therefore cannot {{participate in the}} dehydrogenation of succinate. Three classes of suppressor mutants, classified as frd oxygen-resistant [frd(Oxr) ], constitutive [frd(Con) ], and gene amplification [frd(Amp) ] mutants, were selected from an sdh strain as pseudorevertants that regained the partial ability to grow aerobically on succinate. All contained increased aerobic levels of fumarate reductase activity. In frd(Oxr) mutants expression of the operon showed increased resistance to aerobic repression. Under anaerobic <b>conditions</b> <b>expression</b> of the operon became less dependent on the fnr+ gene product, a pleiotropic activator protein for genes encoding anaerobic respiratory enzymes. Exogenous fumarate, however, was still required for full induction, and repression by nitrate was undiminished. Thus, aerobic repression and anaerobic nitrate repression appear to involve separate mechanisms. In frd(Con) mutants expression of the operon became highly resistant to aerobic repression. Under anaerobic <b>conditions</b> <b>expression</b> of the operon no longer required the fnr+ gene product or exogenous fumarate and became immune to nitrate repression. In partial diploids bearing an frd(Oxr) or an frd(Con) allele and phi(frd+-lac) there was no mutual regulatory influence between the two genetic loci. Thus, the frd mutations act in cis and hence are probably in the promoter region. In frd(Amp) mutants the frd locus was amplified without significant alteration {{in the pattern of}} regulation...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of the three methanol-specific methyltransferase 1 operons (mtaCB 1, mtaCB 2, and mtaCB 3) in Methanosarcina acetivorans led to the suggestion that each of them has a discrete function during growth on methanol, which might be reflected in differential gene regulation (Pritchett and Metcalf, Mol. Microbiol. 56 : 1183 - 1194, 2005). To test this suggestion, reporter gene fusions were constructed {{for each of the}} three operons, and their expression was examined under various growth <b>conditions.</b> <b>Expression</b> of the mtaCB 1 and mtaCB 2 fusions was 100 -fold and 575 -fold higher, respectively, in methanol-grown cells than in trimethylamine (TMA) -grown cells. The mtaCB 3 fusion was expressed at low levels on methanol, TMA, and dimethylamine but was significantly upregulated on monomethylamine and acetate. When TMA- or acetate-grown cultures were shifted to methanol, the mtaCB 1 fusion was expressed most highly during exponential phase, whereas the mtaCB 2 fusion, although strongly induced prior to mtaCB 1 expression, did not reach full expression levels until stationary phase. The mtaCB 3 fusion was transiently expressed prior to entry into exponential phase during a TMA-to-methanol substrate shift experiment. When acetate-grown cells were shifted to medium containing both TMA and methanol, TMA utilization commenced prior to utilization of methanol; however, these two substrates were consumed simultaneously later in growth. Under these <b>conditions</b> <b>expression</b> of the mtaCB 2 and mtaCB 3 fusions was delayed, suggesting that methylamines may repress their expression...|$|R
