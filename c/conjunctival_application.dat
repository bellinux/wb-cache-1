Bacterial conjunctivitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa was induced in Hartley guinea pigs. The <b>conjunctival</b> <b>application</b> of SBH or gentamicin was used for treatment, and the results of this treatment were compared with control values. Inflammatory signs, duration of infection (ie, positive culture), and time for the complete resolution of infection with S. aureus or P. aeruginosa were shortened by the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>application</b> of 1 drop (70 &micro;L) of crude SBH twice daily. The potency of SBH was comparable with that of gentamicin. SBH may be a rational agent for the treatment of infective conjunctivitis in humans; it is inexpensive and commonly available to the rural population.

40|$|A {{patient with}} the midgut carcinoid {{syndrome}} with severe diarrhoea and proven hypersecretion of serotonin (5 -HT) {{was treated with}} low doses of verapamil perorally. During treatment the patient was completely relieved of diarrhoea but discrete facial flushing persisted during treatment. When treatment was cessated, diarrhoeas recurred. This patient underwent pentagastrin (PG) provocation repeatedly; during untreated conditions injection of PG released 5 -HT, detectable in peripheral venous blood. Such release was abolished during verapamil treatment, but recurred after withdrawal of the drug. Surgical biopsies from this tumour were studied in two experimental models: cell suspensions and heterotransplants grown in the anterior eye-chamber of immunosuppressed rats. Release of 5 -HT from the cell suspensions was elicited in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation with isoprenaline (IP) suggesting activation of beta-adrenoceptors on the tumour cells. Such release was reduced after pretreatment with verapamil indicating a calcium dependent mechanism. Intraocular tumour transplants also responded with release of 5 -HT into the chamber fluid after <b>conjunctival</b> <b>application</b> of IP. However, pretreatment of the rats with verapamil significantly reduced the IP-stimulated release of 5 -HT...|$|E

40|$|Lymphocyte {{stimulation}} tests (LST) {{were performed}} in five dogs sensitised with ovalbumin (OVA) and seven healthy dogs. In addition, all five OVA-sensitised and two control dogs were tested after two in vivo provocations with OVA-containing eye drops. The isolated cells were suspended in culture media containing OVA and were cultured {{for up to}} 12 days. Proliferation was measured as reduction in 5, 6 -carboxylfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) intensity by flow cytometry on days 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12. A cell proliferation index (CPI) for each day and the area under the curve (AUC) of the CPI was calculated for each dog. All OVA-sensitised dogs demonstrated increased erythema after <b>conjunctival</b> OVA <b>application.</b> The presence of OVA-specific lymphocytes was demonstrated in 2 / 5 OVA-sensitised dogs before and 4 / 5 after in vivo provocation. Using the AUC, the difference between OVA-sensitised and control dogs was significant in all three LST before in vivo provocation (P< 0. 05) and borderline significant (P= 0. 053) in 2 / 3 LST after provocation. The most significant difference in CPI was observed after 9 days of culture (P= 0. 001). This pilot study indicates that the LST allows detection of rare antigen specific memory T-cells in dogs previously sensitised to, but not concurrently undergoing challenge by a specific antigen...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare various {{techniques}} of pterygium surgery including bare sclera, intraoperative mitomycin C <b>application,</b> <b>conjunctival</b> flap reconstruction, and conjunctival autografting technique. Methods: This study {{is designed to}} compare 4 currently used techniques {{in order to determine}} the complication and recurrence rates after pterygium exision. Included in the study were 77 eyes from 60 patients. Bare sclera technique was used to treat 21 primary pterygia;mitomycin C was used to treat 20 (16 primary, 4 recurrent) pterygia; 18 (17 primary, 1 recurrent) pterygia were treated by conjuntival flap reconstruction;and 18 (9 primary, 9 recurrent) pterygia were treated by conjunctival autografting technique. All patients who underwent surgery were followed up for between 6 months and 2 years. Results: Eight recurrences (38. 09 %) were observed in the bare sclera group whereas there were 5 (25 %) recurrences in the mitomycin C group. In the conjunctival flap reconstruction group, 6 (33. 33 %) recurrences were detected. In the conjunctival autografting group, 3 recurrences were observed. There were no major complications threatening visual ability in the surgical patients. Conclusion: A comparison of the groups demonstrated that the recurrence rate was highest in the bare sclera group, and lowest in conjunctival autografting and mitomycin C treatment groups respectively. Although the conjunctival autografting technique is a more difficult and time consuming technique than the others, cosmetic and surgical results were found to be superior. We advise conjunctival autografting for the treatment of pterygium in view of the high recurrence rates of other techniques, and the possible complications of mitomycin C treatment for benign disease...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In a {{quest for}} a needle-free vaccine {{administration}} strategy, we evaluated the ocular conjunctiva as an alternative mucosal immunization route by profiling and comparing the local and systemic immune responses to the subcutaneous or conjunctival administration of tetanus toxoid (TTd), a model antigen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice were immunized either subcutaneously with TTd alone or via the conjunctiva with TTd alone, TTd mixed with 2 % glycerol or TTd with merthiolate-inactivated whole-cell B. pertussis (wBP) as adjuvants. Mice were immunized on days 0, 7 and 14 via both routes, and {{an evaluation of the}} local and systemic immune responses was performed two weeks after the last immunization. Four weeks after the last immunization, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose (2 × LD 50) of tetanus toxin. RESULTS: The <b>conjunctival</b> <b>application</b> of TTd in BALB/c mice induced TTd-specific secretory IgA production and skewed the TTd-specific immune response toward a Th 1 /Th 17 profile, as determined by the stimulation of IFNγ and IL- 17 A secretion and/or the concurrent pronounced reduction of IL- 4 secretion, irrespective of the adjuvant. In conjunctivaly immunized C 57 BL/ 6 mice, only TTd administered with wBP promoted the establishment of a mixed Th 1 /Th 17 TTd-specific immune response, whereas TTd alone or TTd in conjunction with glycerol initiated a dominant Th 1 response against TTd. Immunization via the conjunctiva with TTd plus wBP adjuvant resulted in a 33 % survival rate of challenged mice compared to a 0 % survival rate in non-immunized animals (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Conjunctival immunization with TTd alone or with various adjuvants induced TTd-specific local and systemic immune responses, predominantly of the Th 1 type. The strongest immune responses developed in mice that received TTd together with wBP, which implies that this alternative route might tailor the immune response to fight intracellular bacteria or viruses more effectively...|$|E
