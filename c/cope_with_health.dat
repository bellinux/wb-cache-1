40|$|AbstractHealth shocks {{are among}} the most {{important}} unprotected risks for microfinance clients, but take-up of micro health insurance remains low. A framed field experiment with credit groups in Tanzania, eliciting demand for group versus individual insurance, attributes this to a social dilemma. In a context of joint liability, insurance is a public good because clients can rely on contributions from group members to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>health</b> shocks. We hypothesize that clients have a private incentive to free-ride and forgo individual insurance even when full enrollment optimizes group welfare. The binding nature of group insurance eliminates such free-riding. Our experiment yields substantial support for this hypothesis. Whereas the demand for group insurance is high, a substantial share of clients forgoes individual insurance and relies on peers to repay their loan when falling ill. Group insurance can potentially increase low take-up rates...|$|E

This study investigated age differences and age changes in active behavioral, active cognitive and avoidance coping and related coping to adaptational outcomes, such as physical and mental health. Sixty-one sexagenarians, 46 octogenarians, and 47 centenarians from the Georgia Centenarian Study participated in this longitudinal study to assess <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>health</b> and family events. The results indicated age group differences in active behavioral coping, suggesting that centenarians were less likely to use this mode of coping.

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} from Africa suggests households may not offer full protection against shocks to all its members. The mechanisms driving these outcomes {{are not fully}} understood. This paper explores the role of support networks in <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>health</b> shocks in rural Ethiopia and makes {{a distinction between the}} financial and labour needs resulting from such shocks. Our data show financial needs can be met through a range of strategies undertaken by individuals and/or their household members. Labour needs are often not cushioned within the household and can therefore only be met through support networks. Women with no or few female relatives in their local support networks, resulting from virilocal marriage arrangements, find it more difficult to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the labour needs associated <b>with</b> <b>health</b> shocks. These findings suggest the assumption of full insurance within the household may hold for the financial consequences of health shocks, but not for the labour needs during illness episodes. ...|$|R

However, the Spanish girls have a significantly higher intake of menarcheal pain related drugs. The anthropometric changes accompanying menarche are greater in the immigrants, especially in terms of trunk fatness, leading to an »overweight« characterisation of this sub-sample.

40|$|Moderate {{selenium}} deficiency {{may lead to}} an impaired capacity to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>health</b> challenges. Functional effects of suboptimal selenium intake are not fully known, and biomarkers for an insufficient selenium supply are inadequate. We therefore fed mice diets of moderately deficient or adequate selenium intake for 6 weeks. Changes in global gene expression were monitored by microarray analysis in splenic leukocytes. Genes for four selenoproteins, Sepw 1, Gpx 1, Selh and Sep 15, were the most significantly down-regulated in moderate {{selenium deficiency}}, and this was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Classification of significantly affected genes revealed that processes related to inflammation, heme biosynthesis, DNA replication and transcription, cell cycle and transport were affected by selenium restriction. Down-regulation by moderate selenium deficiency of specific genes involved in inflammation and heme biosynthesis was confirmed by qPCR. Myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities were decreased in selenium-restricted leukocytes, providing evidence for functional consequences. Genes for 31 nuclear factor (NF) -¿B targets were down-regulated in moderate selenium deficiency, indicating an impaired NF-¿B signaling. Together, the observed changes point to a disturbance in inflammatory response. The selenoproteins found here {{to be sensitive to}} selenium intake in murine leukocytes might also be useful as biomarkers for a moderate selenium deficiency in humans...|$|E

As a consequence, many countries (particularly developed ones) started to experience higher proportions of elderly people (over 65).

A number of modelling methods have been employed to assist those concerned to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>health</b> and social care but albeit separately. The literatures so far, identified several techniques that have been employed mostly to model the care integration. However, literatures also suggest that there are some challenges still persist when modelling integrated care.

This paper attempts to prove the reason why despite the fact that many models of integrated care have been developed, problems are still exist. Based on the literatures, the problems exist due to the unsuitable techniques used to model the IC systems as most of the developed models are using single technique. Therefore, new technique to improve the care integration model is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{perception}} of the population about their needs {{must be considered in}} health care planning. Aim: To describe health care needs from the perspective of potential clients of public health services. Material and methods: An enquiry to a representative sample of 202 dwellings, ascribed to a Family Health Service, was done. Subjects were asked about the health problems in their family and neighborhood. Twelve families from this sample were randomly chosen and interviewed about their health conception, needs and demands. Results: The mean age of subjects, per dwelling, was 31 years. Fifty percent were nuclear families and 6 % were mono parental. Perceived problems were economical in 60 % and health related in 12 %. Eighty percent of health problems were related to addictions and violence. Interviewed subjects associated health with lack of services, with their experience with illness and pain and with a risk of social isolation and incommunication. Health care demands were referred to a better medical care. People declared needs in environmental hygiene, physical and mental health self care, food and jobs. Conclusions: Using this information, simple strategies could be implemented to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>health</b> care demands of the population (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 1287 - 94) ...|$|E
40|$|Health {{reforms in}} low and middle-income {{countries}} usually include {{the provision of}} free or subsidized health insurance. In this paper, I examine whether this type of insurance encourages employment by freeing up resources previously used by households to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>health</b> shocks. To isolate the causal effect of providing free health insurance I use a difference-in-differences design that exploits municipal (county) level variation in the rollout of Mexico’s Seguro Popular (SP). My main finding is that SP increases labor supply by retaining workers in the labor force. I propose that this occurs because SP reduces the time burden that dependents in poor health impose on caregivers. Consistent with this channel, I find that the labor supply response triggered by SP is driven by women, in particular those with caregiving responsibilities. Time use estimates provide additional evidence of the mechanism, as they illustrate {{that the increase in}} female labor supply is due to the reallocation of time from caregiving tasks at home to work in the labor market. The finding that SP increases labor supply is especially important, because it shows that the provision of subsidized health insurance need not entail an efficiency loss in the labor market. Specifically, I show that th...|$|E
