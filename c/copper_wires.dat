40|$|Wire bonding {{technology}} is the earliest chip level interconnection technology, {{but it is still}} the most widely used one in integrated circuit (IC) assembly for its noticeable advantages over other interconnection technologies. Traditionally, gold wire has been the dominating wiring materials in wire bonding technique. Gold wire has many distinguished characteristics such as excellent ductility, conductivity and chemical stability. However, the biggest reliability issue of gold wire bonding is associated with intermetallic compound (IMC) generated at the gold wire-aluminum bonding pad interface. The rapid development of IC technology desires devices that are smaller, faster and cheaper; progressive high current or high power devices demand alterative interconnection materials which have thermal properties and electrical conductivity that are superior to those of gold. With many distinguished advantages such as a higher conductivity, superior mechanical properties, less tendency of forming IMC and especially a much lower cost, copper have rapidly gain a foothold as the main potential material to replace gold for the wire bonding in electronic packaging. Although many integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and fabless semiconductor companies are considering the application of <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire</b> in at least some product designs, there are still deep reservations in the industry over the use of this material, particularly due to concerns over in-service product reliability. Corrosion issue is the biggest problem of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages. To prevent the corrosion, epoxy molding compound (EMC) is required to have excellent properties to provide good protection to <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages. Thus the evaluation and selection of epoxy molding compound for <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages are very important. In this study, the corrosion mechanism of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> package is studies and discussed, EMC inherently absorbs moisture or water from the environment, substances contained in EMC may have a tendency to dissolve and ionize in the absorbed water and form an electrolyte, corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> will take place if placed in a suitable electrolyte. Due to its lower nobility compared with gold, <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> has a higher possibility to be corroded under the same conditions, than means the requirement of epoxy molding compound is stricter when used in <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages. Some EMC properties are correlated to the corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> in packages, and the effects of these properties on the corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages are discussed in detail. To fully evaluate epoxy molding compounds, a series of systemic characterization methods are established in this study. EMC properties which affect the corrosion of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> are characterized. The criteria and methodology of EMC selection for <b>copper</b> <b>wiring</b> packages are proposed and demonstrated in this study.

40|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds have {{replaced}} gold wire bonds {{in the majority}} of commercial semiconductor devices for the latest technology nodes. Although economics has been the driving mechanism to lower semiconductor packaging costs for a savings of about 20 % by replacing gold <b>wire</b> bonds with <b>copper,</b> copper also has materials property advantages over gold. When compared to gold, copper has approximately: 25 % lower electrical resistivity, 30 % higher thermal conductivity, 75 % higher tensile strength and 45 % higher modulus of elasticity. <b>Copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds on aluminum bond pads are also more mechanically robust over time and elevated temperature due to the slower intermetallic formation rate - approximately 1 / 100 th that of the gold to aluminum intermetallic formation rate. However, there are significant tradeoffs with <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonding - <b>copper</b> has twice the hardness of gold which results in a narrower bonding manufacturing process window and requires that the semiconductor companies design more mechanically rigid bonding pads to prevent cratering to both the bond pad and underlying chip structure. Furthermore, copper is significantly more prone to corrosion issues. The semiconductor packaging industry has responded to this corrosion concern by creating a palladium coated <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire,</b> which is more corrosion resistant than pure <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire.</b> Also, the selection of the device molding compound is critical because use of environmentally friendly green compounds can result in internal CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) mismatches with the <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds that can eventually lead to device failures during thermal cycling. Despite the difficult problems associated with the changeover to <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire,</b> there are billions of <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonded devices delivered annually to customers.
