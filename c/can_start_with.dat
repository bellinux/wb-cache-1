Some theorists aver that inserting or removing the screen {{in the midst of}} the experiment can force a photon to retroactively decide to go through the double-slits as a particle when it had previously transited it as a wave, or vice versa. Wheeler does not accept this interpretation.|$|E
25|$|The {{nucleation}} reaction <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> any heterogeneous surface, such as rock salt, but Mentos {{have been}} found to work better than most. Tonya Coffey, a physicist at Appalachian State University, found that the aspartame in diet drinks lowers the surface tension in the water and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the process. It has also been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors can also enhance fountain heights. In some cases, dissolved solids that increase the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights. These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble coalescence. Decreased bubble coalescence leads to smaller bubble sizes and greater foaming ability in water. Thus, the geyser reaction will still work even using sugared drinks, but diet is commonly used both {{for the sake of a}} larger geyser as well as to avoid having to clean up a sugary soda mess.|$|E
500|$|If the {{developer}} creates {{a copy of}} an object using the reserved word clone, the Zend engine will check whether a __clone (...) method has been defined. If not, it will call a default __clone (...) which will copy the object's properties. If a __clone (...) method is defined, {{then it will be}} responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> a by-value [...] of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed.|$|E

500|$|An English {{syllable}} {{includes a}} syllable nucleus {{consisting of a}} vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> up to three consonant sounds, as in sprint , and end with up to four, as in texts [...] This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word strengths [...] is thus {{an example of the}} most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in play; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in fly or sly; s and a voiceless stop, as in stay; and s, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in string. Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: [...] can only occur in syllable initial position, and [...] only in syllable final position.|$|E

2500|$|The {{transition}} <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> biodiesel, {{vegetable oil}} refining, and vegetable oil blends, since these technologies {{do not require}} the capital outlay of converting an engine to run on vegetable oils. [...] Because it costs to convert vegetable oil into biodiesel {{it is expected that}} vegetable oil will always be cheaper than biodiesel. [...] After there are production cars that can use straight vegetable oil and a standard type available at gas stations, consumers will probably choose straight vegetable oil to save money. [...] So the transition to vegetable oil can happen gradually.|$|E
2500|$|Even so, {{the books}} are not without criticism. [...] Wavering {{difficulty}} is a common criticism made about the series. The battles tend to be either too hard or too easy. [...] This is mostly attributed to the attainment of the Sommerswerd (a sword forged by gods) in the second book Fire on the Water which drastically increases the wielder's combat abilities. [...] Another reason for {{this would be the}} fact that a player <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> drastically different statistics. [...] Finally, because the books were written to be functional both as a series and as standalone adventures, whether a player would have access to certain special weapons and abilities made difficulty hard to gauge.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some of the}} aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, {{the cavity}} that holds the amino acid can be mutated and {{modified}} to carry unnatural amino acids synthesized in the lab, and to attach them to specific tRNAs. [...] This expands the genetic code, beyond the twenty canonical amino acids found in nature, to include an unnatural amino acid as well. [...] The unnatural amino acid is coded by a nonsense (TAG, TGA, TAA), quadruplet, {{or in some cases}} a redundant rare codon. [...] The organism that expresses the mutant synthetase can then be genetically programmed to incorporate the unnatural amino acid into any desired position in any protein of interest, allowing biochemists or structural biologists to probe or change the protein's function. [...] For instance, one <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> the gene for a protein that binds a certain sequence of DNA, and, by directing an unnatural amino acid with a reactive side-chain into the binding site, create a new protein that cuts the DNA at the target-sequence, rather than binding it.|$|E

2500|$|To {{effectively}} {{convert a}} Lehmer code d'n, d'n−1, ..., d2, d1 into {{a permutation of}} an ordered set S, one <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> {{a list of the}} elements of S in increasing order, and for i increasing from 1 to n set σ'i to the element in the list that is preceded by d'n+1−i other ones, and remove that element from the list. To convert an inversion table d'n, d'n−1, ..., d2, d1 into the corresponding permutation, one can traverse the numbers from d1 to d'n while inserting the elements of S from largest to smallest into an initially empty sequence; at the step using the number d from the inversion table, the element from S inserted into the sequence at the point where it is preceded by d elements already present. Alternatively one could process the numbers from the inversion table and the elements of S both in the opposite order, starting with a row of n empty slots, and at each step place the element from S into the empty slot that is preceded by d other empty slots.|$|E
2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But I wonder if we <b>can</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E
