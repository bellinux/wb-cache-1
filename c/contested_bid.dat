40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{factors influencing}} voluntary forecast disclosure by target companies, whether good/bad news forecasts are disclosed {{and the influence}} of forecasts on the outcome of hostile bids. Disclosure was significantly more likely during <b>contested</b> <b>bids.</b> In agreed bids, probability of forecast disclosure was greater the shorter the <b>bid</b> horizon. In <b>contested</b> <b>bids,</b> forecasts were more likely where there were large block shareholdings, for larger targets and for targets in the capital goods industry. There was a clear tendency to disclose good news forecasts. A significant positive association between forecast disclosure and increase in offer price was found.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{disclosure of}} 250 profit forecasts in 701 UK takeover bids {{in the period}} 1988 to 1992 against five research issues: - Factors influencing disclosure of forecasts - Influence of prevailing market expectations - Effect of disclosure of forecasts {{on the outcome of}} bids - Factors influencing disclosure content in forecasts - Whether forecasts disclosed convey good news Logit analysis and negative binomial regression are the two primary statistical techniques used to analyse the results. Results show the domination of the takeover-context of the research. Two variables accounted for almost all the influence on disclosure of forecasts for both bidders and targets: bid horizon and type of bid. Probability of disclosure of a forecast is greater the shorter the bid horizon and during <b>contested</b> <b>bids.</b> In addition to bid horizon and type of bid, for bidders, year, value of bid and purchase consideration were significant, and for targets value of bid and industry were significant in one of the two models estimated. Evidence supporting the hypothesis that forecast disclosure is more likely when market expectations are out of line with actual results is provided. There is some evidence that forecasts by targets affect the outcome of bids, but there is no such evidence for bidders. Takeover-context variables and forecast-related variables were most relevant in determining disclosures in forecasts. Disclosure content in forecasts was significantly greater during <b>contested</b> <b>bids,</b> in voluntary forecasts and in longer period forecasts. Significantly more assumptions were disclosed by target forecasters and in longer horizon forecasts. Evidence shows a tendency to disclose good news, with some disclosure of bad news. Good news forecasts are more likely during <b>contested</b> <b>bids.</b> Targets are more likely to disclose bad news forecasts, but when bidders disclose bad news it tends to be worse on average than targets' bad news...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} management’s {{motives for}} rejecting initial takeover bids, {{and identify the}} wealth effects of this decision for target shareholders. <b>Contested</b> initial <b>bids</b> are negatively correlated with the relative quality of initial offer premiums and uncorrelated {{with the presence of}} target classified boards. The likelihood of higher follow-on offers is decreasing in initial offer quality, but higher when target firms have a classified board and when target CEO’s have a greater proportion of their personal wealth tied to the close of a transaction. Positive long-run returns to the shareholders of firms that do not ultimately close a transaction suggest that target managers, on average, realize significant performance gains {{in the absence of a}} change-in-control event. Our evidence on forced CEO turnover indicates that CEOs who err in failing to close high quality offers realize significant personal costs.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} a comprehensive analysis of how British merchant banks organise and approach <b>contested</b> <b>bids</b> within the institutional framework of the City. To this end., a number of exploratory hypotheses were derived from a pilot study with five merchant banks in the City as well as discussions with the project supervisor. Interviews were the carried out with 30 leading UK merchant banks belonging to either the Accepting or Issuing houses associations regarding their role, organisational structure, approaches to bidding and defensive issues related to <b>contested</b> <b>bids.</b> The main perceptions and empirical findings from this major survey are then compared with results to analysis of 30 case studies spanning the 1979 - 81 period (supported by analysis of another 10 cases with respect to some issues) and the results are then discussed and analysed in chapters 8 and 9. To obtain an overview: of how self regulation prescribes bid behaviour and practices, interviews were also held with various City bodies. Volume 1 of this dissertation is divided into 5 parts. Part i outlines the research objectives, methodology and literature survey. Part II then examines the results of a survey of opinion of merchant bankers. In Part III, main results of the literature survey and merchant banking field work are compared with evidence derived. from the case studies. Important research findings pertaining to organisational structure of leading UK merchant banks, approaches to strategies and related issues are then identified and highlighted. Contemporary takeover issues which became apparent during this research project are then analysed and possible reforms suggested (Part IV). The final section i. e., Part V considers some for corporate advisory work relating to takeovers in the 1980 s. In the discussion, details of 40 case studies are used to illustrate the main trends. Volume 2, which is not to be generally available to readers gives a cross section of'transcripts of the interviews held with more than 90 merchant bankers, stockbrokers, takeover specialists, American investment bankers, merchant banking analysts, authors, foreign were chant bankers, officials of self-regulatory bodies as well as relevant financial and non-financial data of the merchant banks interviewed during this survey, Findings of this study are numerous and it has illustrated the fact that UK merchant banks approached their takeover assignments through team work with a minimum of 2, a favored norm of 3 and the maximum team size is dependent on the size, time factor and complexity of the transaction itself. Their approach to <b>contested</b> <b>bids</b> which are invariably multi-disciplinary and complicated should not be viewed purely from the financial perspective alone. In both bidding and defending capacities, the merchant subscribe to the hypotheses that while there are general financial and non-financial principles guiding their approaches,flexibility and creativity are essential. Although the bidder has more control over timing in the takeover Did, however, the findings of this survey have shown that in a number of cases, this factor [nay not always favour the buyer because of the emergence of rival bidders. *Moreover. timing is but one element of a bidding/offensive strategy. In essence, the defensive posture is necessarily a response appropriate to the offensive strategy. The share ownership structure of the defending company plays {{a crucial role in the}} final outcome of the bid. Generally, the merchant banks perceive that it is relatively easier to defend a client when the ownership is spread amongst the small investors who are thought to be more loyal to their boards. This is particularly important, for the main defensive thrust is often an appeal to shareholders' loyalty. This is but one aspect of defensive strategies for, although the literature of corporate finance tends to dwell on. only a few defensive strategies, this study finds that their range is wide. Another important finding was the fact that UK stockbrokers (as agents) work very closely with the merchant banks ('as principals) in advising on <b>contested</b> <b>bids.</b> The former are normally consulted for their market expertise. One of the leading stockbroking firms interviewed served 8 of the 17 ACH (Accepting Houses Committee) members. Owing to this special relationship between these two types of financial institutions and possibly their lack of financial power comparable to that of the merchant banks, the stockbrokers are generally constrained from acting as prinicpal advisors in takeover situations. However, with the impending structural changes in the stockbroking business in the mid 1980 s, there is a possibility that either the merchant bank or stockbroking firm assuming dual capacity. Finally, UK merchant banks in the 1980 s will be characterised by a trend towards conglomeracy and the development of fee-based international merchant banking activities especially in the USA and. the Asia/Pacific regions in view of the constriction and competition in domestic corporate financial advisory activities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the content}} of 250 profit forecasts disclosed during 701 takeover bids for public companies listed on the London Stock Exchange in the period 1988 to 1992.  Two variables measure disclosure; one {{based on the number}} of items disclosed and one {{based on the number of}} assumptions disclosed in the forecasts. Hypotheses are tested to assess whether there is a significant association between disclosure and three levels of independent variables: Takeover-context variables (forecaster/party to the bid; type of bid; value of bid); forecast-related variables (circumstances of making the forecast; forecast horizon; period of the forecast) and firm-specific variables (size; leverage; management ownership; substantial shareholdings, financial advisors; auditors / reporting accountants; listing status; industry; nationality).   Negative binomial regression was used in estimating a model explaining disclosures in forecasts. For both number of items disclosed and number of assumptions disclosed, and in all regression models, type of bid, circumstances of making the forecast and the period of the forecast were significant. Disclosures in forecasts were significantly greater during <b>contested</b> <b>bids,</b> in voluntary forecasts and in longer period forecasts. Significantly more assumptions were disclosed by target forecasters and in longer horizon forecasts. Significantly more items were disclosed where the percentage management ownership was lower.
