5|$|Workshops, {{later to}} be known as the East Workshops, were built to {{rehabilitate}} prisoners, and aid in site construction. A blacksmith's shop was constructed in 1852, and a carpenters’ shop was added in 1858. The prison was designed to have other services onsite, including a kitchen, with four boilers, scullery, pantry, <b>cool</b> <b>room</b> and stores; a bakehouse and ovens, with separate stores for flour and bread; as well as a washhouse, laundry and drying room. The building holding these services was completed in 1855. A separate building, a hospital providing medical services, was also planned, but was one of the last to be constructed. The foundations were laid in 1857, but the plans were changed the next year to provide additional space to isolate contagious or dangerous patients. The hospital was finished in 1859.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the more}} novel {{features}} available to first-class passengers was a 7ft. deep saltwater swimming pool, a gymnasium, a squash court, and a Turkish bath which comprised electric bath, steam room, <b>cool</b> <b>room,</b> massage room, and hot room. First-class common rooms were impressive {{in scope and}} lavishly decorated. They included a Lounge {{in the style of}} the Palace of Versailles, an enormous Reception Room, a men's Smoking Room, and a Reading and Writing Room. There was an À la Carte Restaurant {{in the style of the}} Ritz Hotel which was run as a concession by the famous Italian restaurateur Gaspare Gatti. A Café Parisien decorated in the style of a French sidewalk café, complete with ivy covered trellises and wicker furniture, was run as an annex to the restaurant. For an extra cost, first-class passengers could enjoy the finest French haute cuisine in the most luxurious of surroundings. There was also a Verandah Café where tea and light refreshments were served, that offered grand views of the ocean. At 114ft. long X 92ft. wide, the Dining Saloon on D-Deck was the largest room afloat and could seat almost 600 passengers at a time.|$|E

2500|$|Absinthe that is artificially {{coloured}} or {{clear is}} aesthetically stable, {{and can be}} bottled in clear glass. If naturally coloured absinthe is exposed to light or air for a prolonged period, the chlorophyll gradually becomes oxidised, which {{has the effect of}} gradually changing the colour from green to yellow green, and eventually to brown. The colour of absinthe that has completed this transition was historically referred to as feuille morte (dead leaf). In the preban era, this natural phenomenon was favourably viewed, for it confirmed the product in question was coloured naturally, and not artificially with potentially toxic chemicals. Predictably, vintage absinthes often emerge from sealed bottles as distinctly amber in tint due to decades of slow oxidation. [...] Though this colour change presents no adverse impact to the flavour of absinthe, it is generally desired to preserve the original colour, which requires that naturally coloured absinthe be bottled in dark, light resistant bottles. Absinthe intended for decades of storage should be kept in a <b>cool</b> (<b>room</b> temperature), dry place, away from light and heat. Absinthe should not be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, as the anethole may polymerise inside the bottle, creating an irreversible precipitate, and adversely impacting the original flavour.|$|E

40|$|Pineapple {{peduncle}} mold is {{an important}} postharvest problem in Costa Rica and it causes fruit rejection. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify and quantify the most important fungi in different postharvest phases. Monthly samplings were performed during one production year in 2 regions of Costa Rica. The main genera of fungi were identified and characterized at the molecular level. The colony forming units (CFU) were determined in disinfection water, wax, <b>cooling</b> <b>rooms</b> air and in the peel and peduncle of fruits before (NP) and after (P) processing with the common postharvest treatments of the farms. Fruits were stored in <b>cooling</b> <b>rooms</b> during 22 days and at the end incidence and severity of peduncle molds were evaluated. During the year, changes in fungi populations were observed in all postharvest phases and in the fruits, with higher populations in wax than in disinfection water. Fungi population and molds were higher in the peduncle of NP fruits as compared with P fruits, coincident with larger mold populations at the end of storage. Fungi recovered in the <b>cooling</b> <b>rooms</b> air could also be a source for peduncle molds development. Penicillium purpureogenum, P. diversum and Penicllium sp., were the main fungi identified, with an in vitro high sporulation rate and growing in the peduncle. Moreover, different commercial practices, such as waxing and cooling, where spores were captured, can enhance the peduncle molds development, so it is considered important the cleaning of <b>cooling</b> <b>rooms,</b> as well as developing mechanisms to avoid accumulation in wax of important populations of microorganisms...|$|R
