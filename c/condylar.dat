5|$|In 1994, {{an unusual}} form of {{asymmetric}} occipital <b>condylar</b> dysplasia {{was found in}} two Jacob lambs; a possible link to the multi-horn trait has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|The hindlimbs of Patagosaurus {{are based}} on scant material, some femora, a tibia, and a few nondescript pedal bones. Two femora come from an adult, with a single {{additional}} bone known from the juvenile. The adult femora are proportionately different from the juvenile, being mostly straighter and more ovoid in cross-section. The femoral head is well preserved, although lacking the greater trochanter. The distal end is rather symmetrical when viewed from behind, with two similarly sized <b>condylar</b> surfaces. In the juvenile, the fourth trochanter is completely in the proximal end. The tibia has a well-developed cnemial crest, and is also short and robust. The surface that would have articulated with the astragalus in life has the anterior half raised, and the posterior half lowered.|$|E
25|$|Ramus {{fractures}} {{are said}} to involve a region inferiorly bounded by an oblique line extending from the lower third molar (wisdom tooth) region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle, and {{which could not be}} better classified as either <b>condylar</b> or coronoid fractures.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} useful classification, because both the signs and symptoms, and also the {{treatment}} are dependent upon {{the location of the}} fracture. The mandible is usually divided into the following zones for the purpose of describing the location of a fracture (see diagram): <b>condylar,</b> coronoid process, ramus, angle of mandible, body (molar and premolar areas), parasymphysis and symphysis.|$|E
25|$|These two {{bones are}} {{actually}} separated by an articular disc, which divides the joint into two distinct compartments. The inferior compartment allows for {{rotation of the}} <b>condylar</b> head around an instantaneous axis of rotation, corresponding to the first 20mm {{or so of the}} opening of the mouth. After the mouth is open to this extent, the mouth can no longer open without the superior compartment of the temporomandibular joints becoming active.|$|E
25|$|By far, the {{two most}} common {{symptoms}} described are pain and the feeling that teeth no longer correctly meet (traumatic malocclusion, or disocclusion). The teeth {{are very sensitive to}} pressure (proprioception), so even a small change in the location of the teeth will generate this sensation. People will also be very sensitive to touching the area of the jaw that is broken, {{or in the case of}} <b>condylar</b> fracture the area just in front of the tragus of the ear.|$|E
25|$|Formation of the {{temporomandibular}} joints {{occurs at}} around 12 weeks in utero when the joint spaces and the articular disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the {{component of the}} fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between <b>condylar</b> cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Two slits like joint cavities and intervening disk make their appearance in this region by 12 weeks. The mesenchyme around the joint begins to form the fibrous joint capsule. Very {{little is known about}} the significance of newly forming muscles in joint formation. The developing superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle attaches to the anterior portion of the fetal disk. The disk also continues posterior through the petrotympanic fissure and attaches to the malleus of middle ear.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Condylar</b> {{fractures}} {{are classified}} by location {{compared to the}} capsule of ligaments that hold the temporomandibular joint (intracapsular or extracapsular), dislocation (whether or not the <b>condylar</b> head {{has come out of}} the socket (glenoid fossa) as the muscles (lateral pterygoid) tend to pull the condyle anterior and medial) and neck of the condyle fractures. [...] E.g. extracapsular, non-displaced, neck fracture. [...] Pediatric <b>condylar</b> fractures have special protocols for management.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Condylar</b> {{fractures}} {{have higher}} rates of malocclusion which in turn are dependent {{on the degree of}} displacement and/or dislocation. [...] When the fracture is intracapsular there is a higher rate of late-term osteoarthritis and the potential for ankylosis although the later is a rare complication as long as mobilization is early. [...] Pediatric <b>condylar</b> fractures have {{higher rates of}} ankylosis and the potential for growth disturbance., ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, plain {{films of}} the {{mandible}} would be exposed but had lower sensitivity and specificity owing to overlap of structures. [...] Views included AP (for parasymphsis), lateral oblique (body, ramus, angle, coronoid process) and Towne's (condyle) views. [...] <b>Condylar</b> fractures can be especially difficult to identify, depending on the direction of <b>condylar</b> displacement or dislocation so multiple views of it are usually examined with two views at perpendicular angles.|$|E
2500|$|In disc {{displacement}} without reduction {{the disc}} stays anterior to the <b>condylar</b> head upon opening. Mouth opening is limited {{and there is}} no [...] "pop" [...] or [...] "click" [...] sound on opening.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, if {{the mouth}} {{continues}} to open, {{not only are}} the <b>condylar</b> heads rotating within the lower compartment of the temporomandibular joints, but the entire apparatus (<b>condylar</b> head and articular disc) translates. [...] Although this had traditionally been explained as a forward and downward sliding motion, on the anterior concave surface of the glenoid fossa and the posterior convex surface of the articular eminence, this translation actually amounts to a rotation around another axis. [...] This effectively produces an evolute which can be termed the resultant axis of mandibular rotation, which lies {{in the vicinity of the}} mandibular foramen, allowing for a low-tension environment for the vasculature and innervation of the mandible.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{treatment}} for <b>condylar</b> fractures is controversial. There {{are two main}} options, namely closed reduction or open reduction and fixation. Closed reduction may involve intermaxillary fixation, where the jaws are splinted together in the correct position {{for a period of}} weeks. Open reduction involves surgical exposure of the fracture site, which can be carried out via incisions within the mouth or incisions outside the mouth over the area of the condyle. Open reduction is sometimes combined with use of an endoscope to aid visualization of fracture site. Although closed reduction carries a risk of the bone healing out of position, with consequent alteration of the bite or the creation of facial asymmetry, it does not risk temporary damage to the facial nerve or result in any facial scar that accompanies open reduction. A systematic review was unable to find sufficient evidence of the superiority of one method over another in the management of <b>condylar</b> fractures. [...] Paediatric <b>condylar</b> fractures are especially problematic, owing to the remaining growth potential and possibility of ankylosis of the joint. [...] Early mobilization is often recommended as in the Walker protocol.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{fractures}} of the body, {{are classified}} as open or closed. [...] Because fractures that involve the teeth, by definition, communicate with the mouth this distinction is largely lost in mandible fractures. [...] <b>Condylar,</b> ramus, and coronoid process fractures are generally closed whereas angle, body and parasymphsis fractures are generally open.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{fractured}} mandible {{can involve}} one condyle (unilateral) or both (bilateral). Unilateral <b>condylar</b> fracture may cause restricted and painful jaw movement. There may be swelling over the temporomandibular joint region and {{bleeding from the}} ear because of lacerations to the external auditory meatus. [...] The hematoma may spread downwards and backwards behind the ear, which may be confused with Battle's sign (a sign of a base of skull fracture), although this is an uncommon finding so if present, intra-cranial injury must be ruled out. If the bones fracture and overlie each other there may be shortening of {{the height of the}} ramus. This results in gagging of the teeth on the fractured side (the teeth meet too soon on the fractured side, and not on the non fractured side, i.e. [...] "open bite" [...] that becomes progressively worse to the unaffected side). [...] When the mouth is opened, there may be deviation of the mandible towards the fractured side. [...] Bilateral <b>condylar</b> fractures may cause the above signs and symptoms, but on both sides. Malocclusion and restricted jaw movement are usually more severe. Bilateral body or parasymphysis fractures are sometimes termed [...] "flail mandible", and can cause involuntary posterior movement of the tongue with subsequent obstruction of the upper airway. Displacement of the condyle through the roof of glenoid fossa and into the middle cranial fossa is rare. Bilateral <b>condylar</b> fractures combined with a symphyseal fracture is sometimes termed a guardsman's fracture. The name comes from this injury occurring in soldiers who faint on parade grounds and strike the floor with their chin.|$|E
2500|$|Outside the mouth, {{signs of}} swelling, {{bruising}} and deformity {{can all be}} seen. [...] <b>Condylar</b> fractures are deep, so it is rare to see significant swelling although, the trauma can cause fracture of the bone on the anterior aspect of the external auditory meatus so bruising or bleeding can sometimes {{be seen in the}} ear canal. [...] Mouth opening can be diminished (less than 3cm). [...] There can be numbness or altered sensation (anesthesia/paraesthesia in the chin and lower lip (the distribution of the mental nerve).|$|E
2500|$|Intraorally, if the {{fracture}} {{occurs in the}} tooth bearing area, a step may seen between the teeth {{on either side of}} {{the fracture}} or a space can be seen (often mistaken for a lost tooth) and bleeding from the gingiva in the area. There can be an open bite where the lower teeth, no longer meet the upper teeth. [...] In the case of a unilateral <b>condylar</b> fracture the back teeth on the side of the fracture will meet and the open bite will get progressively greater towards the other side of the mouth.|$|E

60|$|Section 129. The ninth (glossopharyngeal) nerve is chiefly sensory; it is {{the special}} nerve of taste, and is {{distributed}} to the tongue. The tenth nerve (vagus) arises {{by a number of}} roots, and passes out of the skull, together with IX and XI, by the foramen lacerum -posterium- [posterius] (f.l.p.). It is a conspicuous white nerve, and runs down the neck {{by the side of the}} common carotid artery. It sends a superior laryngeal branch (Xa) to the larynx. The left vagus passes ventral to the aortic arch, and sends a branch (l.x.b.) under this along the trachea to the larynx-- the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The corresponding nerve on the right (r.x.b.) loops under the subclavian artery. The main vagus, after this branching, passes behind the heart to the oesophagus and along it to the stomach. XI., the spinal accessory, supplies certain of the neck nerves. XII., the hypoglossal, runs out of the skull by the <b>condylar</b> foramen (c.f.), is motor, crosses the roots of XI., X., and IX., passes ventral to the carotid, and breaks up among the muscles of the tongue and neck.|$|E

50|$|<b>Condylar</b> resorption, {{also called}} {{idiopathic}} <b>condylar</b> resorption, ICR, and condylysis, is a temporomandibular joint disorder {{in which one}} or both of the mandibular condyles are broken down in a bone resorption process. This disorder is nine times more likely to be present in females than males, and is more common among teenagers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>condylar</b> canal (or {{condyloid}} canal) is a canal in the condyloid fossa of {{the lateral}} parts of occipital bone behind the occipital condyle. Resection of the rectus capitus posterior {{major and minor}} muscles reveals the bony recess leading to the <b>condylar</b> canal, which is situated posterior and lateral to the occipital condyle. It is immediately superior to the extradural vertebral artery, which is making a loop above the posterior C1 ring to enter the foramen magnum. The anteriomedial wall of the <b>condylar</b> canal thickens to join the foramen magnum rim and connect to the occipital condyle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Condylar</b> {{resorption}} is an idiopathic condition, {{though there}} are some theories relating to its possible cause. Because <b>condylar</b> resorption {{is more likely to}} be in young females, hormonal mediation may be involved. Strain on the temporomandibular joint from orthodontics or orthognathic surgery may be related to the condition. Reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis are other possible causes.|$|E
