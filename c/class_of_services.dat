We sketch an approach to decide controllability for a certain <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Controllability is decided by synthesizing a service that controls the given service. For a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> which abstracts from data, the synthesis problem is already solved. In this paper, we present an approach for a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> that deals with data explicitly. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{focuses on}} <b>Class</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> Interconnection at inter- domain peering points.

The new "CoS Capability Attribute" is deliberately kept simple and denotes the general EF, AF Group and BE forwarding support across the advertising AS. The second "CoS Parameter Attribute" is of variable length and contains {{a more detailed}} description of available forwarding behaviours using the PHB id Code encoding. Each PHB id Code is associated with rate and size based traffic parameters, which will be applied in the ingress AS Border Router for admission control purposes to a given forwarding behaviour.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a Bufferless Optical Packet Switch, which employs shared Fixed Input Tunable Output Wavelength Converters, namely shared-per-wavelength, supporting Quality of Service is presented. The aims of the paper are both to reduce switch costs, by using simpler optical components and low complexity space switching matrices, and to provide service differentiation among packets belonging to different <b>Class</b> <b>of</b> <b>Services.</b> The QoS, expressed in term of Packet Loss Rate, is differentiated by giving the packets different priorities in accessing both the output wavelength channels and the wavelength converters. The related scheduling algorithm and his complexity evaluation is provided in the paper. The effectiveness of the differentiation scheme is evaluated by an analytical model validated through simulations. Results show how the proposed scheme offers a good differentiation in terms of QoS offered to the different <b>Class</b> <b>of</b> <b>Services...</b>|$|E

Through appropriate queueing and scheduling, delay differentiation is first considered for a node, and then extended to an end-to-end perspective.

These <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> interest can be <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> applications (e.g. HTTP, FTP, WWW, DNS and P 2 P), applications (e.g. Skype [310], YouTube [488] and Netflix [331]), or <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> [390]. A <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> for instance based on QoS, encompasses all applications or <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> applications that have the same QoS requirements.

30|$|These {{scenarios}} lead {{to different}} coverage requirements {{as well as}} different network configurations. The <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> is also dependent on the specific scenario.

Speeds have a very variable range since we can consider both soldiers moving by foot and vehicles moving on the ground. The choice of the model is of great importance, since it is possible to verify that performance can drastically change as a result of changing the mobility model simulated[16].|$|E

In this paper we consider a location based service that currently has hundreds of millions of users and we show how we developed a software that is able to discover their exact positions, by only using information publicly disclosed by the service. Our software does not exploit a specific limitation of the considered service.

30|$|For instance, {{consider}} a hypothetical NSP adopting the Differentiated Service (DiffServ) architecture {{and a set}} of <b>Class</b> <b>of</b> <b>Services</b> (CoS), each one satisfying specific network performance requirements specified for the Y. 1541 QoS classes [16]. Thus, each QoS class must guarantee determined maximum values of IPTD, IPTV and PLR. So, it is natural that this NSP adopts these network parameters during the definition of its SLS template. During the service negotiation, the NSP could associate each SLS with the CoS that meets the required quality. Other NSP adopting a different QoS solution can adopt different QoS parameters (e.g., cell loss ratio, maximum cell transfer delay) and different measurement methods.|$|E

It typically differs from objective and structured measure of quality parameters subject to a service provider’s control.

The aim is that of analyzing these profiles in order to recognize what are the most influencing components for QoE...|$|E
