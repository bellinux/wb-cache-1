USE - The corrosion inhibitor is used in a bath for treating light metals and for protecting light metals, preferably to inhibit corrosion of light metal alloys containing copper, iron, cobalt or nickel and in aircraft or car construction (all claimed). It is especially useful for protecting aluminum and magnesium and their alloys. ADVANTAGE - Light metals are often protected from corrosion by a conversion layer but the effect is limited and is lost if the layer is damaged. The present inhibitor is toxicologically harmless, inhibits cathodic corrosion and permits long-term inhibition. It can also be mixed with polymers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE) at the United States Air Force (USAF) Academy has {{undertaken}} work {{to produce a}} standardized test method for determining {{the effect of a}} <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <b>containing</b> chromate on small scale fatigue damage. CAStLE is specifically focusing their research on the effect of chromate primers on the pit-to-crack transition and crack growth under the USAF damage tolerant flaw size (1. 5 mm). Quantifying the chromate effect on the small damage scale is necessary to provide a baseline to compare the efficacy of new and safer coatings on fatigue life. To correctly account for these factors, bare and chromate primered test specimens of AA 7075 -T 651 were produced with a center hole and a corrosion pit {{at the edge of the}} hole, and subsequently fatigued using representative environments and loading schemes until a thumbnail crack of approximately 1 mm radius was produced. How chromate coatings effect fatigue crack growth is dependent on enough chromate leaching from a coating to reduce the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) in the time it takes to grow from a 300 μm pit to a 1 mm fatigue crack. The current results suggest that the amount of chromate required to leach from the primer to affect FCGR may be highly dependent on the amount of chloride present...|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} number of corrosion problems can be solved by coatings. However, even the best protective coatings can fail by allowing the slow diffusion of oxygen and moisture to the metal surface. Corrosion accelerates when a coating delaminates. Often, the problems start when microscopic nicks or pits on the surface develop during manufacturing or through wear and tear. This problem can be solved by the incorporation of a self-healing function into the coating. Several new concepts are currently under development to incorporate this function into a coating. Conductive polymers, nanoparticles, and microcapsules are used to release corrosion-inhibiting ions at a defect site. The objective of this investigation {{is to develop a}} smart coating for the early detection and inhibition of corrosion. The dual function of this new smart coating system is performed by pH-triggered release microcapsules. The microcapsules can be used to deliver healing agents to terminate the corrosion process at its early stage or as corrosion indicators by releasing dyes at the localized corrosion sites. The dyes can be color dyes or fluorescent dyes, with or without pH sensitivity. Microcapsules were formed through the interfacial polymerization process. The average size of the microcapsules can be adjusted from 1 to 100 micron by adjusting the emulsion formula and the microcapsule forming conditions. A typical microcapsule size is around 10 microns with a narrow size distribution. The pH sensitivity of the microcapsule can also be controlled by adjusting the emulsion formula and the polymerization reaction time. Both corrosion indicator (pH indicator) and <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <b>containing</b> microcapsules were formed and incorporated into paint systems. Test panels of selected steels and aluminum alloys were painted using these paints. Testing of compatibility between the microcapsule system and different paint systems are in progress. Initial experiments with the microcapsule containing paint show visible color changes at induced corrosion sites and improvement of corrosion protection. Further investigation of the performance of the coating using electrochemical techniques and long term exposure are currently underway...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{fundamental}} theory of electrochemical anodic polarization, simulated concrete is doped with <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> to prevent <b>corrosion</b> by chloride ion {{in the marine}} environment.

30|$|Acid {{solutions}} generally {{used for}} the removal of rust and scale in industrial processes and the deterioration of metal due to these processes are very significant. Inhibitors are used in these processes to control metal dissolution. Hydrochloric acid is widely used in the pickling of steel and different steel-based alloys[1, 2]. One way of protecting steel from corrosion is to use <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Organic compounds <b>containing</b> heteroatoms are commonly used to reduce the corrosion attack on steel in acidic media[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The recent trend is towards environmentally friendly inhibitors. Most of the natural products are non-toxic, biodegradable, and readily available in plenty. These advantages have incited us to draw a large part of our laboratory program to examine natural substances as <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> such as fennel oil[17], prickly pear seed oil[18], argan extract[18, 19, 20, 21], argan oil[19, 22], rosemary oil[23, 24, 25], Thymus oil[26, 27], pennyroyal mint oil[28], lavender oil[29], jojoba oil[30], and Artemisia[31, 32, 33].|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is {{an event}} of damage or {{deterioration}} of a metal caused by reaction with the environtment.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} and {{the effect}} of temperature and concentration of trans- 4 -hydroxy- 4 ′-stilbazole on the corrosion of mild steel in 1 [*]M HCl solution was investigated by weight loss experiments at temperatures ranging from 303 to 343 [*]K. The studied inhibitor concentrations were between 1 × 10 − 7 [*]M and 1 × 10 − 3 [*]M. The percentage inhibition increased with the increase of the concentration of the inhibitor. The percentage inhibition reached about 94 % at the concentration of 1 × 10 − 3 [*]M and 303 [*]K. On the other hand, the percentage inhibition decreased with the increase of temperature. Using the Temkin adsorption isotherm, the thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of this inhibitor on the metal surface were calculated. Trans- 4 -hydroxy- 4 ′-stilbazole was found to be a potential <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> since it <b>contained</b> not only nitrogen and oxygen, but also phenyl and pyridine rings that are joined together with a double bond (–C=C–) in conjugation with these rings...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - To {{develop a}} new <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> {{formulation}} for carbon steel in low chloride environments. Designlmethodology/approach - Corrosion inhibition efficiencies were evaluated by the weight loss method and by impedance measurement studies. The nature of the inhibition process was evaluated using potentiostatic polarization studies. The nature of the protective film was investigated using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The concept of synergistic effect {{was used in the}} development of the new synergistic inhibitor formulation. Findings - A new <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> formulation, <b>containing</b> tertiary butyl phosphonate (TBP), zinc ions and citrate, has been developed to control the corrosion of carbon steel in low chloride environments. This inhibitor formulation was found to offer a maximum inhibition efficiency of 96 per cent in a neutral pH test environment. It was interesting to observe that the binary system, consisting of higher concentrations of the TBP and zinc ions, offered only 79 per cent inhibition efficiency. The ternary system, consisting of relatively lower concentrations of the phosphonate, zinc ions and citrate offered a higher (96 per cent) efficiency. This ternary inhibitor system also was found to be efficient in acidic as well as basic environments in the pH range 5 - 8. The inhibitor combination was determined to function as a "mixed 8 '-type inhibitor, though being predominantly cathodic. A plausible explanation of the mechanism of corrosion inhibition is proposed. Practical implications - The ternary inhibitor formulations based on phosphonate, zinc ions and another environmentally friendly synergists like citrate will be quite useful for corrosion inhibition of carbon steel in cooling water systems as they contain relatively less concentrations of phosphonate and zinc ions. Originalitylvalue - The research paper presents the results of a new synergistic inhibitor formulation and also discusses the mechanistic aspects of corrosion inhibition...|$|R
