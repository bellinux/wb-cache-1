40|$|Environmental {{aspects of}} <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> {{location}} problems are considered. First, populations which are hypersusceptible to air pollutants are identified {{and then the}} relationships are outlined between <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> location {{and the quality of}} the environment in the context of the users' susceptibility to the pollutants. Three segments of the population are identified as highly sensitive to the adverse effects of air pollution: children, the aged, and sufferers from respiratory and circulatory conditions. Accordingly, some <b>central</b> <b>facilities,</b> such as cr�ches, kindergartens, elementary schools, homes for the aged, and hospitals are recognized as hyper susceptible to environmental pollution. An illustration of an environmental approach to <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> location is presented. A multicriteria optimization model is developed and applied to the location of pediatric hospitals in the Warsaw region. The trade-off between two criteria [...] accessibility to hospitals and environmental quality of the sites for hospital locations [...] is examined. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{improved}} {{safety in}} and around the ARM SGP CART site, the ARM Program recently purchased and installed an aircraft detection radar system at the <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> near Lamont, Oklahoma. The new system will enhance safety measures already in place at the <b>central</b> <b>facility.</b> The SGP CART site, especially the <b>central</b> <b>facility,</b> houses several instruments employing laser technology. These instruments are designed to be eye-safe and are not a hazard to personnel at the site or pilots of low-flying aircraft over the site. However, some of the specialized equipment brought to the <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> by visiting scientists during scheduled intensive observation periods (IOPs) might use higher-power laser beams that point skyward to make measurements of clouds or aerosols in the atmosphere. If these beams were to strike the eye of a person in an aircraft flying above the instrument, damage to the person's eyesight could result. During IOPs, CART site personnel have obtained Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to temporarily close the airspace directly over the <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> and keep aircraft from flying into the path of the instrument's laser beam. Information about the blocked airspace is easily transmitted to commercial aircraft, but that does not guarantee that the airspace remains completely plane-free. For this reason, during IOPs in which non-eye-safe lasers were in use in the past, ARM technicians watched for low-flying aircraft {{in and around}} the airspace over the <b>central</b> <b>facility.</b> If the technicians spotted such an aircraft, they would manually trigger a safety shutter to block the laser beam's path skyward until the plane had cleared the area...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the process of}} building a climate service centred on regional climate model results from the Rossby Centre regional climate model RCA 4. The climate service has as its <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> a web <b>service</b> provided by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute where users can get an idea of various aspects of climate change from a suite of maps, diagrams, explaining texts and user guides. Here we present the contents of the web service and how this has been designed and developed in collaboration with users of the service in a dialogue reaching over more than a decade. We also present the ensemble of climate projections with RCA 4 that provides the fundamental climate information presented at the web service. In this context, RCA 4 has been used to downscale nine different coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) from the 5 th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) to 0. 44 ° (c. 50 km) horizontal resolution over Europe. Further, we investigate how this ensemble relates to the CMIP 5 ensemble. We find that the iterative approach involving the users of the climate service has been successful as the service is widely used and is an important source of information for work on climate adaptation in Sweden. The RCA 4 ensemble samples a large degree of the spread in the CMIP 5 ensemble implying that {{it can be used to}} illustrate uncertainties and robustness in future climate change in Sweden. The results also show that RCA 4 changes results compared to the underlying AOGCMs, sometimes in a systematic way...|$|R

40|$|CIVINSThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the value of BOS contracts to the U. S. Navy with regards to <b>Facility</b> <b>Service</b> Contracting. <b>Facility</b> <b>service</b> contracting generally is NOT an inherently governmental function and is therefore a prime target for government outsourcing to private industry. Recently, a strong emphasis has been placed on utilizing the private sector when functions are not inherently governmental in nature, enabling economics and market forces to prevail. The idea is that outsourcing will provide more value to the Navy since private industry already performs <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> and will compete to win contracts. What is the most appropriate method for the Navy to use when contracting for <b>facility</b> <b>services?</b> The history of Navy service contracting will be discussed in a later section, but the Navy has many options in which to contract for <b>facility</b> <b>services.</b> Each military base or region has different requirements with regards to <b>Facility</b> <b>services.</b> The Navy may use a BOS contract, individual service contracts, or a hybrid of the two. In recent years, pilot programs have been initiated to test the feasibility of web base FSC programs where Regional IDIQ e-FSC's are used such that customers can order services through a web-base program. However, these pilot programs do not address the fundamental issue of whether the Navy should have a BOS contract or individual FSC contracts. U. S. Naval Postgraduate School, CIVINS progra...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} two-echelon maintenance systems with repair facilities both {{at a number}} of local service centers (called bases) and at a central location. Each repair facility may be considered to be a job shop and is modeled as a (limited capacity) open queuing network, while any transport from the <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> to the bases (and vice versa) is modeled as an ample server. At all bases {{as well as at the}} <b>central</b> repair <b>facility,</b> ready-for-use spare parts are kept in stock. Once an item in the field fails, it is returned to one of the bases and replaced by a ready-for-use item from the spare parts stock, if available. The returned failed item is either repaired at the base or shipped to and repaired at the <b>central</b> <b>facility.</b> In the case of local repair, the item is added to the local base stock as a ready-for-use item after repair. If a repair at the <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> is needed, the base orders an item from the central spare parts stock to replenish its local stock, while the failed item is added to the central stock after repair. Orders are satisfied on a first-come-first-serve basis while any requirement that cannot be satisfied immediately either at the bases or at the <b>central</b> <b>facility</b> is backlogged. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define the added value of {{facility}} management (FM) in general and to develop a typology of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> based on their added value in the educational environment. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on a literature review and first assesses the different aspects of FM added value. The different variables and relations between the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> and their effects on the educational achievement are then conceptualised and studied. Findings – Research shows that FM added value is the customer perceived trade-off between the effects of the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> on the outcome of their processes, its costs and risks. On this basis, a typology of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> was constructed around their level of fixity and their influence on the learning outcome. Practical implications – The typology strongly indicates for FM when to engage in the decision-making process relating to the educational environment in order to contribute to education. Also the typology is useful for deriving priorities for adjusting the current use situation of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> to enhance their effectiveness in both a time and financially efficient manner. Originality/value – This paper operationalises the concept of FM added value and provides several hypotheses and firm recommendations for further research to maximise the contribution of FM. The paper also presents a practical framework for evidenced-based decision making on the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> in the educational environment. It thus offers opportunities for FM to support the future learning landscap...|$|R
