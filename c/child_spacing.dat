About 11% of women under age 20 in Benin use some type of family planning, whether traditional or modern methods. Sexually active unmarried women have a higher contraceptive use around 50%, 14% of which is modern contraception.|$|E

40|$|Our {{results show}} that while many women report that they desire no {{additional}} children, few have used the clinic-based <b>child</b> <b>spacing</b> services. There are many factors responsible for the disparity between the desire for no additional children and the utilization of available services. We can only hypothesize the relative contribution of these factors in our population. literacy {{appears to be a}} major contributor and our data con-finns findings elsewhere suggesting that as female literacy increases there are subsequent rises in the use of <b>child</b> <b>spacing</b> services. It is encouraging that health workers in some settings have been particularly successful in their promotion of <b>child</b> <b>spacing</b> activities. It may be helpful to identify what characteri~tics of their work has contributed to their success. While distance to clinic {{is likely to be a}} factor in women's use of services the results from our study suggest that long distance is not a significant barrier to improving the proportion of women using services. The lack of association between women's desire for no additional children and births in the past year is discouraging. This suggests that there are pressures (desire of the partner, lack of em-powerment, and expectations of the extended family) that restrict the use of services by women who would otherwise use them. Based on these findings the following recommendations have been developed: 1. Female literacy programmes should be expanded and special efforts should be made to ensure that all girls have access to educational opportunities. 2. Health personnel who have been particularly successful in promoting <b>child</b> <b>spacing</b> services should be com-mended for their work.

Data was collected using a structured, interview based questionnaire after taking verbal informed consent. The data collected was analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2013 and SPSS v. 19. 0. Results: The data was diverse since the study setting played host to patients from nearly all possible sociodemographic backgrounds available in the vicinity. 72 % {{of the respondents were}} Sindhi ans 27 % were from Urdu linguistic background. 90 % belonged to lower socioeconomic class and 10 % to middle socioeconomic class.

These programs bestow {{a great deal}} of autonomy on women with respect to fertility decision making. It is well known that a number of close relatives in multigenerational and extended family systems influence women&rsquo;s fertility decisions with respect to <b>child</b> <b>spacing</b> and contraceptive use. One approach toward a systematic study of fertility decision making is to explicitly consider the husband&rsquo;s influences on fertility decision making. This study examines the effects of a selected number of factors on the desired birth interval lengths. We interviewed husbands and wives separately from 165 randomly selected households from two poor neighborhoods in the city of Kitwe, Zambia. Three ordinal birth interval groups were obtained for both husbands and wives separately. The effect of selected factors on the likelihood of influencing the three groups was examined using ordinal logistic regression methods. Data from husbands and wives were analyzed separately. Qualitative methods such as semistructured interviews were used to gather extensive information on the various factors that husbands and wives perceive to influence their <b>child</b> <b>spacing</b> decisions. We found differences in accounts with respect to <b>child</b> <b>spacing</b> between husbands and wives, likely {{due to a lack of}} communication.

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{evidence}} of whether <b>child</b> <b>spacing</b> affects the future success of children. As an exogenous source of variation in <b>child</b> <b>spacing,</b> we {{make use of the}} introduction of an administrative rule in the parental leave benefit system in Sweden. This rule made it possible for a woman to retain her previous high level of parental leave benefits, i. e., 90 percent wage replacement, without entering the labor market between births provided that the interval between the births did not exceed 24 months. The rule had a much larger effect on the birth spacing behavior for native-born mothers compared to foreign-born mothers due to their differential attachment to the labor market. We find that the rule caused a reduction in spacing among native-born mothers as compared to the foreign-born mothers. For individuals born by native-born mothers, the reform also caused a decrease in educational attainment. Thus, this suggests that the effect of spacing children closer has a negative impact on children’s future outcomes. We provide additional evidence that this is likely due to the strong effects of early environment on the capacity for human skill development as discussed by Knutsen et al. (2006).
