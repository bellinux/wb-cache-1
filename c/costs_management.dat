Moreover, effective <b>cost</b> <b>management</b> approaches {{have contributed to}} firms’ competitive advantage in relation to cost leadership strategy. Consequently, firms have implemented contemporary <b>cost</b> <b>management</b> systems, such as activity-based management, business process re-engineering, life-cycle costing, target costing, and theory of constraint (TOC), {{to enable them to}} become low-cost producers and compete effectively and sustain their performance.

Use of recyclable plastic packages is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive. The adoption of reusable plastic containers will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods. The cost associated with reusable plastic containers are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling <b>costs,</b> <b>management</b> costs, and costs resulting from losses. Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost of the containers as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime of reusable plastic containers. One cycle consists of the initial stages of processing plastic containers {{all the way to the}} use and recycling of these containers by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for reusable plastic containers as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these reusable containers need additional transportation to recycling facilities. Reusable plastic containers also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor <b>costs.</b> <b>Management</b> costs exists because reusable plastic container stock count needs to be managed. The final cost of reusable plastic containers is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system. Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting reusable plastic containers.|$|E
