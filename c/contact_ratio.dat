40|$|Abstract: Basic {{experiment}} for estimating a solid <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio</b> {{of dried}} interface by longitudinal ultrasonic wave pulses is attempted. The area ratio is estimated by echo height ratio H defined by sound pressure which depends on central frequency in one cycle of received waves. H is different by distance and topography {{of the solid}} contact part and wavelength, even if the solid <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio</b> is same. However, one law is clarified by arranging this relation with dimensionless distance Λ(=ι/λ) which depends on the distance ι of the solid contact point and the wavelength λ. H is shown by a curve which depends only on the solid <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio,</b> and then, it for any area ratio monotonously approaches the non-contacting area ratio with increasing Λ. This tendency shows that the solid <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio</b> can be directly estimated from the echo height ratio measured by using the high frequency probe. Since the attenuation of the high frequency wave is remarkable, however, {{there is a limit}} of the measurement thickness. Therefore, the measurement by the low frequency probe is required. H in this region is not decided only by the non-contacting area and rapidly approaches to zero with decreasing Λ. The behaviour of this H is governed with the stiffness of contacting two surfaces. Then, the equation for the estimation of the <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio</b> considering the effect of this stiffness is proposed. The solid <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio</b> estimated from H observed in the contact of two-dimensional regular rough surface with constant distance ι an...|$|R

Therefore, reliable information on contact frequency within and among groups can better inform disease modeling and management. We compared three methods of assessing contact patterns: (1) space-use overlap (volume of interaction [VI]), (2) direct contact rates measured by simultaneous {{global positioning system}} (GPS) locations (apart), and (3) direct contact rates measured by proximity loggers (PLs; 1 -m detection) among female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We calculated the PL∶GPS <b>contact</b> <b>ratios</b> to see whether both devices reveal similar contact patterns and thus predict similar pathogen transmission patterns. Contact rates measured by GPS and PLs were similarly high for two within-group dyads (pairs of deer in the same social groups). Dyads representing separate but neighboring groups (high VI) had PL∶GPS <b>contact</b> <b>ratios</b> near zero, whereas dyads further apart (intermediate VI) had higher PL∶GPS <b>contact</b> <b>ratios.</b> Social networks based on PL contacts showed the fewest connected individuals and lowest mean centrality measures; network metrics were intermediate when based on GPS contacts and greatest when based on VI. Thus, the VI network portrayed animals to be more uniformly and strongly connected than did the PL network. We conclude that simultaneous GPS locations, compared with PLs, substantially underestimate the impact of group membership on direct contact rates of female deer and make networks appear more connected. We also present evidence that deer coming within the general vicinity of each other {{are less likely to}} come in close contact if they are in neighboring social groups than deer whose home ranges overlap little if at all. Combined, these results provide evidence that direct transmission of disease agents among female and juvenile white-tailed deer is likely to be constrained both spatially and by social structure, more so than GPS data alone would suggest...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of a model for the prediction of the dynamic behavior of geared systems with emphasis on understanding the effects and importance of parametric excitation resulting from meshing gear teeth. Utilizing a combination of sub-system models developed through both experimental and theoretical techniques, a complete model of a drive train system is used to validate both modeling and solution procedures. The source of the parametric excitation is the time-varying stiffness associated with the meshing of gear teeth. The gear tooth model has been developed using finite element analysis. The gear tooth model is coupled with shaft and bearing models developed using an energy approach and finally with a housing model found using experimental modal techniques. Analysis of the resulting equations of motion is performed using techniques founded in Floquet theory allowing for the determination of both system response and stability properties. Based on the results, it can be concluded that spiral bevel gears operating at small <b>contact</b> <b>ratios</b> are likely to give rise to large amplitude vibrations and parametric instabilities. These responses are due to a combination of low mean gear mesh stiffness and relatively large amplitude parametric excitation created by meshing spiral bevel gears operating at low <b>contact</b> <b>ratios.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{trend in}} gear {{industry}} is an increased focus on gear transmission efficiency. This thesis {{focuses on the}} understanding of how different gear manufacturing methods – particularly {{the contribution of the}} running-in process – affect the surface characteristics and friction response, with the purpose of increasing gearbox efficiency. The thesis consists of a summary and five appended papers. The research hypothesis in paper A and paper B was that the dry elastic <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio</b> is a descriptive parameter for the contact condition. Paper A deals with the influence of manufacturing method on the initial contact conditions. The emphasis in paper B is the changes that occur during running-in and correlating these changes to design requirements. Paper C examines the influence of manganese phosphate coating and lubricants, with respect to friction and the risk of scuffing at the initial contact. Paper D examines the effect of running-in load on the friction response for different surfaces. In paper E, {{the question of whether the}} load during running-in influences the gear mesh efficiency is further expounded. The main conclusions of this thesis are that the running-in influences the gear mesh efficiency; a high running-in load enhances the gear mesh efficiency. The difference in mesh efficiency is in the range of one tenth of a per cent. Thus, the influence of running-in cannot be neglected because it is in the same order of magnitude as reported for other gear efficiency enhancements. Furthermore, the dry elastic <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio</b> presents a descriptive measure of how surface topography influences the contact, at both a global (form deviation) and local (roughness) level. The surface topography caused by the manufacturing method has a significant influence on the <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio.</b> Shaving was found to have the highest <b>contact</b> area <b>ratio,</b> and would therefore be the best choice if deviations from case hardening could be minimised. It was also confirmed that surfaces coated with manganese phosphate raise the limiting load for scuffing failure up to 13 times compared to the uncoated ground equivalent. QC 20141002 </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{transmission}} and power transformation from the power engine to the working machine, gear pairs, are mostly used in mechanical engineering due to the ir compactness of the structure, high reliability and capacity. One way of improving the performance characteristics of gear pairs, and thus the gear transmitters, {{is to increase the}} number of simultaneously meshed pairs of teeth, or increasing the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> To this end, this paper analyzes in detail the partial and simultaneous influence of the number of teeth and tooth profile shapes, moving through shifting coefficient and pressure angle, to the number of simultaneously meshed pairs of teeth. The obtained results allow us to define the optim um parameters of cylindrical gear pairs, in terms of the size of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> Introduction The k inematic indicator of the existence of the transmitting continuity of a rotary movement is the total <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> In order to achieve the transmitting continuity of a rotary movement, the total <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> must be higher than one. Based on the total <b>contact</b> <b>ratio,</b> the information on the number of simultaneously meshed pairs of the teeth which rotate during the contact period is obtained. For example, if the  – one and two pairs of teeth alternately take turn, and if the  – two and three pairs of teeth alternately take turn, etc. It should be noted that the  is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving multiple meshes. The next condition to meet is the compatibility between the accuracy of teeth production, the teeth rigidity and the intensity of the total load of the teeth pair. The influence of the addendum coefficient on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is shown in the paper (Li, 2008). It is shown that changes in the addendum coefficient in conjunction with the corresponding values of the shifting coefficient and gear ratio can achieve the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> value higher than four. The paper (Imrek, 2009) showed that the appropriate structural solution of the form of the teeth of spur gears can achieve a double mesh of the teeth at all points of the lenght of the line of action, when the value of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is less than two. The mathematical model of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> This section presents a mathematical model (equations from 1 to 4) and the algorithm (Fig. 1) to determine the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> The effect of the pressure angle and the number of teeth on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> This section analyzes the effect of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> using equation 4. Fig s. 2, 3 and 4 show the effect of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the size of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> when the shifting coefficient and, and when the number of the teeth on the pinion is in the interval from. The analysis shows that the influence of the number of the teeth on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is much more pronounced at smaller values of the pressure angle. It can be concluded that the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> increases with the number of teeth and with a reduction in the pressure angle. The g radient of enhancement of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is more expressed at lower values of the gear ratio and at lower pressure angles. The effect of the pressure angle, the number of teeth and the shifting coefficient on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> This section analyzes the effect of the pressure angle, the number of teeth meshed and the shifting coefficient on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> using equation 3. Shifting coefficients This section shows the influence of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the size of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> when the shifting coefficients are and when the number of the teeth on the pinion is in the interval from (Fig s. 5, 6 and 7). The influence of the number of the teeth on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is significantly higher when the shifting coefficients are higher than zero, but at the same time the value of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is l ower. Shifting coefficients and This section shows the influence of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the size of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> when the shifting coefficients are and, and when the number of the teeth on the pinion is in the interval from (Fig s. 8, 9 and 10). When the shifting coefficients of the pinion are positive and the shifting coefficients of the gear are negative, the influence of the number of the teeth on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is lower than in the case when both shifting coefficients are positive. At the same time, the interval number of the teeth of the pinion is increased, when the triple mesh is achieved. Also, the value of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is increased. Shifting coefficients and This section shows the influence of the pressure angle and the number of the teeth meshed on the size of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> when the shifting coefficients are  and, and when the number of the teeth on the pinion is in the interval from (Fig s. 11, 12 and 13). When the shifting coefficient s of the pinion are negative and the shifting coefficients of the gear are positive, the influence of the number of the teeth on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> is much lower compared to the case when both coefficients are positive or when the shifting coefficient of the pinion is positive, a the gear's one is negative. At the same time, the interval number of the teeth of the pinion is increased, when the triple mesh is achieved. In this case, the highest values of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> were obtained.   The interval of the pressure angle was increased when the triple mesh of the teeth is achieved. The change of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> by changing the addendum coefficient T he paper (Li, 2008) analyzed the impact of the addendum coefficient () on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> of the cylindrical gear pair. The analysis was conducted for two gear pairs, when the gear ratio  and, and when the shifting coefficients. What was shown in both variants is that the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> increases with the growth of the addendum coefficient. To perceive the simultaneous influence of the addendum coefficient and the shape of teeth profiles on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio,</b> the shifting coefficient was changed in the paper, and the results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Conclusion Higher values of the number of teeth meshed gears and higher values of the gear ratio correspond to higher values of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> In contrast, the lower values of the pressure angle correspond to higher values of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> Thereby, the gradient of the influence of the number of teeth and the pressure angle on the  transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> depends on the value of the shifting coefficient. This gradient has the highest value when the shifting coefficients of the pinion and the gear are negative. The n egative values of the shifting coefficient of the pinion and the positive values of the shifting coefficient of the gear cause the smallest gradient influence of the number of teeth and the pressure angle on the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> At the same time, the combination of shifting coefficients cause s the highest value of the  transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio.</b> The a nalysis has shown that by varying the number of teeth of the gear pair, the pressure angle and the shifting coefficient, the value of the transverse <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> higher than three cannot be accomplished. This means that during the contact period only a double and triple mesh of teeth can be achieved. For achieving the quadruple mesh of teeth, it is necessary to change the addendum coefficient.  </p...|$|E

In order to bypass this complexity, typically, the porous medium approach has been used for applications allow relative coarse resolution. However, for sintering studies, the traditional effective conductivity determination may not be directly applicable. Firstly, the porosity variation may be very rigorous due to the non-uniform densification process with a stiff temperature gradient. Furthermore, a fine control volume is required for the fine temperature resolution for studying the effect on unbalance densification rate within packings.

Therefore in high <b>contact</b> <b>ratio</b> gearing the load transfer from one tooth mesh to another takes place at a lower magnitude of load and the noise produced by this kind of a gearing will be lower.

Methods: Occupational cohorts with hospital contacts 1994 – 1998 and 1999 – 2003. Standardized hospital <b>contact</b> <b>ratios</b> (SHCR) were estimated using national rates and ranked by SHCR size. Results: For non-officers in 1994 – 1998, infectious diseases {{had the highest}} SHCR, followed by neoplastic and endocrinal diseases; in 1999 – 2003 skin diseases were followed by endocrinal and gastrointestinal diseases. For fishermen in 1994 – 1998, nervous system, gastrointestinal, and skin diseases had the highest SHCRs; in 1999 – 2003 it was nervous system, skin, and lymphohematopoietic diseases. As for skin diseases, male fishermen and non-officer seamen generally had increased SHCRs, but engine room personnel specifically had a low SHCR for eczema (eight cases). Fishermen had high SHCRs for tuberculosis in both time periods (six and nine cases, respectively). Non-office...|$|R
