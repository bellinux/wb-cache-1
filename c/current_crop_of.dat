25|$|Even {{excluding}} Sussex and London, South-east England {{has been}} one of the key areas of English folk music and collection. It had retained a strong tradition of wassailing, and seafaring songs were important in the coastal counties of Kent and Hampshire. Arguably the published collection of oral material was made in this area by John Broadwood, as Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex (1843). When the first revival was at its height in the first decade of the 20th century, George Gardiner and Alice Gillington both collected songs in Hampshire, Lucy Broadwood in Surrey, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, Alfred Williams in Oxfordshire and Berkshire and Cecil Sharp in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Kent. In the second folk revival the region contributed several figures, with probably the most important being Martin Carthy from Hertfordshire. The most significant British folk rock group from the region were the Oyster Band, formed in Canterbury, while guitarist John Martyn came from Surrey and fiddle player Chris Leslie from Banbury in Oxfordshire. From the <b>current</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> young folk musicians probably the most prominent are Spiers and Boden from Oxfordshire and Chris Wood, born in Kent. The region is host to numerous folk clubs, and festivals, including the Oxford festival and Fairport’s Cropredy Convention in Oxfordshire and St Albans in Hertfordshire.|$|E

Queensland government is encouraging people for hardwood plantation in inland (low rainfall) area of Southeast Queensland (SEQ). However, the economic viability of the plantation is suspicious. Since the carbon sequestration is payable in the Kyoto context, this study has compared the total soil carbon and its long-term in-/decreasing rate in scrubland, pastureland, cropping land and spotted gum land in Krasnozem soil of Kingaroy, an inland SEQ. We have demonstrated how the timeline of land use transformation could be useful to triangulate the soil carbon trends efficiently and effectively. Isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to a Eurovector elemental analyser was used for soil analysis. The lowest amount of soil carbon was found in cropping land (77. 39 t/ha up to 110 cm), which was even bit lower than the global average of similar land use types (80 t/ha up to 100 cm). The soil carbon under the mature spotted gum (306 tC/ha) was found much higher than the world average soil carbon amount of similar region's forest and was closer to the world richest soil carbon boreal forest. The annual decreasing rate of soil carbon in cropping land was found 2. 6811166 percent which was almost similar to the ROTHC modelled value.

We quantified {{the response of}} maize yield to projected climate change and to three key management options – planting date, fertilizer use and cultivar choice – using the crop simulation model, agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM), at two contrasting sites in Zimbabwe. Three climate periods up to 2100 were selected to cover both near- and long-term climates. Future climate data under two radiative forcing scenarios were generated from five global circulation models. The temperature is projected to increase significantly in Zimbabwe by 2100 with no significant change in mean annual total rainfall. When planting before mid-December with a high fertilizer rate, the simulated average grain yield for all three maize cultivars declined by 13 % for the periods 2010 – 2039 and 2040 – 2069 and by 20 % for 2070 – 2099 compared with the baseline climate, under low radiative forcing. Larger declines in yield of up to 32 % were predicted for 2070 – 2099 with high radiative forcing. Despite differences in annual rainfall, similar trends in yield changes were observed for the two sites studied, Hwedza and Makoni. The yield response to delay in planting was nonlinear. Fertilizer increased yield significantly under both baseline and future climates. The response of maize to mineral nitrogen decreased with progressing climate change, implying {{a decrease in the}} optimal fertilizer rate in the future.

Plant {{growth and development}} is dependent on 17 essential nutrient elements, among them, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) {{are the two most}} important mineral nutrients.
