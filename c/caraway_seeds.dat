5|$|Several foods have an {{association}} with the city. Sally Lunn buns (a type of teacake) have long been baked in Bath. They were first mentioned by name in verses printed in the Bath Chronicle, in 1772. At that time they were eaten hot at public breakfasts in Spring Gardens. They can be eaten with sweet or savoury toppings and are sometimes confused with Bath buns, which are smaller, round, very sweet and very rich. They {{were associated with the}} city following The Great Exhibition. Bath buns were originally topped with crushed comfits created by dipping <b>caraway</b> <b>seeds</b> repeatedly in boiling sugar; but today seeds are added to a 'London Bath Bun' (a reference to the bun's promotion and sale at the Great Exhibition). The seeds may be replaced by crushed sugar granules or 'nibs'.|$|E

30|$|The ripe {{fruits of}} caraway {{is used as}} {{diuretic}} in Moroccan Traditional Medicine. The diuretic effects of acute and sub-chronic oral dose of 100  mg/kg <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> aqueous extract was compared with 10  mg/g furosemide in normal male Wistar rats. <b>Caraway</b> <b>seed</b> extract increased the urine output, total volume of excreted urine, urinary level of K+ and Na+ comparable with furosemide in except of urinary K+ level. The plasma K+ and Na+ was not affected from <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> extract. The administration of <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> aqueous extract for 8  days showed strong diuretic effects and virtually {{had no effect on}} urinary K+ excretion for the entire 8  days. <b>Caraway</b> <b>seed</b> extract had no renal toxicity during 8  days of treatment [64].|$|R
30|$|<b>Caraway</b> <b>seed</b> {{aqueous extract}} {{decreased}} the cholesterol and triglycerides in normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats. Six hours after oral administration of 20  mg/kg <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> aqueous extract, the plasma level of triglycerides and cholesterols of normal rats decreased. Oral single dose of <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> extract decreased the plasma cholesterol levels only in streptozotocin induced rats. No change {{was observed in}} plasma triglycerides concentration in caraway treated streptozotocin induced rats. Repeated oral administration of caraway extract for 15  days significantly reduced the plasma triglycerides in normal and streptozotocin rats [65].|$|R
40|$|Different {{potentially}} therapeutic {{approaches to}} prevent or attenuate gentamicin (GEM) induced nephrotoxicity have been proposed. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the possible protective effects of <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> oil against GEM-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Rats (24) were randomly assigned into four equal groups: i) normal control group, ii) treated with GEM, iii) pretreated with orally <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> oil 10 (mg kg− 1) plus GEM and iv) treated with GEM and <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> oil 10 mg kg− 1. Biochemical examinations were utilized for evaluation of the oxidative stress and renal nephrotoxicity. Creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were determined. Administration of gentamicin to rats induced a marked renal failure, characterized by a significant increase in plasma creatinine and BUN concentrations. The animals treated with gentamicin alone showed a significantly higher plasma MDA level andlower SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities when compared with the control group. Treatment and simultaneous treatment with <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> oil produced amelioration in MDA and increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD, GSH-Px and CAT when compared with the gentamicin treated group. In addition, GEM nephrotoxicity increased renal inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL- 6 and IFN-γ). Pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) in the test groups administered <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> oil. These findings suggest that <b>caraway</b> <b>seed</b> oil treatment attenuates renal dysfunction and structural damage through the reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation in rats...|$|R
25|$|Carvone forms two {{mirror image}} forms or enantiomers: R-(–)-carvone smells like {{spearmint}} leaves. Its mirror image, S-(+)-carvone, smells like <b>caraway</b> <b>seeds.</b> The {{fact that the}} two enantiomers are perceived as smelling different is evidence that olfactory receptors must contain chiral groups, allowing them to respond more strongly to one enantiomer than to the other. Not all enantiomers have distinguishable odors. Squirrel monkeys have also {{been found to be}} able to discriminate between carvone enantiomers.|$|E

The bread is oval or rectangular and baked in a tandoor, a cylindrical oven that is the primary cooking equipment of the sub-continental region. The Afghan version of the tandoor sits above ground and is made of bricks, which are heated to cook the bread. The bread, also known as naan, is shaped and then stuck to the interior wall of the oven to bake. Black cumin or <b>caraway</b> <b>seeds</b> are often sprinkled on the bread, as much for decoration as for taste, and lengthwise lines are scored in the dough to add texture to the bread.|$|E

2500|$|Iceland's {{signature}} {{alcoholic beverage}} is brennivín (literally [...] "burnt [...] wine"), {{which is similar}} in flavouring to the akvavit variant of Scandinavian brännvin. It {{is a type of}} schnapps made from distilled potatoes and flavoured with either <b>caraway</b> <b>seeds</b> or angelica. Its potency has earned it the nickname svarti dauði ("Black Death"). Modern distilleries on Iceland produce vodka (Reyka), gin (Ísafold), moss schnapps (Fjallagrasa), and a birch-flavoured schnapps and liqueur (Foss Distillery’s Birkir and Björk). Martin Miller blends Icelandic water with its England-distilled gin on the island. Strong beer was banned until 1989, so bjórlíki, a mixture of legal, low-alcohol pilsner beer and vodka, became popular. Several strong beers are now made by Icelandic breweries.|$|E
2500|$|S-(+)-Carvone is the {{principal}} constituent (60–70%) of the oil from <b>caraway</b> <b>seeds</b> (Carum carvi), which is produced {{on a scale of}} about 10 tonnes per year. [...] It also occurs to the extent of about 40–60% in dill seed oil (from Anethum graveolens), and also in mandarin orange peel oil. R-(–)-Carvone is also the most abundant compound in the essential oil from several species of mint, particularly spearmint oil (Mentha spicata), which is composed of 50–80% R-(–)-carvone. [...] Spearmint is a major source of naturally produced R-(–)-carvone. [...] However, the majority of R-(–)-carvone used in commercial applications is synthesized from R-(+)-limonene. The R-(–)-carvone isomer also occurs in kuromoji oil. Some oils, like gingergrass oil, contain a mixture of both enantiomers. Many other natural oils, for example peppermint oil, contain trace quantities of carvones.|$|E
