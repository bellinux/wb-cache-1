5000|$|Consular officers, being {{nominally}} {{more distant}} from the politically sensitive aspects of diplomacy, can more easily render {{a wide range of}} services to private citizens, enterprises, et cetera. They may be more numerous since diplomatic missions are posted only in a nation's capital, while consular officials are stationed in various other cities as well. However, {{it is not uncommon for}} individuals to be transferred from one hierarchy to the other, and for consular officials to serve in a capital carrying out strictly consular duties within the [...] "consular section" [...] of a diplomatic post, e.g., within an embassy. Some countries routinely provide their embassy officials with consular commissions, including those without formal consular responsibilities, since a <b>consular</b> <b>commission</b> allows the individual to legalize documents, sign certain documents, and undertake certain other necessary functions.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Muller's career took a new turn. The Dutch government appointed him government commissioner in charge {{of one of the}} main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in Oldebroek to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in Nunspeet. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the <b>Consular</b> Examinations <b>Commission,</b> this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.|$|R
25|$|Since 1979 cars {{operated}} by foreign embassies, high <b>commissions,</b> <b>consular</b> staff, and various international organisations {{have been given}} plates with a distinguishing format of three numbers, one letter, three numbers. The letter is D for diplomats or X for accredited non-diplomatic staff. The first group of three numbers identifies the country or organisation to whom the plate has been issued, the second group of three numbers is a serial number, starting at 101 for diplomats (although some embassies were erroneously issued 100), 400 for non-diplomatic staff of international organisations, and 700 for consular staff. Thus, for example, 101D101 identifies the first plate allocated to the Afghan embassy, and 900X400 is the first plate allocated to the Commonwealth Secretariat.|$|R
5000|$|Consuls {{of various}} ranks may have {{specific}} legal authority for certain activities, such as notarizing documents. As such, diplomatic personnel with other responsibilities may receive <b>consular</b> letters patent (<b>commissions).</b> Aside from those {{outlined in the}} Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, there are few formal requirements outlining what a consular official must do. For example, for some countries, consular officials {{may be responsible for}} the issuance of visas; other countries may limit [...] "consular services" [...] to providing assistance to compatriots, legalization of documents, etc. Nonetheless, consulates proper will be headed by consuls of various ranks, even if such officials have little or no connection with the more limited sense of consular service.|$|R

5000|$|In recent years, DSS has {{expanded}} its overseas investigations program with A/RSO-I's (Assistant Regional Security Officer-Investigators) also known as [...] "Overseas Criminal Investigators." [...] These agents are given special training in consular functions, and are <b>commissioned</b> <b>consular</b> officers. However, they spend {{a large amount of}} their time working with the fraud units in consular sections, investigating visa and passport fraud, alien smuggling and human trafficking, although they have responsibilities outside of their respective Consular assignments for mission security. They work closely with host country law enforcement agencies, and have recently been instrumental in dismantling several large alien smuggling rings. Where there exists an identifiable nexus to the United States, DSS coordinates their alien smuggling investigations with the resident or regional Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Attache.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, DSS has {{expanded}} its overseas investigations program with ARSO-I's (Assistant Regional Security Officer-Investigators), also known as [...] "Overseas Criminal Investigators." [...] These agents are given special training in consular functions and are <b>commissioned</b> <b>consular</b> officers. However, they spend {{a large amount of}} their time working with the fraud units in consular sections, investigating visa and passport fraud, as well as crimes that have a nexus to those documents, including terrorism, organized crime, trafficking in persons, and narcotics violations. The ARSO-I's may work alien smuggling and human trafficking investigations alongside the resident or regional U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Attaché who typically has jurisdictional primacy in these arenas. At the U.S. border, ARSO-I's may work alien smuggling, human trafficking, and passport and visa fraud cases with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). In addition, ARSO-I's also have responsibilities outside of their respective Consular assignments for mission security.|$|R
