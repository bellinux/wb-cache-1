The player takes the role of one such devil child, and battles against demons; the devil <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not fight directly themselves, however, but have allied demons in their party fight for them. The player can choose to talk to demons instead of fighting them, {{to try to make}} them join the player's party, and can increase their allied demons' power by fusing multiple demons with each other.|$|E
5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five <b>children</b> <b>do</b> have a spurt. This suggests that most <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not need principles or constraints {{in order to}} successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied <b>children</b> <b>do,</b> and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not have access to the same auditory base that hearing <b>children</b> <b>do.</b> Orally trained deaf <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E

25|$|Turkle {{talks about}} the nature of privacy in the post 9/11 world, arguing that privacy was sacrificed in {{exchange}} for safety. Turkle argues that because they have grown up as part of a world in which privacy is regarded as increasingly tenuous, <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not always appreciate the full value of privacy, which in turn causes them to share even more personal details on the web. This further depreciates the value of privacy in a self-perpetuating cycle.|$|E

25|$|Compared to children, {{adolescents}} {{are more likely}} to question others' assertions, and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths. Through experience outside the family circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger <b>children</b> <b>do</b> not make.
