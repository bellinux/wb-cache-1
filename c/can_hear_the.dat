5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
5|$|I <b>Can</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>the</b> Heart Beating as One is {{the eighth}} studio album by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, {{released}} on April 22, 1997, by Matador Records. It {{was produced by}} Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor Electr-O-Pura to encompass {{a variety of other}} music genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open-ended dissonance.|$|E

Driven to protect his Yonah, he was the first Gestalt and has combined her with the Replicant Yonah. The original Yonah, however, tells the Gestalt Nier that she <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> new Yonah inside her, and that she loves the Replicant Nier and deserves the body just as much.

Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which is why she quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has already given the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E
5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts.

If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court.

25|$|The Kelb tal-Fenek {{is usually}} taken out to hunt {{at night when}} there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters will take their dogs into the {{countryside}} and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each compass direction. The dogs will then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds will give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting {{too far to the}} sides. At this point the dogs giving chase will emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom will come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit will almost always have taken to the ground. The hunters will then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter will take a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> little bell up to 3 meters down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. This style of hunting is mentioned by Strabo about hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule, and the Maltese word for ferret—"nemes"—may have its roots in the Greek word ''.|$|E
