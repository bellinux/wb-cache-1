For ten years, from 1896 to 1906, every winter, when the Egyptian climate was bearable, Grenfell and Hunt supervised hundreds of Egyptian workers, excavating the rubbish mounds, digging up tightly packed layers of papyrus mixed with earth. The finds were sifted, partially cleaned and then shipped to Grenfell and Hunt's base at Oxford. During the summer, Grenfell and Hunt <b>cleaned,</b> <b>sorted,</b> translated and compared the year's haul, assembling complete texts from dozens of fragments and extracts. In 1898, they published the first volume of their finds. They worked closely together, each revising what the other wrote, and publishing the result jointly. In 1926, however, Grenfell died, leaving Hunt to continue the work with other collaborators until his own death in 1934. Meanwhile, Italian excavators had returned to the site: their work, from 1910 to 1934, brought to light many further papyri, including additional pieces of papyrus rolls of which parts had already been discovered by Grenfell and Hunt.|$|E

50|$|Cranberries are {{harvested}} {{in the fall}} when the fruit takes on its distinctive deep red color. Berries that receive sun turn a deep red when fully ripe, while {{those that do not}} fully mature are a pale pink or white color. This is usually in September through the first part of November. To harvest cranberries, the beds are flooded with six to eight inches (15 to 20 centimeters) of water above the vines. A harvester is driven through the beds to remove the fruit from the vines. For the past 50 years, water reel type harvesters have been used. Harvested cranberries float in the water and can be corralled into a corner of the bed and conveyed or pumped from the bed. From the farm, cranberries are taken to receiving stations where they are <b>cleaned,</b> <b>sorted,</b> and stored prior to packaging or processing.|$|E

In total, 25 women, recruited from the West Kiang region of The Gambia, were trained on how to recognize and remove moldy groundnuts. Market-purchased groundnuts were hand sorted by the women. Groundnuts were sampled at baseline (n = 5), after hand sorting (“clean,” n = 25 and “moldy,” n = 25), and after roasting (n = 5). All samples were analyzed for AFB₁ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A reduction of 42. 9 % was achieved based on the median AFB₁ levels at baseline and after hand <b>sorting</b> (<b>clean</b> groundnuts), whereas an alternative estimate, based on the total AFB₁ in moldy and clean groundnuts, indicated a reduction of 96. 7 %, with a loss of only 2 % of the groundnuts. By roasting the already <b>clean</b> <b>sorted</b> groundnuts, the AFB₁ reduction achieved (based on median levels) was 39. 3 %.

Because of that reasons, this research is conducted to explore diversity, morphology and substrates characters of Polychaeta in Losari Beach,Makassar City, South Sulawesi. Polychaeta was taken from Losari beach. which located in the west of Makassar. Purposif sampling method used for the determination of 10 sampling sites at this location. Polychaeta obtained was <b>cleaned,</b> <b>sorted</b> and grouped in preparation for preservation. Before fixed, specimens anaesthetized with a solution of 72 % MgCl 2 (Fujita, 2010), then fixed by soaking in 10 % formalin (Al-Hakim & Puji, 2009). Samples obtained subsequently sorted and preserved in 70 % alcohol for identification (Fauchald, 1977). The characters of substrate analyzed are the total organic matter and texture. The result showed that there was one species of Polychaeta. There is Perinereis aibuhitensis Grube. The main characters for this species are the amount and form of paragnath and setae types. The texture of the substrate on this location sites are sandy. BOT value of the this location was 3. 09 % - 6. 19 %.

40|$|Tannase (Tannin acyl hydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 20) is {{an enzyme}} {{produced}} {{in the presence of}} tannic acid by various filamentous fungi. They are produced principally by fungi of the genus Aspergillus and Penicillium. The enzyme is used in the food and beverage industry as a clarifying agent for wines, beers and fruit juices. In Africa, billions of dollars are expended yearly on the importation of commercial enzymes for the food and pharmaceutical industries and this increases the cost of production and the finished goods. This study was carried out to isolate tannase producing fungal species using Bambara nuts as a substrate in a bid to finding alternatives to the importation of tannase. Fresh Bambara nuts were collected from different locations in Nigeria. They were <b>cleaned,</b> <b>sorted</b> and intermittently moistened with water to encourage fungal growth for fourteen days. The different fungi obtained after fourteen days were inoculated onto Potato Dextrose Agar plates and incubated at 25 °C for five days. Subculturing of fungal isolates was carried out to obtain pure cultures of isolates. Tannilytic activity (hydrolysis of tannin) of isolates was assessed by inoculating them in media containing tannin. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 2 - 5 days after which the plates were observed and zones of hydrolysis measured. A total of eighteen isolates were obtained. They were all members of the Aspergillus genus. 56 % (10) of the isolates were able to degrade tannin acid with mean zone of hydrolysis of 39 mm ± 23. 7 mm (Range 10 - 70 mm). This study established members of the Aspergillus genus isolated from Bambara nuts as viable fungi for application in the production of tannase. This study adds to existing reports on fungal production of tannase...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to study {{the potential impact of}} Lean Management principles on a service-providing company. Lean Management was originally developed for manufacturing companies when it was first designed in Japan, in Toyota, a car-making company. Lean Management was developed primarily to cut cost and help Toyota achieve its rock-solid sustainability. More specifically, the research seeks to examine whether lean principles can benefit a service-oriented company, or not. In order to find the results for the problem topic, first I want to find out whether there is such thing as “Lean Service”. Further, I want to look into, what does the critiques say about Lean Service? Simultaneously research for, transferability of Lean principles transferrable to a service company? To make this research more focused, a service-providing company is chosen, known as Follo Taxi. Follo Taxi is a midsize regional cab company in Norway, which does not have Lean implemented currently. The research paper also focuses on the counterarguments for lean service. Even thou the problem topic, Lean Service, is quite “new”, there are some prior studies written by researchers and intellectuals. Several previous studies are included in this research to build a relevant theoretical background that can with the reader an insight on the ongoing debate on Lean Service. In order to understand the challenges in a service company, qualitative data was gathered. The qualitative data was collected, through open interviews from different groups of stakeholders. These three groups were, the management, employees and customers. Data was then cross-analyzed, specifically to create an analyses and discuss resource usage, effectiveness & efficiency. The interviews were conducted on one-on-one bases to maintain the interviewee’s comfort level and anonymity. Then I coded the data to study the types of wastages that could occur in a service company. Since it is a qualitative study, stakeholder’s personal views, comments and feelings were crucial to consider. After the data gathering and studying relevant theory, four essential lean principles were selected to be used in a service company. 1) Value Stream Mapping, 2) Just-In-Time, 3) Production Balancing, and 4) 5 S Standardization. These four elements, originally borrowed from Lean Management to Lean Service, can benefit a fully service-oriented company. Value Stream Mapping can help a service company with defining its value, creating a smooth value flow stream & considering pull-system and striving for perfection. Just-In-Time focuses on delivering the product on time and cutting cost, and Production Balancing seeks to prevent over- and underproduction. Whereas, 5 S standardization concentrates on making processes standardized, simplified, <b>cleaned,</b> <b>sorted</b> out and finally yet importantly it seeks to make the procedures sustainable. The final discussion wanders around the significance of these four Lean principles in a service company...|$|E

This paper investigates the flexural performance of various SFRC mixes using RTSF and two types of Manufactured Steel Fibres (MSF). The post-cracking flexural strengths of these mixes are obtained using 3 -point notched prism tests. A simplified equation is proposed to determine the relationship between the post-cracking flexural tensile strength and required SFRC ground-supported slabs thicknesses. It is found that the required slab thicknesses largely depend on f, a single coefficient obtained from the post-cracking flexural strengths of SFRC. In all SFRC mixes, the lowest required slab thickness is obtained when using hybrid fibre reinforcement containing 10 kg/m 3 of RTSF. It is concluded that hybrid fibres using RTSF can be a competitive and environmentally-friendly alternative for industrial concrete flooring applications...|$|R
