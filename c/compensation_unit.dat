40|$|Abstract:- This paper investigates {{and compares}} {{the effects of}} dynamic fault impendence {{variation}} on the accuracy of estimating location of faults on series compensated transmission lines, using a novel fault location algorithm based on the measurement of instantaneous signals, derived from both ends of high voltage transmission lines. In order to estimate fault location accurately, {{it is necessary to}} compute precisely the voltage drops in series <b>compensation</b> <b>units</b> during the fault. However, the methods available for such computations induce considerable errors in fault location estimation algorithms, due to the complexity of the series <b>compensation</b> <b>units.</b> Furthermore, in these methods, fault impedance has been assumed fixed during the fault. In this paper, the fault impedance used in the models has been considered variable and its dynamic inclusion in the fault estimation algorithm has been investigated. The developed algorithm has been tested using the ATP software with 400 KV, 300 km long transmission line interconnecting two equivalent power systems. The algorithm performed well with fixed fault impedance. However, by representing the fault impedance in its dynamic form, the accuracy of the algorithm has not changed. Such simulation of the fault impedance is more accurate than the assumption of fixed values. The presented results show that the new algorithm is capable to estimate accurately the location of faults under different conditions, including dynamic fault impedance. The paper will discuss the results obtained and conclusion will be made on the novel scheme for fault location estimation on series compensated high voltage transmission lines...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes an {{approach}} for a 3 D-Piezo Compensation Mechanism unit that {{is capable of}} fast and accurate adaption of the spindle position to enhance machining by robots. The mechanical design is explained which focuses on low mass, good stiffness and high bandwidth in order to allow compensating for errors beyond the bandwidth of the robot. In addition to previous works [7, 9], an advanced actuation design is presented enabling movements in three translational axes allowing a working range of each axis up to half a millimeter. Based on the presented theoretical dimensioning and finite element simulation translational moves with higher bandwidth can be enabled, due to the parallel design approach of a 3 D-Piezo Compensation Mechanism. For realization aspects piezo actuators are chosen due to their fast dynamics and high forces. The realization of the control loop is further outlined. In order to enable a good control performance the set-up of sensing the extension of the piezo actuator is detailed as well as the spindle position used in fast real-time environment. As a result the 3 D-Piezo Compensation mechanism unit allows an active adaption of the spindle position in the range of micrometers.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the control of {{asymmetric}} permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) system, with particular reference to the suppression of its second harmonic (2 h) power, DC bus voltage and torque ripples. The asymmetries include the unbalanced resistances, unbalanced inductances, and unbalanced 3 -phase back-electromotive forces (EMFs). The mathematical model of the general asymmetries in the PMSG system is firstly presented. The power ripple and torque ripple due to the asymmetries without/with negative-(N-) sequence currents are then analysed in detail. It shows that there are 2 h impedances in the synchronous dq-axis frame. Consequently, the N-sequence currents emerge under the conventional current proportional and integral (PI) control, which will result in undesired 2 h power, DC bus voltage and torque ripples. To suppress the 2 h torque resulted from the N-sequence currents, three typical methods aiming for balanced currents without N-sequence currents are reviewed, evaluated and their relationship is revealed. It shows that all these three methods are capable of suppressing the N-sequence currents as verified by experiments. However, the 2 h power and DC bus voltage cannot be suppressed. To suppress the undesired 2 h power and DC bus voltage, an improved power control without any sequential component decomposers under general unbalanced conditions is proposed. Its effectiveness is validated by elaborated experiments on a prototype PMSG with inherent asymmetry and deliberately introduced asymmetries. However, the 2 h torque is compromised. To solve the 2 h torque, power and DC bus voltage simultaneously, the compensation in parallel with the DC bus is investigated in the PMSG system with asymmetric impedances. The undesired 2 h power from the PMSG is compensated by the 2 h power from the <b>compensation</b> <b>unit.</b> Two topologies of the <b>compensation</b> <b>unit</b> and corresponding control methods are investigated, while the compensation effectiveness is validated by experiments. Furthermore, the <b>compensation</b> <b>unit</b> with external circuits in series with the asymmetric PMSG is investigated. By the compensation in series, the original unbalanced system is modified to a balanced system in theory. Therefore, the N-sequence currents, 2 h power, DC bus voltage, and torque ripple can be naturally suppressed. The feasibility of this compensation method is verified by experiments at different speeds and load conditions, although the effectiveness may be slightly affected by the non-linearity of the compensation inductors in practice. Finally, the research of suppressing the 2 h DC bus voltage and torque ripple is extended to the dual 3 -phase PMSG system with one channel failed. By utilizing the windings, rectifier or inverter in the faulty channel which are still functional, three methods designated as two sets in parallel, two DC buses in parallel and N-sequence currents compensation are investigated, which require minimum extra hardware investment compared with the compensation in parallel and in series. ...|$|E

In particular, the high-power capability of SVC is combined with the fast response of APF to achieve full compensation of reactive power and harmonic currents.
