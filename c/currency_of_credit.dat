2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the War of 1812, Raguet was {{a leading}} inflationist, {{supporting}} deliberate inflation through increasing the available supply <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> and <b>credit.</b> However, his position changed after the Panic of 1819. The Panic also converted Raguet from a protectionist to a leading promoter of free trade. While a state senator, Raguet sent a questionnaire to legislators and prominent citizens in each county of the state {{to determine the extent of}} the depression. One of the questions was [...] "Do you consider that the advantages of the banking system outweigh its evils?" [...] Sixteen out of nineteen counties answered in the negative. Raguet concluded that the depression was a result <b>of</b> bank <b>credit</b> expansion and the subsequent contraction as physical money was drained from the bank's vaults. He promoted restrictions on banks and of granting bank charters.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} foundations {{laid down}} between 1763 and 1776 were {{vital to the}} even greater expansion seen during the Revolutionary War. Though still lagging behind Philadelphia, Baltimore merchants and entrepreneurs produced an expanding commercial community with family businesses and partnerships proliferating in shipping, the flour-milling and grain business, and the indentured servant traffic. International trade focused on four areas: Britain, Southern Europe, the West Indies, and the North American coastal towns. Credit was {{the essence of the}} system and a virtual chain of indebtedness meant that bills remained long unpaid and little cash was used among overseas correspondents, merchant wholesalers, and retail customers. Bills of exchange were used extensively, often circulating as <b>currency.</b> Frequent crises <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and the wars with France kept prices and markets in constant flux, but men such as William Lux and the Christie brothers produced a maturing economy and a thriving metropolis by the 1770s.|$|R
25|$|In Europe, {{paper money}} was first {{introduced}} in Sweden in 1661. Sweden was rich in copper, thus, because of copper's low value, extraordinarily big coins (often weighing several kilograms) had to be made.

50|$|A {{number of}} virtual worlds have {{incorporated}} systems for {{sale of goods}} through virtual interfaces and using virtual <b>currencies.</b> Transfers <b>of</b> in-world <b>credits</b> typically are not bound by laws governing commerce.

One example is that of Ginko Financial, a bank system featured in Second Life where avatars could deposit their real life currency after converted to Linden Dollars for a profit. In July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM's in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money. After a few days the ATM's along with the banks disappeared altogether. Around $700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life. An investigation was launched but nothing substantial ever came of finding and punishing the avatar known as Nicholas Portocarrero who {{was the head of}} Ginko Financial.|$|R
40|$|Based {{in part on}} {{previously}} neglected sales records, {{this article}} offers the first detailed analysis of slave sales by the method known as the scramble. In eighteenth-century South Carolina, the scramble was the preferred sales mechanism for newly arrived Africans, with auction sales generally reserved for slaves already in the colony. Analysis of the sales and other records suggest that the scramble was an economically rational way to sell imported slaves, but that it fell out of favor after the American Revolution as problems <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> and <b>credit</b> rendered it too cumbersome. The article concludes by proposing that the scramble helped to shape colonial slave society by allowing poorer whites greater access to slaves than the auction method. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|A long-standing but {{unsettled}} controversy concerning monetary {{experiences in}} colonial America {{has recently been}} reopened with considerable vigor. Ignoring doctrinal aspects, the main substantive issue concerns the relationship between money holdings and price levels during episodes in which various colonial governments issued paper <b>currency</b> (bills <b>of</b> <b>credit)</b> in large amounts. In several instances, large and rapid increases in the stock <b>of</b> outstanding paper <b>currency</b> led to negligible changes in price levels. But alternative interpretations are possible, since colonial money included specie as well as paper currency. According to the "quantity theory" or classical hypothesis, total money stock magnitudes did not rise sharply during the disputed episodes; instead, the sharp paper currency increases led to corresponding losses of specie [...] as suggested by standard commodity-money analysis. According to the "backing theory" or anti-classical hypothesis, by contrast, there was little specie present so money stock magnitudes could and did rise sharply (in percentage terms). This fundamental factual disagreement has eluded resolution because data on both stocks and flows of specie are almost nonexistent. The present study develops and applies a strategy for circumventing the unavailability of specie data by exploiting conflicting implications of the two hypotheses regarding magnitudes of real per capita holdings <b>of</b> paper <b>currency,</b> relative to normal real money balances, at dates of maximum paper issue. A major feature of the analysis is a new method for the estimation of normal real money holdings, one that relies on paper currency data for a few inflationary episodes. ...|$|R
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the war, the {{currency}} became practically worthless as a medium of exchange. This was because Confederate <b>currency</b> were bills <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> as in the Revolutionary War, not secured or backed by any assets. Just as {{the currency}} issued by the Continental Congress was deemed worthless (witness the phrase [...] "not worth a Continental;" [...] and see The Federalist Papers, which also addressed this issue {{in the run-up to the}} ratification of the U.S. Constitution) because they were not backed by any hard assets, so, too, this became the case with Confederate currency. Even though both gold and silver may have been scarce, some economic historians [...] have suggested that the currency would have retained a relatively material degree of value, and for a longer period of time, had it been backed by hard goods the Confederacy did have, perhaps such as cotton, or tobacco. When the Confederacy ceased to exist as a political entity at {{the end of the}} war, the money lost all value as fiat currency.|$|R
50|$|In literature, {{there is}} a set of related {{definitions}} <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> substitution such as external liability currency substitution, domestic liability currency substitution, banking sector's liability currency substitution or deposit currency substitution and credit dollarlization. External liability currency substitution measures total external debt (private and public) denominated in foreign <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> the economy.

40|$|Patterns in {{domestic}} credit creation stemming from inconsistent fiscal policies have received widespread attention for aggravating speculative attacks on central bank {{foreign exchange reserves}} and contributing {{to the collapse of}} exchange rate regimes. This paper acknowledges the importance of monetary and fiscal discipline, but also emphasizes the importance of other random shocks to the domestic money market, most notably shocks from external credit supplies and relative prices. Policies of the domestic fiscal authorities are only partial catalysts for speculative attacks on a <b>currency.</b> Expansion <b>of</b> domestic <b>credit</b> stemming from the monetization of fiscal imbalances may be dominated by involuntary domestic credit expansions necessitated by surprise shortages in supplies of external capital. Further, the unexpected availability of external capital translates into a lower net critical reserve floor, making the depletion of central bank reserves by a speculative attack more difficult to accomplish. Also of considerable importance are relative price shocks which directly influence the probability of collapse by randomizing the demand for nominal money balances. Empirical studies of exchange rate crises that neglect these considerations will produce biased estimates of both expected collapse probabilities and anticipated post-collapse exchange rates. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of why a government would default on debt denominated in its own currency. Using a newly constructed dataset of 14 emerging markets, we document that the private sector continues to borrow from abroad in foreign currency while sovereigns increasingly borrow from foreigners in local currency. Because depreciation can be very costly for a corporate sector with a currency mismatch due to foreign currency liabilities, emerging market sovereigns may still prefer to default on local currency sovereign debt rather than inflate the debt away. Using our cross-country dataset, we show that a higher reliance on external foreign currency corporate financing is associated with a higher default risk on sovereign debt. We quantify the effects of corporate balance sheet mismatch on sovereign credit risk by introducing local currency sovereign debt and private currency mismatch into a standard sovereign debt model. The model demonstrates how the <b>currency</b> composition <b>of</b> corporate borrowing affects the sovereign’s incentive to inflate or default in times of fiscal stress. Reductions in the share of private external debt in foreign currency can lead to significant reductions in sovereign default risk. A calibration of the model generates the empirical patterns <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> and <b>credit</b> risk in local currency sovereign debt documented in Du and Schreger (2015) ...|$|R

We identify the effects <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> crises on the demand and supply <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and find that the decline in the supply <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is persistent and contributes to about 8 % decline in credit for the first two years, while the 35 % decline in demand lasts only five months.
