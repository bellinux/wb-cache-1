Modifications of the acid treatment applied to the nanotubes, including subjecting them to stirring or ultrasonic agitation, and use of acid or basic pH during composite powder mixing have been approached. No MWNT damage during processing was detected by Raman spectroscopy. CNT bundles were found in all the composites forming different patterns depending on the processing route. Similar values of hardness were obtained for all the composites, while different anisotropy in fracture propagation was found when studying parallel and perpendicular directions to the sintering pressing axis on the cross sections of the composites due to the MWNT preferential alignment. The CNT bundles were found to act as fracture short paths. A similar anisotropic behavior was observed for the electrical conductivity. These results have been correlated to the different microstructures obtained in the composites prepared with different processing routines. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project was to develop an energy efficient, environmentally friendly and low cost process (compared to the current process) for making tackifier dispersions {{that are used to}} make pressure-sensitive adhesives. These adhesives are employed in applications such as self-adhesive postage stamps and disposable diapers and are made by combining the tackifier dispersion with a natural or synthetic rubber latex. The current process for tackifier dispersion manufacture begins by melting a (plastic) resin and adding water to it in order to form a water-in-oil emulsion. This is then converted to an oil-in-water emulsion by phase inversion in the presence of continuous stirring. The resulting emulsion is the tackifier dispersion, but it is not concentrated and the remaining excess water has to be transported and removed. The main barrier that has to be overcome in the development of commercial quality tackifier dispersions is the inability to directly emulsify resin in water due to the very low viscosity of water as compared to the viscosity of the molten resin. In the present research, a number of solutions were proposed to overcome this barrier, and these included use of different mixer types to directly form the emulsion from the molten resin but without going through a phase inversion, the idea of forming a solid resin-in-water suspension having the correct size and size distribution but without melting of the resin, and the development of techniques of making a <b>colloidal</b> <b>powder</b> of the resin that could be dispersed in water just prior to use. Progress was made on each of these approaches, and each was found to be feasible. The most appealing solution, though, is the last one, since it does not require melting of the resin. Also, the powder can be shipped in dry form and then mixed with water in any proportion depending on the needs of the process. This research was conducted at Argonne National Laboratory, and it was determined the new process uses 78 % less energy than the conventional process. Additional benefits of the new process are that it can process resins that cannot presently be processed without using solvents and that it can result in new products made with mixed resins...|$|E

Clusters are then {{moved toward the}} center of agglomerates. The particle rearrangement process during or after condensation is simulated by moving each particle into a more stable position. Particle clusters rearranged during packing have higher packing density and average coordination number than particle clusters rearranged after packing. The effect of particle rearrangement on the packing density in a cluster is comparable to the effect of cluster rearrangement in the cluster agglomeration;In Paper II, agglomeration of colloidal particles in a suspension is simulated using the concepts of interparticle potential fields. Colloid particles move during agglomeration in the direction which decreases the potential energies between particles. Simulated conditions are based on experimental results and on agglomeration theory. The effects of the various types of potential curves between colloidal particles were checked. It was found that short- and long-range fields contribute to the agglomeration process under typical default conditions. Strong short range attractive energy without a repulsive energy barrier makes small strong clusters with hard contacts between particles but weak short-range force with a large repulsive energy barrier makes big agglomerates with soft contacts between particles;In Paper III, settling of colloidal particles was studied with a three-dimensional computer simulation technique. Special attention was paid to the metastable state, rearrangement, and network stress build-up during or after colloidal particle settling. The settling density through the whole process was checked and compared with experimental results. There is a big difference in packing density between particles settled with and without rearrangement.

Stress condensation in a simulated powder compact by internal sediment stresses shows good approximation to the network compression stage of powder settling experiments.

The compaction is a nonlinear process in which new contacts are formed between particles and the contact areas increase. The change of particle shapes allows these materials to reach high packing fraction. We find that the contact specific surface, the orientation anisotropy and the aspect ratio of particles increase {{as a function of the}} packing fraction but at different rates.

40|$|Dense SrZr 0. 95 Y 0. 05 O 3 a and SrCe 0. 95 Yb 0. 05 O 3 a {{thin films}} with {{perovskite}} structure were prepared on porous SrZr 0. 95 Y 0. 05 O 3 a substrates by spin coating <b>colloidal</b> suspensions of <b>powders</b> prepared by combustion methods. Porous substrates were prepared by treating carbon/SrZr 0. 95 Y 0. 05 O 3 a composites in air at 1273 – 1573 K {{in order to}} combust the carbon and partially sinter the resulting porous oxide. This procedure led to strong porous solids with a high gas permeability. Matching the shrinkage of the porous substrate and of the thin film by this pre-sintering of the porous substrate led to thin films free of fissures and other defects. Thin films prepared by these methods did not transport He at ambient temperature or N 2 at 900 – 1000 K. H 2 permeation rates through SrCe 0. 95 Yb 0. 05 O 3 a thin films at 950 K were as high as 500 times larger than on 1 -mm disks and reached values of 6 10 4 mol H 2 /cm 2 min for 2 Am films. H 2 permeation rates were proportional to the inverse of the membrane thickness, indicating that permeation in SrCe 0. 95 Yb 0. 05 O 3 a thin films is controlled by bulk diffusion and not by H...|$|R
40|$|A {{photoelectrochemical cell}} {{utilizing}} flavonoid anthocyanin dyes extracted from blackberries, along with <b>colloidal</b> TiO 2 <b>powder,</b> {{is shown to}} convert sunlight to electrical power at an efficiency of 0. 56 % under full sun. Fluorescence quenching is observed for the excited state of the TiO 2 -adsorbed anthocyanin dye, cyanin, and the photocurrent spectrum correlates well with the optical absorption of the cyanin-sensitized TiO 2 nanocrystalline film. The incident photon-to-current efficiency of 19 % {{at the peak of}} the visible absorption band of the dye, the open-circuit voltages of 0. 5 - 0. 4 V, and short-circuit photocurrents of 1. 5 - 2. 2 mA/cm 2 are remarkable for such a simple system and suggest efficient charge carrier injection. The ultrafast excited-state dynamics of cyanin in solution are compared with those of surface-adsorbed cyanin on TiO 2 and ZrO 2 colloids, as well as complexed with Al(III) ions. A transient absorption signal with a risetime of < 100 fs for cyanin-sensitized TiO 2 nanoparticles is assigned to electrons injected from the dye to TiO 2. This signal is fit to a double-exponential decay with time constants of 0. 52 and 67 ps. The 0. 52 ps component is due to trapping of conduction band electrons or to fast direct recombination with the dye cation, while the 67 ps decay is attributed to trap state mediated indirect recombination. In contrast, stimulated emission with a 2. 6 ps decay time is observed for cyanin in solution, cyanin on ZrO 2, and cyanin complexed with Al(III) ions. When compared to the photon-to-current efficiency measured for the solar cell, the efficiency estimated from the injection and recombination rate constants suggests that electron recapture by the redox mediator and light screening mechanisms may limit the efficiency of the cell...|$|R
40|$|Nanosized allotropes {{of carbon}} have been {{attracting}} {{a lot of}} attention recently, but despite the steady growth of the number of scientific works on materials based on graphene family, there is still much to be explored. These two-dimensional carbon materials, such as graphene nanoplatelets, multilayer graphene or few layer graphene have emerged as a possible second phase for reinforcing ceramics, resulting in remarkable properties of these composites. Typically, graphene ceramic matrix composites are prepared by a <b>colloidal</b> or a <b>powder</b> route followed by pressure assisted sintering. Recently other traditional ceramic processes, such as tape casting, were also successfully studied. The aim of this research is to fabricate α-SiC multi-layer composites containing 2, 4 and 8 vol% of graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) by tape casting and study the effect of these additions on the mechanical behavior of the composites. In order to achieve this purpose, samples were pressureless sintered and tested for density and mechanical properties. The elastic modulus was measured by the impulse excitation of vibration method, the hardness by Vickers indentation and fracture toughness using micro Vickers indentation and by three-point bending applying the pre-cracked beam approach. Results showed that up to 4 vol%, the density and mechanical properties were directly proportional to the amount of GNP added but showed a dramatic decrease for 8 vol% of GNP. Composites with 4 vol% of GNP had a 23 % increment elastic modulus, while the fracture toughness had a 34 % increment compared to SiC tapes fabricated under the same conditions. Higher amounts of GNP induces porosity in the samples, thus decreasing the mechanical properties. This study, therefore, indicates that 4 % is an optimal amount of GNP and suggests that excessive amounts of GNP are rather detrimental to the mechanical properties of silicon carbide ceramic materials prepared by tape castin...|$|R
