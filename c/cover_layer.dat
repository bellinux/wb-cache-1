40|$|The {{invention}} {{concerns a}} nanowire structural element which is suited for implementation in, for example, a microreactor system or microcatalyzer system. For {{the production of}} the nanowire structural element, a template based process is used wherein the electrochemical deposition of the nanowires in nanopores is ideally carried out at least until caps are formed and said caps ideally are at least partially merged together. After reinforcing the two <b>cover</b> <b>layers</b> the structured hollow chamber between the two <b>cover</b> <b>layers</b> is cleared by dissolving the template foil and removing the dissolved template material, wherein the two <b>cover</b> <b>layers</b> remain intact. In this manner, a stable sandwich-like nanostructure is constructed with a two-dimensional hollow chamber-like structure in the plane parallel to the <b>cover</b> <b>layers</b> contained on both sides by the <b>cover</b> <b>layers</b> and permeated in a column-like manner with nanowires...|$|R

2500|$|The {{next three}} layers {{comprise}} lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of elastin and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely. The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this <b>cover</b> <b>layer</b> to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, proteoglycan like fibromodulin, decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The intermediate layer of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer elastin and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as elastin and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. Elastin fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The normal strain level of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging. Each vocal ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage.|$|E

50|$|Multilayer {{insulation}} (MLI) is {{the most}} common passive thermal control element used on spacecrafts. MLI prevent both heat losses to the environment and excessive heating from the environment. Spacecraft components such as propellant tanks, propellant lines, batteries, and solid rocket motors are also covered in MLI blankets to maintain ideal operating temperature. MLI consist of an outer <b>cover</b> <b>layer,</b> interior layer, and an inner <b>cover</b> <b>layer.</b> The outer <b>cover</b> <b>layer</b> needs to be opaque to sunlight, generate a low amount of particulate contaminates, and be able to survive in the environment and temperature to which the spacecraft will be exposed. Some common materials used for the outer layer are fiberglass woven cloth impregnated with PTFE Teflon, PVF reinforced with Nomex bonded with polyester adhesive, and FEP Teflon. The general requirement for the interior layer is that it needs to have a low emittance. The most commonly used material for this layer is Mylar that is aluminized on one or both sides. The interior layers are usually thin compared to the outer layer to save weight and are perforated to aid in venting trapped air during launch. The inner cover faces the spacecraft hardware and is used to protect the thin interior layers. Inner covers are often not aluminized in order to prevent electrical shorts. Some materials used for the inner covers are Dacron and Nomex Netting. Mylar is not used because of flammability concerns. MLI blankets are an important element of the thermal control system.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{decision-making}} procedures, such as multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), often {{rely upon}} input data derived from remote sensing {{in the form}} of land cover maps. However, these data can often contain inherent errors and misclassifications that can influence the accuracy of the final output associated with spatial decision-making procedures. The research presented here explores what influence errors and misclassifications in remote sensing derived land cover data can have on the output from spatial decision-making procedures. Four land <b>cover</b> data <b>layers,</b> each covering the same spatial area and easily obtained from scholarly or governmental institutions, are used throughout this research. These comparative land <b>cover</b> data <b>layers</b> are compared with an author-created land <b>cover</b> data <b>layer</b> known as the BASE layer. The BASE layer represents the nearest approximation of the land cover condition in the study region. Overall land cover classification accuracy is assessed for each of the land <b>cover</b> data <b>layers</b> used in this research. In addition to overall land cover classification accuracy, classification accuracy is evaluated along the edge and interior of land cover regions in order to determine if the spatial location of errors and misclassifications, rather than the quantity of errors and misclassifications alone, can {{have an impact on the}} output form spatial decision making procedures. This is followed by an assessment of the influence of errors and misclassifications on site and situational factors, two of the primary components of spatial decision-making procedures. Direct comparisons are made between the BASE layer and the comparative land <b>cover</b> data <b>layers.</b> A series of multi-criteria evaluation procedures using the BASE layer and the four comparative data layers as input concludes this research. The output from the spatial decision-making procedure using the BASE layer is directly compared with the same spatial decision-making procedure using each of the comparative land <b>cover</b> data <b>layers</b> as input. Differences between the BASE layer and the comparative land <b>cover</b> data <b>layers</b> are then assessed to determine if errors and misclassifications have had an impact on the output of the spatial decision-making procedures. ...|$|R
