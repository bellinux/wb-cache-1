50|$|<b>Covert</b> <b>cloth,</b> {{from which}} the coat is made, is a heavy tweed named after a covered area rich in game {{wildlife}} that {{would serve as a}} starting point on a hunt. A covert coat is always single-breasted with notch lapels, a centre vent, flap pockets, and a signature four (sometimes five) lines of stitching at the cuffs and hem; a ticket pocket is optional. The collar may be constructed of <b>covert</b> <b>cloth</b> or velvet. The traditional colour varies from a light greenish-tan brown to a fawnish mix to a rather deep tannish-green, but variants in grey and navy are also common.|$|E
6000|$|During his covert {{shoots the}} Squire had {{the habit of}} {{recording}} his impressions in a mental note-book. He put special marks against such as missed, or shot birds behind the waist, or placed lead in them {{to the detriment of}} their market value, or broke only one leg of a hare at a time, causing the animal to cry like a tortured child, which some men do not like; or such as, anxious for fame, claimed dead creatures that they had not shot, or peopled the next beat with imaginary slain, or too frequently [...] "wiped an important neighbour's eye," [...] or shot too many beaters in the legs. Against this evidence, however, he unconsciously weighed the more undeniable social facts, such as the title of Winlow's father; Sir James Malden's coverts, which must also presently be shot; Thomas Brandwhite's position in the financial world; General Pendyce's relationship to himself; and the importance of the English Church. Against Foxleigh alone he could put no marks. The fellow destroyed everything that came within reach with utter precision, and this was perhaps fortunate, for Foxleigh had neither title, <b>coverts,</b> position, nor <b>cloth!</b> And the Squire weighed one thing else besides--the pleasure of giving them all a good day's sport, for his heart was kind.|$|R

Standard equipment included turn signals, bumper guards, stainless steel molfings, dual horns, cigarette lighter, {{front and rear}} floor mats, inside rearview mirror, foam rubber seat cushions, stainless steel rocker panel moldings, front seatback robe cord, spun glass hood insulation, rear window ventiplanes, electric clock, stainless steel wheel discs, custom cushion lounge seats front and rear, hand brake light, courtesy light package, padded dash, Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring, and windshield washer. Upholstery choices were <b>covert</b> and pattern <b>cloth,</b> leather and pattern cloth, leather and nylon, and leather and dimple leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] The optional air conditioning unit {{was moved to the}} engine bay instead of the trunk. The turning diameter was 43ft. The Hydramatic automatic transmission gear selector had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|R
