40|$|Cilia {{are complex}} and dynamic organelles that have {{motility}} and sensory functions. Defects in cilia biogenesis and function are at the origin of human ciliopathies. In motile cilia, a basal body organizes the axoneme composed of nine microtubule doublets surrounding a central pair of singlet microtubules. The distal ends of axonemal microtubules {{are attached to the}} membrane by microtubule-capping structures. Little is known about the early steps of cilium assembly. Although cilia grow and resorb from their distal tips, it remains poorly understood where and when the components of the caps are first assembled. By using Atomic Force Microscopy in tapping mode, with resolution at the nanometer range and with minimum sample manipulation, we show that Tetrahymena cilia assembly requires transient assembly of structures, composed of three components that are placed asymmetrically on an early elongating axoneme. In small uncapped axonemes, the microtubule central pair was never observed. Additionally, we show that cilia <b>cap</b> <b>assembly</b> is a multi-step process in which structures of different sizes and shapes are put together in close proximity before the axoneme appears capped. We propose that the cap modifies the axoneme microtubule rate of polymerization and present a model for Tetrahymena cilia <b>cap</b> <b>assembly.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we address}} the problem of {{controlling}} robots with arbitrarily-switched constraints and unknown dynamics. Switching between different constraints of a robot would result in a switched nonlinear system that does not inherit the behavior of its individual subsystems. In order to guarantee stable performance of robots with arbitrarily switched constraints and unknown dynamics, we propose a Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Control (RAFC) strategy that can guarantee global stable performance under such challenging conditions. The suggested control strategy relies on the synergy of the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) that adds robustness against possible dynamics parameters drift, finding a Common Lyapunov Function (CLF) that guarantees stability under arbitrary constraints switching, and Direct Adaptive Fuzzy System (DAFS) that relaxes the need for knowing the precise robot dynamics.

40|$|In the syncytial {{blastoderm}} {{stage of}} Drosophila embryogenesis, dome- shaped actin "caps" are observed above the interphase nuclei. During mitosis, this actin rearranges {{to participate in}} the formation of pseudocleavage furrows, transient membranous invaginations between dividing nuclei. Embryos laid by homozygous sponge mothers lack these characteristic actin structures, but retain other actin associated structures and processes. Our results indicate that the sponge product is specifically required for the formation of actin caps and metaphase furrows. The specificity of the sponge phenotype permits dissection of both the process of actin cap formation and the functions of actin caps and metaphase furrows. Our data demonstrate that the distribution of actin binding protein 13 D 2 is unaffected in sponge embryos and suggest that 13 D 2 is upstream of actin in cortical <b>cap</b> <b>assembly.</b> Although actin caps and metaphase furrows have been implicated in maintaining the fidelity of nuclear division and the positions of nuclei within the cortex, our observations indicate that these structures are dispensible during the early syncytial blastoderm cell cycles.

Furthermore, the formation of actin caps and metaphase furrows is not a prerequisite for the formation of the hexagonal array of actin instrumental in the conversion of the syncytial embryo into a cellular blastoderm...|$|E

40|$|Author: Sosnick Lab, University of Chicago ### Description For protein concentration, gas {{pressure}} is applied directly to ultrafiltration cell. Solutes above the membrane's molecular weight (MW) cut-off are retained in cell, while water and solutes below the cut-off {{pass into the}} filtrate and out of cell. ![Table]([URL] "`Table 1 ") ### Membranes 1. YM 10 Ø 43 mm (for 8050), Amicon # 13622, 10 pack: $ 108 - YM 10 Ø 76 mm (for 8400), Amicon # 13642, 10 pack: $ 139 - **Prewash**: float membrane with glossy side down in beaker with distilled water for at least 1 hour changing water 3 times. All membranes are pretreated with glycerine to prevent drying, YM membranes are treated with sodium azide as a preservative. - **Cleaning**: rinse with 0. 1 M NaOH, followed by thorough flushing with distilled water. For strongly absorbed protein, soak in 0. 1 % protease solution and rinse thoroughly. - **Storage**: for reuse, store membranes in 10 % ethanol water solution at 4 °C. ### Assembly 1. Place membrane in holder, **shiny side up**; then place O-ring on top of membrane. Gently push O-ring down so that it contacts and seats membrane evenly in bottom of holder. **Handle membrane by its edges to avoid scratching or contaminating surface**. - Fit membrane holder into cell body, aligning tabs on sides of holder with slots in base of cell body. - Invert cell body and membrane holder; screw base firmly into bottom of cell body. A definite "stop" will be felt when base and body are fully engaged. Top of membrane holder will be flush with bottom of slots in cell body. - Push filtrate exit tubing onto exit spout of membrane support. - Place stirrer assembly into cell body. When properly installed, arms of stirrer assembly will rest on small ridge inside top of cell body. - Introduce sample into cell. - With a twisting motion, push cap down onto cell body, orienting gas inlet port on cap opposite filtrate exit port on holder. If <b>cap</b> <b>assembly</b> does not slide easily, lubricate O-ring lightly with petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to contact membrane!** - Set pressure-relief valve to horizontal (open) position. - Slide cell into retaining stand, fitting ring on cell base into hole in stand. Flattened edges on bottom flange of cap ensures that cell is inserted properly and prevents rotation of cell once inside stand. - Turn pressure-relief valve to vertical (closed) position. - Attach {{gas pressure}} line. ### Operation 1. Place cell on magnetic stirring table. - Connect inlet line to regulated gas pressure source (Nitrogen gas is recommended for pressurizing cell! Use of compressed air can cause large pH shifts due to dissolution of carbon dioxide. With sensitive solutions, oxidation can also occur, leading to other potential problems.) - Hold cell steady on the stirring table and pressurize according to instructions in membrane package. Generally ** 55 psi** (3. 7 kg/cm 2) is optimal, maximal 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) nitrogen gas pressure. <b>Cap</b> <b>assembly</b> moves upward, forming a secure lock with retaining stand once system is pressurized. - Turn on stirring table and adjust stirring rate until the vortex created is approximately one-third {{the depth of the}} liquid volume. - Monitor concentration. Do not allow retentate to run through. - Collect permeate. - Highly viscous solutions filter slowly, as do solutions containing particulate matter, such as colloids. Where the viscous agent (sucrose, glycerin, etc.) is to be removed, flow can often be increased by predilution. - **Prefilter or centrifuge** any solution containing particulate matter, such as cell debris or precipitates. - To maximize recovery of retained substances, continue stirring for a few minutes after depressurization. This will resuspend the polarized layer at the membrane surface. - When finished, turn off nitrogen pressure source and stirring table. - Vent pressure inside cell by slowly turning pressure-relief knob to horizontal position. Push cap down, then slide cell out from retaining stand. *Note: Overly rapid depressurization can cause the membrane to buckle up and rupture*. - Using a twisting motion, remove cell cap and the magnetic stirrer assembly. Always remove the cell top with the pressure-relief valve set to the horizontal (open) position. Removal in vertical (closed) position can create a partial vacuum which can rupture the membrane! Pour out solution. - Disassemble cell, then wash all components with a mild detergent/water solution, then rinse thoroughly. Caustic cleaning solutions may damage the anodized aluminum retaining stand. Leave ultrafiltration cell disassembled whenever it is unlikely to be used for several weeks. ### Limits - max. cell operating **pressure**: 75 psi (5. 3 kg/cm 2) - max. membrane operating pressure: 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) - pressure-relief valve preset: 90 psi (6. 3 kg/cm 2) - Although brief exposure to higher **temperatures** is possible, do not operate cell continuously above 85 °C (185 °F). - **pH** 2 to 10 - Do not use the following **chemicals**: Ketones (including acetone), Aromatic hydrocarbons (including toluene), Cellosolvers, Halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, Aliphatic esters, DMSO, Polar Aromatics. *Note:The spring in the pressure-relief valve is not compatible with 0. 1 N NaOH*. ### Sterilization Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells can be autoclaved at 121 °C (250 °F) for 30 minutes. They are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures, 70 % ethanol, isopropanol or 5 % formalin. **CAUTION**: Tighten the base partially before autoclaving. ### Maintenance - Replace O-rings {{at the first sign of}} damage or wear. - If installation or removal of <b>cap</b> <b>assembly</b> becomes difficult, lubricate cap O-ring with a small amount of petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to come in contact with membrane!** - Check stirrer periodically for rough edges that could possibly damage the membrane. - Replace transparent body immediately should it become cracked or crazed. ### Troubleshooting **Little or no filtrate obtained:** 1. Rotate pressure-relief valve to check for pressure. If not pressurized, check nitrogen source and regulator. - Make sure glossy side of disc membrane faces up. - If sample solution is highly viscous due to microsolutes, either dilute or diafilter to increase flow rate. - Check membrane holder and filtrate port for blockage. **Filtrate rate abnormally high:** 1. Check membrane for lesions, scratches, or roughness. - Make sure correct membrane type is being used. - Check stirrer assembly to ensure that stirring bar is not contacting the membrane surface. **Cell leaks:** 1. Be sure lower O-ring rests entirely on the membrane peripheral surface. - Check O-rings for nicks and cuts. - Make sure membrane support is seated properly, and that the base is screwed in firmly. - Make sure O-rings are not squeezed out of slots. - Check fittings on gas inlet tubing for correct order and position...|$|E

40|$|DNA {{built from}} modular repeats {{presents}} {{a challenge for}} gene synthesis. We present a solid surface-based sequential ligation approach, which we refer to as iterative <b>capped</b> <b>assembly</b> (ICA), that adds DNA repeat monomers individually to a growing chain while using hairpin ‘capping’ oligonucleotides to block incompletely extended chains, greatly increasing the frequency of full-length final products. Applying ICA to a model problem, construction of custom transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) for genome engineering, we demonstrate efficient synthesis of TALE DNA-binding domains up to 21 monomers long and their ligation into a nuclease-carrying backbone vector all within 3 [*]h. We used ICA to synthesize 20 TALENs of varying DNA target site length and tested their ability to stimulate gene editing by a donor oligonucleotide in human cells. All the TALENS show activity, with the ones > 15 monomers long tending to work best. Since ICA builds full-length constructs from individual monomers rather than large exhaustive libraries of pre-fabricated oligomers, it will be trivial to incorporate future modified TALE monomers with improved or expanded function or to synthesize other types of repeat-modular DNA where the diversity of possible monomers makes exhaustive oligomer libraries impractical.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose an {{effective}} and efficient solution method for the component allocation problem (CAP) in printed circuit board (PCB) assembly, in order to achieve high-throughput rates of the PCB assembly lines. Design/methodology/approach - The investigated CAP is intertwined with the machine optimization problems for each machine in the line because the latter determine the process time of each machine. In order to solve the CAP, a solution method, which integrates a meta-heuristic (genetic algorithm) and a regression model is proposed. Findings - It is found that the established regression model can estimate the process time of each machine accurately and efficiently. Experimental tests show that the proposed solution method can solve the CAP both effectively and efficiently. Research limitations/implications - Although different regression models are required for different types of assembly machines, the proposed solution method can be adopted for solving the <b>CAPs</b> for <b>assembly</b> lines of any configuration, including a mixed-vendor assembly line.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} Contact-State (CS) monitoring for peg-in-hole force-controlled robotic assembly tasks. In order to perform such a monitoring target, the wrench (Cartesian forces and torques) and pose (Cartesian position and orientation) signals of the manipulated object are firstly captured for different CS's of the object (peg) {{with respect to the}} environment including the hole. The captured signals are employed in building a model (a recognizer) for each CS and in the framework of pattern classification the CS monitoring would be addressed. It will be shown that the captured signals are non-stationary, i. e. they have non-normal distribution that would result in performance degradation if using the available monitoring approaches. In this article, the concept of the Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) is used in building the likelihood of each signal and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed in finding the GMM parameters. The use of the GMM would accommodate the signals non-stationary behavior and the EM algorithm would guarantee the estimation of the optimal parameters set of the GMM for each signal and hence the modeling accuracy would be significantly enhanced. In order to see the performance of the suggested CS monitoring scheme, we installed a test stand that is composed of a KUKA Lightweight Robot (LWR) doing a typical peg-in-hole tasks.

40|$|Abstract. Proof-Carrying Code brings two big {{challenges}} to the re-search field of programming languages. One is to seek more expressive logics or type systems to specify or reason about the properties of low-level or high-level programs. The other is to study the technology of certifying compilation in which the compiler generates proofs for pro-grams with annotations. This paper presents our progress in the above two aspects. A pointer logic was designed for PointerC (a C-like pro-gramming language) in our research. As an extension of Hoare logic, our pointer logic expresses the change of pointer information for each statement in its inference rules to support program verification.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} developing novel Contact-State (CS) modeling, control strategy, {{and environment}} position localization (position searching) for force-guided robotic assembly processes of rigid and flexible objects. For the CS modeling, the wrench (Cartesian force and torque) signals of the manipulated object are captured for different {{phases of the}} considered assembly processes and using the Expectation Maximization-based Gaussian Mixtures Model (EM-GMM), a recognizer is developed for each CS of the assembly. The suggested EM-GMM CS modeling scheme is shown to have excellent Classification Success Rate (CSR) with reduced computational efforts. For the control part, it is shown throughout the thesis that a force-guided robotic assembly process is a hybrid nonlinear system with arbitrary switching signal resulted from the constraints arbitrary switching during the assembly. Furthermore, the robot dynamics is frequently unknown, which {{is the case in}} many industrial robots, that would make the force-guided robotic assembly process to be an unknown hybrid nonlinear system with arbitrary switching. In order to overcome such a control challenge, a Decentralized Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Control (DRAFC) strategy is derived that guarantees stable performance under constraints arbitrary switching and unknown dynamics. For the environment position localization, the EM-GMM CS modeling scheme is integrated with a spiral search path and the precise hole position is identified for cases of position uncertainty. Experiments are conducted on a KUKA Lightweight Robot (LWR) doing different force-guided assembly tasks for rigid and flexible objects. Excellent performance is reported for the proposed EM-GMM CS recognition scheme, the DRAFC strategy, and the suggested position searching algorithm. The suggested EM-GMM CS recognition, DRAFC strategy, and position localization schemes are compared with the availably corresponding schemes and the superiority of the suggested schemes is shown. The reasons behind the superiority of the EM-GMM CS recognition scheme are the accommodation of the captured signals non-stationary behavior, employing optimized number of GMM components in the modeling process, and employing the EM algorithm that iteratively increases the log-likelihood. The causes behind the superiority of the DRAFC strategy are addressing the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the robot, accommodating the constraints arbitrary switching, and the robustness against possible dynamics parameters drift. The reasons behind the surpassing of the suggested position localization strategy are the robustness against the surface roughness and reduced computational efforts. The proposed EM-GMM CS modeling scheme, DRAFC strategy, and position searching scheme are applied to the entire peg-in-hole assembly processes of rigid and flexible objects. Excellent Localization Success Rate (LSR) was resulted when using the suggested schemes. Furthermore, the proposed CS modeling scheme, control strategy, and localization approach are applied to a couple of applications in automotive industry; the first one is the camshaft <b>caps</b> <b>assembly</b> of a cylinder head and the other is the air-intake manifold assembly of a powertrain.

40|$|Black gram (Vigna mungo) {{seeds are}} {{a rich source}} of {{digestible}} proteins, however, during storage these seeds are severely damaged by bruchids (Callosobruchus spp.), reducing seed quality and yield losses. Most of the cultivated genotypes of black gram are susceptible to bruchids, however, few tolerant genotypes have also been identified but the mechanism of tolerance is poorly understood. We employed Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) to identify specifically, but rarely expressed bruchid egg induced genes in black gram. In this study, Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) library was constructed to study the genes involved in defense response in black gram against bruchid infestation.

40|$|International audienceProteins {{targeting}} actin filament barbed ends play {{a pivotal}} role in motile processes. While formins enhance filament <b>assembly,</b> <b>capping</b> protein (CP) blocks polymerization. On their own, they both bind barbed ends with high affinity and very slow dissociation. Their barbed-end binding is thought to be mutually exclusive. CP has recently been shown to be present in filopodia and controls their morphology and dynamics. Here we explore how CP and formins may functionally coregulate filament barbed-end assembly. We show, using kinetic analysis of individual filaments by microfluidics-assisted fluorescence microscopy, that CP and mDia 1 formin are able to simultaneously bind barbed ends. This is further confirmed using single-molecule imaging. Their mutually weakened binding enables rapid displacement of one by the other. We show that formin FMNL 2 behaves similarly, thus suggesting that this is a general property of formins. Implications in filopodia regulation and barbed-end structural regulation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) markers {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} the markers {{of choice for}} applications in breeding because of next generation sequencing technology developments. For SNP development by NGS technologies, correct assembly of the huge amounts of sequence data generated is essential. Little is known about assembler's performance, especially when dealing with highly heterogeneous species that show a high genome complexity and what the possible consequences are of differences in assemblies on SNP retrieval. This study tested two assemblers (CAP 3 and CLC) on 454 data from four lily genotypes and compared results with respect to SNP retrieval. Results <b>CAP</b> 3 <b>assembly</b> resulted in higher numbers of contigs, lower numbers of reads per contig, and shorter average read lengths compared to CLC. Blast comparisons showed that CAP 3 contigs were highly redundant. Contrastingly, CLC in rare cases combined paralogs in one contig. Redundant and chimeric contigs may lead to erroneous SNPs. Filtering for redundancy {{can be done by}} blasting selected SNP markers to the contigs and discarding all the SNP markers that show more than one blast hit. Results on chimeric contigs showed that only four out of 2, 421 SNP markers were selected from chimeric contigs. Conclusion In practice, CLC performs better in assembling highly heterogeneous genome sequences compared to CAP 3, and consequently SNP retrieval is more efficient. Additionally a simple flow scheme is suggested for SNP marker retrieval that can be valid for all non-model species. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The ongoing {{efforts to}} {{sequence}} the honey bee genome require additional initiatives to define its transcriptome. Towards this end, we employed the Open Reading frame ESTs (ORESTES) strategy to generate profiles {{for the life}} cycle of Apis mellifera workers. Results Of the 5, 021 ORESTES, 35. 2 % matched with previously deposited Apis ESTs. The analysis of the remaining sequences defined a set of putative orthologs whose majority had their best-match hits with Anopheles and Drosophila genes. <b>CAP</b> 3 <b>assembly</b> of the Apis ORESTES with the already existing 15, 500 Apis ESTs generated 3, 408 contigs. BLASTX comparison of these contigs with protein sets of organisms representing distinct phylogenetic clades revealed a total of 1, 629 contigs that Apis mellifera shares with different taxa. Most (41 %) represent genes that are in common to all taxa, another 21 % are shared between metazoans (Bilateria), and 16 % are shared only within the Insecta clade. A set of 23 putative genes presented a best match with human genes, many of which encode factors related to cell signaling/signal transduction. 1, 779 contigs (52 %) did not match any known sequence. Applying a correction factor deduced from a parallel analysis performed with Drosophila melanogaster ORESTES, we estimate that approximately half of these no-match ESTs contigs (22 %) should represent Apis -specific genes. Conclusions The versatile and cost-efficient ORESTES approach produced minilibraries for honey bee life cycle stages. Such information on central gene regions contributes to genome annotation and also lends itself to cross-transcriptome comparisons to reveal evolutionary trends in insect genomes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tropomodulin (Tmod) is an actin pointed-end capping {{protein that}} regulates actin {{dynamics}} at thin filament pointed ends in striated muscle. Although pointed-end capping by Tmod controls thin filament lengths in assembled myofibrils, {{its role in}} length specification during de novo myofibril assembly is not established. We used the Drosophila Tmod homologue, sanpodo (spdo), to investigate Tmod's function during muscle development in the indirect flight muscle. SPDO {{was associated with the}} pointed ends of elongating thin filaments throughout myofibril assembly. Transient overexpression of SPDO during myofibril assembly irreversibly arrested elongation of preexisting thin filaments. However, the lengths of thin filaments assembled after SPDO levels had declined were normal. Flies with a preponderance of abnormally short thin filaments were unable to fly. We conclude that: (a) thin filaments elongate from their pointed ends during myofibril assembly; (b) pointed ends are dynamically capped at endogenous levels of SPDO so as to allow elongation; (c) a transient increase in SPDO levels during myofibril assembly converts SPDO from a dynamic to a permanent cap; and (d) developmental regulation of pointed-end <b>capping</b> during myofibril <b>assembly</b> is crucial for specification of final thin filament lengths, myofibril structure, and muscle function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) are mobile sequences {{found in}} nearly all eukaryotic genomes. They {{have the ability to}} move and replicate within a genome, often influencing genome evolution and gene expression. The identification of TEs {{is an important part of}} every genome project. The number of sequenced genomes is rapidly rising, and the need to identify TEs within them is also growing. The ability to do this automatically and effectively in a manner similar to the methods used for genes is of increasing importance. There exist many difficulties in identifying TEs, including their tendency to degrade over time and that many do not adhere to a conserved structure. In this work, we describe a homology-based approach for the automatic identification of high-quality consensus TEs, aimed for use in the analysis of newly sequenced genomes. Results We describe a homology-based approach for the automatic identification of TEs in genomes. Our modular approach is dependent on a thorough and high-quality library of representative TEs. The implementation of the approach, named TESeeker, is BLAST-based, but also makes use of the <b>CAP</b> 3 <b>assembly</b> program and the ClustalW 2 multiple sequence alignment tool, as well as numerous BioPerl scripts. We apply our approach to newly sequenced genomes and successfully identify consensus TEs that are up to 99 % identical to manually annotated TEs. Conclusions While TEs are known to be a major force in the evolution of genomes, the automatic identification of TEs in genomes is far from mature. In particular, there is a lack of automated homology-based approaches that produce high-quality TEs. Our approach is able to generate high-quality consensus TE sequences automatically, requiring the user to only provide a few basic parameters. This approach is intentionally modular, allowing researchers to use components separately or iteratively. Our approach is most effective for TEs with intact reading frames. The implementation, TESeeker, is available for download as a virtual appliance, while the library of representative TEs is available as a separate download. </p...|$|R

Highly skilled labors {{and a number of}} adjustable knobs are required to produce the high quality coating works using the conventional au-tomatic spray gun which is cost intensive. Therefore, linear motor operated multiple spray operations spray gun has been developed. This spray gun consists of two spray units, an air control and supply unit and a triggering unit to carry out the multiple spray operations. This paper focuses on the design optimization and fabrication of the housing of the spray units which hold fluid nozzles, air nozzles, an <b>assembly</b> <b>cap,</b> a needle valve or a ball valve. In the air less and air assisted airless spray systems, high pressurized liquid is passed through the nozzle which is held by the housing of the spray unit. Before entering into the nozzle, the high pressurized liquid is passed through the housing. For the simplicity of the analysis, it is assumed that the housing is an open-ended pressure vessel. From the analysis, dimensions and material selection have been optimized and finally the spray units have been fabricated and tested. During the performance test it is seen that satisfactory transfer efficiency of spray operation has been achieved by using newly developed spray housing of the spray units, which proves the stability of the spray housing during high pressure operation...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection of CD 4 (+) T cells {{leads to the}} production of new virions that assemble at the plasma membrane. Gag and Env accumulate in the context of lipid rafts at the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, respectively, forming polarized domains from which HIV- 1 buds. HIV- 1 budding can result in either release of cell-free virions or direct cell-cell spread via a virological synapse (VS). The recruitment of Gag and Env to these plasma membrane caps in T cells is poorly understood but may require elements of the T-cell secretory apparatus coordinated by the cytoskeleton. Using fixed-cell immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy, we observed a high percentage of HIV- 1 -infected T cells with polarized Env and Gag in <b>capped,</b> lipid raft-like <b>assembly</b> domains. Treatment of infected T cells with inhibitors of actin or tubulin remodeling disrupted Gag and Env compartmentalization within the polarized raft-like domains. Depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton reduced Gag release and viral infectivity, and actin and tubulin inhibitors reduced Env incorporation into virions. Live- and fixed-cell confocal imaging and assay of de novo DNA synthesis by real-time PCR allowed quantification of HIV- 1 cell-cell transfer. Inhibition of actin and tubulin remodeling in infected cells interfered with cell-cell spread across a VS and reduced new viral DNA synthesis. Based on these data, we propose that HIV- 1 requires both actin and tubulin components of the T-cell cytoskeleton to direct its assembly and budding and to elaborate a functional VS...|$|R
30|$|Metal {{nanoparticles}} {{are one of}} {{the basic}} building blocks of nanotechnology. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have attracted enormous attention in chemistry, biomedicine, and electronics due to their very small size, oxide-free surfaces, bio-conjugation properties, good biocompatibility, and unique optical properties. Specifically, because of their optical activity in the near infrared (NIR), GNPs are extensively utilized in immunoassays [1, 2], drug delivery systems [3] as well as imaging, detection, and thermal therapy of cancer [4 – 6]. These applications have sparked great interest in the development of synthetic methods for preparing different gold-based nanostructures. The anisotropy in nanoparticle shape offers high near-infrared absorption and improved Raman scattering [7]. Based on Mie scattering theory, shifts in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [8] occur when the particles deviate from spherical geometry. Non-spherical gold nanoparticles present multiple absorption bands correlating with their multiple axes, and they can support both propagating and localized surface plasmon resonances [7]. The number of SPR peaks usually increases as the symmetry of nanoparticles decreases; spherical nanoparticles exhibit only one peak, whereas two and three peaks are often observed in nanorods, nanodisks, and triangular nanoplates, respectively. Many anisotropic gold nanostructures like gold nanotubes [9, 10], nanocages [11], gold nanoshells [6], gold nanorods [12], and gold triangular nanoprisms [13, 14] have been developed and demonstrate enhanced and adjustable absorption in the NIR region. However, most of these gold nanostructures require a complicated multistep and time-consuming synthesis process, which includes shaping the particles by use of templates, kinetically controlling the facet growth rates of seeds with assistance of <b>capping</b> reagents, and <b>assembly</b> of preformed spherical colloid nanoparticles [7].|$|R
