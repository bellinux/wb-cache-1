5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and <b>Criminal</b> <b>Evidence</b> Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{authority}} {{to the effect that}} a court will not generally grant a declaration if it considers the issue at hand to be an academic question or one that is entirely hypothetical. For instance, in Vince v. Chief Constable of Dorset Police (1992), proceedings against the Chief Constable of Dorset Police were brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of members of the Police Federation of England and Wales to, among other things, enable chief constables throughout the country to know where they stood on a question of law with respect to the Police and <b>Criminal</b> <b>Evidence</b> Act 1984, namely, whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36(3) of the Act. Affirming the decision of the judge below, a majority of the Court of Appeal declined to make a declaration on the matter. It took the view that since {{there was no evidence that}} any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer, the issue was academic or hypothetical.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{specific}} rights apply in criminal cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and <b>Criminal</b> <b>Evidence</b> Act 1984 and the Access to Justice Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice. The prosecution is under a common law duty to disclose all relevant evidence including that which may assist the defendant. The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and <b>Criminal</b> <b>Evidence</b> Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a presumption of innocence. In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct a jury to find a defendant guilty. There is also a right to jury trial, the accused should be able to follow proceedings and {{they have a right to}} be present during proceedings. The application of the double jeopardy rule was limited by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E
25|$|Under section 107 of the Police and <b>Criminal</b> <b>Evidence</b> Act 1984, Sergeants and Chief Inspectors may be {{designated}} (by {{an officer of}} at least the rank of Superintendent) to exercise the powers of an Inspector or a Superintendent respectively. Such a designation will generally accompany such an officer being given an acting rank, so for most operational purposes {{there is no difference}} between substantive, temporary and acting ranks at Inspector and above (although there may be differences as to pay, pensions and insignia). On the other hand, under section 36 of that Act, only substantive Sergeants may be appointed custody officers.|$|E

25|$|Within the British police, {{sergeant}} is {{the first}} supervisory rank. Sergeant is senior {{to the rank of}} constable, and junior to inspector. The rank is mostly operational, meaning that sergeants are directly concerned with day-to-day policing. Uniformed sergeants are often responsible for supervising a shift of constables and allocating duties to them. Prisoner-handling stations will also have one or more separate custody sergeants who are responsible for authorising and supervising the detention of arrested persons in accordance with the Police and <b>Criminal</b> <b>Evidence</b> Act, along with the daily management and effective running of the custody suite.|$|E

There is also an instruction for escape, under which RO members have to look for a hiding place of their own and always possess 100 thousand Korean won in cash. They were also told to evade the investigators' chase by fleeing and exchanging secret passwords when reconnecting a RO member.|$|E

500|$|False {{imprisonment}} {{is defined}} as [...] "depriving the claimant of freedom of movement, without a lawful justification for doing so". Unlike assault and battery, false imprisonment is a tort of strict liability: no intention on the behalf of the defendant is needed, but the imprisonment must {{be caused by a}} deliberate act (as decided in Sayers v Harlow Urban District Council, where a faulty lock, not a deliberate act from another party, caused a woman to become trapped in a public toilet) and must be unlawful.

50|$|In its {{conclusion}} to the Lundy report, the Police Authority concluded Lundy's team had got {{too close to}} the <b>criminals.</b> <b>Evidence</b> came for this from the statistics for armed robbery in the Metropolitan area. In 1972, the annual total of armed robberies in the Metropolitan district was 380 - the year after Smalls, it had reduced to 168. By 1978, it had risen to 734 and by 1982 it had more than doubled, to 1,772 - a 366 per cent increase in a decade. The Flying Squad was revived to centralise specialist robbery squads and to improve technical surveillance and the provision of police tactical firearms units.|$|R
