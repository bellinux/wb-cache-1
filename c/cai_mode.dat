After a server interruption, the server can either continue the transmission of the message or can completely retransmit the message. These modes are called Continue After Interruption (<b>CAI)</b> <b>mode</b> and Repeat After Interruption (RAI) mode respectively. Two types of traffic are considered (i) multimedia data traffic server operates on Continuous After Interrupt (<b>CAI)</b> <b>mode</b> and (ii) normal data traffic mode server is at Retransmit after Interrupt (RAI) mode. First, we give some general results on a GI- 1 - 1 queue. Next we derive expression for the probability generating function of system contents and cell delays. Some performance measures such as mean delays have been derived in both types of server modes.

40|$|Gasoline Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine has the {{potential}} of providing better fuel economy and emissions characteristics than current spark ignition engines. One implementation of this technology employs a Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system and is also often referred to as Controlled Auto Ignition (CAI) combustion in the literature. The objective of the study can be divided into two topics. First, the dynamic nature of load trajectory and several important phenomena in <b>CAI</b> <b>mode</b> were investigated. Second, the issues encountered during mode transition between SI and CAI regime were considered. Despite wide-open-throttle operation, pumping loss in <b>CAI</b> <b>mode</b> was not negligible. A major source of pumping loss in <b>CAI</b> <b>mode</b> was the heat transfer to cylinder wall during the recompression process due to the high in-cylinder residual gas temperature. The influence of fuel air equivalence ratio on combustion stability was analyzed to explain the misfires phenomenon in fuel rich condition during transient operation. Heat release analysis has been conducted to characterize the combustion process in <b>CAI</b> <b>mode.</b> Large variations of the 50 % burned point due to fluctuation of residual gas mass and temperature were observed. Small step changes in valve timings (EVC, EVO, and IVC) and fueling resulted in a new steady state within 3 - 4 engine cycles at 1500 rpm. These small step changes are reversible in nature. Sudden large step change in load required much longer time to reach steady state due to the time required for thermal stabilization. Misfires were observed in large low-load-to-high-load step change but not in high-load-to-low-load step change. (cont.) A simple open loop controller based on linear interpolation of fuel injection and valve timing events was implemented to assess the time scale required to avoid misfires during large load perturbation. Mode transition from the SI to CAI regime may be categorized as failed, non-robust, and robust. In a failed transition, the engine would not reach steady state CAI combustion. In a non-robust transition, one or more intended CAI cycles misfire, although the cycles progress to a satisfactory CAI operating after a few cycles. In robust transition, every intended CAI cycle is successful. A mode transition strategy based on late IVC and fuel metering strategy has been proposed. Smooth and robust modes transitions both from SI to CAI and vice versa have been experimentally demonstrated by implementing this strategy. by Halim G. Santoso. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A two part {{research}} {{study has been}} completed {{on the topic of}} compression after impact (CAI) of thin facesheet honeycomb core sandwich panels. The research has focused on both experiments and analysis in an effort to establish and validate a new understanding of the damage tolerance of these materials. Part one, the subject of the current paper, is focused on the experimental testing. Of interest are sandwich panels, with aerospace applications, which consist of very thin, woven S 2 -fiberglass (with MTM 45 - 1 epoxy) facesheets adhered to a Nomex honeycomb core. Two sets of specimens, which were identical {{with the exception of the}} density of the honeycomb core, were tested. Static indentation and low velocity impact using a drop tower are used to study damage formation in these materials. A series of highly instrumented CAI tests was then completed. New techniques used to observe CAI response and failure include high speed video photography, as well as digital image correlation (DIC) for full-field deformation measurement. Two <b>CAI</b> failure <b>modes,</b> indentation propagation, and crack propagation, were observed. From the results, it can be concluded that the <b>CAI</b> failure <b>mode</b> of these panels depends solely on the honeycomb core density...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{in their}} various forms have {{great potential for}} use in the development of multifunctional multiscale laminated composites due to their unique geometry and properties. Recent advancements in the development of CNT hierarchical composites have mostly focused on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). In this work, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were used to develop nano-modified carbonfiber/epoxylaminates. A functionalization technique based on reduced SWCNT was employed to improve dispersion and epoxy resin-nanotube interaction. A commercial prepregging unit was then used to impregnate unidirectional carbonfiber tape with a modified epoxy system containing 0. 1 wt% functionalized SWCNT. Impact and compression-after-impact (<b>CAI)</b> tests, <b>Mode</b> I interlaminar fracture toughness and Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness tests were performed on laminates with and without SWCNT. It was found that incorporation of 0. 1 wt% of SWCNT resulted in a 5 % reduction of the area of impact damage, a 3. 5 % increase in CAI strength, a 13 % increase in Mode I fracture toughness, and 28 % increase in Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness. A comparison between the results of this work and literature results on MWCNT-modified laminated composites suggests that SWCNT, at similar loadings, are more effective in enhancing the mechanicalperformance of traditional laminated composites.

Students interact with RMT to reinforce what they learn in class in five different topics. In this paper, we evaluate a different population of students and replicate our prior research: despite the relatively small amount of exposure during the term to RMT compared to other course-related activities, students learn significantly more on topics covered with RMT [1]. However, we did not find the same advantage for the dialog-based tutoring mode of RMT over the <b>CAI</b> <b>mode.</b> When transcript analyses indicated that a small but significant number of students were gaming the system by entering empty or nonsense responses, we modified the tutor to require reasonable attempts. This did lead some students to reform their gaming ways. In other cases, however, it resulted in disengagement from tutoring at least temporarily because reasonable answers were not recognized...|$|E

40|$|This item is Closed Access. After {{validation}} of the numerical model against published laser doppler anemometry (LDA) experimental data (Pitcher et al., 2003), numerical calculations {{have been carried out}} to investigate the in-cylinder transient flow structure of a controlled auto-ignition (CAI) engine running at speeds of 1, 500 rpm and 2, 000 rpm. The geometry configuration of the engine is imported into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code used in this study. The simulations take into account the movement of the inlet, exhaust valves and the piston. To simulate an engine in controlled auto-ignition (<b>CAI)</b> <b>mode,</b> the same valve timing that allows 36 % gas residuals was applied to the model. The evolution of the flow pattern inside the cylinder at the symmetrical cross section is described.

They are required to equip student nurses with the competencies to render healthcare in technologically advanced healthcare settings. Modern developments in information communication and educational technologies compel nurse educators to make a paradigm shift by redirecting the emphasis from traditional methods of instruction to computer-assisted instruction (CAI) and computer-based learning. This study investigated the nature of student nurses' exposure to CAI and computer-based learning, the perceived benefits of this exposure, {{as well as the}} challenges encountered.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a closed-loop controller for use on a Controlled-Auto- Ignition (CAI) / Spark-Ignition (SI) mixed mode engine equipped with a variable-valve-timing (VVT) mechanism. The controller in this study was designed only for use in the CAI regime. Operation in the SI regime and control of transitions between the <b>CAI</b> and SI <b>modes</b> were considered to be outside the scope of this study. The first part of the study involved creating an open-loop feedforward controller. This controller transformed desired engine output into required input based on a mapping of the steady-state output-to-input transfer function at constant engine speed and intake manifold temperature. Since the mapping domain was limited, the open-loop controller did not compensate for changes in operating conditions. This controller was used to study the transient response of the engine. Using the transient data, a mathematical representation of the engine output; i. e. mean effective pressure (MEP) and fuel-air equivalence ratio (), its in-cylinder state; i. e. mass of fuel, mass of air, percent mass exhaust gas residual and pressure, and input to the engine; i. e. mass of fuel, intake valve closing and exhaust valve closing, was developed. This representation showed that the CAI engine is effectively a quasi-static system in that the output of any given cycle depends almost entirely on the in-cylinder state at the start of that cycle, and that the latter depends almost entirely on prior cycle input. The quasi-static nature of the CAI engine effectively defined the architecture of the closed-loop controller; namely, a feedforward and feedback sub-controllers. A numerical model of the CAI engine and a closed-loop control system were developed. (cont.) A comparison of output from the model and engine showed excellent correlation. The model was then used to determine the gains of the closed-loop controller. Validation of the closed-loop controller consisted of comparing output from the CAI engine subject to closed-loop control to both the desired output and output from the engine subject to open-loop control. Visual cycle- by-cycle and statistical comparisons showed that the performance of the CAI engine improved significantly when subject to closed-loop control. This was especially true when the environmental and operating parameters not included in the original feedforward mapping; i. e. engine speed and intake manifold temperature, were allowed to vary. by Jeffrey A.

The effects of nano-particle coating {{and the degree of}} damage induced by the simulated lightning strikes on AE activities were examined, and the relationship between the compressive residual strength and AE behavior has been evaluated in terms of AE event counts and the onset of AE activity with the compressive loading. The degree of impact damage was also measured in terms of damage area by using ultrasonic C-scan images. The assessment during the CAI tests of damaged CFRP showed that AE monitoring appeared to be useful to differentiate the degree of damage hence the mechanical integrity of composite structures damaged by lightning strikes...|$|E
40|$|The {{validation}} of surrogates formulated using a computational framework by Ahmed et al. [1]for two purely paraffinic gasoline fuels labelled FACE A and FACE C was undertaken in this study. The ability of these surrogate mixtures {{to be used}} in modelling LTC engines was accessed by comparison of their low temperature oxidation chemistry with that of the respective parent fuel as well as a PRF based on RON. This was done by testing the surrogate mixtures in a modified Cooperative Fuels Research (CFR) engine running in Controlled Autoignition Mode (<b>CAI)</b> <b>mode.</b> The engine was run at a constant speed of 600 rpm at an equivalence ratio of 0. 5 with the intake temperature at 150 °C and a pressure of 98 kPa. The low temperature reactivity of the fuels were studied by varying the compression ratio of the engine from the point were very only small low temperature heat release was observed to a point beyond which auto-ignition of the fuel/air mixture occurred. The apparent heat release rates of different fuels was calculated from the pressure histories using first law analysis and the CA 50 times of the low temperature heat release (LTHR) were compared.

40|$|Gasoline is {{the most}} widely used fuel for light duty {{automobile}} transportation, but its molecular complexity makes it intractable to experimentally and computationally study the fundamental combustion properties. Therefore, surrogate fuels with a simpler molecular composition that represent real fuel behavior in one or more aspects are needed to enable repeatable experimental and computational combustion investigations. This study presents a novel computational methodology for formulating surrogates for FACE (fuels for advanced combustion engines) gasolines A and C by combining regression modeling with physical and chemical kinetics simulations. The computational methodology integrates simulation tools executed across different software platforms. Initially, the palette of surrogate species and carbon types for the target fuels were determined from a detailed hydrocarbon analysis (DHA). A regression algorithm implemented in MATLAB was linked to REFPROP for simulation of distillation curves and calculation of physical properties of surrogate compositions. The MATLAB code generates a surrogate composition at each iteration, which is then used to automatically generate CHEMKIN input files that are submitted to homogeneous batch reactor simulations for prediction of research octane number (RON). The regression algorithm determines the optimal surrogate composition to match the fuel properties of FACE A and C gasoline, specifically hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, density, distillation characteristics, carbon types, and RON. The optimal surrogate fuel compositions obtained using the present computational approach was compared to the real fuel properties, as well as with surrogate compositions available in the literature. Experiments were conducted within a Cooperative Fuels Research (CFR) engine operating under controlled autoignition (<b>CAI)</b> <b>mode</b> to compare the formulated surrogates against the real fuels. Carbon monoxide measurements indicated that the proposed surrogates accurately reproduced the global reactivity of the real fuels across various combustion regimes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1979 The {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of extraversion, sex and computer based modes of drill and practice in arithmetic on achievement in arithmetic for grade three children. A computer based system of drill and practice in arithmetic, based on the 'Strands' program from Stanford University, was developed and implemented for the experiment which was conducted during Term II, 1978. The system of drill and practice was used in an interactive, individualized <b>mode</b> (<b>CAI),</b> a non-interactive individualized mode (CMI) and two modes in which the teacher selected exercises from the program. In one of these teacher selected modes the performances of the children were displayed in the classroom. The children were classified as extraverts, introverts or medium extraverts {{as a result of their}} responses to the Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory. The grade three children at Moreland Primary School were pretested for initial arithmetic achievement. They were randomly allocated to treatments of drill and practice in arithmetic after being ranked on the extraversion scale. The experimental program extended over eleven weeks in which the children were given daily drill and practice in arithmetic using the mode to which they were assigned. One hundred and seventeen students completed the program and the posttest. The experimental design for the investigation is a 2 X 3 X 4 factorial model for which an analysis of covariance was used to test the significance of the hypotheses formulated for the study. The cell frequency for the twenty-four cells was randomly reduced to three to enable analysis of covariance for equal cell frequencies. The hypotheses which were supported by significant t statistics are: i. Extravert students performed at a higher level of achievement in arithmetic than introverts ii. Boys had superior performance on the non-displayed mode of teacher selected. drill; when the results for the teacher selected mode were displayed the girls had superior performances iii. Extraverts are better suited to non-individualized modes of drill than introverts In six cases the analysis indicated possible trends that: i. Boys performed better than girls. ii. The performances on the teacher selected modes were superior to those on the individualized modes iii. The interactive, individualized mode of Grill and practice (CAI) produced superior results to the non-interactive individualized mode (CMI) iv. Extraverts are favoured by CAI, while the introverts are favoured by CMI v. In the teacher selected modes the introverts' performances improved on the displayed results mode; the extraverts' performances improved on the non-display of results, thus reducing the superiority of the. extraverts when the results were displayed.
