500|$|One type of focal injury, {{cerebral}} laceration, {{occurs when}} the tissue is cut or torn. Such tearing is common in orbitofrontal cortex in particular, because of bony protrusions on the interior skull ridge above the eyes. [...] In a similar injury, <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> (bruising of brain tissue), blood is mixed among tissue. In contrast, intracranial hemorrhage involves bleeding that is not mixed with tissue.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} factor in whether a person will develop early and late seizures is the extent of the damage to the brain. [...] More severe brain injury also confers a risk for developing PTS for a longer time after the event. [...] One study found that the probability that seizures will occur within 5years of injury is in 0.5% of mild traumatic brain injuries (defined as no skull fracture and less than 30minutes of post-traumatic amnesia, abbreviated PTA, or loss of consciousness, abbreviated LOC); 1.2% of moderate injuries (skull fracture or PTA or LOC lasting between [...] 30minutes and 24hours); and 10.0% of severe injuries (<b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion,</b> intracranial hematoma, or LOC or PTA for over 24hours). Another study found that the risk of seizures 5years after TBI is 1.5% in mild (defined as PTA or LOC for less than 30minutes), 2.9% in moderate (LOC lasting between 30minutes and 1day), and 17.2% in severe TBI (<b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion,</b> subdural hematoma, or LOC for over a day; image at right).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the heat}} of a game, it may be hard to see or feel {{symptoms}} relating to <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions.</b> If any of these signs are visible or as an athlete, you feel them, remove yourself from competition immediately. <b>Cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> and other injuries can occur in any sport, not just in the traditional “collision” sports. According to the USCPSC, four of the top five sports that cause brain injuries are considered to have limited brain contact: basketball, bicycling, baseball, and playground activities. [...] The most popular sport to cause <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> is American football due to the drastic acceleration/deceleration of the brain.|$|R

2500|$|Immediate {{and early}} {{seizures}} {{are thought to}} be a direct reaction to the injury, while late seizures are believed to result from damage to the cerebral cortex by mechanisms such as excitotoxicity and iron from blood. Immediate seizures occurring within two seconds of injury probably occur because the force from the injury stimulates brain tissue that has a low threshold for seizures when stimulated. [...] Early PTS are considered to be provoked seizure, because they result from the direct effects of the head trauma and are thus not considered to be actual epilepsy, while late seizures are thought to indicate permanent changes in the brain's structure and to imply epilepsy. [...] Early seizures can be caused by factors such as cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> or laceration. Factors that may result in seizures that occur within two weeks of an insult include the presence of blood within the brain; alterations in the blood brain barrier; excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate; damage to tissues caused by free radicals; and changes in the way cells produce energy. Late seizures {{are thought to be}} the result of epileptogenesis, in which neural networks are restructured in a way that increases the likelihood that they will become excited, leading to seizures.|$|E
50|$|Since {{cerebral}} swelling {{presents a}} danger to the patient, treatment of <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> aims to prevent swelling. Measures to avoid swelling include prevention of hypotension (low blood pressure), hyponatremia (insufficient sodium), and hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide in the blood). Due to the danger of increased intracranial pressure, surgery may be necessary to reduce it. People with <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> may require intensive care and close monitoring.|$|E

Thirty patients were reviewed and in 6 (20 %) a delayed haematoma was diagnosed on a later CT scan, when signs of <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> were absent initially. Recurrence of intracranial hypertension within 3 to 4 h proved to be a significant indication for the development of these haematomas, despite the initial but inconsistent good response to osmotic diuretics.

5000|$|In the Ontario study, all catastrophic {{injuries}} {{recorded for}} recreational canoeing were fatal, {{and accounted for}} 4.3% of all sport and recreation fatalities in the province. Of the 27 cases, 24 fatalities resulted from drowning, and the others from <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions,</b> <b>cerebral</b> lacerations, and skull fractures. Canoeing drowning fatalities are [...] "often correlated with alcohol consumption", as it increases the probability of submersion and decreases the probability of recovery from submersion. They are often associated with young males inexperienced in canoeing.|$|R
50|$|A skull {{fracture}} {{occurs when}} a bone in the skull breaks, and may penetrate the brain, tearing arteries, veins, or meninges, leading to the functional impairment of walking, communication, thinking, or feeling. Cerebral lacerations (tearing of brain tissue) or <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> (bruising of brain tissue) usually damage the cerebral cortex, resulting in permanent neurological deficits.|$|R
50|$|In January 2009, {{a right-wing}} extremist {{affiliated}} with the Republican Social Movement attacked the Sinagoga Major. He struck the building's facade repeatedly with a baseball bat, and when a synagogue employee approached him, he beat the worker so severely with the bat the man had to be hospitalized with <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> and a broken arm. The attacker was detained by police.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cerebral</b> <b>contusion,</b> Latin contusio cerebri, {{a form of}} {{traumatic}} brain injury, is a bruise of the brain tissue. [...] Like bruises in other tissues, <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> {{can be associated with}} multiple microhemorrhages, small blood vessel leaks into brain tissue. Contusion occurs in 20-30% of severe head injuries. A cerebral laceration is a similar injury except that, according to their respective definitions, the pia-arachnoid membranes are torn over the site of injury in laceration and are not torn in contusion. [...] The injury can cause a decline in mental function in the long term and in the emergency setting may result in brain herniation, a life-threatening condition in which parts of the brain are squeezed past parts of the skull. Thus treatment aims to prevent dangerous rises in intracranial pressure, the pressure within the skull.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effects of}} a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> depend on {{the cause of the}} injury and what part of the brain was most affected. Outcomes vary from minor {{injuries}} that require short recovery times to severe injuries that can lead to death. [...] Short-term effects of cerebral contusions can range from a mild headache to feeling lightheaded for a few days. Most short-term effects match that of a mild head injury while long-term effects can be much more serious. Most long-term injuries require surgery, rehabilitation, and close monitoring. In small cases, cerebral contusions can lead to death (about 15 per 100,000 people). If a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> leads to a coma, recovery can be very long and rehabilitation extensive. If the coma is long, the probability of dying or permanent neurological damage is very possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> (bruising on the brain) depend on {{the severity of the}} injury, ranging from minor to severe. Individuals may experience a headache; confusion; sleepiness; dizziness; loss of consciousness; nausea and vomiting; seizures; and difficulty with coordination and movement. They may also have difficulty with memory, vision, speech, hearing, managing emotions, and thinking. Signs depend on the contusion's location in the brain.|$|E
5000|$|In football, medical {{trainers}} {{are well}} versed to diagnose symptoms pertaining to a traumatic brain injury. They are not, however, {{able to determine}} what type of injury it is or the extent the injury stems. Football trainers can medically clear or not clear players based on brain injury symptoms. If a trainer feels that certain symptoms exist {{that are similar to}} that of <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions,</b> they will take the player out of the game and rush them to the hospital. Upon admission into the hospital, a CT scan will be ordered. A CT scan is the quickest method to diagnose <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> because it can be performed immediately and have fairly exact findings. [...] The best method, as suggested by medical doctors, is an MRI because they present more sensitive and accurate findings. MRI’s, however, must be scheduled and cannot be completed immediately following the injury. MRI’s also {{take a long time to}} perform where the injury a player sustained may get worse within that time frame.|$|R
5000|$|While {{penetrating}} {{head trauma}} {{accounts for only}} a small percentage of all traumatic brain injuries, it is associated with a high mortality rate, and only a third of people with penetrating head trauma survive long enough to arrive at a hospital. [...] Injuries from firearms are the leading cause of TBI-related deaths. Penetrating head trauma can cause <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> and lacerations, intracranial hematomas, pseudoaneurysms, and arteriovenous fistulas. The prognosis for penetrating head injuries varies widely.|$|R

50|$|In head injury, a coup injury occurs {{under the}} site of impact with an object, and a contrecoup injury occurs on the side {{opposite}} the area that was hit. Coup and contrecoup injuries are associated with <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions,</b> a type of traumatic brain injury in which the brain is bruised. Coup and contrecoup injuries can occur individually or together. When a moving object impacts the stationary head, coup injuries are typical, while contrecoup injuries are produced when the moving head strikes a stationary object.|$|R
5000|$|In sports, most <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> {{are caused}} when {{the brain is}} either {{suddenly}} accelerated, decelerated, or strikes an immovable object. [...] When the blow happens, brain tissue can be damaged, sometimes resulting in the need for hospitalization and surgery. A resection of the contused tissue is needed within surgery pending {{the severity of the}} incident. The highest rates of contusions occur in men between the ages of 15 to 24, somewhat due to their aggressive nature. [...] If a person sustains a contusion one time, {{they are more likely to}} sustain a repeated one.|$|R
5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|R
50|$|Though it is {{more likely}} to cause infection, {{penetrating}} trauma is similar to closed head injury such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion</b> or intracranial hemorrhage. As in closed head injury, intracranial pressure is likely to increase due to swelling or bleeding, potentially crushing delicate brain tissue. Most deaths from penetrating trauma are caused by damage to blood vessels, which can lead to intracranial hematomas and ischemia, which can in turn lead to a biochemical cascade called the ischemic cascade. The injury in penetrating brain trauma is mostly focal (that is, it affects a specific area of tissue).|$|E
50|$|The initial injury {{may be a}} {{concussion}}, {{or it may be}} another, more severe, type of head trauma, such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion.</b> However, {{the first}} concussion need not be severe for the second impact to cause SIS. Also, the second impact may be very minor, even a blow such as an impact to the chest that causes the head to jerk, thereby transmitting forces of acceleration to the brain. Loss of consciousness during the second injury is not necessary for SIS to occur. Both injuries may take place in the same game.|$|E
5000|$|Although Franklin {{described}} PTA, {{it was the}} British physician C. P. Symonds {{who first}} discussed the specific amnesiac symptoms that often follow a <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusion,</b> which is a specific kind of traumatic brain injury. Symonds observed that the patient remains [...] "stuperose, restless and irritable" [...] after recovering consciousness. He also identified a recovery period of days to weeks for this post-concussive state. Presumably, shorter durations of PTA, which are now included in the definition, were not thought to be serious enough for documentation. Most importantly, he identified the amnesia that the patient experiences {{during this period of}} recovery, and recommended the use of [...] "formal tests for memory and retention" [...] to assess recovery.|$|E
25|$|Acute bleeds often develop {{after high}} speed {{acceleration}} or deceleration injuries and are increasingly severe with larger hematomas. They are most severe if associated with <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions.</b> Though {{much faster than}} chronic subdural bleeds, acute subdural bleeding is usually venous and therefore slower than the typically arterial bleeding of an epidural hemorrhage. Acute subdural bleeds have a high mortality rate, higher even than epidural hematomas and diffuse brain injuries, because the force (acceleration/deceleration) required to cause them causes other severe injuries as well. The mortality rate associated with acute subdural hematoma is around 60 to 80%.|$|R
50|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> or hematomas.

People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cerebral</b> <b>contusions</b> are bruises to {{the brain}} caused by a direct {{blow to the head}} causing the brain to bounce against the inside of the skull and bruise brain tissue. [...] The force of the blow causes either a tearing or {{twisting}} of the structure and blood vessels which hinders the ability of the receptors to send feedback {{to the brain}}. With the tearing or twisting of structure, the brain begins to swell and bleed. Since the brain cavity has no room to expand due to the swelling, bruises begin to form. Due {{to the nature of the}} injury, most of the contusive damage is found deeper in the brain.|$|R
