60|$|In England itself, on {{the other}} hand, we {{have at least one}} kind of fish which exemplifies the {{opposite}} or migratory solution of the dry pond problem, and that is our familiar friend the <b>common</b> <b>eel.</b> The ways of eels are indeed mysterious, for nobody has ever yet succeeded in discovering where, when, or how they manage to spawn; nobody has ever yet seen an eel's egg, or caught a female eel in the spawning condition, or even observed a really adult male or female specimen of perfect development. All the eels ever found in fresh water are immature and undeveloped creatures. But eels do certainly spawn somewhere or other in the deep sea, and every year, {{in the course of the}} summer, flocks of young ones, known as elvers, ascend the rivers in enormous quantities, like a vast army under numberless leaders. At each tributary or affluent, be it river, brook, stream, or ditch, a proportionate detachment of the main body is given off to explore the various branches, while the central force wriggles its way up the chief channel, regardless of obstacles, with undiminished vigour. When the young elvers come to a weir, a wall, a floodgate, or a lasher, they simply squirm their way up the perpendicular barrier with indescribable wrigglings, as if they were wholly unacquainted, physically as well as mentally, with Newton's magnificent discovery of gravitation. Nothing stops them; they go wherever water is to be found; and though millions perish hopelessly in the attempt, millions more survive in the end to attain their goal in the upper reaches. They even seem to scent ponds or lakes mysteriously, at a distance, and will strike boldly straight across country, to sheets of water wholly cut off from communication with the river which forms their chief highway.|$|E

30|$|In Europe, {{member states}} have to measure {{chemicals}} in aquatic biota for compliance checking with EQSbiota [2, 3]. The guidance document for chemical monitoring of sediment and biota [37] gives recommendations for implementing this monitoring. The German Working Group on water {{issues of the}} Federal States and the Federal Government (LAWA) has further elaborated a concept for monitoring EQS according to directive 2008 / 105 /EG and gives recommendations, e.g. for selection of fish species and size of sampled fish [38]. In fish, contaminant concentrations are usually measured in muscle tissue and refer to the fresh weight of the sample. Since the <b>common</b> <b>eel</b> (Anguilla anguilla) accumulates high amounts of chemicals due to its food habits and its high lipid content, monitoring data are often presented separately for this species. In the Rhine River, for example, next to the <b>common</b> <b>eel,</b> the white fish species roach (Rutilus rutilus), common bream (Abramis brama) and chub (Squalius cephalus) are often monitored [39]. In fish, levels of mercury and mercury compounds usually exceed the European EQSbiota of 20  μg kg− 1 fresh weight whereby recent pollution is mainly ascribed to the diffuse atmospheric input [33, 40]. In Bavaria, for example, 98 % of the fish muscle samples exceeded the EQSbiota for mercury in 2007 to 2009 [41]. For trend monitoring, European member states further have to analyse 14 priority substances such as hydrophobic organic chemicals, metals and tributyltin in sediment, suspended particulate matter and/or biota that tend to accumulate in these matrices [2]. In this context, sampling the same species as well as comparable size and age of fish are particularly important since these parameters affect bioaccumulation and may confound or even superimpose temporal trends. For chemicals that show increased levels in liver compared with muscle tissue of fish, analysing liver tissue may be advantageous.|$|E
40|$|The first {{red water}} {{appeared}} in the south-western coast of Omura Bay from middle July to early August, and the second one spread all over {{the southern part of}} the Bay from latter August to middle September 1965. Both bloomings were due to Gymnodinium sp. This paper mainly deals with the second one. This blooming was accompanied by the phenomenon that dissolved oxygen in the bottom water-mass dwindled into zero, and also by the mass-mortality of fishes―goby, blenny, globefish, <b>common</b> <b>eel,</b> octopus, dragonet, anchovy, gray mullet, conger eel, etc. Nevertheless the distribution of blooming was limited to the southern part and the water-mass without dissolved oxygen and the mass-mortality extended all over the bay. What has caused this mass-mortality ? From the status of the red water, the dissolved oxygen content in the bottom water-mass and the progress of decomposition above the ark shell, it was assumed that the mass-mortality of fishes and invertebrates was not caused by the red water, but primarily by the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water-mass all over the Bay...|$|E

40|$|Six {{metabolites}} of polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) were identified and quantified from the bile of 31 common eels (Anguilla anguilla), 29 European flounders (Pleuronectes flesus), and 15 conger eels (Conger conger) collected from the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel during 1997. The bile metabolites were deconjugated by enzymatic hydrolysis and separated by reverse-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The major metabolite present in all fish was 1 -hydroxy pyrene (75 – 94 % of all metabolites detected) with lower proportions of 1 -hydroxy chrysene (2 – 15 %) and 1 -hydroxy phenanthrene (2 – 8 %), and small amounts of three benzo[a]pyrene derivatives (< 3 %). Metabolite concentrations (normalized to biliverdin content) were significantly higher in common eels than {{in the other two}} species and tended to be higher in all species {{at the beginning of the}} year than at the end. The data confirm the importance of 1 -hydroxy pyrene as the key PAH metabolite in fish bile and suggest that the <b>common</b> <b>eel</b> is an ideal species for monitoring PAHs in estuarine environments...|$|E
40|$|As it is {{desirable}} that a fresh catalogue should be prepared, embracing all the species known at the present time, I have much pleasure in submitting the following additional observations regarding our fishes and fishing industries, together {{with a list of}} the principal edible fishes, and a complete classified list of all the fishes known to me at the present time. The known sea and inland fishes of Tasmania, including the eight species of European fresh-water fishes successfully acclimatised, number 214 species. These are generally grouped by naturalists under 4 sub-classes, 65 families, and 146 genera.

Storage of cells at 4 °C in a glucose-containing medium for up to 72 h {{had no effect on}} 3 -OMG uptake, and there was no correlation between the sugar permeabilities of erythrocytes from different fish and intracellular ATP levels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline increased cytochalasin-B-sensitive 3 -OMG transport activity; half-maximal stimulation occurred at catecholamine concentrations in the region of 1 janol I" 1. This catecholamine-induced stimulation of sugar transport appeared to be independent of the basal cytochalasin-B-sensitive 3 -OMG permeability of the cells. Kinetically, catecholamines increased the Vm of transport without changing the apparent Km (approx. 1. 4 mmol I" 1). Saturable 3 -OMG influx was inhibited by phloretin, D-glucose, D-deoxyglucose and D-galactose, but not by D-fructose and L-glucose. Transporter stereoselectivity was confirmed by direct measurements of D- and L-glucose uptake. Erythrocytes from two other fish species, Monopterus albus Richardson (paddyfield eel) and Salmo gairdneri Richardson (rainbow trout), unlike those from the <b>common</b> <b>eel,</b> were uniformly deficient with respect to cytochalasin-B-sensitive 3 -OMG and D-glucose transport activity.

In {{the case of the}} two gobies and the eel, these three congeneric digenes sometimes coexist in the same infracommunity.

Implications arising from previous research concerning the demographic behaviour of these trematodes in their first intermediate host (mollusc compartment), were taken into account when interpreting structures observed in the definitive hosts. The problems of coexistence between these species, which are taxonomically very close in the same parasite community, and the under-lying speciation mechanisms are discussed in the light of population structuration...|$|E
