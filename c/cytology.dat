5|$|Turrill thus {{explicitly}} excludes from alpha taxonomy {{various areas}} of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, genetics, and <b>cytology.</b> He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy (pp. 365–366).|$|E
5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical <b>cytology</b> in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E
5|$|A common modern {{classification}} {{system has been}} that of Fernandes (1951, 1968, 1975) based on <b>cytology,</b> as modified by Blanchard (1990) and Mathew (2002), although in some countries such as Germany, the system of Meyer (1966) was preferred. Fernandes described two subgenera based on basal chromosome number, Hermione, n = 5 (11) and Narcissus, n = 7 (13). He further subdivided these into ten sections (Apodanthi, Aurelia, Bulbocodii, Ganymedes, Jonquillae, Narcissus, Pseudonarcissi, Serotini, Tapeinanthus, Tazettae), as did Blanchard later.|$|E
5|$|CT {{screening}} {{is associated}} with a high rate of falsely positive tests which may result in unneeded treatment. For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans. Other concerns include radiation exposure and the cost of testing along with follow up. Research has not found two other available tests—sputum <b>cytology</b> or chest radiograph (CXR) screening tests—to have any benefit.|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based <b>cytology.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical <b>cytology</b> tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and <b>cytology.</b> When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal {{whether a person}} has a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes <b>cytology,</b> in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|Columbia University's Jesup Lectures {{were the}} {{starting}} point for many of the most important works of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The presenters introduced the connection between two important discoveriesthe units of evolution (genes) with selection as the primary mechanism of evolution. In 1941, Edgar Anderson (whose work on hybridization in the genus Iris had interested Stebbins since they met in 1930) and Ernst Mayr co-presented the lecture series and Mayr later published his lectures as Systematics and the Origin of Species. In 1946, Stebbins was invited on Dobzhansky's recommendation to present the prestigious lectures. Stebbins' lectures drew together the otherwise disparate fields of genetics, ecology, systematics, <b>cytology,</b> and paleontology. In 1950, these lectures were published as Variation and Evolution in Plants, which proved {{to be one of the}} most important books in 20th-century botany. The book brought botanical science into the new synthesis of evolutionary theory, and became part of the canon of biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed the modern synthesis of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins started {{graduate}} studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering plant taxonomy and biogeography—particularly {{that of the}} flora of New England—with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He completed his MA in 1929 and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the <b>cytology</b> of plant reproductive processes in the genus Antennaria, with cytologist E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist Karl Sax. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent {{with the work of}} contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and <b>cytology</b> began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of <b>cytology,</b> armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
5|$|From 1870 to 1880 {{it became}} clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the {{substance}} of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century {{it was found that the}} number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles – what is now known as <b>cytology,</b> or cell theory became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Cryptothecia has been unclear, and historically, C.rubrocincta has been placed in several different genera. Like all lichens, C.rubrocincta is an association of a fungus (the mycobiont) with a photosynthetic organism (the photobiont), in this case, an algae. Initially, it was unknown whether the mycobiont component of C.rubrocincta was an ascomycete or a basidiomycete. Although {{the vast majority of}} lichen mycobionts are from the Ascomycota, in 1937 German lichenogist Friedrich Tobler believed the mycobiont to be a basidiomycete, because he interpreted some unusual microscopic structures to be clamp connections, structures associated only with the basidiomycete fungi. In another publication later that year, he specified the mycobiont to be a hymenomycete, and described the monotypic genus Herpothallion to supersede the old name Chiodecton sanguineum. Although Vernon Ahmadjian corroborated the presence of clamp connections in the species when he studied the species' <b>cytology</b> in 1967, other researchers did not find clamp connections in specimens collected from different countries. Further doubt was cast on the possibility of a basidiomycete mycobiont with the discovery of the depside confluentic acid in 1966, concentric bodies in 1975, and woronin bodies in 1983, as all of these characteristics are restricted to Ascomycetes.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cytology</b> is an {{important}} tool in identifying effusions due to malignancy. The most common causes for pleural fluid are lung cancer, metastasis from elsewhere and pleural mesothelioma.

25|$|A {{karyotype}} is {{the characteristic}} chromosome complement of a eukaryote species. The preparation and study of karyotypes {{is part of}} <b>cytology</b> and, more specifically, cytogenetics.|$|E
25|$|Anatomy is {{the study}} of the {{physical}} structure of organisms. In contrast to macroscopic or gross anatomy, <b>cytology</b> and histology are concerned with microscopic structures.|$|E
25|$|Liquid-based <b>cytology</b> {{is another}} {{potential}} screening method. Although {{it was probably}} intended to improve on {{the accuracy of the}} Pap test, its main advantage has been {{to reduce the number of}} inadequate smears from around 9% to around 1%. This reduces the need to recall women for a further smear. The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports screening every 5 years in those who are between 30 and 65 years when <b>cytology</b> is used in combination with HPV testing.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{replication}} and transcription of DNA {{is highly}} standardized in eukaryotes, the same cannot {{be said for}} their karyotypes, which are highly variable.

25|$|Liquid based cytology—The {{sample of}} (epithelial) cells {{is taken from}} the Transitional Zone; the squamo-columnar {{junction}} of the cervix, between the ecto and endocervix.

25|$|Many {{health care}} {{providers}} are under the false impression that only sterile water, or no lubricant at all, {{should be used to}} lubricate the speculum.

25|$|Polymorphism crosses several {{discipline}} boundaries, including {{ecology and}} genetics, evolution theory, taxonomy, <b>cytology,</b> and biochemistry. Different disciplines may {{give the same}} concept different names, and different concepts may be given the same name. For example, there are the terms established in ecological genetics by E.B. Ford (1975), and for classical genetics by John Maynard Smith (1998). The shorter term morphism may be more accurate than polymorphism, but is not often used. It was the preferred term of the evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley (1955).|$|E
25|$|Several tobacco {{plants have}} been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from N. tabacum {{cultivar}} 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant <b>cytology.</b> Tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural biotechnology. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. This research laid the groundwork for all genetically modified crops.|$|E
25|$|After a thyroid nodule {{is found}} during a {{physical}} examination, {{a referral to}} an endocrinologist or a thyroidologist may occur. Most commonly an ultrasound is performed to confirm {{the presence of a}} nodule and assess the status of the whole gland. Measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis present, a known cause of a benign nodular goiter. Measurement of calcitonin is necessary to exclude the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Finally, to achieve a definitive diagnosis before deciding on treatment, a fine needle aspiration <b>cytology</b> test is usually performed and reported according to the Bethesda system.|$|E
25|$|Reliable {{comprehensive}} incidence {{statistics for}} c-SCLC are unavailable. In the literature, {{the frequency with}} which the c-SCLC variant is diagnosed largely depends on the size of tumor samples, tending to be higher in series where large surgical resection specimens are examined, and lower when diagnoses are based on small <b>cytology</b> and/or biopsy samples. Tatematsu et al. reported 15 cases of c-SCLC (12%) in their series of 122 consecutive SCLC patients, but only 20 resection specimens were examined. In contrast, Nicholson et al. found 28 c-SCLC (28%) in a series of 100 consecutive resected SCLC cases. It appears likely, then, that the c-SCLC variant comprises 25% to 30% of all SCLC cases.|$|E
