5|$|A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the Varsity Match, talk in {{the press}} had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the second trial match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his form was lacking and he was outshone by Poulton. So for {{the third and final}} trial, England versus The Rest on 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> <b>before</b> they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
5|$|The period did {{lead to some}} {{reform of}} {{internal}} Society statutes, such as in 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along {{with a copy of}} the total income and expenditure of the Society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before.</b> As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates. The Society's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850, when a government grant-in-aid of £1,000 a year was accepted. This was increased to £4,000 in 1876, with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds, doling them out to individual scientists. This grant has now grown to over £47million, some £37million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.|$|E

50|$|Egypt's Kharijites proclaimed {{themselves}} for Ibn al-Zubayr when the latter proclaimed himself Caliph at Mecca, and Ibn al-Zubayr dispatched Abd al-Rahman ibn Utba al-Fihri {{to become the}} province's governor. Although the incumbent governor, Sa'id ibn Yazid, gave way, the resident Arab elites of the province barely tolerated his presence, and began contacts with the Umayyad caliph Marwan I in Damascus. These contacts encouraged Marwan to march against Egypt, where Abd al-Rahman vainly tried to muster a defence: although he fortified the capital, Fustat, an army he sent to stop the Umayyad advance at Ayla, it melted away, and his fleet was wrecked by storms. Marwan entered Egypt unopposed, and after a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> clashes <b>before</b> Fustat, the city's nobles surrendered it to him. Abd al-Rahman was allowed to leave Egypt with his possessions.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, the 138th TFS {{deployed}} to the Persian Gulf with 516 members {{in support of}} Operation Desert Storm. The 138th {{was one of only}} two Air National Guard units to fly combat missions during Operation Desert Storm. The Close Air Support project however proved to be a miserable failure. Precision aiming was impossible for several reasons: the pylon mount wasn't as steady as the A-10's rigid mounting; the F-16 flies much faster than an A-10, giving the pilots too little time approaching the target; firing the gun shook the aircraft harshly and made it impossible to control the targeting; the essential CCIP (constantly computed impact point) software was unavailable. The pilots ended up using the gun as an area effect weapon, spraying multiple targets with ammunition, producing an effect rather like a cluster bomb. It took only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> this <b>before</b> they gave up, unbolted the gun pods, and went back to dropping real cluster bombs - which did the job more effectively.|$|R

Furthermore, there had been a very strong wind blowing all week, which ended up splitting open the giant projection screen (which was made from several small canvas panels) and causing it to come crashing down.|$|E

50|$|They breed {{through the}} year and may have two broods, but mainly during the monsoons. The nest {{is made up of}} fine plant fibres, cobwebs and is studded on the {{exterior}} with lichens, bark pieces, flying seeds and other materials. The nest is constructed by the female alone although the male may fly alongside her. The nest is lined with soft fibres such as from the fuzz covering the seeds of Calotropis. The nest is placed on the end of branch and the entrance usually faces a bush. Nests may sometimes be built close to buildings or under open porches. The female stays in the nest at night a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> laying the eggs. The clutch consists of two eggs which are generally oval, pale greenish and white with spots and streaks, becoming more dense at the broad end. Sometimes, eggs may be plain grey without markings as well. When collecting cobwebs they are often seen at windows of homes, a time when they also sometimes end up tapping the window, possibly at their own reflection. The eggs are usually laid in the morning. The eggs are incubated by both the male and female. The incubation period varies from 14 to 16 days. The chicks fledge in about 17 days and continue to be fed by the male for a few days. Helpers, females or possibly juveniles from the previous brood may sometimes assist the parents in feeding the young. Old nests are sometimes reused. Cases of nests being parasitised by the grey-bellied cuckoo are known. In one case the cuckoo was fed by an adult sunbird as well as an adult common tailorbird.|$|R
50|$|A Chinese legend {{tells how}} {{liquorice}} root {{first came to}} be used in traditional Chinese medicine:A long time ago, there was an old doctor with excellent medicine skills. He opened his medical office in his home with a few students as assistants. One time, he had to leave home for a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> and <b>before</b> the old doctor left, he gave his students several drug packages {{in order for them to}} help out with the home patients. The old doctor did not return home on time, and the medicine he left for his students were running out, and there were still many patients to cure. In the backyard, however, there were some chopped and dried grasses used for boiling the water left, so the students administered them to the patients and told them that it was their teacher’s medicine. Magically, the patients who were suffering from spleen and stomach problems, coughing phlegm, or with sore throats and ulcers were cured from this medicine. These dried grasses were liquorice roots. Since then, liquorice roots have been widely used in Chinese medicine and healing.|$|R

The people made it worse for themselves by keeping up a desultory fire from windows and housetops when resistance had long ceased to be of any use; and, of course, seeing their comrades shot down in this way infuriated the troops still further.|$|R

25|$|With {{one point}} in hand, Lyon {{traveled}} to Munich to take on group leaders Bayern, who defeated Steaua București 1–0 on the opening matchday. With both teams coming off unimpressive matches a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> (Lyon an unspectacular 2–1 victory over Nancy and Bayern, a 0–1 loss away to Hannover 96), the match showed why with Lyon's only goal coming off the head of Bayern defender Martín Demichelis in the 25th minute from one of Juninho's spot-kicks. Bayern later equalised through Zé Roberto in the second half. Though Lyon had decent chances, including one where Karim Benzema {{had a chance to}} capitalize on a Bayern mistake late in the second half, the match remained 1–1 with Lyon leaving Munich with just two points through two matches.|$|E

25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds.

A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city.

50|$|After four tough {{games in}} four days in Comox, the team had only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> rest <b>before</b> flying to Winnipeg and {{boarding}} a team bus to St. Malo, Manitoba to represent British Columbia at the 2013 Keystone Cup - the Western Canadian Junior B Championships. Facing a daunting travel and game schedule that included six games {{in four days}}, the Sockeyes {{proved to be the}} class of the tournament. They went 5-0 in the round robin and outscored the provincial championship teams from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario by a total of 39-10. They faced the Saskatoon Royals for a second time in the final on Sunday, April 21. After a fast paced first period that ended 0-0, the Sockeyes depth and focused, persistent play once again led to some quick goals and a 3-0 lead after two. The big Saskatoon team battled hard in the final frame, but the Sockeyes held on for a 5-2 win and their second Keystone Cup championship in franchise history. The Sockeyes depth was again a big factor in their success in the grueling schedule as valuable contributions from Jordan Andrews, Derek Hughes, Bret Higham, William Latimer and affiliate player Austin Adamson proved crucial. The Red Line torched the tournament and MVP Rudi Thorsteinson scored an incredible 11 goals in 6 games (after scoring 7 in the regular season). Thorsteinson led the tournament in scoring with 16 points while he, Jake Roder and Jeremy Hamaguchi combined for an amazing 39 points. Super rookies Danton Heinen and Daniel Lange also notched five goals apiece while veteran Stephen Campbell scored four. Dean Allison, the team's regular season and playoff leading scorer and MVP, and team captain Sam Chichak played exemplary two-way hockey, typically shutting down the other teams top forwards. All of the teams at the Keystone Cup had some very talented players, but the Sockeyes two deadly powerplay units, stellar penalty killing and their ability to roll four lines and play both goaltenders separated them from the other provincial champions. In total, 19 different Sockeyes notched at least a point in the tournament, and every player contributed with key shot blocks, face-off wins and strong, team-first play.|$|R

Later in late August, just a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> {{the start of the}} World Championships in Daegu, Powell shocked the world by pulling out of the highly {{anticipated}} 100m as his groin strain aggravated and did not allow him to compete. Powell expressed great disappoinment but vowed to come back strong for the London Olympics in 2012, but still hoped to run the 4x100m relay in Daegu. However, he was unfit to run the relay and had to watch his compatriots win gold in a world record time of 37.04s. Powell competed in the 100m at the Diamond League Final in Zurich on 9 September. He looked very impressive in the first 60m, but faded to second place as newly crowned world champion, Yohan Blake, took victory in 9.82s. Powell registered a 9.95s run, which was impressive given the fact that his injury was still present. By completing the race, the sprinter took the Samsung Diamond Trophy with $40,000 in cash. Powell ended his season with another injury, almost a repeat of year 2010, where he showed excellent form {{in the first half of}} the year, but unfortunately suffered injuries.|$|E
25|$|The second {{pilot was}} penned by writers Don Nicholl, Michael Ross, and Bernie West, {{better known as}} NRW, who had gained fame in {{adapting}} another British series, Till Death Us Do Part, into All in the Family. The second pilot followed the British series even more closely, with the filmmaker character David Bell becoming cooking student Jack Tripp like his English counterpart, chef Robin Tripp, {{and one of the}} women being renamed Chrissy (a character name also featured in the British version; however, the US character bore more resemblance to the other British female character, Jo). Jack's female roommates were portrayed by Joyce DeWitt as florist Janet Wood, and Susan Lanier as secretary Chrissy Snow (actress Denise Galik had originally been given the role but was dismissed a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the pilot taped). The setting of the show was also moved from North Hollywood to the beachside in Santa Monica. NRW went on to conceive the show as an all out farce, building the show's plot line heavily on the many misunderstandings encountered by each of the characters. This pilot was actually a remake of the British series episode And Mother Makes Four which was the second episode of the show. The new concept was well liked, with the exception of Lanier's portrayal of Chrissy.|$|E

UNC would respond by outscoring Duke 30-22 over the next several minutes of the 1st half to cut Duke's lead down to 40-36 with around 4 minutes left in the 1st half. Duke then went on a 9-0 run over the next 2 minutes to get their largest lead of {{the game at}} 49-36 with 2 minutes left in the half. UNC would score the last 6 points of the half to cut Duke's lead down to 49-42 at halftime. In the 2nd half almost everything went UNC's way as UNC started dominating the post and eventually built their largest lead of the game 77-67 over Duke with 4 minutes left in regulation to complete a 41-18 run over Duke in an 18-minute span. With Duke still trailing UNC 79-72 with around 2 1/2 minutes left in regulation Duke's Tyus Jones would help Duke finish regulation on a 9-2 run over UNC to tie the game at 81 points apiece to send it to overtime.

Granderson hit a grand slam homer earlier in the game, and became the first player in MLB history to hit two grand slams in the same week for two different organizations. The following day, spot starter Brock Stewart struggled, allowing five runs in the third inning without recording an out but the Dodgers bullpen prevented more damage and the offense picked up the clack. Chris Taylor had three hits and three RBI as they came back to win 8–5. In the next game, Rich Hill took a perfect game into the ninth inning only to have it broken up by an error on Logan Forsythe. With the Dodgers offense unable to score, he remained in the game for the 10th and allowed his first hit, a leadoff homer by Josh Harrison to lose the game 1–0. Granderson hit his third homer of the week in the next game, and Yasmani Grandal and Adrian Gonzalez hit back-to-back homers in the eighth as they took the final game of the series, 5–2.

25|$|Meanwhile, having {{retreated to}} the island of Lobau after the battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{knew that he had}} failed in his attempt to cross the Danube and was so {{astonished}} by the severity of the setback that he remained in unaccustomed inaction for 36 hours. After recovering his usual drive, his immediate concern was to improve the dire situation of his army, which was in very bad shape and virtually trapped on Lobau island, after the Danube had swollen. With his usual tireless activity, he supervised the transformation of Lobau island into a huge army base. The French built temporary campaign hospitals for his 20,000 wounded, as well as warehouses and barracks, which sheltered a numerous permanent military garrison. As soon a secure bridge was built, the Emperor had the wounded and a part of the troops transferred to the mainland, but maintained IV Corps on the island. He did not intend to abandon this position, as he was planning {{to use it as a}} springboard for his upcoming crossing. His next task was to rebuild the army. Casualties had been roughly equal to those of the enemy, but, with fewer troops engaged, some of Napoleon's battalions needed rebuilding from scratch. Losses in officers in particular had been extremely high and proved difficult to replace. Maréchal Jean Lannes, one of Napoleon's ablest commanders and a personal friend, had been mortally wounded in action and died nine days after the battle. Another irreplaceable loss was Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire, who had been created a Marshal of the Empire just a month before, in recognition of his brilliant conduct during the earlier campaign, but received a mortal wound during the battle and died before the coveted baton could arrive from Paris. Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne, another famous general was killed in action at the head of his cuirassiers and the commander in chief of the artillery, Nicolas-Marie Songis des Courbons, became severely ill and had to leave his command a few weeks after the battle. Despite all these setbacks, the army and its officers retained total confidence in Napoleon's ability to lead them to victory and morale remained high. Evidence of this came a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the newly planned crossing of the Danube, when Napoleon's most senior Corps commander, Maréchal André Masséna fell from his horse and badly injured his foot, rendering him unable to ride for some time. In sheer contrast with Hiller's gesture, Masséna, although in significant pain, made arrangements to lead his men in battle from a phaeton and vowed to retain his command, much to the Emperor's relief.|$|E
