This research is inspired by theoretical work that suggests that gifts act as physical symbols of social relationships. The <b>Connectibles</b> system leverages gift-giving practices, presenting users with gift objects (“connectibles”) that they exchange with one another. These objects automatically form always-on communication channels between givers and receivers. As a user collects more and more of these objects, he or she begins to acquire a dynamic, physical representation of and interface to her social network. The community of users’ interactions implicitly represent the structure of the social network; these data can be accessed with a GUI application, allowing users to explore and interact with their social network. This system was implemented and subject to three user studies.

The weight of a suspended load and the load supporting structure on the load cell are applied on both chambers. A gauge reads the liquid pressure in the upper chamber and a valve unit <b>connectible</b> to a source of air under pressure is connected to the air chamber. The load cell is tared by initially adjusting the air pressure in the lower chamber to produce a zero reading on the gauge. When a load is applied on the device, the volume displacement of the air chamber is small relative to the volume displacement of the liquid in the upper chamber. The volume of the air chamber thus remains substantially constant so that the gauge indicates directly the net weight of the applied load...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Sampling-Based Motion Planning (SBMP) {{has been}} {{successful}} in planning the motion {{for a wide variety of}} robot types. An important primitive of these methods is selecting candidate neighbors and validating/invalidating the pathways between nodes of the map. These neighbors are commonly selected based on some distance metric (DM). An ideal distance metric for SBMP should identify configurations visible to each other, i. e., <b>connectible</b> by some local planner, such as straight-line interpolations. However, no perfect DM exists as different DMs capture different aspects of configurations. In this work, we introduce a Hierarchical Neighbor Finding Strategy that applies multiple DMs in series. There are two main benefits of this strategy. First, this strategy applies cheaper and less accurate DMs to be used; then in succession, more expensive and accurate DMs can be applied on iteratively reduced sets of configurations, yielding high quality neighbor selection with reduced computation time. Additionally, this strategy enables the ability to use complementary DMs that handle different aspects of the geometry at once, which we show through the combination of a Knot Theory distance and a Scaled Euclidean disctance for highly articulated linkages. Our results show that this Hierarchical Neighbor Finding Strategy provides improved performance in terms of connectivity and efficiency for Probabilistic Roadmap Methods for DOF up to 1024. We also demonstrate how our method can provide improvements for roadmap-based protein folding applications. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} a product and {{ultimately}} the associated company are largely dependent {{on the ability of}} the company to generate effective, high-quality and economical design solutions within shortened development times. To achieve increased quality and considerable time savings, standard components can be utilized. In order to establish a suitable solution the designer must evaluate various component types, sizes and combinations until the desired performance capabilities for the design are achieved. However, further improvements in economy and performance can be obtained by the effective utilization of various configurations of standard components. During this phase of evaluation, the designer must consider not only system performance but also component issues such as reliability, suppliers, cost, maintenance and internal practices. The pressure for reduced time to market does not leave room for time-consuming trial-and-error approaches. Today, experimentally validated computer modelling has become the preferred choice for rapidly carrying out the assessment of performance and the evaluation of design alternatives. In using such techniques the designer also demands the capability to assess whether the connected components are suitable both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative issues relate to whether the components are physically <b>connectible</b> and matched in terms of their performance capabilities, while the qualitative issues relate to the utilization of the component or a sequence of components. These may include preferences for suppliers, cost considerations, reliability issues, recommended component combinations and internal practices. These two aspects of the embodiment process are defined as compatibility analysis in this work. This paper outlines the process for the embodiment of mechanical systems with standard components and identifies the key aspects of compatibility analysis. Following this, the importance of and the requirements for compatibility analysis in modelling mechanical systems are discussed and a strategy to support compatibility analysis within a modelling environment is proposed. This strategy is implemented into an existing system modelling tool and an example study is included to illustrate the benefits to the designer...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Endothelial {{cell and}} {{capillaries}} are particularly sensitive to radiation. The importance of alterations in endothelial cell and capillaries caused by ionizing radiation has been evident {{since the first}} observations by researchers. Radiosensitivity of endothelial cell and biological markers of effects such as, particularly, premature cellular senescence assessed by b-galactosidase assay and the behaviour of the capillary loops in subjects radio-exposed recorded with “in vivo capillaroscopy” are the topic of this research. Over the last 20 {{years there has been}} a considerable development of the procedures involving risk of exposure to ionising radiation in departments undertaking interventions under radiological monitoring. Materials and Methods: The induction of SIPS (stress-induced premature senescence) and its relationship with telomere length, which drives physiological senescence, were investigated in vitro by exposing a model system (HUVEC or human vein endothelial cells) to the GSI carbon ion beam used for therapeutic purposes, at both the LET values incurred by normal (plateau region) and tumour (SOBP or Spread-Out Bragg Peak) cells. X-ray irradiation was used as reference. The examination in vivo of capillaries was carried out in 16 workers (radiologists and medical staff) aged between 42 and 67 years and length of service between 9 and 22 years exposed to radiation during the procedures of interventional radiology, using a ‘Videocap’ (DS-Medica, Milan) video-capillaroscope with optical probes of 200 x. The multiparametric capillaroscopic examination has been integrated with the classification of different profiles with reference to morphology and hemorheology. Results: As early as 2 weeks from irradiation, many more cells stain positive for b-galactosidase in the progeny of irradiated cells than in that from controls. At such early times, doses as low as 0. 1 - 0. 5 Gy from the plateau region of the Bragg curve were more effective than 2 Gy SOBP at inducing SIPS. In general, plateau-irradiated HUVECs showed more senescent cells than those from x ray irradiation. A part of senescing cells significantly higher than control was also observed following SOBP irradiation despite the incidence of lethal damage being associated with its higher LET. The protocol adopted in radio-exposed subjects during the procedures of interventional radiology, has shown an augmentation of abnormalities of the capillaroscopic examinations suggesting infraclinic effects of ionising radiation <b>connectible</b> with length of service. Conclusions: Ionising radiation efficiently cause SIPS in the HUVEC model system, exhibiting a dependence upon LET;The senescent phenotype occurs at early times post irradiation and is induced by doses as low as 0. 1 - 0. 5 Gy of 12 C ions from the plateau region of the Bragg curve;Telomere length attrition may be a driving molecular mechanism for SIPS after low LET-irradiation but is of no apparent relevance for 12 C ion-induced senescence. In the medical staff radioexposed, the use of in vivo capillaroscopy seems an effective way of controlling the effects of chronic professional radiation doses accumulated over many years of service and it seems of great interest as a biological indicator of effects for radiological prevention...|$|E
