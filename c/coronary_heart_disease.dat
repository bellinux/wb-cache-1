When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments.

5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts.

Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} the state-of-the-art of coronary stents and future expectations for these medical devices {{in the treatment}} of patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> The National Institute of Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands has carried out a literature study and additional interviews for the study as part of the Public Health Status and Forecast, 2002. The clinical introduction of coronary stents in the late eighties has significantly changed intervention cardiology, with stent technology continuously evolving over the past 10 to 15 years {{to meet the demands of}} clinical practice. The implantation of coronary stents in stenosed blood vessels is nowadays one of the most frequently performed medical interventions in cardiology. However, in-stent restenosis and thrombosis remain major complications of stent implantation. Adjunctive therapies and new stent designs have been developed to treat these serious problems. Extension of the positive results of drug eluting stents in clinical pilot studies to practice may mean a revolution in interventional cardiology, reducing the rate of in-stent restenosis. The number of people with <b>coronary</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> will increase from 168, 100 in 2000 up to about 239, 900 in 2020 in the Netherlands.
