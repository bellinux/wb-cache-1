40|$|In {{the series}} of soluble and {{film-forming}} aminocelluloses for application as enzyme-compatible support matrices, novel derivatives with xylylene diamine residues selectively at C 6 and solubilizing <b>carbanilate</b> groups were synthesized. Synthesis of these aminocelluloses was successful in three reaction steps starting from cellulose (Avicel PH 101) via tosylcellulose with degree of substitution of 0. 88 (preferably at C 6) and tosylcellulose <b>carbanilate.</b> Using a 10 -fold excess of xylylene diamine, only one amino group of the diamine reacts during the nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate groups. In the last step, {{the influence of the}} structure of the starting xylylene diamine isomers and of the reaction conditions on the degree of substitution of the tosylate, <b>carbanilate</b> and xylylene diamino groups in the final polymer, on the occurrence of side reactions and on the polymer solubility was studied. All xylylene diamino tosylcellulose carbanilates are soluble in DMA, DMSO and DMF in never dried state and form transparent films on glass surfaces. These films are promising support matrices for enzyme immobilization because of their characteristic topography, as is shown by atomic force microscopy examinations of the film surfaces...|$|E
40|$|A soluble cytokinin-binding protein from {{wheat germ}} {{that has a}} high {{affinity}} {{for a range of}} purine cytokinins also interacts with a variety of nonpurine compounds that can affect cytokinin-modified processes in animal or plant cells or which bind to proteins known to interact with certain cytokinins. A variety of structurally disparate compounds which inhibit chloroplast photosystem II activity (including phenylurea, <b>carbanilate,</b> and alkylamino- 2 -chloro-sym-triazine compounds) displace kinetin from the protein in an apparently competitive fashion. However, various energy transfer inhibitors (including organotin compounds and N,N′-dicy-clohexylcarbodiimide) also inhibit kinetin binding to the protein. N 6, 2 - 0 ′-Dibutyryl- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic AMP and 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutylxanthine (the effects of which on fibroblast morphology and motility can be mimicked by cytokinins) are inhibitors of kinetin binding to the protein. A variety of compounds that can have antimitotic effects (including 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutylxanthine and certain alkylated cyclic nucleotide, <b>carbanilate,</b> and tryptamine compounds) displace kinetin from the protein. However, a variety of indole derivatives also displace kinetin from the cytokinin-binding protein, which in a qualitative sense has a broad ligand specificity...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-one <b>carbanilate</b> {{derivatives}} were assayed {{for their}} capabilities to inhibit the ATPase activity of a plasma membrane fraction from Acer pseudoplatanus cells. At {{a concentration of}} 100 micromolar, nine compounds strongly inhibited the ATPase activity, with I 50 ranging from 14. 5 micromolar to 35 micromolar. These molecules were also inhibitory to plasma membrane ATPases of other origins: plant (maize shoot), yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and animal (dog kidney). The most efficient molecule appeared to be 2, 2, 2 -trichloroethyl 3, 4 -dichlorocarbanilate...|$|E
40|$|To {{adjust the}} {{properties}} of the macromolecular structure of cellulose, chemical modification can take place to find different applications. In the current study, cellulose was extracted from bagasse, where it was derivatized to carboxymethyl cellulose, and <b>carbanilated</b> cellulose. These two cellulose derivatives were further chemically modified in homogenous system by tosyl and trimethylsilylation to synthesize cellulose macromolecular derivatives, namely tosylcellulose derivatives and trimethylsilylcellulose derivatives. The compositional microstructure of the synthesized cellulose derivatives was investigated by 1 HNMR analysis, FT-IR and SEM. This study demonstrated that cellulose, cellulose derivatives and both tosyl and trimethylsilyl cellulose derivatives formed under homogeneous conditions can be evaluated as potential carriers for controlled release of anti-acid drugs. The release was investigated as a function of pH and time in various pH solutions, namely 2. 0, 3. 5 and 5. 0. The results indicated that the release is controlled by the type of the modified cellulose and thus it was concluded that modification is important for the use in slow drug release...|$|R
40|$|Homogenous {{acylation}} and carbanilation {{reactions of}} wood-based lignocellulosic materials {{have been investigated}} in ionic liquids. We have found that highly substituted lignocellulosic esters can be obtained under mild conditions (2 h, 70 °C) by reacting wood dissolved in ionic liquids with acetyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, and acetic anhydride {{in the presence of}} pyridine. In the absence of pyridine, extensive degradation of the wood components was found to occur. Highly substituted <b>carbanilated</b> lignocellulosic material was also obtained in the absence of base in ionic liquid. These chemical modifications were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, 1 H NMR, and quantitative 31 P NMR of the resulting derivatives. The latter technique permitted the degrees of substitution to be determined, which were found to vary between 81 % and 95 % for acetylation, benzoylation, and carbanilation, accompanied by similarly high gains in weight percent values. Thermogravimetric measurements showed that the resulting materials exhibit different thermal stabilities from those of the starting wood, while differential scanning calorimetry showed discrete new thermal transitions for these derivatives. Scanning electron microscopy showed the complete absence of fibrous characteristics for these derivatives, but instead, a homogeneous porous, powdery appearance was apparent. A number of our reactions were also carried out in completely recycled ionic liquids, verifying their utility for potential applications beyond the laboratory bench. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{solubility}} {{and film}} forming properties of newly developed cellulose derivatives with 1, 4 -phenylenediamine (PDA) substituents at position C 6 of the anhydroglucose unit (AGU) {{can be achieved}} by formation of acetate, benzoate, and <b>carbanilate</b> groups, respectively, preferably in position C 2 /C 3. All derivatives, if soluble in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), form transparent films from their solutions. The solubility of these PDA cellulose esters in DMSO or DMA, such as the aging, enzyme immobilization, and redox-chromogenic behaviors of the films, depending on the nature and the degree of substitution of the functional groups were investigated. Regarding the influence of the autoxidation by air-oxygen of the PDA groups on the storage stability, the longest stable derivatives were the PDA cellulose carbanilates. Onto PDA cellulose derivate films glucose oxidase was immobilized via diazo coupling, and by glutardialdehyde and ascorbic acid reactions with an obtained enzyme activity of 45 (diazo coupling, PDA cellulose acetate) to 145 mU/cm(2) (ascorbic acid, PDA cellulose <b>carbanilate).</b> The redox-chromogenic properties were demonstrated by oxidative coupling reaction of typical reagents like phenol and chinoline derivatives onto the PDA groups of the cellulose esters in presence of H 2 O 2 and peroxidase. The best coloring results were obtained by using PDA cellulose carbanilates und benzoates. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|E
40|$|The {{phototransformation}} of the herbicide Isopropyl <b>carbanilate</b> (IPC) {{has been}} investigated under UV light. Irradiation of the herbicide at room temperature in aqueous and organic solvents such as hexane and methanol afforded new photo-products formed {{as a consequence of}} various processes including photo-Fries rearrangement, ring solvolysis, hydrolysis of the amide/carbamoyl and ester bonds, ring coupling and polymerization. The percentage remaining of the herbicide as a function of time was followed periodically starting from zero time up to three hours. Analyses were performed by GC-FID equipped with a semipolar glass column operated at 170 ?C. The rate of photo disappearance of IPC under controlled lab condition followed 1 st order kinetics and found to be solvent dependent in the manner of non polar > polar solvents. The photo-products were successfully separated by GC and preparative TLC (Silica gel F- 254) and were identified using either GC-MS and/or MS. Identifications were assigned on the bases of molecular ions, mass fragmentation pattern and whenever possible by comparison with the mass spectra of literature analogues...|$|E
