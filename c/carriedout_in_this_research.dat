Islanding detection algorithms are deployedwithin the {{phasor measurement unit}} (PMU) using logic equations. Tripping decisions are based on local and wide-area synchrophasorsas computed by the PMU, and trips are generated usingIEC 61850 - 8 - 1 generic object-oriented substation event messages. The performance assessment compares these islanding detectionschemes for the nondetection zone and operation speed underdifferent operating conditions. The testbench that is demonstratedis useful for a myriad of applications where simulation exercises inpower system computer-aided design software provide no realisticinsight into the practical design and implementation challenges. Finally, different communication latencies introduced due tothe utilization of synchrophasors and IEC 61850 - 8 - 1 GOOSEmessages are determined. QC 20160602 </p...|$|R

Specifically, it focuses on the local government levelcomposed by the public entities that exert powers above the territorial limitsof a municipality (Gemeinde) and below those of a Federated State (Bundesland). The analysis of the constitutional and legal position, the administrativeorganization and the powers of each of those entities, which is <b>carriedout</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article, reveals a plural and heterogeneous system of local corporations,which can be best described as an asymmetrical multilevel system.

Notwithstanding the diversity of Länder’s legislations,it is possible to identify a double tendency. While the legal regulationof the entities acting in the level below the Kreis (Gesamtgemeinden) appears to be quite stable, those above the Kreis (höhere Kommunalverbände,Regionalplanungskörperschaften and Stadt-Umland-Verbände) undergo importantprocesses of reform. Inasmuch these reforms tend to build “regional”levels of local government, they challenge the territorial and functionalstatus of the Kreise themselves...|$|R
