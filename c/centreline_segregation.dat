40|$|<b>Centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> {{appears as}} a {{positive}} segregation of alloying elements like C, Mn and P in the mid thickness region of continuously cast slabs. It is an intrinsic phenomenon for the casting process and {{it is almost impossible}} to mitigate through post processing. <b>Centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> can be harmful to the weldability and integrity of any fabricated steel product, especially line pipe. At present, there is no international consensus on evaluation methods of <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation.</b> A repeatable and objective method for evaluation of <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> is highly desirable for both steelmaking process improvement and also for the prediction of final product performance. In the current work, a MATLAB program based on image analysis was developed to evaluate the images of <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> by automatic measurement of segregation features. The original grey scale images of the centre line segregation were reduced to black and white images for automatic measurement. The black features of the image, representing areas of element segregation, were identified according to predefined criteria. The degree of segregation was evaluated based on equations which were developed by considering different parameters of the segregation segments, and also was evaluated by rules gleaned from experienced steelmakers...|$|E
40|$|A {{common problem}} during {{production}} of steel by continuous casting is <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation.</b> <b>Centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> is {{an accumulation of}} unwanted substances in thecentre of the end product, called slabs. <b>Centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> occurs because different alloys have higher solubility with liquid steel than solid steel. The solidification of steel is done from the outside and in, which makes the alloys move towards the centre where they eventually stick. At SSAB’s production facility in Luleå the <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> is measured in a sampling process, where samples from the end product are cut out and etched in acid bath. After the acid bath the sample is scanned to specify the <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation.</b> Previous studies {{have concluded that the}} sampling process has high variance, which creates uncertainties for the specification of the <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation.</b> The scanner {{and other parts of the}} sampling process have been excluded during previous studies. The purpose of this project was to identify influencing factors for the acid, determine which of these factors are active for the variation and the settings of the factors to generate low variation. Since experiments and quantitative data collection were needed the method used by this thesis was Six Sigma by the DMAIC-method. A project team was appointed containing experts of both the process and the chemical properties of the acid. During discussions with the team three influencing factors where identified; purity of the acid, time and temperature. These factors where then examined by design of experiments (DoE). During the DoE each sample where etched two times at each setting and a difference between these two was calculated. The sample size was kept at seven. The average of the seven samples and the variance between these samples then became the response variablesfor the experiment. Two DoE were conducted where the purpose of the first was toeliminate the purity of the acid factor to save time. Since it could not be excluded the second experiment continued where the first ended. The purity of the acid and temperature was identified as active to the variance of the acidbath. These factors were then analysed to determine an optimal level to generate lowvariance. The recommendations of this project were to change acid after 60 samples and to improve the temperature equipment to keep the temperature at 55 oC. If the recommendation of this thesis is followed then the <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> will be measured more precisely and decrease rework.

40|$|Abstract. Twin roll casting (TRC) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be a process capable of producing Mg sheets at a significantly reduced cost. However, {{the quality of the}} Mg sheets produced by the TRC process is limited due to the formation of coarse columnar grains and severe <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation,</b> which reduces both the strength and ductility of Mg-alloys. In this paper, melt conditioned (MC) has been employed prior to twin roll casting (TRC) of AZ 31 alloy to understand its effect on the solidification mechanism. For comparison, AZ 31 alloy strips were also produced through conventional TRC process. The results showed that the solidification mechanism can be completely altered by introducing MC in TRC process...|$|E
40|$|A hyperthermal seedable {{supersonic}} beam, {{specifically designed}} for the deposition of thiophene based oligomers, is presented. The beam's properties are characterized by time-of-flight mass spectrometry and photoionization spectroscopy. Several quaterthiophene (T 4) films under different beam conditions have been prepared and characterized by optical absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. <b>Centreline</b> heavier species <b>segregation</b> in the beam is exploited to grow T 4 films efficiently from impurities present in raw terthiophene (T 3) powders. The morphology {{and structure of the}} films can be controlled by the beam's parameters that in turn allow variation in flux density, energy and orientation of molecules in the beam...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe flat ingots of 2524 alloy were {{prepared}} by direct chill (DC) casting process with {{the application of}} a low frequency electromagnetic field and the macrosegregation behaviour of this alloy was investigated. The experimental results showed that there are an obvious positive segregation near to the surface and a negative segregation in the centre area of the ingot. Cu shows the highest segregation tendency among the main elements of Cu, Mg and Mn. Ti shows a different segregation trend opposite to that of Cu. The application of electromagnetic field do not have significant effect on the segregation near to the ingot surface. However, with the application of electromagnetic field, the negative <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> in the centre area of the ingot was evidently reduced. This paper presents these results and corresponding discussions...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated {{low water}} {{corrosion}} of steel piling in sea water harbours in the UK, Europe and elsewhere {{has been shown}} recently {{to be the result}} primarily of water pollution. Elevated levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in sea and brackish waters are responsible for microbiologically influenced corrosion of steel piling below the low water tide level. This is demonstrated in field data from 13 Australian experimental sites, nine US naval sites and some severe sites in Australia, Norway, Japan and the UK. Localised perforation of sheet piling, often associated only with the webs of U and Z profile piles, is shown {{to be the result of}} <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation,</b> porosity and composition differences in steel profiles. These stem from the steelmaking process and are likely to be less severe for modern steels. The results explain most of the observations for actual steel piling in various harbours, both vertically and horizontally (i. e. for U and Z and other pile profile types) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{magnesium}} strips were produced by twin roll casting (TRC) and melt conditioned twin roll casting (MC-TRC) processes. Detailed optical microscopy studies {{were carried out}} on as-cast and homogenized TRC and MC-TRC strips. The results showed uniform, fine and equiaxed grain structure was observed for MC-TRC samples in as-cast condition. Whereas, coarse columnar grains with <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> were observed in the case of as-cast TRC samples. The solidi fication mechanisms for TRC and MC-TRC have been found completely divergent. The homogenized TRC and MC-TRC samples were subjected to tensile test at elevated temperature (250 – 4001 C). At 2501 C, MC-TRC sample showed significant improvement in strength and ductility. However, at higher temperatures the tensile properties were almost comparable, despite of TRC samples having larger grains compared to MC-TRC samples. The mechanism of deformation has been explained by detailed fractures surface and sub-surface analysis carried out by scanning electron and optical microscopy. Homogenized MC-TRC samples were formed (hot stamping) into engineering component without any trace of crack on its surface. Whereas, TRC samples cracked in several places during hot stamping proces...|$|E
40|$|The {{shrinkage}} during solidification {{of aluminium}} and iron based alloys {{has been studied}} experimentally and theoretically. The determined shrinkage behaviour {{has been used in}} theoretical evaluation of shrinkage related phenomena during solidification. Air gap formation was experimentally studied in cylindrical moulds. Aluminium based alloys were cast in a cast iron mould while iron based alloys were cast in a water-cooled copper mould. Displacements and temperatures were measured throughout the solidification process. The modelling work shows that the effect of vacancy incorporation during the solidification has {{to be taken into account}} in order to accurately describe the shrinkage. Crack formation was studied during continuous casting of steel. A model for prediction of crack locations has been developed and extended to consider non-equilibrium solidification. The model demonstrates that the shrinkage due to vacancy condensation is an important parameter to regard when predicting crack formation. The <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> was studied, where the contributions from thermal and solidification shrinkage were analysed theoretically and compared with experimental findings. In order to compare macrosegregation in continuous casting and ingot casting, ingots cast with the same steel grade was analysed. However, the macrosegregation due to A-segregation is driven by the density difference due to segregation. This is also analysed experimentally as well as theoretically...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of high strength line pipe steel {{have seen a}} decrease in carbon content from 0. 25 wt% to less than 0. 05 wt% and manganese to less than 1 wt% {{in an attempt to}} reduce <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation.</b> The sulphur content should be less than 0. 008 wt% as well. However, recent papers argued that low manganese levels in pipeline steels have the potential to improve weld line toughness and allow a higher tolerance for sulphur. Should this be true {{it would be possible to}} eliminate the usual desulphurising treatments thereby decreasing the production cost. The current study was designed to explore the effect of titanium on sulphide precipitation in steels with higher sulphur contents than currently used in the pipeline industry. The mechanical properties of steels are influenced by the type, shape and size of sulphide precipitates. Titanium additions to low carbon steel influence the precipitation behavior and composition of sulphide precipitates and could provide grain refinement, precipitation strengthening and sulphide shape control. In the present study, titanium was added to a low carbon, low manganese steel which contained approximately 0. 01 wt% sulphur in order to study the effect of titanium on sulphide formation in the absence of other alloying elements. Microscopic assessment of centreline sulphide precipitates revealed that irontitanium- sulphide co-exists with (Mn,Fe) S. An increase of the titanium content from 0. 008 wt% to 0. 024 wt%, results in an increase in the titanium content of irontitanium- sulphide phases and a decrease in the iron content of the (Mn,Fe) S phases. In contrast to reports in the literature where it has been suggested that titanium can dissolve in MnS and even that it is possible for TiS to replace MnS. This study has shown that Ti replaces iron in FeS but does not dissolve in manganese sulphides. The presence of FeTiS 2 (trigonal CdI 2 -type structure with a P 3 m 1 space group and lattice parameters of a = 0. 34 nm and c = 0. 57 nm) precipitates has been verified for the first time in steel. IV A concentric solidification technique in a laser-scanning confocal microscope was employed to observe in situ, solidification and the precipitation of sulphides following segregation of alloying elements into the remaining liquid. Microstructural development of low carbon steel upon solidification has been observed in situ, alloying element distributions were measured experimentally and sulphide precipitates have been compared to the precipitates at the centreline of continuously cast steel slabs. Microstructural development was similar in the two cases and some aspects of alloying element segregation upon solidification of a slab can be simulated experimentally by the use of the concentric solidification technique. There is a remarkable similarity between the sequence of events decreased in the in-situ observations and that occurring in industrially-cast slabs reported in the literature. Sulphide precipitates at the centreline of concentrically solidified specimens are similar in morphology and composition to precipitates in continuously cast steel slabs and TEM analysis confirmed that FeTiS 2 as well as MnS (containing iron) can form on prior austenite grain boundaries in both cases. The progression of the solid/liquid interface in plain Fe-C and Fe-Ni alloys was simulated by using Diffusion Controlled TRAnsformation (DICTRA) software which operates in conjunction with Thermo-Calc. Good correlation was found between experimental results and computations. Solute build up in the liquid at the solid/liquid interface was determined experimentally in Fe-Ni alloys and there was good agreement between the calculated concentration gradient of nickel and experimental measurements using an EPMA technique. Therefore, it is possible to determine comparatively the <b>centreline</b> <b>segregation</b> with fairly elementary experimental procedures and mathematical simulation at various steel compositions if DICTRA and Thermo-Calc are provided with sufficiently accurate thermodynamic information. Precipitates which formed in the solid state were assessed by carbon replication techniques, transmission electron microscope studies and atom probe tomography. Manganese and copper sulphides were the dominant sulphide precipitates. Copper sulphides nucleated on manganese sulphides and formed a shell around rod-like and V globular manganese sulphides. Iron did not dissolve in manganese sulphides and therefore the manganese sulphides which formed in solid state have higher melting points than sulphides formed on prior austenite grain boundaries at the centreline of slab. Titanium nitrides were observed in various sizes and distributions. TiN acts as nucleation sites for the precipitation of sulphides. An increase of the titanium content from 0. 008 wt% to 0. 024 wt%, results in precipitation of a few micrometer TiN and a decrease in the number of small cubic TiN precipitates. Small particles (~ 10 nm length and 3 nm thickness in size) that contain Ti, C, S and N have been identified for the first time by the use of three-dimensional atom probe tomograph...|$|E
