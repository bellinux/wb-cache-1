It and a DDP-24 were used by Max Mathews, {{considered by many to}} be the founding father of computer music, to develop his GROOVE music system, as related by Professor Barry Vercoe in a 1999 MIT Media Lab interview. When asked to describe the first MIT experimental music studio, Prof. Vercoe replied, [...] "We began that work when I first arrived in 1971. The first studio we had was in the basement of Building 26, where we had a computer given to MIT by Max Mathews-the Honeywell DDP-24. Max initially developed his GROOVE system on this machine and was kind enough to give it to MIT when I joined the faculty." [...] The 3C DDP-24 used modules or cards called S-Pac’s.

5000|$|The NORD-10 was {{equipped}} with a common bus system for all external devices. The bus system was divided into groups, {{and a great deal}} of effort had been made to ensure that no device would be able to jam the bus system in the case of malfunction. Each group had its own controller which in addition to functioning as an electronic switch for the bus system, could also change priority for the whole group. All interconnections between the cards were done with multilayer printed circuit backwiring boards, and all input/output interface had the same standard form. The system could therefore be extended or reconfigured by plugging in new or shifting around the existing interface cards. The position of the device interface in the <b>card</b> <b>rack</b> determined the interrupt priority of the device. In direct memory access transfers the device would send a [...] "request". The CPU would answer with a [...] "grant" [...] signal, which would be passed from device to device until it came to the device which initiated the [...] "request", and transfer to the memory could take place. When two or more devices request a DMA request simultaneously to the CPU had the highest priority. One memory cycle later the next DMA along the chain would be allowed to send data, and so on, until a higher priority device again sent a request. This meant that many DMA devices could use the same bus system at the full data transfer rate. It was not necessary to establish a [...] "master-slave" [...] connection. The transfer was one 16-bit word/850 nanoseconds, or 2.2MB/s.|$|E

Reducing congestion in our nation's urban areas has become a top priority of state departments of transportation nationwide. The development and construction of freeway management systems have recently begun to help reduce these problems. A major component of freeway management systems is the inductance loop detector. This research effort evaluated the use of inductance loop detectors in a freeway management situation to determine best wire type, shortest lag time condition, and most accurate speed detection scenario. Single stranded wire and multiconductor wire inductance loops were compared for accuracy of speed measurement. The multiconductor wire inductance loop speed trap measured a speed difference from the infrared light sensor speed trap of only 0. 139 mph (0. 224 km/h). On the other hand, the single stranded wire speed trap measured a speed difference of about 6 mph (10 km/h). Clearly, the best method for obtaining accurate speeds with inductance loops utilizes multiconductor cable loops. The lag time from the presence of a vehicle at an inductance loop to the actual detection of a vehicle varies. As the lag time varies so does the accuracy of speed measurement. Vehicle size, vehicle speed, detector type, detector sensitivity, and inductance loop wire type all affect the lag time. The shortest lag times were found to occur when using the Naztec <b>Card</b> <b>Rack</b> detector. The multiconductor cable loops also had shorter lag times than did the single stranded wire loops. Measuring accurate vehicle speeds with inductance loop detector speed traps is dependent upon the vehicle mix, vehicle speeds. detector type, and detector sensitivity settings. While using a 9 meter (30 foot) trap, the speed difference between an inductance loop speed trap and an infrared light sensor speed trap was found to be very small for most cases. As speeds increased, the speed difference also increased, Finally, the Naztec <b>Card</b> <b>Rack</b> detector was found to consistently measure the lowest speed differences for most conditions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction When {{properly}} maintained, cyclotrons often {{remain in}} operation for 20 years and more. However, {{as the years}} pass the control systems in particular become challenging to support. The I/O cards and other hardware eventually become obsolete, making spare parts difficult or even impossible to find. And the knowledge and ability to reload and configure the software also gets lost as operating systems and media storage technology change. This obsolescence {{is true of the}} Siemens RDS- 112 cyclotron, which is controlled using a 486 computer, connected to an external STD <b>card</b> <b>rack</b> containing up to 15 I/O cards. These I/O cards were last manufactured in the 1990 ’s, and the iRMX-based control programs malfunction on computers newer than a 486 processor. A control system upgrade for the RDS- 112 cyclotron has been developed by PET Technical Consulting Inc. This commercially available control system reduces operator training time, requires less maintenance, and supports new targets and custom product processes. Material and Methods The availability of high channel count I/O cards, and the decision not to support the old CPCU synthesis units, means the entire STD <b>card</b> <b>rack</b> can be replaced with 5 National Instruments (NI) I/O cards. The replacement computer is an industrial grade rack mounted PC with RAID 1 mirrored pair hard drives in front panel access quick swap bays. Two NI PCI- 6509 Digital I/O cards connect directly to the RDS electronics, channel assignments are mapped using software configuration. Three NI PCI- 6229 Multifunction I/O cards connect to the RDS electronics through a cable breakout interface plate, the terminal blocks are wired as needed to map the channels. The new control software was created using National Instruments LabVIEW. The new control sequences have a core based on the original RDS- 112 FORTRAN control programs. Then hundreds of improvements were made to simplify operation, increase flexibility, minimize user involvement and mistakes, and clearly display key parameters and fault conditions. System control has been combined into a comprehensive Graphical User Interface, with controls and indicators grouped together onto subsystem pages. Commands that once needed to be typed-in have been replaced with a clickable control for each function. Bar graphs display target and slit currents. Status is obvious with red faults against normally green indicators. Audio alarms cue the operator for process interaction, warn if target current or pressure drifts from setpoint, or if faults occur with power supplies, vacuum, or water cooling. Improvements in sequences and beam algorithms have reduced the time to achieve full beam on dual targets from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes. Results and Conclusion This new control system has been installed on (5) five RDS- 112 cyclotrons used for commercial isotope distribution. The total combined operation time of these systems after receiving the upgrade is now over 17 years, during this time the control system operation has been nearly problem free. UPDATE: The Siemens RDS- 111 cyclotron is controlled by a VME computer that is now end-of-life. The VM 30 and VM 42 CPU boards and many of the I/O modules are no longer manu-factured. PET Technical Consulting is developing a control system replacement for the RDS- 111 cyclotron with expected completion in 2014...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is the testing and evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} a variety of fire suppressants and fire-response techniques that will be used in the next generation of spacecraft (Crew Exploration Vehicle, CEV) and planetary habitats. From the many lessons learned in the last 40 years of space travel, there is common agreement in the spacecraft fire safety community that a new fire suppression system will be needed for the various types of fire threats anticipated in new space vehicles and habitats. To date, there is no single fire extinguishing system that can address all possible fire situations in a spacecraft in an effective, reliable, clean, and safe way. The testing conducted under this investigation will not only validate the various numerical models that are currently being developed, but it will provide new design standards on fire suppression that can then be applied to the next generation of spacecraft extinguishment systems. The test program will provide validation of scaling methods by conducting small, medium, and large scale fires. A variety of suppression methods will be tested, such as water mist, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen with single and multiple injection points and direct or distributed agent deployment. These injection methods cover the current ISS fire suppression method of a portable hand-held fire extinguisher spraying through a port in a rack and also next generation spacecraft units that may have a multi-point suppression delivery system built into the design. Consideration will be given to the need of a crew to clean-up the agent and recharge the extinguishers in flight in a long-duration mission. The fire suppression methods mentioned above will be used to extinguish several fire scenarios that have been identified as the most relevant to spaceflight, such as overheated wires, cable bundles, and circuit boards, as well as burning cloth and paper. Further testing will be conducted in which obstructions and ventilation will be added to represent actual spacecraft conditions (e. g., a series of cards in a <b>card</b> <b>rack)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The ‘rewards’ {{offered by}} banks and shops are a {{dangerous}} illusion, says Richard Denniss WHEN Kim, of Kath and Kim fame, {{wanted to give}} her mum an overseas holiday she headed straight for the shops. How better to save up for an overseas holiday than to spend a fortune on your credit <b>card</b> and <b>rack</b> up some ‘Fly Buys’ while you are at it. But what began as satire has now become the central theme of a new advertising campaign by American Express. It’s not a credit card, it’s a trip to New York, proclaim the billboards. That’s not a pair of shoes, it’s a step closer to Paris, the full page advertisements inform us. The exact opposite is, of course, the case. In the real world, the more you spend on one thing, the less you can spend on others. But in the consumer debt based economy of contemporary Australia, such a view is decidedly ‘old school’. It seems that many Australians feel so unrecognised in their daily pursuits that they insist on being ‘rewarded’ for tasks as banal as buying toilet paper or booking an airline flight. Why would anyone shop around for cheap groceries when they can get a ‘reward’ for heading straight to the same shop every week? Or why would people plan their expenditures to meet their incomes and pay cash for their purchases when they can have anything they want right now and be ‘rewarded’ for it at the same time. Apart from providing us with rewards and recognising our loyalty, credit cards also help us to plan our finances. We can all take advantage of those wonderful interest-free periods and finally get our own back on the banks. Except of course we can’t. Despite widespread condemnation of the ‘greedy banks’, greedy people chasing reward points and interest free periods give the banks {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} per year in interest on their ‘interest free’ credit cards. What the banks are banking on is that our eyes will be bigger than our pay cheques, and on the whole they are right. Consumer debt is at an all-time high in Australia. Easy credit has seen consumer debt balloon with the average credit card debt growing by 10 per cent in the last 12 months. This trend is unlikely to abate with mobile phones teaching children from an early age to call now and worry later. But it is not just consumer greed that stops consumers from ever besting the banks in the ‘reward’ stakes. If the banks start to lose they can, as they have shown recently, always change the rules. A hundred thousand frequent flyer points might sound like a lot, but it is up to the airlines to decide how many you need to get from Sydney to Melbourne. Replacing the weekly pay packet with electronic funds transfer has changed fundamentally the way we think of money. Cash is no longer a scarce commodity that must be carefully rationed until the next pay day; it has simply become something that we pick up on the way home along with the milk and the bread. Of course our spending is ultimately constrained by our income in the long run, but as a famous economist once said, ‘in the long run we are all dead’. We know that we must spend less if we want to save more, but it can be so easy to save by simply buying more things when they are on sale, especially when there is nothing to pay until 2005. Our reliance on electronic pay packets, and the simultaneous roll out of credit cards, has resulted in a radical change in societal norms concerning responsible behaviour. Careful budgeting and the putting away of some contingency money for a ‘rainy day’ has been transformed from common sense to quaintly nostalgic in a bit over a decade. Gone are the days when children would be given their own bank account in primary school and encouraged to make a deposit, no matter how small, each week. These days the take out message for kids is that since the bank fees are greater than your pocket money you are better off just spending it. And it’s an important lesson. One of the main reasons that credit cards became so popular compared to debit cards was that the fees for using the banks’ money were deliberately set lower than the fees for using your own money. Going without new shoes and sunglasses might seem like a boring way to save up for an overseas holiday, but it is far more effective than waiting for the credit card company to ‘reward’ you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using a credit card to smooth out the bumps in your personal finances, but there is something dangerously wrong with the logic that only by spending more can people afford that overseas holiday they want. As people work longer and longer hours in increasingly stressful work conditions perhaps it is understandable that they seek recognition and reward for their efforts, but the rewards offered by banks and shops are illusory. Mark Latham has recently tried to get the important issue of individual and national saving back on the political agenda. Maybe he needs to implement a frequent savers loyalty program. Such a plan might sound satirical, but Kath and Kim used to sound satirical as well. Richard Denniss is Senior research fellow at The Australia Institute, a Canberra based public interest think tank.
