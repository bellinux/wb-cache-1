40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{real-time}} vision system for position determination and vision guidance to navigate an autonomous mobile robot in a known environment. We use a digital camera, which provide ten times the video <b>capture</b> <b>bandwidth</b> then a USB, using FireWire interface. In order to achieve real-time image processing we use MMX technology to accelerate vision tasks. Camera calibration is a necessary step in 3 D computer vision in order to extract metric information from 2 D images. Calibration is used to determine the camera parameters by minimizing the mean square error between model and calibration points. The camera calibration we use here is based on several views of a planar calibration pattern, which is an easy to use and accurate algorithm. For position pose of the robot we use the corner points and lines, features extracted from the image, and matched with the model of the environment. The algorithm is as follows: first we compute an initial pose using the Ganatipathy's four point algorithm and we use this initial estimation as the starting point for the iterative algorithm proposed by Arajo in order to refine our pose...|$|E
40|$|We {{look at the}} {{variability}} of the power produced by the three-float M 4 wave energy converter for locations in the North-East Atlantic and North Sea using the NORA 10 hindcast data from 1958 - 2011. The aim is to investigate whether the produced power is also strongly affected by the climate variability (such as the North Atlantic Oscillations) in the winter, just as the ocean wave power resource as observed in previous studies. In this study, we demonstrate the use of proxy indices {{in combination with the}} climate indices to reconstruct a historic practical wave power climate from 1665 - 2005. We also conduct sensitivity studies to assess the changes in the practical wave power variability in response to perturbing the machine size, the power take-off coefficient, the response bandwidth and the power limit of the power take off. We find that the resultant temporal variation is still dominated by the climate variability. However, the overall variability important for power availability and energy supply economics is smaller than that of the ocean wave power resource because of the finite <b>capture</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of the M 4 machine. The statistical methodology presented here is also potentially relevant to other wave energy converters in similar locations...|$|E
40|$|Commercialization of {{spectral}} imaging {{for color}} reproduction {{will require the}} identification and traversal of roadblocks to its success. Among the drawbacks associated with spectral reproduction is a tremendous increase in data <b>capture</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and processing throughput. Methods are proposed for attenuating these increases with data-efficient methods based on adaptive multi-channel visible-spectrum capture and with low-dimensional approaches to spectral color management. First, concepts of adaptive spectral capture are explored. Current spectral imaging approaches require tens of camera channels although previous {{research has shown that}} five to nine channels can be sufficient for scenes limited to pre-characterized spectra. New camera systems are proposed and evaluated that incorporate adaptive features reducing capture demands to a similar few channels with the advantage that a priori information about expected scenes is not needed at the time of system design. Second, proposals are made to address problems arising from the significant increase in dimensionality within the image processing stage of a spectral image workflow. An Interim Connection Space (ICS) is proposed as a reduced dimensionality bottleneck in the processing workflow allowing support of spectral color management. In combination these investigations into data-efficient approaches improve two critical points in the spectral reproduction workflow: capture and processing. The progress reported here should help the color reproduction community appreciate that the route to data-efficient multi-channel visible spectrum imaging is passable and can be considered for many imaging modalities...|$|E

Application requirements are represented in terms of the average throughput, latency and maximum burst size.

In this framework, the hit ratio is the key performance indicator which <b>captures</b> the <b>bandwidth</b> / memory tradeoff for a given global performance. This paper focuses on the estimation of the hit ratio in a network of caches that employ the Random replacement policy. Assuming that requests are independent and identically distributed, general expressions of miss probabilities for a single Random cache are provided as well as exact results for specific popularity distributions. Moreover, for any Zipf popularity distribution with exponent α > 1, we obtain asymptotic equivalents for the miss probability {{in the case of}} large cache size. We extend the analysis to networks of Random caches, when the topology is either a line or a homogeneous tree. In that case, approximations for miss probabilities across the network are derived by assuming that miss events at any node occur independently in time; the obtained results are compared to the same network using the Least-Recently-Used discipline, already addressed in the literature. We further analyze the case of a mixed tandem cache network where the two nodes employ either Random or Least-Recently-Used policies. In all scenarios, asymptotic formulas and approximations are extensively compared to simulations and shown to perform very well. Finally, our results enable us to propose recommendations for cache replacement disciplines in a network dedicated to content distribution.

To <b>capture</b> the available <b>bandwidth</b> of the wireless network accurately [12], we need to consider two types of bandwidth: local available bandwidth and neighbor available bandwidth. Local available bandwidth is the amount of spare bandwidth observed by the given node whereas neighbor available bandwidth is the amount of spare bandwidth that a given node can consume without affecting the quality of the existing flows in its transmission and carrier sensing range. Therefore, the amount of bandwidth available for a given node is the minimum of the local available bandwidth and neighbor available bandwidth. To further illustrate the importance of the local and neighbor available bandwidth in wireless networks, we show a simple simulation using Ns 2 (v 2.29) [16] as follows.|$|R

In this paper we investigate one aspect of fault recovery in this context, the rerouting of guaranteed performance connections affected by link faults in the network. Recovery is achieved by rerouting the affected connection so as to avoid the failed link while ensuring that the traffic and performance guarantees made along the previous route are satisfied along the new route. The goal of the rerouting schemes is to reroute as much of the affected traffic as quickly and efficiently as possible. We investigate rerouting along the lines of two orthogonal components: the locus of reroute, which determines the node that does route selection and the new route selected; and the timing component, which determines when the individual reroute attempts are initiated. Within each of these two components we examine approaches that span the spectrum of that component.

Attacker nodes alter the IEEE 802. 11 DCF firmware to illicitly capture the channel via elevating the probability of the average number of packets transmitted successfully using up the bandwidth share of the innocent nodes that follow the protocol standards.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{ubiquitous}} wireless services has prompted {{the exploration of}} using increasingly larger transmission bandwidths often in environments with harsh propagation conditions. However, present analyses do not capture the behavior of systems in these channels as the bandwidth changes. This thesis: describes {{the development of an}} automated measurement apparatus capable of characterizing wideband channels up to 16 GHz; formulates a framework for evaluating the performance of wireless systems in realistic propagation environments; and applies this framework to sets of channel realizations collected during a comprehensive measurement campaign. In particular, the symbol error probability of realistic wideband subset diversity (SSD) systems, as well as improved lower bounds on time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation are derived and evaluated using experimental data at a variety of bandwidths. These results provide insights into how the performance of wireless systems scales as a function of bandwidth. Experimental data is used to quantify the behavior of channel resolvability as a function of bandwidth. The results show that there are significant differences in the amount of energy captured by a wideband SSD combiner under different propagation conditions. In particular, changes in the number of combined paths affect system performance more significantly in non-line-of-sight conditions than in line-of-sight conditions. Results also indicate that, for a fixed number of combined paths, lower bandwidths may provide better performance because a larger portion of the available energy is <b>captured</b> at those <b>bandwidths.</b> The expressions for lower bounds on TOA estimation, developed based on the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB), are able to account for the a priori information about the TOA as well as statistical information regarding the multipath phenomena. The ZZB, evaluated using measured channel realizations, shows the presence of an ambiguity region for moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). It is shown that in a variety of propagation conditions, this ambiguity region diminishes as bandwidth increases. Results indicate that decreases in the root mean square error for TOA estimation were significant for bandwidths up to approximately 8 GHz for SNRs in this region. by Wesley M. Gifford. Thesis (Ph.
