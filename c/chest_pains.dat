40|$|Background: Non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> is an {{important}} disorder in Asia. The practice and views of gastroenterologists on non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> in this region are not known. Aims: To determine the current understanding, diagnostic practice and treatment strategies among gastroenterologists on the management of non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> in Asia. Methods: A 24 -item questionnaire was sent to gastroenterologists in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Results: 186 gastroenterologists participated with {{a response rate of}} 74 %. 98 % of gastroenterologists managed patients with non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> over the last 6 months. 64 % felt that the number of non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> patients was increasing and 85 % believed that {{the most common cause of}} non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> was GERD. 94 % of the gastroenterologists believed that they should manage non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> patients, but only 41 % were comfortable in diagnosing non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> The average number of investigations performed was four in non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> patients, and oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy was the most commonly used initial test. A proton pump inhibitor was considered the first-line treatment in non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> and was reported as the most effective treatment by the gastroenterologists. Conclusion: Most gastroenterologists were practicing evidence-based medicine, but frequent use of investigations and a lack of awareness of the role of visceral hypersensitivity in non-cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> patients were noted. © 2007 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background Whether {{the higher}} {{coronary}} mortality in South Asians compared with White populations {{is due to}} a higher incidence of disease is not known. This study assessed cumulative incidence of <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> in South Asians and Whites, and prognosis of <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> Methods Over seven phases of 18 -year follow-up of the Whitehall-II study (9775 civil servants: 9195 White, 580 South Asian), <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> was assessed using the Rose questionnaire. Coronary death/non-fatal myocardial infarction was examined comparing those with <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> to those with no <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> at baseline. Results South Asians had higher cumulative frequencies of typical angina by Phase 7 (17. 0 versus 11. 3 %, P, 0. 001) and exertional <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> (15. 4 versus 8. 5 %, P, 0. 001) compared with Whites. Typical angina and exertional <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> at baseline were associated with a worse prognosis compared with those with no <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> in both groups (typical angina, South Asians: HR, 4. 67 and 95 % CI, 2. 12 – 0. 30; Whites: HR, 3. 56 95 % CI, 2. 59 – 4. 88). Baseline non-exertional <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> did not confer a worse prognosis. Across all types of pain, prognosis was worse in South Asians.

40|$|Background: Although many {{patients}} who experience <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> or pressure consult their physicians, unfortunately {{a large number}} of them do not, and consequently they remain undiagnosed and untreated. Chest pain, in a subset of these patients, may be relieved with a bronchodilator or other asthma drugs. Methods: This retrospective study included twenty cases of <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> that were relieved with asthma drugs. Chest pain was categorized into three types: <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> variant asthma, bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> <b>pain,</b> and non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> Chest pain variant asthma was defined as chest pressure that improved in response to a bronchodilator, without the characteristic attacks of bronchial asthma. Bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> was defined as chest pressure, with the characteristic attacks of bronchial asthma that improved following the administration of a leukotriene receptor antagonist, systemic corticosteroid, or bronchodilator. Non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> was defined as chest pressure without the typical asthma attack, but with chest pressure that improved in response to a leukotriene receptor antagonist or systemic corticosteroid, but not a bronchodilator. Results: Fourteen cases of <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> were diagnosed as variant asthma, three cases were diagnosed as bronchial asthma with <b>chest</b> <b>pain,</b> and three cases were diagnosed as non-asthmatic allergic <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> Conclusions: The results suggest that the mechanism underlying <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> that is relieved with asthma drugs can involve either an airway constriction pathway or a non-constrictive pathway presumably airway inflammation. Analysis of the patient's response to treatment with asthma medication is useful for the correct diagnosis of the source of <b>chest</b> <b>pain...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background The {{development}} and course of noncardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> {{are assumed to}} be influenced by interoceptive processes. Purpose It was investigated whether heartbeat perception was enhanced in patients suffering from noncardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> and to what degree it was associated with self-reported cognitive–perceptual features and <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> characteristics. Methods A total of 42 patients with noncardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> (NCCP), 35 patients with cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain,</b> and 52 healthy controls were recruited. Heartbeat perception was assessed using the Schandry task and a modified Brener–Kluvitse task. Self-report measures assessed anxiety sensitivity, somatosensory amplification, heart-focused anxiety, and <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> characteristics. Results Heartbeat perception was not more accurate in patients with NCCP, compared to patients with cardiac <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> and healthy controls. However, in patients with NCCP, the error score (Schandry task) was significantly associated with stronger <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> impairment, and the response bias (Brener–Kluvitse task) was associated with lower <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> intensity. Conclusion Against assumptions of current etiological models, heartbeat perception was not enhanced in patients with NCCP. Chest pain characteristics and particularly their appraisal as threatening might be more relevant to NCCP than the perceptional accuracy of cardiac sensations and should be focused in psychological interventions. However, associations with <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> impairment suggest cardiac interoception to influence the course of NCCP. ...|$|R

The objective {{of the study was to}} estimate duration from chronic <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> to CAD and to assess impact of risk factors on same duration. Methods: Data were obtained from community based study on 17, 232 Saudi adults. History of patients about onset of <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> and other risk factors were inquired.

To understand more about the mechanisms by which reflux elicits <b>chest</b> <b>pain,</b> we aimed to identify factors which are important in triggering <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> In this multicenter study, 120 patients with NCCP were analyzed using 24 -h pH-impedance monitoring. In the patients with a positive association between reflux and <b>chest</b> <b>pain,</b> the characteristics of the reflux episodes which were followed by a <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> episode were compared with chest pain-free reflux episodes. Using 24 -h pH-impedance monitoring, 40 % of the NCCP patients were identified as having reflux as a possible cause of their <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> Reflux episodes that were associated with <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> had a higher proximal extent (P= 0. 007), a higher volume clearance time (P= 0. 030), a higher 15 -minute acid burden (P= 0. 041), were more often acidic (P= 0. 011), had a lower nadir pH (P= 0. 044), and had a longer acid duration time (P= 0. 027) than reflux episodes which were not followed by <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> Patients who experienced typical reflux symptoms {{were more likely to have}} reflux as the cause of their <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> (52 vs. 31. 4 %, P= 0. 023).

40|$|Objectives: The {{relation}} between <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> and coronary atherosclerosis (CA) {{in patients with}} inflammatory joint diseases (IJD) has not been explored previously. Our aim was to evaluate the associations {{of the presence of}} <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> and the predicted 10 -year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by use of several CVD risk algorithms, with multi-detector computer tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography verified CA. Methods: Detailed information concerning <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> and CVD risk factors was obtained in 335 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). In addition, 119 of these patients underwent MDCT coronary angiography. Results: Thirty-one percent of the patients (104 / 335) reported <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> Only 6 patients (1. 8 %) had atypical angina pectoris (pricking pain at rest). In 69 patients without <b>chest</b> <b>pain,</b> two thirds had CA, while in those who reported <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> (n= 50), CA was present in 48. 0 %. In a logistic regression analysis, <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> was not associated with CA (dependent variable) (p= 0. 43).

Main outcome measures Proportion of <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> attendances resulting in admission; reattendances and admissions over the next 30 days; daily emergency medical admissions (all causes); and proportion of emergency department attendances with <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> Results The introduction of <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> unit care was associated with weak evidence of an increase in emergency department attendances with <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> (16 % v 3. 5 %; P= 0. 08); no change in the proportion of <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> attendances resulting in admission (odds ratio 0. 998, 95 % confidence interval 0. 940 to 1. 059; P= 0. 945); small increases in the proportion reattending (odds ratio 1. 10, 1. 00 to 1. 21; P= 0. 036) or being admitted (1. 30, 0. 97 to 1. 74; P= 0. 083) over the next 30 days; and evidence of increased daily medical admissions (1. 7 per day, 95 % confidence interval 0. 8 to 2. 5; P< 0. 001). However, this last finding was highly sensitive to changes in the method used to handle missing data. Conclusion The introduction of <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> unit care did not reduce the proportion of patients with <b>chest</b> <b>pain</b> admitted and may have been associated with increased emergency department attendances with <b>chest</b> <b>pain.</b> Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 5531841...|$|R
