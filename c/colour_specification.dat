Informal manual techniques for generating harmonious sets of colours have been known and used for at least a century. Although superficially simple, they have not been precise techniques, as pigment-based and dye-based colouring techniques are not susceptible to accurate measurement, in terms of area of colour used or mathematical relationships between colours, and mathematical analysis does not appeal strongly to the design community. Now the historical separation between engineering and design has narrowed. First, the development of colour television brought numerical precision into <b>colour</b> <b>specification.</b> Secondly, in computers, the medium for colour representation and the tool for calculating colour parameters have been integrated. Consequently, it has also become feasible to derive sets of harmonious colours automatically. ...|$|E

In this fast moving technological environment, with increasing specialisation in those fields of practice engaged with colour, how do different disciplines in art, design and the sciences communicate theories and practice across their boundaries? We propose colour as a meta-discipline, sitting above all and across many subjects, and by this definition as multi-disciplinary. Colour measurement, specification and replication bring challenges, but communication across colour fields also has conceptual barriers. This challenge of communicating different concepts, viewpoints, tools and methods, languages, teminology and cultures cannot be avoided.

Roundels used on aircraft painted in NIVO were duller than the normal colours. The size of the roundel was generally determined by the space available at the specified location, with a space of several inches around the edges.

40|$|Public roads without road markings, {{especially}} roads carrying {{high traffic}} volumes, {{would lead to}} chaos and accidents resulting in injuries and loss of life. The road authorities need {{to ensure that all}} signage is well maintained and conforms to the Southern African Development Community Road Traffic Signs Manuals (SADC RTSM) (1999) and the South African Road Traffic Signs Manuals (SARTSM) (1999). The most important aspect of road markings is that they must be retroreflective. The minimum RL for white and yellow road markings is 100 mcd/m 2 /lx and 70 mcd/m 2 /lx respectively (SADC RTSM, 1999). There are other important parameters to which road markings should conform, such as the Qd, colour and skid resistance. There are various types of road marking paints and road marking materials, namely solvent-borne, water-borne, cold plastic, thermoplastic and preformed tape applied universally. In SA, solvent-borne paints, water-borne paints and thermoplastic materials are widely used, with cold plastic materials being increasingly used of late. There are SABS standards on solvent-borne and water-borne road marking paints covering a wide range of aspects. However, there are insufficient standards on plastic road marking materials and therefore some road marking applicators could be applying inferior quality plastic road marking materials. The only specification related to thermoplastic road marking materials published by the SABS is the SABS EN 1424 : 1997 (1997) (Road marking materials - premix glass beads). This specification was adopted by the SABS exactly as per the European Standard EN 1424 : 1997 (1997) and it specifies the requirements for laboratory tests on aspects of premix glass beads such as the granulometry, refractive index, chemical resistance, quality and surface treatment. Since the European specifications are widely adopted by many countries, the BS EN 1436 : 2007 (2007) specification was used in conjunction with the available SA standards in this study to develop the thermoplastic road marking standard. It is more advantageous for the road authority to stipulate the specifications with which road marking products must comply than to give the detailed specification of each constituent. It would be time consuming and costly to test each constituent, besides which the equipment to test the constituents is not readily available in SA. The onus should be on the manufacturer to ensure that the formulation of the road marking material is such that the product meets the required specifications. The service life of road markings is affected by volume and type of vehicles passing over them, the type of road surface, sand and dirt, climatic conditions and application of the road markings. On clean roads, both asphalt and chip seal surfaces, thermoplastic road marking materials have longer RL and Qd service lives than water-borne road marking paints. The white road marking paints and materials generally complied with the <b>colour</b> <b>specification.</b> However, the yellow road markings complied minimally with the <b>colour</b> <b>specification</b> on both clean and dirty roads. Although thermoplastic road marking materials have a longer RL service life on clean roads, it might not be economical to use them on dirty roads since the RL service life was similar for water-borne road marking paints and cold plastic road marking materials. The initial skid resistance of white and yellow 1. 2 mm thermoplastic complied with the specification. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Civil EngineeringMScUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|In recent times, the {{transportation}} industry has generated {{a number of}} developments involving new technology in signaling. Important developments have involved the production of light by means of light-emitting diode (LED). Unfortunately, the maximum light output, dominant wavelength, reliability and the lifetime of LEDs are all {{closely related to the}} junction temperature. Accordingly, LED performance largely depends on the ambient temperature of its operating environment. Consequently, adequate heat-sinking is required to maintain a long lifetime and compliance. Today again, designing an LED railway signal that is able to meet compliance over wide range of temperatures is problematic. In particular, for yellow aspects compliance is difficult to achieve at extreme ambient temperature because the shift in the colour of yellow LEDs over the specified temperature range can be greater than the magnitude of <b>colour</b> <b>specification.</b> Use of phase change materials (PCMs) can provide practical solution of these problems. PCMs can store and release thermal energy during the process of melting and freezing (changing from one phase to another). When such a material freezes, it releases large amounts of energy in the form of latent heat of fusion or energy of crystallization. Conversely, when the material is melted, an equal amount of energy is absorbed from the environment as it changes from solid to liquid. This paper presents studies that enable the design of railway signals to meet, in a rigorous way, colorimetric compliances on a large range of temperature change. Furthermore, the proposed system is applicable, in a simple way and without operational changes, to the existing systems. It is sufficient to insert inside of the signals a suitable amount of a specific PCM...|$|E
40|$|Ground calcium {{carbonate}} (GCC) slurries {{are commonly used}} in paper to improve properties such as whiteness, printability, opacity and gloss. The brightness R 457 (i. e. the reflectance at a wavelength of 457 nm) and <b>colour</b> <b>specifications</b> constitute the main quality parameters for GCC slurries, and must be within certain tolerances set by the paper industry. Hence, the removal of any dark or colouring minerals from the raw material {{is essential to obtain}} high quality. Norsk Mineral is one of the world’s biggest suppliers of raw material for GCC production. The raw material is a coarse grained calcite marble extracted from the Akselberg deposit situated in Brønnøysund, 250 km north of Trondheim, Norway. Here, some 2 million tonnes of GCC raw material are produced annually by the subsidiary Brønnøy Kalk. The beneficiation of this raw material involves purification through reverse flotation followed by micronisation of the concentrates. The resulting fine grained slurries (d 80 ≈ 1 μm) comprise the GCC product manufactured for the paper industry. Graphite and silicates represent the main contaminant phases in the Akselberg (Watne 2001). These contaminants are easily separated from the calcite marble by froth flotation, thus resulting in a white, high-quality product. However, substantial volumes of the deposit consist of a sulphide bearing marble, where the main contaminants are pyrite and pyrrhotite, the latter being the most abundant. The first part of the PhD study included an attempt to identify and quantify the different crystallographic phases of pyrrhotite since they display different magnetic, oxidative and flotation properties. The magnetic colloid method, SEM (scanning electron microscope) and EMP (electron micro probe) confirmed the presence of both pyrrhotite phases. Although the accurate quantification was not achieved, the experience gained is still documented in the thesis.

40|$|Acrylamide, a {{contaminant}} {{classified by}} the IARC as “probably carcinogenic to humans” is formed in several heated foods and {{known to be}} linked to the Maillard reaction. Fried potato products are important in the acrylamide issue because they contain the main precursors necessary for its formation and moreover they contribute on average for {{an important part of the}} dietary exposure to this process contaminant, apart from other food commodities, including cereals products, coffee, chocolate and potato snacks. The current entrance quality control used in the French fries industry is done based on colour evaluation with USDA/Munsell colour chart. Colour is evaluated after a short frying test, typically 180 °C for 3 min. This quality control relates raw material to <b>colour</b> <b>specifications</b> of final product (customers demand) and accordingly, either raw material is rejected for processing or appropriate process adjustments are taken (e. g. blanching conditions). This study evaluated the possibility of a more effective entrance control of the raw potato tubers in order to identify lots of potatoes prone to acrylamide formation. Therefore the relationship between the sugar content of potato tuber, the formation of acrylamide and the colour of the baked product was evaluated during two consecutive potato storage seasons (2007 and 2008). The current entrance control was compared to two other colour evaluation methods (CIE L*a*b* colour parameters and a process-specific Agtron analyzer) and to reducing sugar contents determination. Even though differences were observed in reducing sugar contents in raw material for both seasons, similar trends were observed between the acrylamide content of the final product and the above-mentioned parameters. It was demonstrated that a more effective entrance control for incoming potatoes was indeed possible. Using the relationships between acrylamide and respectively colour formation (measured by the Agtron methodology) and reducing sugar content could better identify lots of potatoes prone to acrylamide formation when compared to the current entrance control. Nevertheless, the application of Agtron measurements is certainly more practical to implement and provides a better correlation to acrylamide in the final product compared to reducing sugars in the raw material...|$|R

Six methods for determination of perceived colour weredeveloped and evaluated, along with a method for comparison ofperceived and inherent colour. A combination of all gave themost reliable results. Results showed some recurring tendenciesfor perceived colour to vary with viewing conditions, but thevariations were always smaller than the difference betweenperceived and inherent colour. Consistent variation patternsfor the difference between inherent and perceived colour werefound for both hue and nuance.

After standardisation procedures, redness of pork (CIE <b>colour</b> <b>specification</b> a*), {{one of the most}} important objective colour attributes, was used as an indicator for colour changes in this analysis. The analysis was based on results from five experiments, which met selection criteria. Analysis of changes of other objective colour attributes, lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) was not possible due to lack of published data. The statistical analysis (using mixed models) found significant effects of tissue α-tocopherol concentration in M. longissimus dorsi, simplified supplemented vitamin E levels as well as storage time and storage light on redness of pork and its changes over time. The relationship between redness and α-tocopherol concentration was found to be linear, and between redness and storage time was non-linear (third degree polynomial) in one model. This model suggested that an increase of 1 μg of α-tocopherol in the muscle led to an expected increase a* value of 0. 11. Another model identified significant interactions about 0. 28 between α-tocopherol concentration and storage time in late storage periods. A third model found a significant difference of - 0. 48 between predicted a* values at lower (≤ 50 IU/kg feed) and higher supplemented vitamin E levels (≥ 100 IU/kg feed). The models predicted an initial increase for 3 days, a stable period for 5 days and then a decrease for a* values over storage time. The a* values were significantly lower by about 1. 4 when samples were exposed to light in the models, the effect of light found to be constant over time.

40|$|Purpose Visual stress {{consists}} of perceived distortions or discomfort while reading. It is claimed that these symptoms are alleviated by viewing through coloured lenses or overlays, {{with a specific}} colour required for each individual. This has been explained {{on the basis of}} altered visual cortex excitation as affected by the spectral content of the viewing light. If symptoms are indeed alleviated by a particular colour that has an impact on the individual's visual system, we would expect that selection of the most beneficial colour would be repeatable. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether this is the case. Methods Twenty-one participants (mean age 26 years (range 8 – 55 years); 12 female, nine male) with visual stress and no other uncorrected ocular or visual anomaly were recruited. Each participant selected the colour most beneficial in alleviating their symptoms from a standard set of 10 coloured overlays, and underwent intuitive colorimetry in which the most beneficial of a wide range of chromatic illuminance settings was selected. Without prescribing an overlay at the first appointment, this process was repeated on a second occasion at a mean of 25 days later. Results About half of the participants (n = 10) chose the same (n = 7) or similar (with one common colour in both choices; n = 3) coloured overlay on the two occasions, while 11 participants chose a completely different overlay colour. Across all participants, the colorimetry setting shifted by, on average, 9. 6 just noticeable differences, indicating that the colours were perceptually very different. Conclusion These findings suggest that people with visual stress are unlikely to find exactly the same colour to be optimal on different occasions, and raise questions about the need for precise <b>colour</b> <b>specification</b> in tinted lenses for visual stress...|$|E

Japanese Drafts are used mainly in ban'ei and horsemeat production. The ideal horse has draft phenotype and [...] "hybrid vigour". The breed doesn't have any <b>colour</b> or marking <b>specifications.</b> <b>Colours</b> of bay, chestnut, flaxen chestnut, black, gray and variety of roans have been recorded since they also exist in purebreds. In extreme cases, a horse may have multiple facial markings and all legs marked with white. Open studbook policy has led to pinto (piebald) pattern; one female family used in ban'ei {{can be traced to}} single stallion born in 1967, while dominant white seen in two horses was spontaneous, manifesting in 2010.|$|R
25|$|The {{level of}} {{technology}} in the 1948 2CV was remarkable for the era. While <b>colours</b> and detail <b>specifications</b> were modified in the ensuing 42years, the biggest mechanical change was the addition of front disc brakes (by then already fitted for several years in the mechanically similar Citroën Dyane 6), in October 1981 (for the 1982 model year). The reliability of the car was enhanced by the minimalist simplification of the designers, being air-cooled (with an oil cooler), it had no coolant, radiator, water pump or thermostat. It had no distributor either, just a contact breaker system. Except for the brakes, there were no hydraulic parts on original models; damping was by tuned mass dampers and friction dampers.|$|R
2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired <b>colour</b> and <b>specification.</b> Malts range in colour from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or black malts.|$|R
