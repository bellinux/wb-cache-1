40|$|The {{widely held}} belief that <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> {{ownership}} {{can help to}} reduce loneliness was tested using a quasi-experimental longitudinal design. Over a six-month period, 59 participants completed the UCLA-Loneliness Scale when they were seeking to acquire a <b>companion</b> <b>animal.</b> Participants' loneliness was measured again six-months after their initial recruitment, by which time 35 of the 59 participants had acquired a new <b>companion</b> <b>animal.</b> There {{was no evidence that}} <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> acquisition helped to reduce levels of loneliness, irrespective of whether participants already owned a <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> at the time of seeking to acquire a new <b>companion</b> <b>animal,</b> or the type of <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> that was acquired. There was no evidence that participants who ultimately acquired a new <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> differed from participants who did not, suggesting that the findings were not a consequence of a self-selection bias. The perseverance and apparent strength of the belief that <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> ownership can alleviate loneliness is discussed in relation to the current findings. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> ownership can help to alleviate loneliness. This study explored whether <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> separation leads to increased levels of loneliness. Among new students who had been at universily for three weeks, no evidence was found that <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> separation was associated with increased levels of loneliness, irrespective of the self-reported "closeness" of the owner-companion animal relationship before separation. Because prior to leaving home <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> owners and non-companion animal owners may have somehow differed, a comparable sample of <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> owners and non-companion animal owners was tested immediately prior {{to the time of}} moving to university. No difference in loneliness was found due to <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> ownership, irrespective of the self-reported degree of closeness of the relationship. As both samples may have been atypical, the impact of moving to university on loneliness was explored and a highly significant increase in loneliness was found. Overall, these findings suggest that <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> separation does not contribute to the increase in loneliness observed when students leave home to start at university...|$|R

40|$|Participants {{were ten}} {{emerging}} adult (18 - 29), heterosexual couples {{who have had}} a <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> for at least six months and have no human children. The present study evaluated parenting responsibilities associated with the <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> including caregiving, expenses, and negotiation. Data were collected by a demographic survey and semi-structured interviews. Using a grounded theory framework, a self-created interview was conducted in-person with each couple. Overall, the results suggest that the parenting responsibilities associated with raising a <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> are parallel to the responsibilities of raising a human child. The findings also suggested that the family developmental theory could be modified and adapted to relate to the addition of a <b>companion</b> <b>animal</b> into the family unit, and the developmental changes that occur.

25|$|According {{to a paper}} {{published}} in 2000 by Harold Herzog and Lorna Dorr, previous academic surveys of attitudes towards animal rights have tended to suffer from small sample sizes and non-representative groups.

25|$|Great Danes have {{naturally}} floppy, triangular ears. In the past, when Great Danes were {{commonly used}} to hunt boars, cropping of the ears was performed to make injuries to the dogs' ears less likely during hunts. Now that Danes are primarily <b>companion</b> <b>animals,</b> cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons. In the 1930s when Great Danes had their ears cropped, after the surgery, two devices called Easter bonnets were fitted to their ears to make them stand up. Today, the practice is common in the United States, but much less common in Europe. In some European countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and Germany, and parts of Australia and New Zealand, the practice is banned or controlled to only be performed by veterinary surgeons.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, a {{pharmaceutical}} company called Zonagen (later renamed Repros Therapeutics) was {{started with the}} goal of developing zona pellucida vaccines {{as an alternative to the}} surgical sterilization of <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> and eventually as a contraceptive for human use. The products would be based on research being done at the Baylor College of Medicine by Bonnie S. Dunbar that was funded by Zonagen. However, the relationship between Zonagen and Bonnie Dunbar ended acrimoniously in 1993. Despite claims later that year that development of a contraceptive vaccine was imminent and an agreement with Schering AG for funding for joint development of a contraceptive vaccine for human use, no vaccine was made commercially available and the agreement with Schering was terminated after primate studies were disappointing. The company would go on to pursue other projects and be renamed.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} flies of the two-winged type, Order Diptera, such as mosquitoes, horse-flies, blow-flies and warble-flies cause direct {{parasitic}} disease to domestic animals, and transmit organisms that cause diseases. These infestations and infections cause distress to <b>companion</b> <b>animals,</b> and in livestock industry the financial costs of these diseases are high. These problems occur wherever domestic animals are reared. This article {{provides an overview}} of parasitic flies from a veterinary perspective, with emphasis on the disease causing relationships between these flies and their host animals. The article is organized following the taxonomic hierarchy of these flies in the Phylum Arthropoda, Order Insecta. Families and genera of dipteran flies are emphasized rather than many individual species. Disease caused by the feeding activity of the flies is described here under Parasitic disease. Disease caused by small pathogenic organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under Transmitted organisms; prominent examples are provided from the many species.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} of barking in dogs {{in relation to}} wolves could also be {{the product of the}} very different social environment of dogs. Dogs live in extraordinarily close range with humans, in many societies kept solely as <b>companion</b> <b>animals.</b> From a very young age, humans tend to be one of a dog’s primary social contacts. This captive environment presents very different stimuli than would be found by wolves in the wild. While wolves have vast territories, dogs do not. The boundaries of a captive dog’s territory will be visited frequently by intruders, thus triggering the bark response as a warning. Additionally, dogs densely populate urban areas, allowing more opportunity to meet new dogs and be social. For example, it is possible that kenneled dogs may have increased barking due to a desire to facilitate social behavior. Dogs’ close relationship with humans also renders dogs reliant on humans, even for basic needs. Barking is a way to attract attention, and the behavior is continued by the positive response exhibited by the owners (e.g., if a dog barks to get food and the owner feeds it, the dog is being conditioned to continue said behavior).|$|E
25|$|On Krypton, {{parallel}} evolution {{led to the}} emergence of analogous species to Terran cats, simians, birds and dogs, which were domestic <b>companion</b> <b>animals</b> as they were on Earth. As explained in his first appearance, Krypto was originally the toddler Kal-El's dog while they were on Krypton. Jor-El, testing prototypes for the rocket that would eventually send Kal-El to Earth, decided to use Krypto as a test subject. However, Krypto's rocket was knocked off-course; the rocket drifted through space for years until it eventually landed on Earth, where Krypto was reunited with the now-teenaged superhero, Superboy. Due to the environment (Earth's yellow sun and lower gravity), Krypto possessed the same powers and abilities as his master, although his physical abilities were proportionate to his smaller size and species, similar to an ordinary dog vs. a human. Certain sensory abilities of Krypto's (senses of smell and hearing) would be more acute than those of Superman, just as an ordinary dog's senses would be more acute than those of an ordinary human. Krypto also had super-canine intelligence (approximately human level, though with his canine traits and interests still present); the comics expressed this via the use of thought balloons indicating what Krypto was thinking.|$|E
