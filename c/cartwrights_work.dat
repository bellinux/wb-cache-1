50|$|In 1820 the U.K. and the Ottoman Empire had {{established}} a Trade Tariff that would expire in 14 years. After 1834 neither party wanted to renew the original agreement as it stood; so, Reşit Pasha (advisor to the Sultan), David Urquhart (an English diplomat), Lord Posonby (the British Ambassador) and Counsel General John <b>Cartwright,</b> <b>worked</b> to form the Treaty of Balta Liman. David Urquhart was sent to Istanbul to befriend Reşit Pasha and convince him the treaty would be of benefit to the Ottoman State. Urquhart worked hard to convince Ottoman notables that the treaty was in their favor. He published articles in Istanbul’s newspapers, listing the benefits of free trade markets; his propaganda influenced the capital city deeply. France and Russia watched the negotiations of the treaty closely. Russia feared losing its newfound Ottoman interests, and the French may have had to consider switching sides if Britain aligned itself with the Sultan against Mehmet Ali Pasha of Egypt.|$|R

Steven Cartwright is a troop {{leader in}} the British Royal Marines, who during the Chimeran {{invasion}} of Britain, and with {{the deaths of the}} British military hierarchy, becomes de facto head of the Royal Marines, under the command of Cpt. Rachel Parker; serving as her second-in-command of the British Resistance. Cartwright is shown to be flamboyant, flippant and easy-going; however he is also a highly competent tactician and brilliant soldier; leading many operations against the Chimera. In Resistance: Fall of Man, Cartwright occasionally fights beside Hale during his one-man mission to end the Chimeran occupation, until he was incapacitated during the final battle. Cartwright survived and returned to duty, now promoted to Major and made official head of the British Royal Marines, once again under now-Colonel Parker.

In part three I present and discuss metaphysical pluralism as argued for by John Dupré (1995). In the final section, I balance pluralism against physicalism. On the basis of that discussion I end with outlining an argument for ontological pluralism. My overall goal is mainly two things. I aim to show (i) that physicalism is not the only serious alternative to dualism, and (ii) that it is feasible to regard ontological pluralism, which I consider a type of philosophical materialism, as ‘the scientific metaphysics’...|$|R

50|$|Because Olivia Hill {{worked at}} the Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia during {{the spring and fall}} seasons, and a related resort in Bermuda during the winter, Oliver was raised by her {{grandmother}} and grandaunt in a small house on St. James Street in a predominantly African American section of Richmond. When Oliver was six years old, his mother Olivia Hill returned to Richmond for her mother's funeral, and introduced Oliver to her new husband, Joseph <b>Cartwright</b> Hill, who <b>worked</b> as a bellman at the Homestead resort. Oliver's maternal grandmother had moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania but returned to Richmond shortly before her death. His paternal grandfather William Henry White Sr. had founded Mount Carmel Baptist Church in Richmond, which the family attended and where Oliver attended Sunday school, but Rev. White died on August 13, 1913, not long after grandmother Lewis. His paternal grandmother, Kate Garnet White, was reputedly part Native American, but {{had little to do with}} Oliver and his mother.

40|$|In a now-classic paper, Nancy Cartwright {{argued that}} the Humean {{conception}} of causation as mere regular co-occurrence is too weak {{to make sense of}} our everyday and scientific practices. Specifically she claimed that in order to understand our reasoning about, and uses of, effective strategies, we need a metaphysically stronger notion of causation and causal laws than Humeanism allows. Cartwright’s arguments were formulated in the framework of probabilistic causation, and it is precisely in the domain of (objective) probabilities that I am interested in defending a form of Humeanism. In this paper I will unpack some examples of effective strategies and discuss how well they fit the framework of causal laws and criteria such as CC from <b>Cartwright’s</b> and others’ <b>works</b> on probabilistic causality. As part of this discussion, I will also consider the concept or concepts of objective probability presupposed in these works. I will argue that Cartwright’s notion of a nomological machine, or a mechanism as defined by Stuart Glennan, is better suited for making sense of effective strategies, and therefore that a metaphysically primitive notion of causal law (or singular causation, or capacity, as Cartwright argues in (1989)) is not – here, at least – needed. These conclusions, as well as the concept of objective probabilities I defend, are largely in harmony with claims Cartwright defends in The Dappled World. My discussion aims, thus, to bring out into the open how far Cartwright’s current views are from a radically anti-Humean, causal-fundamentalist picture...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how Dr. Samuel A. Cartwright used {{science to}} manufacture consent among slave laborers in the antebellum South. I hope {{to contribute to}} debates on black health by addressing the issue of mental health {{and the role of}} race in the history of psychiatry. Cartwright's early essays and anonymous publications, heretofore addressed, provide unique insight into what led the physician to articulate blacks' acts of defiance and rebellion as instances of mental instability. Instead of viewing black people's vigilance for freedom as earnest, Cartwright was well known for having delineated a variety of mental disorders to which he claimed all Africans were prone, including shirking work related responsibilities (Dysaesthesia Aethiopica), and the practice of running away to freedom (Drapetomania). This dissertation demonstrates how Cartwright mobilized statistics and diagnostic categories in hopes to convince others to limit black mobility and to eliminate power-sharing. 	Whether in the form of whites negotiating with slaves, providing incentives for them to work harder, or by rejecting the "Free Negro" category altogether, Cartwright saw his duty as twofold: to correct what he argued was the misguided notion that some blacks held the capacity to endure freedom whereas others did not, and to put forth a therapeutic regimen by which to curb blacks' enthusiasm for freedom [...] he repudiated gradual and immediate abolition altogether and advocated instead that whites worldwide reduce all blacks to slavery. Following the lead of the Founding generation Cartwright reasoned that there were structurally-based, mental and physiological differences between blacks and whites which led blacks to be governed differently and through coercion. So, in addition to being innovate in his diagnostic claims, on par with Jefferson's accomplishment in Notes on the State of Virginia, Cartwright consolidated existing scientific opinion and then gave it powerful and influential articulation. He motivated a trans-Atlantic debate about "Free Negro Insanity" which reflected widespread 19 th century scientific thinking about race, slave management and stimulating correct conduct in laborers. An inquiry into "Free Negro Insanity" enables a conversation about how trans-Atlantic science and medicine served the requirements of slavery as an institution&# 894; how science is used to determine what constituted a slave's status, what was meant by a slave "running away" and why slaves' "mental competence" was necessarily an issue. By examining the genealogy of Cartwright's concepts, one can see better his process of concept-creation and inquire into how `objects' in science get created or set aside for study. 	Cartwright wrote extensively on the need for Southerners to pursue independent medical education as a way to explore diseases particular to the Southern climate and "its Negroes. " But despite the fact that <b>Cartwright's</b> early <b>work</b> (published before his tenure as "Professor of Negro Diseases" at the University of Louisiana) established his career and achieved him status, scholars address it rarely. I argue that charting how he achieves, loses and then regains his status provides a unique window into the thinking of the emerging plantation aristocracy on how to regulate "Free Negro" activity in the Mississippi and Louisiana territories {{as well as in the}} English, Spanish and French West Indies. This inquiry into conduct disorder and defiance diagnoses helps readers to see both medicine's curative and productive values. The implications of such a focus stretch from the applied science of 19 th century "Negro Management" handbooks and "Plantation Manuals" to the 20 th century presence of medical diagnoses like "Attention Deficit Disorder" (A. D. D.), "Hyperactivity Disorder" (A. D. H. D.), and "Oppositional Defiance Disorders" (O. D. D.) which are aimed at curbing the behavior of disobedient, defiant and rebellious youth through pharmaceutical treatments...|$|R
