5|$|Turley {{began working}} as a {{financial}} planner in 1957, by selling life insurance. He also operated a bowling alley in Bel Air, Maryland, and an insurance firm in Baltimore. In 1977, Turley joined with Arthur L. Williams, Jr. and five others to found A. L. Williams & Associates, an insurance company. At A. L. Williams, agents advised clients to purchase term life insurance, rather than <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> life insurance, and invest the money they saved in mutual funds. The company became Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 1989. He retired from the business in 2001, and sold half of his business to his son and the other half to Lynn Webb, a senior national sales director.|$|E

25|$|The {{dividend}} is {{hopefully the}} payout that the assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted {{and all the}} assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are {{in the form of}} cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not even be a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. Tangible assets <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated. Intangible assets such as intellectual property or processes are much more difficult to evaluate.|$|E

50|$|Internal {{rates of}} return for {{participating}} policies may be much worse than universal life and interest-sensitive whole life (whose <b>cash</b> <b>values</b> are invested in the money market and bonds) because their <b>cash</b> <b>values</b> are invested in the life insurance company and its general account, which may be in real estate and the stock market. However, universal life policies run a much greater risk, and are actually designed to lapse. Variable universal life insurance may outperform whole life because the owner can direct investments in sub-accounts that may do better. If an owner desires a conservative position for his <b>cash</b> <b>values,</b> par whole life is indicated.|$|R

25|$|Casket (or the $2 Casket) was {{the name}} given to the draw lottery {{administered}} by Queensland's lottery operator, Golden Casket. The {{name of the game}} dates back to the first Queensland draw lotteries – with cash prizes originally prohibited by law, the first prize was awarded as a casket of gold valued at a certain amount, which was then immediately bought back from winners for its <b>cash</b> <b>value.</b> The first Casket draw was held on 14 June 1917, with the final draw (Draw 301) held on 3 April 2013.|$|E

25|$|Few {{guidelines}} were provided for operating Union prison camps, so Owen devised his own, {{which served as}} a model for other camps. Owen's policies were sympathetic to the prisoners' needs. Under his command, camp discipline was strict, but humane, and allowed for self-government among the prisoners, which local leaders criticized on occasion. Early challenges at the camp included equitable distribution of rations and supplies. A camp bakehouse was erected and in operation by mid-April 1862. It provided prisoners a place to work and the means to earn money to purchase small amenities. A fund established from the <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> of the camp's excess rations provided prisoners with additional supplies. While trade with unauthorized vendors did occur, most of the items sold to prisoners came from the camp's sutler.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{other sites}} started to expand beyond eSports betting and instead offered betting on games of chance. Jackpot-like sites were introduced, where users can put their skins into the pot, which {{will end in}} one person winning. The higher total value, the more chance the user would have to win. A few sites reduced the {{gambling}} to betting on {{the result of a}} single coin flip. Some sites also offered unopened weapon crates for purchase with skins. In combination with the gambling features, players could then trade skins they won for their <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> through these sites, or purchase skins with currency to gamble further. The exact timing for the growth of these gambling sites is unclear, but Chris Grove, an analyst for Eilers & Krejcik Gaming and Narus Advisors, observed as early as August 2015 that skins were being used for betting on eSports. At that time, the use of skins for gambling on more traditional games-of-chance was not readily apparent.|$|E
25|$|Valve added random skin rewards {{as part of}} {{an update}} to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2013, believing that players would use these to trade with other players and bolster both the player {{community}} and its Steam marketplace. A number of websites were created to bypass monetary restrictions Valve set on the Steam marketplace to aid in high-value trading and allowing users to receive <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> for skins. Some of these sites subsequently added the ability to gamble on the results of professional matches or in games of chance with these skins, which in 2016 was estimated to handle around $5 billion of the virtual goods. These sites, along with Valve and various video game streamers, have come under scrutiny due to ethical and legal questions relating to gambling on sporting matches, underage gambling, undisclosed promotion, and outcome rigging. Evidence of such unethical practices was discovered in June 2016, and led to two formal lawsuits filed against these sites and Valve in the following month. Valve subsequently has taken steps to stop such sites from using Steam's interface for enabling gambling, leading to about half of these sites to close down, while driving more of the skin gambling into an underground economy.|$|E

If the policy has {{not become a}} [...] "modified endowment", the loans are withdrawn from the policy values as premium first and then any gain. Taking Loans on UL affects the long-term viability of the plan. The <b>cash</b> <b>values</b> removed by loan are no longer earning the interest expected, so the <b>cash</b> <b>values</b> don't grow as expected. This shortens {{the life of the}} policy. Usually those loans cause a greater than expected premium payment as well as interest payments.|$|R

500|$|The Virginia Lottery gives top-prize {{winners of}} certain games {{a choice of}} cash or annuity.

(A cash option winner of Mega Millions or Powerball receives the [...] "lump sum" [...] in two installments as both games are offered by multiple lotteries.)

500|$|According to Hans Bielenstein, the {{physical}} requirements of subsistence in grain {{can also be}} calculated from the Hanshu: [...] "a family consisting of an old woman, a grown man, a grown woman, an older child, and a younger child, annually consumed 127 hu of unhusked grain. This comes to about 10.5 hu per month." [...] (According to Swann, one hu 斛 equals 0.565 of a US bushel, which is about 5 gallons or 20 liters). Hsu puts the yearly subsistence figure at 140 hu. Bielenstein also examines salary tables given in both the Hanshu and the Houhan shu (Book of the Later Han) that list official salaries half in cash and half in unhusked grain. Based on these tables, he derives a conversion between cash and hu: a [...] "generally accepted average is 70 to 80 cash for Former Han and 100 cash for Later Han." [...] Based on this conversion, the <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> of the grain needed for subsistence was about 8,890 to 14,000 coins per year during the Han dynasty.|$|E

500|$|In March 1931 Gibbons {{had become}} engaged to Allan Webb, a budding actor and opera singer five years her junior. He {{was the son}} of a cricketing parson, and the {{grandson}} of Allan Becher Webb, a former Bishop of Bloemfontein who served as Dean of Salisbury Cathedral. On 1 April 1933 the couple were married at St Matthew's, Bayswater. Later that year she learned that Cold Comfort Farm had been awarded the Prix Étranger, the [...] foreign novel category of the prestigious French literary prize, the Prix Femina. [...] It had won against works by two [...] more experienced writers, Bowen and Rosamond Lehmann. [...] This outcome irritated Virginia Woolf, herself a former Prix [...] Étranger winner, who wrote to Bowen: [...] "I was enraged to see they gave the £40 (the <b>cash</b> <b>value</b> of the prize) to Gibbons; still, now you and Rosamond can join in blaming her". Cooke observes that of all the Prix [...] Étranger winners from the inter-war years, only Cold Comfort Farm and Woolf's To the Lighthouse are remembered today, and that only the former has bequeathed a phrase that has passed into common usage: [...] "something nasty in the woodshed".|$|E
