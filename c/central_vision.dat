25|$|Eye damage. Though it is unlikely, {{high power}} visible or {{invisible}} (infrared, ultraviolet) laser light could cause permanent eye injury.

At higher power levels, the spots may be in the <b>central</b> <b>vision,</b> in the same area where the original light was viewed. Most unlikely of all is injury causing a complete and permanent loss of vision. To do this requires very specialized equipment and a desire to deliberately target aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Glaucoma is a {{group of}} eye {{diseases}} which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by <b>central</b> <b>vision</b> resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{photoreceptor}} cells, rods and cones, which are sensitive to different aspects of light. Rod cells are sensitive to the intensity of light over a wide frequency range, thus are responsible for black-and-white vision. Rod cells are not present on the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for <b>central</b> <b>vision,</b> and are not as responsive as cone cells to spatial and temporal changes in light. There are, however, twenty times more rod cells than cone cells in the retina because the rod cells are present across a wider area. Because of their wider distribution, rods are responsible for peripheral vision.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, <b>central</b> <b>vision</b> (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The walk is {{strictly}} influenced by vision, that's {{essential for the}} position of the body in the space during the walk cycle and the postural control. The quality of life related to the vision is widely highlighted in literature: for example Brown et al. in 2005 underlined the comparison from DMLE and chronic ills, like HIV, angina, dialysis, advanced prostate tumor, stroke, and heart attack. Peripheral low vision appeared the most crippling aspect to the walk, but in recent years a lot of studies stressed the walk difficulty in patients with <b>central</b> low <b>vision.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study has been carried out in partnership between Ophtalmic Department and Physiatrist Department. Its aim was to evaluate static posture in patients affected by maculopathy. We picked out subjects affected by maculopathy with <b>central</b> low <b>vision</b> due to a variety of causes but with preserved peripheral vision. RESULTS: Test trials had the purpose to investigate different aspects of static posture, in subjects affected by <b>central</b> low <b>vision.</b> It was related to risk of falling and faulty postures, that are pathologically in a long term. CONCLUSIONS: Our study claimed that in stabilometric analysis the differences between patients affected by maculopathy and control group aren't statistically significant...|$|R

25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} is a variable condition; {{the degree of}} severity is not tightly linked to whether it is Usher I, II, or III. For example, someone with type III may be unaffected in childhood, but go on to develop a profound hearing loss and a very significant loss of sight by early to midadulthood. Similarly, someone with type I, who is therefore profoundly deaf from birth, may keep good <b>central</b> <b>vision</b> until the sixth decade of life, or even beyond. People with type II, who have useful hearing with a hearing aid, can experience {{a wide range of}} severity of the RP. Some may maintain good reading vision into their 60s, while others cannot see to read while still in their 40s.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{researchers}} had at their disposal three methods of investigating eye movement. The first, unaided observation, yielded only small amounts of data that would be considered unreliable by today's scientific standards. This lack of reliability arises from the fact that eye movement occurs frequently, rapidly, and over small angles, to the extent that it is impossible for an experimenter to perceive and record the data fully and accurately without technological assistance. The other method was self-observation, now considered to be of doubtful status in a scientific context. Despite this, some knowledge appears to have been produced from introspection and naked-eye observation. For example, Ibn al Haytham, a medical man in 11th-century Egypt, is reported to have written of reading in terms of a series of quick movements and to have realised that readers use peripheral as well as <b>central</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some circumstances, {{fluorescent}} lamps operated {{at the power}} supply frequency (50 or 60Hz) can also produce flicker at the same frequency itself, which is noticeable by more people. This can happen {{in the last few}} hours of tube life when the cathode emission coating at one end has almost run out or a filament is open circuit, and that cathode starts having difficulty emitting enough electrons into the gas fill, resulting in slight rectification and hence uneven light output in positive and negative going AC cycles. Power frequency flicker can also sometimes be emitted from the very ends of the tubes, if each tube electrode produces a slightly different light output pattern on each half-cycle. Flicker at power frequency is more noticeable in the peripheral vision than it is when viewed directly, as is all flicker (since the peripheral vision is faster—has a higher critical frequency—than the <b>central</b> <b>vision).</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{interpretation}} of facial expressions and mouthing {{can be difficult}} to understand when an individual has a visual impairment. Such problems hinder the ability of people to understand stimuli and translate information pertaining to perception with their brain for analysis. Non-verbal communication is important in effective communication and elders with vision loss are more likely to misinterpret or read the other person's actions in a wrong way. Visual impairments also cause a loss in positive perceptions of the environment around them. This can lead to isolation and possible depression in elderly people. Macular degeneration is a common cause of vision loss in elderly people. It diminishes the macula of the eye, which is responsible for clear vision. It causes progressive loss of <b>central</b> <b>vision</b> and possible loss of colour vision. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and growth of abnormal vessels around the retina causing the photoreceptors not to receive proper images. Though ageing almost always causes this, other possible effects and risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history and excessive sunlight exposure.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} {{and interviews with}} members of open source projects have described a male-dominated culture within open source communities that can be unwelcoming or hostile towards females. There are an initiatives such as Outreachy that aim to support more women and other underrepresented gender identities to participate in open source software. However, within the discussion forums of open source projects the topic of gender diversity can be highly controversial and even inflammatory. A <b>central</b> <b>vision</b> in open source software is that because the software is built and maintained on the merit of individual code contributions, open source communities should act as a meritocracy. In a meritocracy, the importance of an individual in the community depends {{on the quality of}} their individual contributions and not demographic factors such as age, race, religion, or gender. Thus proposing changes to the community based on gender, for example, to make the community more inviting towards females, go against the ideal of a meritocracy by targeting certain programmers by gender and no based on their skill alone.|$|E

This consumption necessitates the use of carbon-producing fuels such as coal and natural gas, both of which have significant environmental impacts. While renewable energy sources remain promising, it is expected that most of the electricity generation will still use fossil fuels in the near term. Therefore, improving the energy efficiency in commercial buildings is critical, and one of the <b>central</b> <b>visions</b> of “smart buildings ” is to reduce their energy use while maintaining the same level of service.

2500|$|Cats have {{a visual}} {{field of view}} of [...] 200° {{compared}} with 180° in humans, but a binocular field (overlap in the images from each eye) narrower than that of humans.

Field of view is largely dependent upon the placement of the eyes, but may also be related to the eye's construction. Instead of the fovea, which gives humans sharp <b>central</b> <b>vision,</b> cats have a central band known as the visual streak. Cats can see some colors, and can tell the difference between red, blue and yellow lights, as well as between red and green lights. Cats are able to distinguish between blues and violets better than between colors near the red end of the spectrum. A 2014 study found that, along with several other mammals, cats lenses transmit significant amounts of ultraviolet (UVA 315–400nm) light, which suggests that they possess sensitivity to this part of the spectrum.|$|E
