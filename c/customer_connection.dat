40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the link between IS {{capabilities}} and operational performance in services. More specifically, it aims to investigate how the processes for supplier and customer integration affect IS capabilities and consequently, firms’ operational performance. Accordingly, this study examines the effects of three dimensions of IS capabilities (IT for supply chain activities, flexible IT infrastructure, and IT operations shared knowledge) on cost and quality performance via the mediation of the processes developed for supplier and customer integration in service firms. This is achieved by measuring SCI in terms of supply side integration processes (supplier integration) as well as customer side integration processes (customer transactions, <b>customer</b> <b>connection,</b> and customer collaboration). A survey-based research design intended to measure the estimated relationships was adopted. Data were collected from 156 service establishments in the UK. Mediated multiple regression analysis revealed that integrating specific processes with supply chain members (supplier integration, customer transactions, <b>customer</b> <b>connection,</b> and customer collaboration) can fully or partially mediate the effects of IT for supply chain activities and IT operations shared knowledge on cost and quality performance; no support was found for the relationships between flexible IT infrastructure and cost and quality performance. These results provide a valuable explanation to academics {{as well as to}} practitioners regarding the importance of various processes developed for integration with supply chain members in leveraging IS for operational performance in services. This thesis takes a step towards quelling concerns about the business value of IS, contributing to the development and validation of the measurement of IS capabilities in the service operations context. Additionally, it adds to the emerging body of literature linking supply chain integration to the operational performance of service firms...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} the {{influence}} of the marketing department (MD), as well as its relationship with firm performance, includes seven industrialized countries and aims to generalize the conceptual model presented by Verhoef and Leeflang (2009). This investigation considers the antecedents of perceived MD influence, top management respect for the MD, and MD decision influence, as well as the relationships of these three influence variables with market orientation (MO) and business performance (BP). Meta-analytic procedures reveal initial empirical generalizations: Accountability, MD innovativeness, and the <b>customer</b> <b>connection</b> capabilities of the MD relate consistently to all three studied MD influence measures. The generalization also shows that MD influence contributes to BP indirectly through its positive relationship with MO and directly through its positive direct relationship with BP.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} modeling of fault distribution along the boundary crossing lines of the area of vulnerability on the stochastic prediction of voltage sags and their characteristics. The study was performed on a generic distribution network, and all types of faults were simulated throughout the network. Two buses from the 11 -kV distribution system were randomly selected and the areas of vulnerability due to each type of fault for specific sensitive equipment at the selected buses were determined. These areas were determined by assessing voltage sag performance at each phase separately. Finally, the influence of different fault distributions along the vulnerability area boundary crossing lines was considered. It was shown that the fault distribution along those lines influences strongly the number and characteristics of voltage sags at the <b>customer</b> <b>connection</b> point...|$|E

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} state estimation {{is the core}} stone for flexible operation and control of active smart grids. Through the current expansion of integrating DG units in low voltage networks, the network operation is becoming more complex than before. However, real-time monitoring and control through state estimation is a routine task for the transmission system operators (TSO's) due to the availability of measurement data. The distribution system operators (DSO's) are trying to extend their monitoring and control for medium and low voltage network in order to enable smart grid applications. With the current rollout of smart meters, which are considered as {{a key component of}} future smart grids, there would be enough metering data in the distribution networks (voltage, current, active and reactive power consumption and generation) available at every <b>customer</b> <b>connection</b> point. This paper aims to develop a method {{to solve the problem of}} meter placement for low voltage sy stem state estimation through deciding which measurement data from the installed smart meters should be considered in the state estimation algorithms in order to improve on the uncertainty of the estimated voltage and its phase angle at every node in the network...|$|E
