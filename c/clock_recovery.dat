40|$|Abstract — Power {{consumption}} of the clock tree dominates over 40 % of the total power in modern high performance VLSI designs, measures {{must be taken to}} keep it under control. Hence, low power clocking schemes are promising approaches for low-power design. We propose four novel energy <b>recovery</b> <b>clocked</b> flip-flops that enable energy <b>recovery</b> from the <b>clock</b> network, resulting in significant energy savings. These flipflops operate with a single-phase sinusoidal clock which can be generated with high efficiency. In the Tanner 250 nm CMOS technology, we implemented these energy <b>recovery</b> <b>clocked</b> flipflops through an H-tree clock network driven by a resonant clock-generator to generate a sinusoidal clock. The proposed flip-flops exhibit more than 80 % delay reduction, power reduction of up to 47 %, as compared to the conventional energy recovery flip-flop. Simulation results show a power reduction of 90 % on the clocktree and total power savings of up to 83 % as compared to the same implementation using the conventional square-wave clocking scheme and flip-flops. In this paper, we also propose clock gating solutions for energy <b>recovery</b> <b>clocking.</b> Applying our clock gating to the energy <b>recovery</b> <b>clocked</b> flip-flops reduces their power by more than 1000 times in the idle mode with negligible power and delay overhead in the active mode.
