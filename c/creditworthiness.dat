5|$|In early 1790, Hamilton {{devised a}} plan with the {{approval}} of Washington, culminating in The Residence Act of 1790, that established the <b>creditworthiness</b> of the new government, as well as its permanent location. Congress had previously issued almost $22 million to suppliers in certificates of debt during the war; some of the states had incurred debt, as well (more so in the North). In accordance with the plan, Congress authorized the assumption and payment of these debts, and provided funding through customs duties and excise taxes. The proposal was largely favored in the North and opposed in the South. Hamilton obtained the approval of the southern states in exchange for an agreement to place the new national capitol on the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Researchers found {{evidence}} that significant deviations from CIRP during {{the onset of the}} global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 were driven by concerns over risk posed by counter parties to banks and financial institutions in Europe and the US in the foreign exchange swap market. The European Central Bank's efforts to provide US dollar liquidity in the foreign exchange swap market, along with similar efforts by the Federal Reserve, had a moderating impact on CIRP deviations between the dollar and the euro. Such a scenario was found to be reminiscent of deviations from CIRP during the 1990s driven by struggling Japanese banks which looked toward foreign exchange swap markets to try and acquire dollars to bolster their <b>creditworthiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|A National Loan Act {{provided}} for $2 million in bonds, {{but due to}} its poor <b>creditworthiness,</b> the kingdom {{had been unable to}} sell them. Gibson hit upon the idea of combining the two acts by appointing businessman Claus Spreckels, a close friend of the king, as government agent to contract with the United States Mint to have coins struck there, and for Spreckels to be paid in government bonds. In March 1883, the cabinet council authorized Finance Minister John M. Kapena to make the arrangement with Spreckels, who received formal authority for this role in May. H.A.P. Carter, Hawaiian envoy in Washington, acted as intermediary between the Hawaiians and the US government, and wrote to Kapena in June that the US authorities regarded the agency arrangement as peculiar, since a more usual way of proceeding would have been for the Hawaiian government to contract directly, and to pay for the coins in cash.|$|E

25|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} provide assessments about the <b>creditworthiness</b> of bonds issued by corporations, governments, and packagers of asset-backed securities. In market practice, a significant bond issuance generally has a rating {{from one or}} two of the Big Three agencies.|$|E
25|$|CRAs {{theoretically}} provide {{investors with}} an independent evaluation {{and assessment of}} debt securities' <b>creditworthiness.</b> However, {{in recent decades the}} paying customers of CRAs have primarily not been issuers of securities but buyers, raising the issue of conflict of interest (see below).|$|E

25|$|In Australia, {{credit scoring}} is widely {{accepted}} {{as the primary}} method of assessing <b>creditworthiness.</b> Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring {{in the setting of}} credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.|$|E
25|$|Influenced profoundly by the Great Depression, many {{national}} leaders promoted {{the development of}} local industry {{in an effort to}} insulate the economy from future external shocks. After six years of government austerity measures, which succeeded in reestablishing Chile's <b>creditworthiness,</b> Chileans elected to office during the 1938â€“58 period a succession of center and left-of-center governments interested in promoting economic growth by means of government intervention.|$|E
25|$|A {{credit rating}} agency (CRA, also called a ratings service) {{is a company}} that assigns credit ratings, which rate a debtor's ability to pay back debt by making timely {{interest}} payments and the likelihood of default. An agency may rate the <b>creditworthiness</b> of issuers of debt obligations, of debt instruments, and in some cases, of the servicers of the underlying debt, but not of individual consumers.|$|E
25|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} assess the relative credit risk of specific debt securities or structured finance instruments and borrowing entities (issuers of debt), {{and in some}} cases the <b>creditworthiness</b> of governments and their securities. By serving as information intermediaries, CRAs theoretically reduce information costs, increase the pool of potential borrowers, and promote liquid markets. These functions may increase the supply of available risk capital in the market and promote economic growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} the bank to borrow money {{reliably}} and economically is crucial, which is why confidence in the bank's <b>creditworthiness</b> is important to its liquidity. This means that the bank needs to maintain adequate capitalisation and to effectively control its exposures to risk {{in order to continue}} its operations. If creditors doubt the bank's assets are worth more than its liabilities, all demand creditors have an incentive to demand payment immediately, causing a bank run to occur.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in The Daily Yomiuri on 16 June 2007, Sahashi said he was considering offers of capital and business alliances from several companies in various industries, including retail firms, {{to deal with an}} expected drop in sales and to restore trust in the company and possibly selling off properties and real estate in Osaka estimated to be worth several billion yen. A capital alliance would have served to improve its <b>creditworthiness</b> and secure operating expenses.|$|E
25|$|The issuers of the {{obligations}} or securities may be companies, special purpose entities, {{state or local}} governments, non-profit organizations, or sovereign nations. A credit rating facilitates the trading of securities on a secondary market. It affects the interest rate that a security pays out, with higher ratings leading to lower interest rates. Individual consumers are rated for <b>creditworthiness</b> not by credit rating agencies but by credit bureaus (also called consumer reporting agencies or credit reference agencies), which issue credit scores.|$|E
25|$|Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury {{has been}} obtaining {{negative}} real {{interest rates on}} government debt. Such low rates, outpaced by the inflation rate, occur when the market believes {{that there are no}} alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies, pensions, or bond, money market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against risk. Lawrence Summers and others state that at such low rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money, and improves <b>creditworthiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{turnaround}} {{in the fiscal}} performance is particularly noteworthy. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century, Morocco's overall deficit stood at 5.3 percent of GDP, and gross total government debt amounted to three-fourths of GDP. In 2007, reflecting a strong improvement in revenue performance and moderate growth in expenditure, the budget was close to balance. Under the combined effect of a prudent fiscal policy and sizeable privatization receipts, the total debt stock had shrunk by 20 percentage points, and now stands at a little over half of GDP. As a result, perceptions of Morocco's <b>creditworthiness</b> have improved.|$|E
25|$|New credit {{scores have}} been {{developed}} {{in the last decade}} by companies such as Scorelogix, PRBC, L2C, Innovis etc. which do not use bureau data to predict <b>creditworthiness.</b> Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay. It is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine <b>creditworthiness,</b> and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding the effects of linguistic profiling relates to housing. A study at the University of Pennsylvania found that discrepancies existed not only between white speakers of Standard American English and black speakers of African American Vernacular English, but in addition in between females and males and speakers of Black Accented English and African American Vernacular English when applying for housing. African Americans as a whole {{were also more likely}} to be told about the problems of <b>creditworthiness</b> when applying for a lease. An explanation offered by {{the research}}er suggests the linkage between low socio-economic backgrounds and African American Vernacular English, while Black Accented English was associated with higher middle class status. Speech closer to the standard form yielded greater acceptance.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{there was}} {{initially}} a widespread {{belief that a}} corporation needed to demonstrate its <b>creditworthiness</b> by having its shares only partly paid, as where shares are partly paid, the investor would be liable {{for the remainder of}} the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to Â£1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866â€“1867) and the Long Depression (1873â€“1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no single}} yield curve {{describing}} the cost of money for everybody. The {{most important factor in}} determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their <b>creditworthiness.</b> The yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government bond yield curve (government curve). Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{has been}} run by {{military}} dictatorships for large periods of time, alternating with limited democracy. These rapid changes in governments led to rapid policy changes and reversals and {{the reduction of}} transparency and accountability in government. The onset of military regimes have contributed to non-transparency in resource allocation.Those who do not constitute the political elite are unable to make political leaders and the Government responsive to their needs or accountable to promises. Development priorities are determined not by potential beneficiaries but by the bureaucracy and a political elite {{which may or may}} not be in touch with the needs of the citizens. Political instability and macroeconomic imbalances have been reflected in poor <b>creditworthiness</b> ratings, even compared to other countries of similar income levels, with resulting capital flight and lower foreign direct investment inflows. The current government of Pakistan has professed commitments to reforms in this area.|$|E
25|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} {{originated in the}} United States in the early 1900s, when ratings began {{to be applied to}} securities, specifically those related to the railroad bond market. In the United States, the construction of extensive railroad systems had {{led to the development of}} corporate bond issues to finance them, and therefore a bond market several times larger than in other countries. The bond markets in the Netherlands and Britain had been established longer but tended to be small, and revolved around sovereign governments that were trusted to honor their debts. Companies were founded to provide investors with financial information on the growing railroad industry, including Henry Varnum Poor's publishing company, which produced a publication compiling financial data about the railroad and canal industries. Following the 1907 financial crisis, demand rose for such independent market information, in particular for independent analyses of bond <b>creditworthiness.</b> In 1909, financial analyst John Moody issued a publication focused solely on railroad bonds. His ratings became the first to be published widely in an accessible format, and his company was the first to charge subscription fees to investors.|$|E
25|$|The {{liberalization}} program {{overcame the}} balance of payments crisis, reestablished Turkey's ability to borrow in international capital markets, and led to renewed economic growth. Merchandise exports grew from US$2.3 billion in 1979 to US$8.3 billion in 1985. Merchandise import growth in the same periodfrom US$4.8 billion to US$11.2 billiondid not keep pace with export growth and proportionately narrowed the trade deficit, although the deficit level stabilized at around US$2.5 billion. Ã–zal's policies had a particularly {{positive impact on the}} services account of the current account. Despite a jump in interest payments, from US$200 million in 1979 to US$1.4 billion in 1985, the services account accumulated a growing surplus during this period. Expanding tourist receipts and pipeline fees from Iraq were the main reasons for this improvement. Stabilizing the current account helped restore <b>creditworthiness</b> on international capital markets. Foreign investment, which had been negligible in the 1970s, now started to grow, although it remained modest in the mid-1980s. Also, Turkey was able to borrow on the international market, whereas in the late 1970s it could only seek assistance from the IMF and other official creditors.|$|E
25|$|Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, {{the chief}} {{underwriter}} of Citigroup's Consumer Lending Group, began warning {{the board of}} directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's <b>creditworthiness.</b> When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that at the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Regardless of the findings of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanesâ€“Oxley Act (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing {{as one of the first}} witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.|$|E
500|$|When {{mortgage}} lenders {{consider whether}} to underwrite a particular loan, {{they look to}} {{factors such as the}} <b>creditworthiness</b> of the borrower and the amount of down payment the borrower will be making. [...] The amount of the down payment required by the mortgage lender can be as high as 20% of the home's purchase price. [...] In the United States, the down payment requirement can be substantially reduced if repayment of the mortgage is guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), an agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). [...] The required down payment under such FHA insured loans has varied over time; in the 1990s it was 3% of the home's purchase price.|$|E
500|$|As attorney-general in the Greenfield government, Brownlee {{had been}} {{critical}} of its large deficits, and putting a stop to them {{was one of his}} priorities on taking office. [...] He accomplished this objective sooner than he might have expected: though the government had projected a deficit for 1925, on February 11, 1926, he announced to the legislature that the year's accounts had actually recorded a surplus of $188,019. [...] A second small surplus was recorded in 1926. [...] Securing control of natural resources and disposing of the railways were two elements of Brownlee's strategy for ensuring that these surpluses continued, but he also took other measures. [...] For example, on a trip to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1927, he met with international financiers in an effort to increase their confidence in the <b>creditworthiness</b> of his government.|$|E

2500|$|Against this {{background}} {{and in the}} wake of criticism of credit rating agencies following the subprime mortgage crisis, legislators in the United States and other jurisdictions have commenced to reduce rating reliance in laws and regulations. The 2010 Doddâ€“Frank Act [...] removes statutory references to credit rating agencies, and calls for federal regulators to review and modify existing regulations to avoid relying on credit ratings as the sole assessment of <b>creditworthiness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Credit scoring is {{not limited}} to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, {{insurance}} companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the <b>creditworthiness</b> of borrowers. Credit scoring also has much overlap with data mining, which uses many similar techniques. [...] These techniques combine thousands of factors but are similar or identical.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{a credit}} score {{is a number}} based on a {{statistical}} analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the <b>creditworthiness</b> of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills. [...] A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically {{from one of the}} three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. Income is not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating a credit score.|$|E
2500|$|CRAs provide [...] "surveillance" [...] (ongoing {{review of}} {{securities}} after their initial rating) and may change a security's rating {{if they feel}} its <b>creditworthiness</b> has changed. CRAs typically signal in advance their intention to consider rating changes. Fitch, Moody's, and S all use negative [...] "outlook" [...] notifications to indicate {{the potential for a}} downgrade within the next two years (one year in the case of speculative-grade credits). Negative [...] "watch" [...] notifications are used to indicate that a downgrade is likely within the next 90 days.|$|E
2500|$|Besides the {{government}} curve and the LIBOR curve, there are corporate (company) curves. These are constructed from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Since corporations have less <b>creditworthiness</b> than most governments and most large banks, these yields are typically higher. Corporate yield curves are often quoted {{in terms of}} a [...] "credit spread" [...] over the relevant swap curve. For instance the five-year yield curve point for Vodafone might be quoted as LIBOR +0.25%, where 0.25% (often written as 25 basis points or 25) is the credit spread.|$|E
