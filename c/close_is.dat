As a trainer with the Tigers he was named in the British National League All Star team for three years running from 1956 to 1958. He died on 4 October 1964 aged 63, when he suffered a heart attack, while refereeing a football charity match in aid of Sussex wicket keeper Jim Parks. He left behind a widow and one son. In 2004, {{he was elected to}} Manchester City's Hall of Fame. A street near Manchester City's former ground Maine Road, Sam Cowan <b>Close,</b> <b>is</b> named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Vicars' Chapel is {{rubble masonry}} however the south face {{which can be}} seen from the <b>close</b> <b>is</b> of white Conglomerate quarried locally. The shields on the wall are those of Nicholas Bubwith, {{suggesting}} that construction was started during his reign as bishop between 1407 and 1424, and John Stafford who was bishop from 1424 until 1443 suggesting that construction was completed under his episcopate. The lower floor was a chapel, and a spiral stair led up to the library. The chapel was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Katherine. It is now used by the chaplain of Wells Cathedral School. The interior is decorated with 19th century gesso work by Heywood Sumner.|$|E
5|$|School House, 70The Close, was {{formerly}} {{part of the}} Carnary college but now contains classrooms and school offices. While much of the building dates to around 1830, extensive 14th and 15th century features remain such as the stone entrance archway. The building, which is Grade I listed, adjoins the Erpingham Gate and is three storeys high and has eight bays. School End House, 69The <b>Close,</b> <b>is</b> a 17th-century timber-framed house built against {{the east end of}} the school chapel. Formerly a home, the Grade I listed building is now the senior common room for staff and a school office. The entrance is pilastered and is surrounded by lion-mask roundels. The Music School, 71The Close, was built in 1626–28 as a home for the prebendaries of the cathedral, funded by the chapter. Typical of the period, the Grade II* listed building was constructed from flint-rubble, brick, and reused materials from monastic buildings in the Close. It replaced an earlier house and incorporates the remains of a medieval free-standing bell tower originating in the 12th or 13th century, rebuilt around 1300 and largely demolished by 1580.|$|E

25|$|A platonic {{interpretation}} for {{the relationship}} between David and Jonathan has been the mainstream view found in biblical exegesis, as led by Christian writers. This argues that the relationship between the two, although strong and <b>close,</b> <b>is</b> ultimately a platonic friendship.

Following Lucy's death, Countess Close passed to her son, who then gave the land to Spalding Priory in 1147.|$|E
25|$|In Dark Magick Morgan was {{betrayed by}} the first boy she ever loved (Cal). Now Morgan must attempt {{to get on with}} her life. Morgan begins to study with Hunter, and slowly begins to realize her {{feelings}} for him. But dark magick seems to be surrounding them and someone <b>close</b> <b>is</b> to blame. Hunter and Morgan slowly start to get closer throughout the book. Hunter suspects that the dark magick is being used by David Redstone, owner of Practical Magick, and Morgan's friend. Morgan does everything she can to try and prove it was not him, but in the end, Hunter is right. The day before David gets stripped of his powers, Morgan and Hunter share a passionate kiss, and after Hunter strips David of his powers, he gives Morgan the stone Morganite, and it shows that Morgan is the thing/person that Hunter desires most in his heart.|$|E
25|$|The tramway {{began and}} ended with the oyster fishery from 1864 to 1884. So that cargo could begin its journey to Kent and London on a horse-tram, the tramway was built due south from the pier to the railway which had been built in 1861. This track, which was later to become Hampton Pier Avenue, was {{straightened}} at its northern end and raised above risk of flood for the tram. By 1866 the tracks were still not laid along the pier itself, {{but according to the}} OS map of 1878, it had been completed by then. At the southern end, the tramway curved westward, running beside Westbrook, and reached the railway line just east of the point where Westbrook crosses it, and to the west of where Hampton <b>Close</b> <b>is</b> today: see 1878 map, pictured. One Judah Downs won £900 in a dispute over land crossed by the tramway, and the company later bought him out as well. After the company went into liquidation, the tramway was removed in the 1880s. For much of the 20th century it was possible to see where the tramway reached the railway line.|$|E

He is also drafted by the {{mercenary}} group the Special Executive to save Saturnyne from a show trial, during which he witnessed the destruction of Earth-238's reality to prevent the Jaspers' Warp there from spreading out across the multiverse. He also encountered members of the pan-dimensional Captain Britain Corps, an organization of Captain Britains from various dimensions. However, he and his assembled allies were unable to prevent Earth-616's Jim Jaspers from expanding his influence over Earth, and though Brian fought bravely it fell to the Fury to kill the villain - Roma is of the opinion Merlyn intended all along for Brian to lead the Fury to Earth-616 to do this, but this was unconfirmed. Captain Britain also valiantly fights against the Fury, but although he comes <b>close,</b> <b>is</b> unable to best it.

The second category is composed of portraits of younger, more ethnically diverse artists including Zhang Huan, Sienna Shields and Pozsi B. Kolor. In these portraits, Close aimed to highlight the cultural diversity of New York City. He also has two self-portraits within the station.|$|E

500|$|Mona Penelope Simpson (née Olsen), {{voiced by}} Glenn <b>Close,</b> <b>is</b> Homer's {{deceased}} long-lost mother and Abe's estranged first wife. Her first major appearance was in [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] where she reveals {{that she was}} forced to abandon her family after being caught up in the hippie movement and participated in various acts of activism. The writers used this episode as an opportunity to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Prior to the seventh season, Mona Simpson had only made two brief flashback appearances, the first being season two's [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] and the second being season six's [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] and in both episodes she was voiced by Maggie Roswell. Mona dies in the episode [...] "Mona Leaves-a", as Homer struggles {{to come to terms with}} her death. The character is named after writer Richard Appel's wife, whose maiden name is Mona Simpson. Mona was designed in a way so that she has little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. Glenn Close recorded original material for another episode, season fifteen's [...] "My Mother the Carjacker". Mona also has a speaking appearance in season ten's [...] "D'oh-in in the Wind", this time voiced by Tress MacNeille.|$|E
500|$|The English {{zoologist}} Edward Bagnall Poulton studied animal coloration, especially camouflage. In his 1890 book The Colours of Animals, he classified {{different types}} such as [...] "special protective resemblance" [...] (where an animal looks like another object), or [...] "general aggressive resemblance" [...] (where a predator blends {{in with the}} background, enabling it to approach prey). His experiments showed that swallowtailed moth pupae were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as larvae. Poulton's [...] "general protective resemblance" [...] {{was at that time}} considered to be the main method of camouflage, as when Frank Evers Beddard wrote in 1892 that [...] "tree-frequenting animals are often green in colour. Among vertebrates numerous species of parrots, iguanas, tree-frogs, and the green tree-snake are examples". Beddard did however briefly mention other methods, including the [...] "alluring coloration" [...] of the flower mantis and the possibility of a different mechanism in the orange tip butterfly. He wrote that [...] "the scattered green spots upon the under surface of the wings might have been intended for a rough sketch of the small flowerets of the plant , so <b>close</b> <b>is</b> their mutual resemblance." [...] He also explained the coloration of sea fish such as the mackerel: [...] "Among pelagic fish it is common to find the upper surface dark-coloured and the lower surface white, so that the animal is inconspicuous when seen either from above or below." ...|$|E
