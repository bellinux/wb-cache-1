5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was <b>completely</b> <b>wrong,</b> and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{confidence}} {{that he had}} the right solution to the murder mystery, Chibnall admitted to getting cold feet about the ending. Minutes before episode eight was to air in April 2013, he called executive producer Jane Featherstone and, in a panicked voice, told her that he'd got the ending <b>completely</b> <b>wrong.</b> Twenty minutes later, he calmed down and realised the ending was fine as is.|$|E

A lot of the other parts were things that had been started and were on a certain route, so they had to continue. But you can still direct them in a certain way. But I really like that last episode." ...|$|R

Pytheas however could not then answer for himself, or protect his own work from loss or alteration, so most of the questions concerning his voyage remain unresolved, to be worked over by every generation. To some he is a daring adventurer and discoverer; to others, a semi-legendary blunderer or prevaricator.|$|E
25|$|Dahl {{was rescued}} {{and taken to}} a first-aid post in Mersa Matruh, where he regained consciousness, but not his sight, and was then taken by train to the Royal Navy {{hospital}} in Alexandria. There he fell {{in and out of}} love with a nurse, Mary Welland. An RAF inquiry into the crash revealed that the location to which he had been told to fly was <b>completely</b> <b>wrong,</b> and he had mistakenly been sent instead to the no man's land between the Allied and Italian forces.|$|E
25|$|The AFE zone is {{reported}} to be located at or near the deepest point on the anterior wall of the vagina, above the cervix, where the anterior wall of the vagina starts to curve upward (the entrance to the anterior fornix), but some websites and news articles have described it as being on the posterior wall of the vagina, roughly opposite of the G-spot. Dr. Chua Chee Ann stated in an interview that this is <b>completely</b> <b>wrong.</b> Some believe that this area may be a different erogenous zone altogether.|$|E

5000|$|According to Barrie, {{she argued}} daily with the soap's {{producers}} {{about the way}} the storyline was being written, accusing them of being medically inaccurate: [...] "Cervical cancer takes years to develop. No consultant would make a pronouncement as quickly as that. And no woman would have reached that stage without severe symptoms, which Alma didn't have. I felt straightaway that it gave <b>completely</b> the <b>wrong</b> message. And I know that as the storyline has developed, a number of medical experts have spoken out against it. That didn't surprise me one bit." ...|$|R
25|$|Several {{subsequent}} excavations {{followed through}} the 1960s, funded by generous {{grants from the}} National Geographic Society. On their return in 1967, Drucker and Heizer saw that, as others had already claimed, the vegetation previously covering the mound, {{as well as their}} own assumptions, had led to them previously publishing a <b>completely</b> <b>wrong</b> account of its shape. It was in fact a round fluted cone with ten ridges and depressions around it, rather than the sloping rectangle, leading to a flat platform that they had assumed. Possibly the shape was intended to match or represent the mountains nearby. They also obtained better carbon samples in order to achieve one of the key goals of the excavation of La Venta—proving that the Olmec were a distinct and separate culture that pre-dates the first Maya settlements.|$|E
25|$|Each {{contestant}} that auditions {{is given}} a number by the production team and remains in the waiting area until called out into the wings, giving them {{a certain amount of}} time to prepare their act. Upon being allowed onto the main stage, they will usually be asked by one of the judges for their name and what they plan to perform, along with other details such as age, occupation, personal background, and what they wish to achieve if they won. After this, they are then given three minutes to conduct their performance before both the judges and a live audience, with some acts being supported by a backing track provided by the production team. If at any time, the judges find the performance to be unconvincing, boring or <b>completely</b> <b>wrong,</b> they may use the buzzer before them, which changes the Xs from white to red; if all the judges press their buzzers, then the performance is immediately over.|$|E
25|$|The raid was {{ultimately}} a failure as {{none of the}} objectives were achieved by the British. No casualties were inflicted upon the Germans, no prisoners were taken and the only damage inflicted was a cut telephone line. Additionally, {{the quality of the}} planning and conduct of the operation has been called into question. Much of the equipment used was either not servicable—faulty compasses, and motor launches that broke down—or inadequate for the job and launches that were unable to come all the way into the beach due to their draught. Also some of the tasks that had been assigned were impractical or had not been rehearsed—the wire intended for use as a road block was too heavy to carry from the beach—and intelligence relating to German dispositions upon the island was at best outdated or <b>completely</b> <b>wrong.</b> The commandos also found they were burdened with equipment that was not of use, including steel helmets, gaiters and an excess of ammunition. Largely this {{was the result of the}} haste with which the operation had been conceived and then put together, but it was also indicative of the embryonic status of the raiding and commandos concept.|$|E

He called it [...] "the worst judgement in the history of F1", saying, [...] "It's absolutely unacceptable when three influence the championship like this". Three-time {{world champion}} Jackie Stewart said that [...] "F1 attracts the largest capital investment in sport, but it's being overseen by people who are not doing it full-time and we get inconsistent decisions".|$|E
500|$|We {{wanted to}} make a {{specific}} story about two people—Meg and Dom—not a video that was representative of all couples or all domestic violence situations. I'm not saying that all couples fight this way.

Megan was the key to this video.... I'll tell you as a director the reason why [...] scenes in the video feel so real is because in the moment they were real.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the weather}} had {{abruptly}} become dark and rainy, and Dick and Anne are directed only with the vaguest “ar”s when they request directions, besides being confused by ringing bells whose meaning they cannot decipher. The two children take <b>completely</b> the <b>wrong</b> route, and upon seeing a light, run to meet a completely deaf old woman. Assuming it must be Blue Pond Farm-House, Dick and Anne go in but the old woman, called Mrs. Taggart, bluntly announces they must leave because her son would not accept either of them. However, once Dick manages to communicate Mrs. Taggart agrees to let Anne stay in a remote loft whilst Dick makes do with sleeping in the barn.|$|R
2500|$|Sturgeon {{met with}} new UK Prime Minister Theresa May in Edinburgh on 15 July 2016 after the latter {{had made it}} clear that UK unity was a high priority. Afterwards, Sturgeon said that [...] "It would be inconceivable for any prime {{minister}} to seek to {{stand in the way of}} a referendum if that is what the Scottish Parliament voted for ... if there's a clear sense that that's what people in Scotland want, would be <b>completely</b> the <b>wrong</b> thing to do."

Domestic violence is a major problem and the cause of pain and misery for many families. This man has spouted questionable opinions and gets rewarded."

500|$|Keč {{was charged}} with three {{criminal}} offenses: the hijacking itself, and fraud and forgery related to attempting to take out 50,000 Norwegian krone from a friend's bank account. He had confessed the crime and several witnesses could confirm he had committed the crime. The incident was the second court case in Norway regarding hijacking, after Braathens SAFE Flight 139 had been hijacked by a drunk in 1985. The law permitted a sentence from 2 to 21 years prison. On 16 June 1995, Keč was sentenced to four years prison by Eidsivating Court of Appeal. After receiving the sentence, he stated to the press: [...] "I regret hijacking the aircraft. I have apologized to the victims. Hijacking an aircraft was a <b>completely</b> <b>wrong</b> way to create attention for the situation in Bosnia." ...|$|E

In 2010, in an interview on BBC Radio 1, Williams elaborated, [...] "'It is one of those situations in life that could be very explosive and could go <b>completely</b> <b>wrong.</b> We had that big chat and the most amazing thing happened at the end of it.

[...] "I {{want to tell the}} Chinese authorities and Xi Jinping, the president of China, that you are wrong. <b>Completely</b> <b>wrong.</b> You better release the five guys. Let them go back home". American and European associations of publishers and booksellers – including PEN American Center, the Authors Guild and the Federation of European Publishers – jointly wrote to CY Leung, urging him to take action on the missing Causeway Bay booksellers and [...] "request a formal assurance from Beijing that it will respect Hong Kong's autonomy and abide by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration".|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, UFC {{president}} Dana White {{accused him}} of [...] "sucking {{the life out of}} the sport (boxing) and not putting anything back in." [...] Amongst White's criticisms were that Arum had created a weak undercard for the De La Hoya-Mayweather fight in 2007 saying Arum did not promote the show correctly. [...] "He promoted that show <b>completely</b> the <b>wrong</b> way, because he worried about the money as opposed to trying to secure the future", White said. [...] "He should have stacked that card. He should have had Shane Mosley and Bernard Hopkins and (Marco Antonio) Barrera and Winky Wright on there and used it to show that boxing is back". Arum responded by saying that MMA fighters need to examine the revenues being generated and ask why the UFC wasn't paying them more.|$|R

500|$|Liu was {{nominated}} by International PEN, the worldwide association of writers. Interested in Western philosophy, Liu made {{his reputation as}} a literary critic with a treatise on the state of modern Chinese literature: an article he published in 1986 that criticised Chinese writers for their dependence on the state, and their deficit in free-thinking, caused a stir in the Chinese literary world. His challenging ideas caught the attention of the intellectuals; he lectured all over China and abroad. He was in New York when the 1989 pro-democracy movement erupted in China; he returned immediately to China and {{spent most of his time}} amongst the protesters in Tiananmen Square. This, and his subsequent leadership role in the Charter 08 pro-democracy manifesto for China, led the Chinese authorities to censor his views as subversive. Liu was jailed for 11 years on 25 December 2009, for [...] "inciting subversion of state power." [...] A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said [...] "It would be <b>completely</b> <b>wrong</b> for the Nobel Prize committee to award the prize to [...] ". In January 2010, Václav Havel and others—including the 14th Dalai Lama, André Glucksmann, Vartan Gregorian, New Zealand politician Mike Moore, Karel Schwarzenberg, Desmond Tutu and Grigory Yavlinsky—published an article endorsing Liu. A professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Xu Youyu, and others, addressed an open letter [...] "to the European People" [...] in support of Liu, while 14 exiled dissidents urged the Nobel Committee to pass over Liu's nomination, arguing that Liu had maligned other dissidents, forsaken the oppressed Falun Gong and that his stance against the Chinese leadership had become too [...] "soft".|$|E
