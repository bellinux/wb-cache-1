50|$|Telescoping {{caseless}} rounds {{must also}} {{deal with the}} issue of blocking the bore, as the bullet is surrounded by propellant. The booster charge is used to address this issue, providing an initial burst of pressure to force the bullet out of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>body</b> and into the barrel before the body combusts.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]375 H&H Magnum case {{design was}} {{conceived}} to use cordite; a stick type propellant used widely in the United Kingdom. The tapering <b>cartridge</b> <b>body</b> {{design and the}} small shallow shoulder are typical aspects of cartridges optimized {{for the use of}} this propellant. An advantage of such a case design is that it will feed and extract smoothly thus contributing to the cartridge's reliability in the field.|$|E
5000|$|Caseless rounds {{are limited}} {{by the fact that}} the <b>cartridge</b> <b>body</b> is {{primarily}} a propellant, and structural properties are secondary to the combustion properties. The primary issue is one of extraction. While caseless ammunition eliminates the need to extract a fired case, unfired caseless rounds must be extractable to unload the firearm or to clear a misfire. With metallic cases, this ability is provided by a rim or extractor groove machined into the rear of the case. Even in completely plastic bodied cartridges, such as the Activ brand shotgun shells, a thin metal ring is molded into the rim to provide support for the extractor. [...] A secondary issue is that ammunition in use can be exposed to air, water, lubricants, and solvents. Primer and propellant in caseless rounds is unprotected, while cartridge cases provide a high degree of protection.|$|E
50|$|Coupled to the tonearm, the <b>cartridge</b> <b>body's</b> {{function}} {{is to give the}} moving parts a stationary platform so that they can track the groove with precision.|$|R
50|$|Marley Natural offers three {{categories}} of goods: cannabis (whole flower, pre-rolls, and oil <b>cartridges),</b> <b>body</b> care products, and lifestyle accessories including smoking accessories. Marley Natural body care and smoking accessories are available online and at select retailers across the United States. Cannabis is available in California, Oregon, and Washington state. The brand launched in February 2016 on the 71st anniversary of Bob Marley's birthday and celebrated the event at an exclusive event in the Hollywood Hills that was featured in Rolling Stone magazine.|$|R
60|$|The {{accusation}} of murder {{for the death}} of the philanthropist was withdrawn by common consent. Damages in error were awarded to Hayloft for the loss of his revolver and <b>cartridges.</b> The main <b>body</b> of the case was carried on a writ of certiorari to the Federal Courts and appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The novel {{method of}} {{charging}} the 1911 could be potentially lethal if done incorrectly. Shotgun cartridges of the time were often made of paper, which could make the <b>cartridge</b> <b>body</b> vulnerable to expansion when exposed to moisture in large quantities. If this happened in the 1911, the barrel {{would have to be}} cycled in order to open the chamber so that the swelled shotgun shell could be removed. Some users mistakenly cycled the barrel by placing the butt of the weapon against the ground and forcing the barrel down. In this position, the muzzle of the weapon would be pointing towards the face of the user, and the swelled shell could fire, injuring or killing the user. This safety issue led to the Model 1911 being nicknamed [...] "the Widowmaker". This situation could be avoided with adherence to safety procedures common to handling firearms, in particular, the practice of keeping the weapon pointed in a safe direction at all times.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum is {{a member}} of the Remington Ultra Magnum {{cartridge}} family based on the [...]404 Jeffery via the Canadian Magnum cartridges. As these <b>cartridges</b> feature wider <b>bodies</b> than the belted magnums based on the [...]375 H case, these cartridges have greater case capacities than their corresponding full length belted Magnum cartridges such as the 7 mm Shooting Times Westerner, the [...]300 Weatherby Magnum, [...]340 Weatherby Magnum and the [...]375 Ackley Improved.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]450 Ackley Magnum was {{designed}} in 1960 by Parker Otto Ackley. The [...]450 Ackley Magnum {{can be considered}} an improved cartridge {{in comparison with the}} [...]458 Lott. The <b>cartridge</b> has minimum <b>body</b> taper ending with a small shoulder. Case capacity and performance is slightly greater than that of the [...]458 Lott resulting in less 50 ft/s in velocity at equal pressures. Chamber will accept the Lott and Watts cartridges. The [...]458 Winchester Magnum can be fired in the chamber in an emergency. The [...]450 Barnes supreme cannot be fired in the chamber of the [...]450 Ackley as there are minute dimensional differences which may prevent the cartridge from chambering. A-Square currently loads this cartridge with a [...] bullet at 2400 ft/s.|$|R
40|$|Positive-ion {{electron}} impact (PIEI), positive-ion {{chemical ionization}} (PICI) and negative-ion chemical ionization (NICI) mass spectra are presented for six pyrazolones and four pyrazolidines, and their fragmentation modes have been analyzed. In the PIEI mode, molecular ions were relatively intense for most compounds. Peaks at m/z 56 and 77 appeared in common for pyrazolones and peaks at m/z 77 and 183 in common for pyrazolidines. In the PICI mode, [M + 1]+ quasi-molecular ions constituted base peaks for most compounds. Common peaks at m/z 56 and 120 appeared for pyrazolones and peaks at m/z 120 for pyrazolidines. In the NICI mode, pyrazolones gave both molecular and [M - 1]-quasi-molecular anions except dipyrone, and common peaks at m/z 106. For pyrazolidines, molecular or quasi-molecular anions were small or missing except for ketophenylbutazone. A rapid extraction procedure with Sep-Pak C 18 <b>cartridges</b> from human <b>body</b> fluids of these compounds and their detection by wide-bore capillary gas chromatography (GC) were also presented. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|R
