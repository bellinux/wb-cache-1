25|$|Cadillac is {{also known}} as Chestnut Town, USA. The local area is home to a {{relatively}} large number of American chestnut trees, planted by pioneers from New York and Pennsylvania who settled in western Michigan. A blight in the early 20th century wiped out nearly every American <b>Chestnut</b> <b>tree,</b> but those in western Michigan developed a mysterious resistance and survived.|$|E

25|$|Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford– {{former members}} of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the {{original}} leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the <b>Chestnut</b> <b>Tree</b> Café—with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, {{in the course of his}} editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a memory hole. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.|$|E

25|$|As climate warmed further around 3,000 B.C., beech, walnut, hickories, chestnut, and {{butternut}} grew. These trees produced nuts {{for feeding}} Archaic hunters; Archaic Indian populations grew more rapidly. As populations grew, large families became small tribes in various areas. During {{this time the}} 12 prominent hardwood tree species of Eastern North America existed in Warren County, which were Ash, Beech, Birch, Cherry, Chestnut, Elm, Hickory, Maple, Oak, Sweet Gum, Sycamore, and Walnut. The <b>Chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> is now extinct in Warren County, following the Chestnut blight that decimated the eastern U.S. in the earlier twentieth century. The Archaic period lasted from 8000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.|$|E
25|$|Sicily is an often-quoted {{example of}} {{man-made}} deforestation, which has occurred since Roman times, when {{the island was}} turned into an agricultural region. This gradually dried the climate, leading {{to a decline in}} rainfall and the drying of rivers. The central and southwest provinces are practically devoid of any forest. In Northern Sicily, there are three important forests; near Mount Etna, in the Nebrodi Mountains and in the Bosco della Ficuzza's Natural Reserve near Palermo. The Nebrodi Mountains Regional Park, established on 4 August 1993 and covering , is the largest protected natural area of Sicily; and contains the largest forest in Sicily, the Caronia. The Hundred Horse Chestnut (Castagno dei Cento Cavalli), in Sant'Alfio, on the eastern slopes of Mount Etna, is the largest and oldest known <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> in the world at 2,000 – 4,000 years old.|$|E
25|$|La Nausée allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin is the classic existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from staring at a crumpled piece of paper in the gutter to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, the nausea appears more and more frequently, though he is still unsure of what it actually signifies. However, at the base of a <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> in a park, he receives a piercingly clear vision of what the nausea actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} the park, and in turn also its flora and fauna, is largely typical for mountainous regions of the eastern Mid-Atlantic woodland, and indeed {{a large portion of}} common species are typical of {{ecosystems}} at lower altitudes as well. On southwestern faces of some of the southernmost hillsides pine predominates and there is also the occasional prickly pear cactus, which grows naturally. In contrast, some of the northeastern aspects are most likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Other commonly found plants include oak, hickory, chestnut, maple, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The once predominant American <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> was effectively brought to extinction by a fungus known as the chestnut blight during the 1930s – though the tree continues to grow in the park, it does not reach maturity and dies back before it can reproduce. Various species of oaks superseded the chestnuts and became the dominant tree species. Gypsy moth infestations beginning in the early 1990s began to erode the dominance of the oak forests as the moths would primarily consume the leaves of oak trees. Though the Gypsy moths seem to have abated some, they continue to affect the forest and have destroyed almost 10 percent of the oak groves.|$|E

Kyle Darren, the caricature of Luke Perry star of Beverly Hills, 90210, appears as well. Mayor Quimby uses the phrase [...] "May the Force be with you" [...] from the Star Wars franchise, confusing it with Nimoy's work on Star Trek (and—at the same time—believing Nimoy to have been [...] "one of The Little Rascals").

500|$|In November 2007, the Anne Frank tree—by then {{infected}} with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk—was {{scheduled to be}} cut down {{to prevent it from}} falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist Arnold Heertje said about the tree: [...] "This is not just any tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews." [...] The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the horse chestnut, which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution. The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years. However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree. Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. Saplings were also sent to a school in Little Rock, Arkansas that was the scene of a desegregation battle, Liberty Park (Manhattan), which honours victims of the September 11 attacks, and other sites in the United States. Another horse <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> honoring Frank was planted in 2010 at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham, Alabama.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree" [...] ("Under the {{spreading}} <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree,</b> I sold you, and you sold me") {{was based on}} an old English song called [...] "Go no more a-rushing" [...] ("Under {{the spreading}} <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree,</b> Where I knelt upon my knee, We were as happy as could be, 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree."). The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching your chest when you sing [...] "chest", and touching your head when you sing [...] "nut"). Glenn Miller recorded the song in 1939.|$|E
