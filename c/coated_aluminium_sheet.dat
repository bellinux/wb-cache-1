The roughening behavior of <b>coated</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> can substantially differ from that of uncoated sheets of the same substrate material owing to the mechanical properties of the coatings.

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} of metal components both wear and corrosion {{have to be}} considered. In particular, corrosion is a primary problem in the aeronautic field, where the aluminium alloys are affected by several corrosion typologies. Furthermore, nowadays carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) are finding an increasing use, but they can induce galvanic corrosion phenomena when coupled with aluminium alloys. To overcome this problem, corrosion resistant coatings are used on aluminium components. On these premises, the realization of a titanium <b>coating</b> on <b>aluminium</b> components could allow the coupling of CFRP and aluminium alloys, improving the corrosion resistance. Cold Spray Deposition is a recent technology to realize these coatings. This technology allows the production of near fully dense coatings on metallic surfaces. In many applications the <b>coated</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets</b> have to be machined (cut or drilled). Machining with conventional cutting methods leads to both tool wear and damages in the coating. Laser cutting represents a promising alternative: it does not involve any mechanical cutting force or tool wear and, thanks to the small laser beam spot, it allows to realize complex shapes. In this paper, laser cutting of an Al alloy sheet (0. 6 mm thick) coated with Ti Alloy, was studied. The adopted laser source was a 150 W, lamp pumped Nd:YAG, specifically developed for micro-machining operations on metals. During the tests, the process parameters (cutting speed, pulse duration and entrance side) were changed and the kerf geometry was analysed {{as a function of}} the process parameters...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the reflective properties of titania (TiO 2) nanoparticle-based coating. Design/methodology/approach – TiO 2 nanoparticles, synthesised by sol-gel method, were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis). The coating material has been prepared by dispersing titania nanoparticles in an acrylic binder with different pigment to binder weight ratio. The reflectors were prepared by applying this coating material to different <b>coating</b> thicknesses to <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheets.</b> Findings – In the study reported here, the coating material could produce reflectors with diffuse reflectance, 99 per cent, using coating material, having binder by weight ratio between 14 and 20 per cent, and thickness, 0. 15 ?mm. On exposing the developed reflectors to different levels of illumination (upto 20, 000 lux), they were still found to have diffuse reflectance of more than 96 per cent almost throughout the visible spectrum. Practical implications – The fabricated reflectors find applications in commercial optical products, such as: reflective panels, luminaries, etc. Originality/value – As of today, the reflective coatings used are of conventional type, which employ bulk TiO 2 particles. In this study, we are reporting TiO 2 nanoparticle-based highly reflective coating.

40|$|FSS) for radar {{absorbing}} materials (RAM) are increasing, but it {{is still}} a challenge to select a proper FSS for a particular material as well as the dimensions of FSS for optimized absorption. Therefore, in this paper an attempt has been made to optimize the dimensions of FSS for microwave absorbing application using Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. The considered frequency selective surfaces are composed of conducting patch elements pasted on the ferrite layer. FSS are used for filtration and microwave absorption. In this work, selection and optimization of FSS with radar absorbing material has been done for obtaining the maximum absorption at 8 – 12 GHz frequency. An equivalent circuit method has been used for the analysis of different FSS, which is further used to design fitness function of GA for optimizing the dimensions of FSS. Eight different available ferrite materials with frequency dependant permittivities and permeabilities have been used as material database. The GA optimization is proposed to select the proper material out of eight available materials with proper dimensions of FSS. The optimized results suggest the material from database and dimensions of FSS. The selected material is then mixed with epoxy and hardener, and <b>coated</b> over the <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet.</b> Thereafter, all five FSS were fabricated on ferrite coated Al sheets using photolithographic method followed by wet etching. The absorption was measured for all FSS using absorption testing device (ATD) method at X-band.

40|$|Abstract. During the thermo-mechanical {{processing}} of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> products in commercial production lines the material experiences a complex history of temperature, time and strain paths, which result in alternating cycles of deformation and recrystallization {{with the associated}} changes in microstructure and, especially, crystallographic texture. Thus, computer-based alloy and process development requires integration of models for simulating the evolution of microstructure, microchemistry and crystallographic texture into process models of the thermo-mechanical production of Al sheet. In the present paper the influence of texture on the anisotropic properties is explored for various industrially processed <b>aluminium</b> alloy <b>sheets</b> for packaging applications. Besides the use of experimentally measured sheet textures as an input for the anisotropy calculations, particular attention {{is given to the}} use of modelled textures. Here, results from a comprehensive through-process modelling of the texture evolution during the thermo-mechanical production of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> are utilized. Eventually, this will enable us to predict the evolution of texture and the resulting properties along the entire process chain and hence to improve product quality of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> products avoiding laborious and expensive plant trials...|$|R

However, aluminium to copper joined by thermal welding processes presents challenges in terms of achieving good joint quality. This is attributed to their dissimilar mechanical and thermal properties which result in large stress gradients during heating. This study investigated joining of <b>aluminium</b> to copper <b>sheets</b> by electromagnetic pulse welding, which is a solid-state process that uses electromagnetic forces for joining of dissimilar materials. Hybrid sheet welds were obtained for all parameters conditions, selected according to a Taguchi L 18 design. The structural and mechanical characteristics were examined and related to the welding parameters {{by means of a}} Pareto analysis and response graphs. The welded zone started with a wavy interface with interfacial layers and defects and evolved to a flat interface without interfacial layers. The maximum transferable force depended on the minimum specimen thickness and the strength of the hybrid sheet weld. In case of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness reduction, the maximum transferable force was linearly correlated with the <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness. High quality joints were obtained for no <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness reduction and for a sheet weld strength which was at least as high as that of the base material. The most effective way to increase the transferable force was to lower the initial gap and to increase the free length, which resulted in no <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness reduction. Alternatively, the use of a rounded spacer decreased the effect of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness on the transferable force. An increase in weld width was achieved for an increase in capacitor charging energy and gap, whereas an increase in weld length was obtained for a decrease in gap. An increase in weld width did not necessarily result in an increase in the transferable force. In the regarded cases, a hybrid sheet with narrow weld width could therefore have higher quality...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCrack {{propagation}} and deviation during trimming of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{have been}} analysed experimentally and modelled by a {{finite element analysis}} (FEA). The experimental results may be summarized as follows. Two crack propagation mechanisms operate in <b>aluminium</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, i. e. either between adjacent voids or by multiple coalescence of micro-cracks. A fracture process-zone may be identified for both mechanisms. Outside this fracture process-zone, no damage is observed. The particular crack propagation mechanism does not influence the crack path. A mechanical model based on a two steps analysis is presented. In the first step, the overall stress strain field prior to cracking is determined by an explicit Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation based FEA. In the second step, dedicated to crack propagation, no remeshing is used. A cumulative damage model based on the equivalent plastic strain increment is shown to be very efficient.
