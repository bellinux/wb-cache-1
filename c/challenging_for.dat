5|$|After <b>challenging</b> <b>for</b> a Canucks roster spot {{once again}} during the team's 2010 {{training}} camp, Hodgson {{was assigned to the}} Manitoba Moose. He scored his first regular season AHL goal against goaltender Peter Delmas of the Hamilton Bulldogs on October 22, 2010. With the score tied 3–3 after overtime, Hodgson added a shootout goal to help the Moose win the game. Later, in December 2010, Hodgson suffered a broken orbital bone after he was high-sticked by teammate Lee Sweatt during a Moose practice. Eight days after returning to Manitoba's line-up, Hodgson earned his first NHL call-up to Vancouver.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} suggested that evolutionary considerations generate an epistemological <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> moral realism. At first approximation, the <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> the moral realist is to explain our having many true moral beliefs, given that those beliefs are {{the products of}} evolutionary forces that would be indifferent to the moral truth. An important question surrounding this challenge {{is the extent to}} which it generalizes. In particular, it is of interest whether the Evolutionary <b>Challenge</b> <b>for</b> moral realism is equally a <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> mathematical realism. It is widely thought not to be. In this paper, I argue that the Evolutionary <b>Challenge</b> <b>for</b> moral realism is equally a <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> mathematical realism. Along the way, I substantially clarify the Evolutionary Challenge, discuss its relation to more familiar epistemological challenges, and broach a number of foundational issues in metaphysics. The paper should be of interest to ethicists because it places pressure on anyone who rejects moral realism on the basis of the Evolutionary Challenge to reject mathematical realism as well. And the paper should be of interest to philosophers of mathematics because it presents a new epistemological <b>challenge</b> <b>for</b> mathematical realism that bears, I argue, no simple relation to Paul Benacerraf's familiar challenge...|$|R
5|$|After this shaky {{beginning}} in the professional ranks, Gomez had a run of victories from September 1997 to February 1999. During this period Gomez won seven straight fights before <b>challenging</b> <b>for</b> his first title belt, the vacant British Central Area featherweight title against Chris Jickells on 27 February 1999 in Oldham. Gomez won the title with a fifth-round knockout. He followed his first title win by adding another championship, the IBF Inter-Continental featherweight title, with a second-round knockout over Nigel Leake.|$|E

5|$|A late Benny Cross goal gave Burnley a 1–0 {{win over}} Manchester United at Turf Moor, {{extending}} the team's unbeaten record to 30matches. In the next match, Burnley lost a league fixture {{for the first}} time since 4 September 1920 when they were beaten 0–3 by Manchester City at Hyde Road. City were also <b>challenging</b> <b>for</b> the league title and eventually finished as runners-up. More than 37,000 spectators attended the match and several people were injured as the stadium became overcrowded. Burnley followed up the setback with successive wins over Manchester City and Manchester United to take the total number of league wins in the season to 23.

With Stockport already bottom of the league, a 4–0 home defeat to Millwall saw manager Kilner sacked. Former England international Carlton Palmer was appointed in November 2001.
