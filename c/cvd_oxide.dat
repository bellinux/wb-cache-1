50|$|The {{choice of}} source gas {{depends on the}} thermal {{stability}} of the substrate; for instance, aluminium is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500 °C, dichlorosilane at around 900 °C, and TEOS between 650 and 750 °C, resulting in a layer of low- temperature oxide (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower dielectric strength, for instance), and it deposits nonconformally. Any of these reactions {{may be used in}} LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> invariably has lower quality than thermal oxide, but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} {{published}} {{studies on the}} prepara-tion of Si-rich SiO 2 (1 - 7) and SigN 4 (6 - 11) films. An early report (5) on chemically vapor deposited (CVD) Si-rich SiO 2 films described the material as "semi-insulating, " because the material displayed an elec-trical conductivity intermediate between SiO 2 and Si. The implication is that the bandgap of the material is also intermediate and therefore that a homogeneity range exists in this system. Work at our laboratory (6) showed evidence that both Si-rich SiO 2 and SigN 4 are composed of two phases: silicon and either oxide or nitride. Later studies (7, 12) on Si-rich SiOz supported the multi-phase proposition but also sug-gested that the oxide phase is something other than normal CVD SiO 2. In the present study, our trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM), and x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) observations are pre-sented as a comparison of stoichi 0 metric and Si-rich SiO ~ and Si 3 N 4 films. From this comparison of CVD films, we conclude that the Si-rich films are indeed two phase materials: one phase Si and the other either normal <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> or nitride. The nature of the so-called normal <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> and nitride is not addressed in this study. Experimental Procedures CVD was used to prepare 100 nm films for this study.

40|$|Abstract. Deposited oxide is an {{attractive}} gate oxide due to absence of carbon at the MOS interface. We fabricated and characterized Si-face 4 H-SiC n-MOS capacitors and n-channel MOSFETs with <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> annealed in NO at 1250 o C and compared to those with dry thermal oxide. Nitrogen and carbon distribution in the oxide was evaluated by SIMS. The CVD/NO sample has lower interface state density near the conduction band edge, higher nitrogen concentration at the interface and lower carbon concentration in the oxide than the Dry/NO sample. Channel mobility of 27. 7 cm 2 /Vs was obtained for the CVD/NO sample, which {{is higher than the}} Dry/NO sample (24. 9 cm 2 /Vs). These MOSFET performances are correlated with the results of n-MOS capacitors and SIMS measurements...|$|E

Transmission structures fabricated on GPSOI, where the ground plane was locally grounded electrically, exhibited 50 dB to 30 dB increased isolation over a frequency range of 500 MHz to 50 GHz compared to standard low resistivity (15 to 20 Ù cm) SOI substrates where no buried ground plane existed. The GPSOI exhibited over 25 dB increased isolation over the same frequency range compared to published data for high resistivity (200 Ù cm) SOI substrates with no buried ground plane but where capacitive guard rings were used. substrate,crosstalk,isolatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Phosphorous {{implanted}} n+/p diodes {{have been}} included in the masks for manufacturing n-MOSFET devices and processed in the same way of source/drain regions. The diode junctions were made by a P+ implantation at 300 °C and a post implantation annealing at 1300 °C. The diode emitter area was protected by 0. 6 µm thick <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> during the processing of the MOSFET gate oxide. Three gate oxide processes were taken into account: two of them include a N implantation before a wet oxidation, while the third one was a standard oxidation. Considering the effect on the n+/p diodes, the main difference among the processes were the wet thermal oxidation time that ranged between 180 and 480 min at a temperature of 1100 °C. The diode current-voltage characteristics show similar forward but different reverse curves in the temperature range of 25 - 290 °C. Differences in reverse bias voltage {{as a function of the}} measurement temperature have been analyzed and are related to the different gate oxidation time. A correlation between the shortest oxidation time and the lower leakage current is presented...|$|E

This sequence was analyzed as to yield and cost and {{these data suggest that}} the price goals of 1986 are attainable. Specifically, it was shown that a low cost POCL 3 is a suitable replacement for the semiconductor grade, and that a suitable <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> can be deposited from a silane/air mixture using a Silox reactor. A dip coating method was developed for depositing an antireflection coating from a metalorganic precursor. Application of photoresist to define contact grids was made cost effective through use of a dip coating technique. Electroplating of both Ag and Cu was shown feasible and cost effective for producing the conductive metal grids on the solar cells. Laser scribing was used to separate the cells from the dendrites without degradation. Ultrasonic welding methods were shown to be feasible for interconnecting the cells.

40|$|Silicon {{quantum dots}} have been {{deposited}} {{on top of}} a 3 -nm tunnel oxide by Low Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (LPCVD) and coated with a 7 -nm Chemical Vapour Deposited (<b>CVD)</b> <b>oxide.</b> This stack was then incorporated in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor structure and used as floating gate of a memory cell. The presence of 3 nm of tunnel oxides allows the injection of the charge by direct tunnel (DT) using low voltages for both program and erase operations. The charge stored in the quantum dots is able to produce a well-detectable flat band shift in the capacitors or, equivalently, a threshold voltage shift in the transistors. Furthermore, due to the presence of SiO 2 between the grains, the lateral charge loss is reduced and, thus, long retention time are possible. In this work we present good memory action characterised by low write voltages, write times of the order of milliseconds and long retention time in spite of the low tunnel oxide thickness. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Silicon-on-insulator {{devices have}} {{problems}} with both performance and cost. We developed three advanced evices on bonded SOI produced using pulse-field-assisted bonding and selective polishing {{in an attempt to}} solve these problems. We tightly bonded highly implanted wafers, epitaxial wafers, and wafers covered with smoothed <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> at emperatures below 1000 ~ We uniformly thinned bonded wafers by grinding, polishing, resistivity-sensitive etching, or selective polishing. We formed buried layers and buried electrodes by bonding and polishing techniques. Our high speed epitaxial-base transistor on 1 -~m thick SOI has a cutoff frequency of 32 GHz. Our lateral bipolar transistor with a thin base on 0. 15 -~m thick SOI had a cutoff frequency of 4 GHz. A double-gate MOSFET on 60 -nm thick SOI had a transconductance of more than twice that of a conventional SOI MOSFET. This paper discusses further advantages of bonded SOI techniques. Silicon-on-insulator (SOi) technology based on wafer bonding is an emerging technology for high-performance integrated circuits. The most useful SOI properties are {{a direct result of the}} ability to provide total electrical isola-tion.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{applications}} would benefit from MEMS devices that can produce very strong electrical fields with high potential differences; in particular the production and acceleration of ions or charged droplets for spacecraft or biomedical applications. We have carried out investigations into the use of silicon dioxide as an insulator in MEMS devices designed for such applications. The work focuses on axisymmetric electrode configurations that produce 10 8 V/m electrical fields close to the axis, in vacuum. To accelerate ions to high velocities (&# 62; 100 m/s) potentials of over 1 kV are required. MOS devices, consisting of aluminium insulated from the silicon substrate by SiO 2, were produced {{with a number of}} different geometries. Thermal oxides of 2 m thickness and thermal oxides augmented by 2 m of <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> were tested for the maximum voltage held before permanent destruction. The insulator surface between two electrodes placed 50 m apart, successfully held voltages of over 3 kV without surface flashover. We have shown that breakdown occurred through the oxide with a mean hold-off voltage of 1340 V for 2 m oxides and 2960 V for 4 m oxides. In the course of the experiments, we have found the importance of chip cleanliness, voltage polarity and the external measuring circuit...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of thermally oxidized films on SiC and oxide/SiC interfaces {{has been carried}} out by use of spectroscopic ellipsometry, comparing with the oxide films on Si and low-temperature <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> films. We have, for the first time, proposed the measurements of optical properties of oxide films as a function of oxide thickness using one sample with angled etched oxide film on SiC. From the ellipsometric measurements, {{it was found that the}} apparent refractive indices decrease with decreasing oxide film thickness. These behavior can be explained by the model that there exist interface layer, about 1 nm in thickness, with higher refractive index than those of SiC and Si 0 2 and the thickness of Si 0 2 layers on the interface layer increases with oxide film thickness. This result suggests that there exist thin interface layers with high refractive indices between Si 02 layers and SiC substrates. We have also measured atomic composition and chemical bonding in oxide films on SiC by AES and XPS, and have shown the changes in the composition and bonding nature at the interfaces. We have developed the measurement method of thickness of homoepitaxially grown films on SiC by use of micro FT-IR, and have demonstrated the thickness mapping of 2 inch diameter 6 H-SiC epilayers...|$|E
40|$|The etching of {{polysiloxane}} spin-on-glass (SOG) layers on aluminum by a fluorine-based plasma {{has been}} studied by Auger electron spectroscopy. The etching of such film by CF 4, CHF 3, and C 2 F 6 {{is characterized by a}} residual film formation which is significantly thicker than the residues found after etching, under identical conditions, of a chemically vapor de-posited (CVD) silicon dioxide on aluminum. A study of the residual layer composition is presented for various film struc-tures, processing, and etching conditions for three types of reactive ion etching (RIE) systems operating at high, medium, and low pressures. The results indicate the presence of fluorocarbon polymer-like residual films, typical for each one of the systems. The thicker esidual layer was found for SOG films on aluminum etched at high pressure. The film structure, as found by Auger electron spectroscopy, is of fluorocarbon material on an aluminum oxide. The formation of such resid-ual layer can be reduced by decreasing the gas pressure in the system and increasing the bias between the sample and the plasma during etching. For the films etched in the very low pressure range, about 2 - 3 mt, the residual film is thin, 0. 5 - 1. 0 nm, and is not much different from those found for <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide.</b> The results are also compared to the residues found after etching similar films on silicon.

40|$|An Integrated Phosphor Field Emission Device (IPFED) {{has been}} {{fabricated}} at the Rochester Institute of Technology {{for the purpose}} of developing a new, flat panel display technology. The device incorporates a new, cathodoluminescent, thin film phosphor (Ta 2 Zn 308) developed at RIT as an anode. A cathode and control gate, both consisting of a thin layer of molybdenum are also included in the device. Electrons are tunneled from the cathode via Fowler-Nordheim tunneling to energetically strike the phosphor anode. The anode then produces light, via cathodoluminescence, which the human eye can detect. Standard semiconductor processes were utilized in the fabrication of the device. These processes include; sputtering of Zinc Oxide, tantalum, molybdenum, and quartz, deposition of chemically vapor deposited (<b>CVD)</b> <b>oxide,</b> reactive ion etching of tantalum, molybdenum, and silicon dioxide using CHF 3 /He, CF 4 /H 2, or SF 6 plasmas, using a G-line stepper and diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) novolac resin resists to pattern the aforementioned materials, and utilizing a Rapid Thermal Processor (RTP). The device can be scaled from ultra high resolution (10 jim pitch or less) to standard SVGA resolution (0. 28 mm pitch). Bright (no way to quantify) pixels have been observed at 200 nA of current at 100 V of acceleration energy. The control gate which was built into the structure does not function as designed due to shorting problems between the control gate and cathode. A process for the vacuum encapsulation of the devices has also been developed. This process does not require any special alignment of a separate faceplate. Many of the known problems with other field emissive displays have been circumvented by this new design...|$|E
40|$|The {{high power}} densities {{expected}} for the MIT microengine (silicon MEMS-based micro-gas turbine generator) require the turbine and compressor spool to rotate {{at a very}} high speed at elevated temperatures (1300 to 1700 K). However, the thermal softening of silicon (Si) at temperatures above 900 K limits the highest achievable operating temperatures, which in turn significantly compromises the engine efficiency. Silicon carbide (SiC) offers great potential for improved microengine efficiency due to its high stiffness, strength, and resistance to oxidation at elevated temperatures. However, techniques for microfabricating SiC to the high level of precision needed for the microengine are not currently available. Given the limitations imposed by the SiC microfabrication difficulties, this thesis proposed Si-SiC hybrid turbine structures, explores key process steps, identified, and resolved critical problems in each of the processes along with a thorough characterization of the microstructures, mechanical properties, and composition of CVD SiC. Three key process steps for the Si-SiC hybrid structures are CVD SiC deposition on silicon wafers, wafer-level SiC planarization, and Si-to-SiC wafer bonding. Residual stress control in SiC coatings is of the most critical importance to the CVD process itself {{as well as to the}} subsequent wafer planarization, and bonding processes since residual stress-induced wafer bow increases the likelihood of wafer cracking significantly. Based on CVD parametric studies performed to determine the relationship between residual stresses in SiC and H 2 /MTS ratio, deposition temperature, and HCl/MTS ratio, very low residual stress (less than several tens of MPa) in thick CVD SiC coatings (up to - 50 pm) was achieved. (cont.) In the course of the residual stress study, a general method for stress quantification was developed to isolate the intrinsic stress from the thermal stress. In addition, qualitative explanations for the residual stress generation are also offered, which are in good agreement with experimental results. In the post-CVD processes, the feasibility of SiC wafer planarization and Si-to-SiC wafer bonding processes have successfully been demonstrated, where <b>CVD</b> <b>oxide</b> was used as an interlayer bonding material to overcome the roughness of SiC surface. Finally, the bonding interface of the Si-SiC hybrid structures with oxide interlayer was verified to retain its integrity at high temperatures through four-point flexural tests. by Dongwon Choi.
