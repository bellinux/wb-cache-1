50|$|The outside wet-steam engine had inside {{valves and}} drove the first coupled axle. The wheels were sprung with leaf springs located over the top, that were linked by a <b>compensating</b> <b>lever</b> between the coupled wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} on {{the driving}} wheels {{was achieved by}} leaf springs underneath and {{was linked to the}} leaf springs of the leading wheels using a <b>compensating</b> <b>lever.</b> HULDA had a transverse leaf spring under the trailing axle, this axle was unsprung on the other engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{side frame}} of the bogie was usually of bar construction, with simple horn guides attached, {{allowing}} the axle boxes vertical movements between them. The axle boxes had a cast-steel equaliser beam or bar resting on them. The bar had two steel coil springs placed on it and the bogie frame rested on the springs. The effect was to allow the bar {{to act as a}} <b>compensating</b> <b>lever</b> between the two axles and to use both springs to soften shocks from either axle. The bogie had a conventional bolster suspension with swing links carrying a spring plank.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the {{shortcomings}} in ride of the Grafenstaden outside-frame bogies, the locomotive had smooth riding qualities. The engine had a riveted interior plate frame and the coupled wheels had springs under the axle boxes, that were not linked by <b>compensating</b> <b>levers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Indian {{locomotive}} class XB was a 4-6-2 (or Pacific) {{passenger locomotive}} with a 17 LT axle load. It {{had a lot}} of problems. It was built with the help of British Engineering Standards Association (BESA). It was up to date as any locomotive in England. It had American 3-point suspension with <b>compensating</b> <b>levers</b> for indifferent tracks in India. The trailing wheels were mounted on a Cartazzi truck as it was for the rest of British Pacifics at the time. Goodall-type drawgear was fitted between engine and tender to facilitate free movement. They still proved to be successful as they survived till the 1980s. The modifications in India to this class was implemented in LMS Railway in UK. Copper firebox had combustion chamber extension.|$|R
50|$|Until 1864 the South Eastern Railway {{had very}} few tank {{locomotives}}. In that year the 205 class 0-4-2T locomotives were introduced, {{for use on}} the London suburban passenger services; they were designed by James I. Cudworth, the company's locomotive superintendent. They performed well, but their capabilities were restricted by the small fuel and water capacities; so after twelve of these were in service, Cudworth produced an enlarged version of the design. With the fuel capacity raised from 0.75 LT to 1.25 LT and the water capacity raised from 690 imp gal to 850 imp gal, the extra weight and length that this required behind the cab made it necessary to support {{the rear of the}} locomotive on a bogie in place of the single rear axle, producing an 0-4-4T - the first of that wheel arrangement to be built for an English railway (the first Scottish railway to use the 0-4-4T wheel arrangement was the Caledonian, in 1873). There were <b>compensating</b> <b>levers</b> to equalise the weight between the coupled axles, and the outside-framed bogie also had compensating levers; it carried {{about a third of the}} locomotive's weight. Like the 205 class, they burned coke as a fuel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} the design principles for the resistance wave height meter {{and structure of}} hardware and software, madding brief elaborate on the functions and realization of each module. The system adopts a <b>compensating</b> <b>lever</b> method to exclude {{the impact of the}} solution conductivity on the system measurement results. The excitation source use bipolar pulse voltage, easing the dielectric polarization problem, so that the circuit is further simplified, improves measurement precision...|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, the new 2 MN {{deadweight}} force {{standard machine}} of PTB, which was moved from Berlin to Braunschweig {{and has been}} completely modernised, is presented. The determination {{of the mass of}} the deadweights with a special mass comparator is described. The uncertainty of the machine is theoretically analysed and experimentally verified by force measurement procedures.
