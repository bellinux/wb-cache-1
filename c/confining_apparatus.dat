40|$|Inelastic {{deformation}} in polymers under large deformation {{is typically}} accompanied by instabilities. These instabilities can {{be associated with}} shear banding, barreling, buckling, etc., and can prevent complete characterization of the constitutive behavior. In this paper, we present an experimental configuration where polymers can be subjected to large homogeneous deformations. The design and operation of the <b>confined</b> compression <b>apparatus</b> is described. Using the apparatus, it is shown that the nonlinear pressure-volume response can be extracted for pressures as high as 1 GPa. The shear response is also extracted from the same experimental datait is shown that for two polymers, polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate, the stress drop observed in uniaxial tests may not represent an intrinsic material property and, further, that by applying high confining pressures plastic deformation may be suppressed completely...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{miniature}} {{process for}} separating the oil phase from dilute oil/water emulsion is developed. This proc-ess applies a <b>confined</b> space <b>apparatus,</b> {{which is a}} thin flow channel made of two parallel plastic plates. The space between the two plates is rather narrow to improve the collisions between oil droplets and the plate surface. Oil droplets have an affinity for the plate surface and thus are captured, and then coalesce onto the surface. The droplet size distribution of the residual emulsion resulted from the separation process is remarkably changed. The oil layer on the plate weakens the further separation of oil droplets from the emulsion. Three types of plate materials, poly-propylene (PP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and nylon 66, were used. It is found that PP {{is the best in}} terms of the oil separation efficiency and nylon 66 is the poorest. The interaction between droplets in the emulsion and plate surface is indicated by the spreading coefficient of oil droplet on the plate in aqueous environment, and the influ-ences of formed oil layer and plate material on the separation efficiency are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{demand for}} natural gas is {{increasing}} since recent climate change. Natural gas is considered an abundant energy source with low greenhouse-gas emissions. A natural gas engine usually operates in lean-burn mode to gain the advantage of high thermal efficiency and low nitrogen oxides emission. A problem typically associated with natural gas combustion in lean mode is poor ignitability. The objective {{of this study is}} to improve ignitability of lean natural gas combustion using gas-jet ignition method. Several experiments were done using a <b>confined</b> volume chamber <b>apparatus.</b> Images of the combustion flame were captured using a high speed camera, and hydrocarbon emissions were measured. The result showed that the gas-jet ignition method is effective in improving ignitability of lean natural gas mixture. An addition of 30 % hydrogen gas to the natural gas fuel improves both the ignitability and further flame propagation, thus lowering the hydrocarbon emission...|$|R
40|$|Elucidation of the {{load-bearing}} {{mechanism of}} the nucleus pulposus (NP) facilitates understanding of the mechanical and metabolic functioning of the intervertebral disc and provides key data for mathematical models. Negatively charged proteoglycans in the NP generate an ionic osmotic pressure, πi, which contributes to the tissue's resistance to load and, moreover, is the main mechanism by which the unloaded disc rehydrates. Functionally important, πi has seldom been investigated in situ and, crucially, its variation with strain has not been reported. In a <b>confined</b> compression <b>apparatus,</b> we aimed to apportion the strain-dependent load-bearing {{mechanism of the}} NP at equilibrium to the tissue matrix and ionic osmotic pressure; and to determine whether any proteoglycan loss occurs during confined compression testing. Forty-eight confined compression experiments were conducted in isotonic (0. 15 M NaCl) and hypertonic (3. 0 and 6. 1 M NaCl) external solutions in single and multiple step-strain protocols. The 6. 1 M NaCl external solution was needed to eliminate {{as much of the}} ionic effects as possible. The ionic osmotic pressure was well described by πi= 19. 1 λ− 1. 58 (R 2 = 0. 992), and was approximately 70 % of the applied load at equilibrium, independent of λ. The effective aggregate modulus,, also increased with strain:. Concentrations of sulphated glycosaminoglycans were obtained for the samples tested in isotonic NaCl with no proteoglycan loss detected from the confined compression tests. These results highlight the non-linearity of the stress-strain response of NP tissue and the necessity to include a non-linear function for osmotic pressure in mathematical models of this tissue...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{two main}} known {{mechanisms}} of aluminum (Al) nanoparticle reaction {{are discussed in}} the literature, namely those based on diffusion through an oxide shell and melt-dispersion. The two mechanisms lead to opposite predictions in nanoparticle design. The diffusion mechanism suggests that the reduction or complete elimination of the oxide shell will increase Al reactivity, whereas the meltdispersion mechanism suggests an increase in initial oxide thickness up to an optimal value. The goal {{of this study is to}} perform critical experiments in a <b>confined</b> flame tube <b>apparatus</b> to compare these two predictions. Specifically, the flame propagation rates of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (C 13 F 27 COOH) -treated Al nanoparticles with and without an alumina shell were measured. Results show that when there is no alumina passivation shell encasing the Al core, the flame rate decreases by a factor of 22 - 95 and peak pressure deceases by 3 orders of magnitude, in comparison with the Al particles with an oxide shell. These results imply that the melt-dispersion reaction mechanism is responsible for high flame propagation rates observed in these confined tube experiments...|$|R
40|$|Total {{electron}} scattering cross sections for pyrazine {{in the energy}} range 10 - 500 eV have been measured with a new magnetically <b>confined</b> electron transmission-beam <b>apparatus.</b> Theoretical differential and integral elastic, as well as integral inelastic, cross sections have been calculated {{by means of a}} screening-corrected form of the independent-atom representation (IAM-SCAR) from 10 to 1000 eV incident electron energies. The present experimental and theoretical total cross sections show a good level of agreement, to within 10 %, in the overlapping energy range. Consistency of these results with previous calculations (i. e., the R-matrix and Schwinger Multichannel methods) and elastic scattering measurements at lower energies, below 10 eV, is also discussed. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

40|$|The thermal {{behavior}} of three aromatic polyesters in a homologous series, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT), and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) was studied under hydrostatic pressure up to 200 MPa {{by using a}} high pressure differential thermal analysis <b>apparatus.</b> <b>Confining</b> fluid high pressure dilatometer was used to establish the volume–temperature curves (in both solid and liquid regions) from which volume change on melting of these polyesters at atmospheric pressure was determined. Single endothermic peak was seen for PET and PTT, whereas PBT showed double peaks above 50 MPa. Pressure coefficient of melting temperature at atmospheric pressure (dTm/dp(0)), {{was obtained from the}} quadratic fit. The dTm/dp(0) for PTT was newly determined to be 0. 445 KMPa− 1, whereas for PET and PBT were 0. 503 and 0. 455 KMPa− 1, respectively, comparable to reported values. The dTm/dp(0) exhibited the odd-even behavior corresponding to odd and even number of methylene groups in the repeat unit. Enthalpy and entropy of fusion had the most influence on this coefficient. Entropy related to conformational and volume change were evaluated and the former was found to {{have a significant impact on}} the value of dTm/dp(0) ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{million tons}} of Chromite Ore Processing Residue (COPR) were {{deposited}} at two sites in New Jersey and Maryland, USA, and over time they exhibited extensive heaving phenomena. Ettringite, a needle-shaped mineral and an expansive mineral commonly recognized in the literature concerning cement- and soil, has been identified extensively in numerous COPR samples collected from these sites. It was therefore believed that ettringite formation and its crystal growth are strongly associated with COPR heaving. We investigated the correlation between ettringite and the heaving phenomena in COPR materials that contained no initial ettringite. Two identical COPR samples were exposed to a 4 % w/w sulfate solution (25 °C, 50 °C) in a <b>confined</b> swell test <b>apparatus.</b> Both swell test samples were analyzed by means of X-ray powder diffraction. The peak intensities of newly formed ettringite were more pronounced in the sample tested at 50 °C, and swell development was only observed in this sample. Scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed well-crystallized ettringite needles exceeding 40 μm in length for this sample, while ettringite crystals less than 15 μm in length formed in the sample tested at 25 °C. Therefore, {{the results suggest that}} the quantity of ettringite and the extent of crystallization {{play a key role in}} the heave of COPR. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to examine the}} environmental, safety, health and {{operational}} aspects of detonating a <b>confined</b> explosive test <b>apparatus</b> that has been designed to maximize the dynamics of impact on beryllium metal components for Contained Firing Facility (CFF) applications. A combination of experimental collection and evaluation methods were designed and implemented to provide an evaluation of immediately postdetonation by-products reflecting a potential worst-case scenario beryllium aerosolization explosive event. The collective Material Evaluation Test Series (METS) 04 - 06 provided explosive devices designed to scale for the dedicated METS firing tank that would provide a post-detonation internal environment comparable to the CFF. The experimental results provided appropriate information to develop operational parameters to be considered for conducting full-scale beryllium-containing experimental tests with similar designs within CFF and B 801 A. These operational procedures include the inclusion of chelating agents in pre-shot CFF cardboard containers with a minimum of 600 gallons content, an extended time period post-test before purging the CFF chamber, and an adaptation of approaches toward applications of the scrubber and HEPA systems during the post-shot sequence for an integrated environmental, safety, and health approach. In addition, re-entry and film retrieval procedures will be adapted, in line with abatement techniques for cleaning the chamber, that will be required for work inside a CFF that will contain an elevated concentration of spherical and highly aerosolizable beryllium particulate...|$|R
40|$|From {{pharmaceutical}} powders {{to agricultural}} grains, a great {{proportion of the}} materials handled in industrial situations are granular or particulate in nature. The variety of stesses that the matierals may experience and the resulting bulk behaviours may be complex. In agricultural engineering, a better understanding into agricultural processes such as seeding, harvesting, transporting and storing will help to improve the handling of agricultural grains with optimised solutions. A detailed understanding of a granular system is crucial when attempting to model a system, whether it is on a micro (particle) or macro (bulk) scale. As numerical capabilities are ever increasing, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is becoming an increasingly popular numerical technique for computing the behaviour of discrete particels for both industrial and scientific applications. A look into the literature shows a lack of validation of what DEM can predict, specifically with respect to bulk behaviour. In addition, when validation studies are conducted, discrepancies between bulk responses in physical tests and numerical predictions using measured particles properties may arise. The aire {{of this research is}} to develop a methodology to calibrate DEM models for agricultural grains using data meaured in bulk physical tests. The methodology will have a wider application to granular solids in general and will advance understanding in the area of DEM model calibration. A contrasting set of granular materials were used to develop the methodology including 3 inorganic solids (single and paired glass beads, and polyethylene terephthalate pellets) and two organic materials (black eyes beans and black kidney beans). The developed methodology consists of three steps: 1. The development of bulk physical tests to measure the bulk responses that will be used to calibrate the DEM models, 2. The creation of the numerical dataset that will describe how the DEM input parameters influence the bulk responses, and 3. The optimisation of the DEM parameters using a searching algorithm and the results from Step 1 and 2. Two laboratory devices were developed to provide calibration data for the proposed methodology: a rotating drum and an confined compression test. These devices were chosen as they can produce bulk responses that are repeatable and easy to quantify, as well as generate discriminating results in numerical simulations when DEM parameters are varied. The bulk response determined from the rotating drum device was the dynamic angle of repose Ør formed when the granular material in a 40 % filled drum is rotating at a speed of 7 rpm. the <b>confined</b> compression <b>apparatus</b> was used to determine the bulk stiffness of a system by monitoring the change in void ratio from the stress applied during a loading and unloading cycle. The gradient of the loading and unloadng curves termed λ and κ respectively were chosen as the bulk responses to calibrate the DEM models. The experimental results revealed that the dynamic Ør was significantly influences by the particle aspect ration and boundary conditions. The stiffness parameters were found to be predominantly influences by the initial packing arrangement. The numerical dataset describing how the DEM input parameters influence the numerical bulk responses was created by simulating the bulk physical tests, varying selected DEM parameters and monitoring the effects on bulk parameters. To limit the number of simulations required, design of experiment (DOE) methods were used to determine a reduced factorial matrix of simulations. In additions, an extensive parametric investigation on the non-optimised parameters as well as a scaling sensitivity study was carried out. The final step in determining the optimised parameters is to use a searching algorithm to infer the DEM parameters based on the numerical dataset and used the experimental results as calibration data. To perform a comparative study, tow searching algorithms were explored: the first was a simple method based on Microsoft Excel's Solver algorithm coupled with a weighted inverse distance method. The second made used of the statistical analysis program Statistica. It was shown that the Excel Solver algorithm is simpler and quicker to use but for the present first implementation, could only perform an optimisation based on two bulk responses. Statistica required the creation of a staistical model based on the numerical dataset before using the profiling and desirability searching technique, but was able to optimise the parameter using all three bulk responses. A verification and validation of the optimisation methodology was conducted using the optimised parameters for the black eyed beans. A verification was cnducted by simulating the two calibration experiments using the optimsed parameters and comparing these with the experiments. In addition, a validation was peformed by predicting the response of ta shallow footing penetration on a bed of black eyed beans. It was found that DEM simulations using optimised parameters predicted vertical stress on the footing during penetration to an acceptable degree of accuracy for industrial applications (< 10 %) at penetration depths up to 30 mm.
