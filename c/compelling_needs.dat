30|$|Nanofluid {{is a novel}} heat-transfer fluid {{prepared}} by dispersing nanometer-sized solid particles in traditional heat-transfer fluid to increase thermal conductivity and heat-transfer performance. Nanofluid was coined by Choi and colleagues [1 – 3] in 1995 at Argonne National Laboratory of the USA. Nanofluids with water, ethylene glycol, or oil as the base fluid were of great significance primarily because of their enhanced thermal properties. There are <b>compelling</b> <b>needs</b> in many industrial fields to develop oil-based heat transfer fluids with significantly higher thermal conductivity for energy-efficient heat exchangers. Many efforts have {{been focused on the}} oil-based nanofluids. Transformer oil, mineral oil, silicon oil, hydrocarbon fuels, and some organic solutions are used as the base fluids for studying nanofluids. The dispersion and thermal conductivities of the oil-based nanofluids containing Cu, CuO, Ag, or Al 2 O 3 particles have been recently reported [4 – 6].|$|E

40|$|Of the 97 geoarchaeological {{sites of}} this study that bridge the Pleistocene-Holocene {{transition}} (last deglaciation), approximately two thirds have a black organic-rich layer or “black mat” {{in the form of}} mollic paleosols, aquolls, diatomites, or algal mats with radiocarbon ages suggesting they are stratigraphic manifestations of the Younger Dryas cooling episode 10, 900 B.

40|$|On the whole, {{studies of}} extracurricular {{participation}} in secondary school have been surprisingly bereft of a conceptual framework, rife with methodological prob-lems, {{and prone to}} include overstatements or "overinterpretations " of findings. Holland and Andre's (1988) recent review of this literature points out these short-comings, but provides an unduly beneficent or optimistic summary of many studies and stops short of the decisive directives needed to yield more enlightening studies.

40|$|Wetlands {{are highly}} {{productive}} and support {{a wide variety}} of ecosystem goods and services. Various forms of global change impose <b>compelling</b> <b>needs</b> for timely and reliable information on the status of wetlands worldwide, but several characteristics of wetlands make them challenging to monitor remotely: they lack a single, unifying land-cover feature; they tend to be highly dynamic and their energy signatures are constantly changing; and steep environmental gradients in and around wetlands produce narrow ecotones that often are below the resolving capacity of remote sensors. These challenges and needs set the context for a special issue focused on wetland remote sensing. Contributed papers responded to one of three overarching questions aimed at improving remote, large-area monitoring of wetlands: (1) What approaches and data products are being developed specifically to support regional to global long-term monitoring of wetland landscapes? (2) What are the promising new technologies and sensor/multisensor approaches for more accurate and consistent detection of wetlands? (3) Are there studies that demonstrate how remote long-term monitoring of wetland landscapes can reveal changes that correspond with changes in land cover and land use and/or changes in climate...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the last}} several years, the field of {{terahertz}} science and technology has changed dramatically. Many new advances in the technology for generation, manipulation, and detection of terahertz radiation have revolutionized the field. Much of this interest has been inspired {{by the promise of}} valuable new applications for terahertz imaging and sensing. Among a long list of proposed uses, one finds <b>compelling</b> <b>needs</b> such as security screening and quality control, as well as whimsical notions such as counting the almonds in a bar of chocolate. This list has grown in parallel with the development of new technologies and new paradigms for imaging and sensing. Many of these proposed applications exploit the unique capabilities of terahertz radiation to penetrate common packaging materials and provide spectroscopic information about the materials within. Several of the techniques used for terahertz imaging have been borrowed from other, more well established fields such as x-ray computed tomography and synthetic aperture radar. Others have been developed exclusively for the terahertz field, and have no analogies in other portions of the spectrum. This review provides a comprehensive description of the various techniques which have been employed for terahertz image formation, as well as discussing numerous examples which illustrate the many exciting potential uses for these emerging technologies.

40|$|As {{part of the}} MASCOT/WOTRO {{multinational}} team {{conducting the}} maternal health literature mapping, four Latin American researchers were particularly interested in analysing information specific to their region. The mapping started with 45, 959 papers uploaded from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, LILACAS, PopLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge. From these, 4175 full texts were reviewed and 2295 papers were subsequently included. Latin America experienced an average maternal mortality decline of 40 % between 1990 and 2013. Nevertheless, the region's performance was below the global average and short of the 75 % reduction set in Millennium Development Goal 5 for 2015. The main outcomes show that research on maternal health in the countries where the most impoverished populations {{of the world are}} living is not always aligned with their <b>compelling</b> <b>needs.</b> From another perspective, the review made it possible to recognize that research funding as well as the amount of scientific literature produced concentrate on issues that are not necessarily among the main causes of maternal deaths. Even though research on maternal health in Latin America has grown from an average of 92. 5 publications per year in 2000 - 2003 to 236. 7 between 2008 and 2012, it's not satisfactorily keeping pace with other regions. In conclusion, it is critical to effectively orient research funding and production to respond to the health needs of the population.

Over the last several years, the NCVHS Subcommittee on Populations has served as a public forum to discuss challenges in the collection and use of race and ethnicity categories in health data, including considerations of how to determine extent of health disparities. In this effort, the Subcommittee conducted a series of hearings designed to investigate the collection and use of data on racial and ethnic groups by data systems funded and maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 42) This {{project was}} inspired by my experience as a facilitator in Los Angeles High???s Human Awareness Program in the Spring of 1972. The experience was brought about because of student body unrest due to police sweeps around campus, drug problems, sharing Fairfax High's campus and facilities after the 1969 earthquake and racial tensions. I found myself in a very interesting position because I had attended Los Angeles High School 15 years ago and since that time {{there has been a}} radical change in the entire composition of the student-body, philosophical approaches to education and community, i. e., it has changed from a predominately White to a predominately Black student-body, the community has a majority of Blacks and the educational philosophy has changed from a strictly academic orientation, to one of dealing with adjustment and behavioral problems. Also, it was a very disturbing experience for me because I witnessed educational processes that, in my opinion, were not conducive to a positive educational experience for students. At this point I feel a need to express that I will make this presentation as objective as possible but subjectivity will definitely be expressed, Also, I think it is necessary to summarize the results of the Human Awareness Program in order to better explain the main portion of this project, which is to find a feasible and workable program that can help solve some of the <b>compelling</b> <b>needs</b> of students, especially their psychological needs. The Human Awareness Program was born out of the concern of parents interested in doing something meaningful rather than talking about the problems of Los Angeles High School.
