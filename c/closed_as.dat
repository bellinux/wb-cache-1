5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door <b>closed.</b> <b>As</b> she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.|$|E
5|$|After the war, coastal defences became {{increasingly}} irrelevant as nuclear weapons came {{to dominate the}} battlefield.

St Catherine's and Portland were decommissioned in the late 1940s, Hurst, Pendennis and Yarmouth in the 1950s, Southsea in 1960 and, after, the closure of its air base, Calshot followed in 1961.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{pendulum}} had swung back towards road transport. The Cromford Canal was largely abandoned in 1944, and several of the rail lines passing through the Peak were <b>closed</b> <b>as</b> uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe. The Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone. Parts of the trackbed are now used for the Trans Pennine Trail, the stretch between Hadfield and Woodhead being known specifically as the Longdendale Trail.|$|E

This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, the New York City Health Department {{ordered that}} the city's gay bathhouses be <b>closed.</b> <b>As</b> a result, {{heterosexual}} sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had {{to shut down}} as well because the city had just passed a gay rights ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments {{would have been a}} violation of that ordinance.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm {{striking}} Réunion, officials advised residents to remain inside. Officials ordered residents in Saint-Leu along the coast to evacuate inland, and at least 300people evacuated island-wide. The airport at Saint-Denis was closed, but reopened after the storm passed the island; several flights were canceled as a result. The main port was also <b>closed,</b> <b>as</b> were most childcare facilities, and mail service was suspended.

5|$|On August 31, the Baja California Sur state {{government}} ordered {{the evacuation of}} more than 10,000residents. Those who refused to follow the evacuation order would {{have been forced to}} evacuate by the army. Shelters were set up to allow local residents and tourists to ride out the storm. Just weeks after a major flood in the area, officials evacuated hundreds of citizens in Las Presas in northern Mexico area near a dam.

5|$|The European Space Research Organization (ESRO) {{established}} Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund {{as one of}} {{its four}} initial European Space Tracking Network stations. The facility remained in use from 1967 to 1974, but was <b>closed</b> <b>as</b> it was not suitable for ESRO's second generation of satellites. During the planning of the station, Longyearbyen had been proposed as a location, and it was largely political concerns by Norwegian authorities to create permanent activity in Ny-Ålesund which lead ESRO to accept the location.|$|E

5|$|The {{alternative}} route via Horseway sluice and the Old Bedford River {{has been closed}} for several years. The lock at Welches Dam has been <b>closed</b> <b>as</b> being unsafe and a reedbed has taken hold. Very low water levels between Horseway sluice and Welches Dam lock often prevented passage. This stands to be improved, however, {{as part of the}} Fens Waterways Link project, which includes plans for improving the route through the Middle Levels from Stanground to Salters Lode and to Welches Dam.|$|E
5|$|The house <b>closed</b> <b>as</b> a hostel in 2007, {{after the}} London Borough of Hillingdon chose to replace its {{temporary}} accommodation with affordable permanent housing, {{in light of}} a directive from the Government for all local authorities {{to reduce the number}} of families in temporary housing by half by 2010. Highgrove, together with six other buildings was put forward to be sold for redevelopment, with the proceeds to be invested in the construction of new housing.|$|E
