5000|$|The exact {{chemical}} {{process by which}} carbon so significantly delays sulfation is not fully understood. However the presence of UltraBattery’s parallel ultracapacitor apparently protects the negative terminal from the large surface preponderance of lead sulfate crystals that affects VRLA batteries operated at high rates of discharge or for long periods in pSoC operation, increasing the rechargeability of the cell (see also Hard Sulfation). Reduced sulfation also significantly enhances <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> by reducing hydrogen gas production at the electrode [...] This is not unexpected since excessive hydrogen gas production (which robs significant energy from the charging process) is caused when electrons pushed into the negative plate during charging (which would usually react with the lead sulfate crystals inside the plate) are unable to easily react with large crystals of lead sulfate {{on the surface of}} the plate, so instead tend to reduce the electrolyte’s abundant hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas.|$|E

40|$|AbstractContemporary {{applications}} {{are changing the}} failure mechanisms of lead acid batteries. Sulfation at the negative electrode, acid stratification, and dendrite formation now precede positive electrode failures such as grid corrosion and active material shedding. To attenuate these failures, carbon has been explored as a negative electrode additive to increase <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance,</b> eliminate sulfation, and extend cycle life. Frequently, however, carbon incorporation decreases paste density and hinders manufacturability. Discrete carbon nanotubes (dCNT), also known as Molecular Rebar®, are lead acid battery additives which can be stably incorporated into either electrode to increase <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> and cycle life with no change to paste density and without impeding the manufacturing process. Here, full-scale automotive batteries containing dCNT in the negative electrode or both negative and positive electrodes are compared to control batteries. dCNT batteries show little change to Reserve Capacity, improved Cold Cranking, increased <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance,</b> and enhanced overall system efficiency. Life cycle tests show > 60 % increases when dCNT are incorporated into the negative electrode (HRPSoC/SBA) and up to 500 % when incorporated into both electrodes (SBA), with water loss per cycle reduced > 20 %.

40|$|Batteries in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle applications operate from partial state of charge and are subjected to short periods of charge and discharge with high currents. These operating conditions create two major problems, namely low <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> and progressive sulfation of the negative plates. The low specific electrochemically active surface of the negative plates can be expanded significantly by adding definite types of carbon materials, which improves substantially the <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the battery. We assume that the slowest elementary process during charging negative plates is {{the dissolution of the}} lead sulfate crystals. This process can be accelerated by adding poly-aspartic acid (Baypure DS- 100 or DS) to the negative paste or to the electrolyte. DS causes partial amorphization of the PbSO 4 particles and reduces their size. Thus, the reversibility of the charge-discharge processes at the negative plates is improved and their sulfation is retarded. Besides, DS increases the overpotential of hydrogen evolution on the lead electrode. These effects of DS make it a useful additive to lead-acid batteries operated in the high-rate partial-state-of-charge duty...|$|E

This work elucidates the impact of the external surface area of carbon additives on the electrochemical performance of lead-carbon electrodes with respect to the DCA. Five specially synthesized amorphous hard carbon powders with different specific external surface area ranging from 13 m 2 g− 1 to 192 m 2 g− 1 were added to the negative active material of laboratory lead-carbon test cells. Results from cyclic voltammetry reveal that the specific external surface area of amorphous carbons exhibits a clear correlation to the electrochemical activity of lead-carbon electrodes. Firstly, an almost linear increase of the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction with increasing specific external surface area of the carbon additive can be found. Secondly, the specific double-layer capacity of the negative active material is directly linked to the specific external surface area of the additive, as well. Thirdly, a clear correlation to the DCA can be established. In conclusion, a high specific external carbon surface in the negative active material seems to be a key to improve the dynamic <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> of modern lead-carbon batteries...|$|E

40|$|Li-ion {{batteries}} {{have become}} one of the chosen energy storage devices that are used in applications such as power tools, cellular phones and electric vehicles (EV). With the demand for portable high energy density devices, the rechargeable Li-ion battery has {{become one of}} the more viable energy storage systems for large scale commercial EVs because of their higher energy density to weight or volume ratio when compared to other current commercial battery energy storage systems. Various safety procedures for the use of Li-ion batteries in both consumer and EV applications have been developed by the international associations. The test procedures studied in this dissertation demonstrated the importance of determining the true capacity of a cell at various discharge rates. For this, the well known Peukert test was demonstrated. The study also showed that cells with different battery geometries and chemistries would demonstrate different thermal heating during discharge and slightly different Ragone results if different test methods were used as reported in the literature. Accelerated ageing tests were done on different cells at different Depth-of-Discharge (DoD) regions. The different DoD regions were determined according to expected stresses the electrode material in a cell would experience when discharged to specific DoD that follows the discharge voltage profile. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used to measure various electrochemical changes within these cells. The EIS results showed that certain observed modelled parameters would change similarly to the ageing of the cell as it aged due to the accelerated testing. EIS was also done on cells at different State-of-Charge (SoC) and temperatures. The results showed that EIS can be used as an effective technique to observe changes within a Li-ion cell as the SoC or temperature changed. For automotive vehicles that are powered by a fuel cell or battery, a supercapacitor can be coupled to a battery in order to increase and optimize the energy and power densities of the drive systems. A test procedure in the literature that evaluated the use of capacitors with Pb-acid batteries was applied to Li-ion type cells in order to quantify the increased power due to the use of a supercapacitor with a Li-ion cell. Both a cylindrical LiCoO 2 cell and a VRLA Pb-acid cell showed some additional <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> and delivery when connected to the supercapacitors. A LiMn 2 O 4 pouch cell showed significant <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> and delivery when connected to supercapacitors. The amount of additional <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> and delivery of the different combinations could be explained by EIS, in particular, the resistance and capacitance of the cell in comparison to the combination of the cell and supercapacitor.
