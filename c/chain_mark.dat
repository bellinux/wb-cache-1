50|$|The {{break in}} the {{continuity}} of the Alpine <b>chain</b> <b>marked</b> by the deep valley, the Vinschgau, of the upper Adige {{is one of the most}} remarkable features in the orography of the Alps. The little Reschen Lake, which forms the chief source of the Adige is only 4 metres below the Reschen Pass (1,504 m), and by it is 8 km from the Inn valley. Eastward of this pass, the main chain runs north-east to the Brenner Pass along the snowy crest of the Ötztal and Stubai Alps, the loftiest point on it being the Weißkugel (3,739 m, Ötztal), for the highest summits both of the Ötztal and of the Stubai districts, the Wildspitze (3,774 m) and the Zuckerhütl (3,505 m) stand a little to the north.|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, {{geologist}} John Tuzo Wilson hypothesized {{the origins}} of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, explaining that they were created by a hotspot of volcanic activity that was essentially stationary as the Pacific tectonic plate drifted in a northwesterly direction, leaving a trail of increasingly eroded volcanic islands and seamounts in its wake. An otherwise inexplicable kink in the <b>chain</b> <b>marks</b> a shift in the movement of the Pacific plate some 47 million years ago, from a northward to a more northwesterly direction, and the kink has been presented in geology texts {{as an example of how}} a tectonic plate can shift direction comparatively suddenly. A look at the USGS map on the origin of the Hawaiian Islands clearly shows this [...] "spearpoint".|$|R
5000|$|Altoids {{are less}} widely {{available}} in Britain—their country of origin—than in the US {{to which they are}} exported. The mints are stocked in relatively few shops, including Tesco, Morrisons, and Waitrose supermarket <b>chains.</b> <b>Marks</b> & Spencer produces a near identical product called [...] "Curiously Strong Mints". Unlike their marketing in the US, Altoids have never been heavily marketed in the UK. Callard & Bowser-Suchard once manufactured Altoids at a plant in Bridgend, Wales, but has since moved Altoids' production to an existing plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States. This was done to manufacture the products closer to where they are primarily marketed. They were marketed for a brief period in the 1990s under the [...] "Nuttall's" [...] brand when Callard and Bowser was under the ownership of Terry's.|$|R
50|$|Özyeğin led Yapı ve Kredi Bankası until 1987, when {{he decided}} to {{establish}} his own bank, the Finansbank at the age of 43. He expanded it to a bank with more than 200 branches operating in nine countries out of Turkey, mostly in Europe. He later founded several finance companies and brought them under the Holding Fiba, which has around 8,500 employees in 20 companies. Over the next few years, he invested in high-demand industries such as real estate, energy and retail, building condominiums and shopping centers across the main domestic business districts. In 1996, he entered the retail business purchasing the supermarket chains Gima, Endi, Spar and Greens. Furthermore, Özyeğin signed a franchising contract with the British retail <b>chain</b> <b>Marks</b> & Spencer, and then purchased also the Sakura Bank.|$|R
5000|$|Marker's {{research}} at Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University) was directed towards finding synthetic routes to steroid hormones from [...] "relatively inexpensive starting materials". While {{working on a}} series of plant steroids called sapogenins, he realized that the structure of the side chain of one of the compounds, sarsasapogenin, had been incorrectly described in the literature: rather than having an unreactive [...] "double-tetrahydrofuran" [...] side chain, it actually had a much more reactive [...] "ketone spiro acetal" [...] side chain. While the ketone spiro acetal was unreactive in basic or neutral conditions, it could be degraded under acidic conditions: indeed, Marker described it as [...] "unusually reactive". In showing {{the true nature of the}} sarsasapogenin side <b>chain,</b> <b>Marker</b> had discovered the first of the steps in what would become known as the Marker degradation.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "assembly line" [...] {{that forms}} the volcanoes is driven by a hotspot- a plume of magma deep within the Earth {{producing}} lava at the surface. As the Pacific Plate moves in a west-northwest direction, each volcano moves with it away from its place of origin above the hotspot. The age and location of the volcanoes are {{a record of the}} direction, rate of movement, and orientation of the Pacific Plate. The pronounced 43-million-year-old break separating the Hawaiian Ridge from the Emperor <b>Chain</b> <b>marks</b> a dramatic change in direction of plate movement. Initial, deeper-water volcanic eruptions are characterized by pillow lava, so named for their shape, while shallow-water eruptions tend to be composed mainly of volcanic ash. Once the volcano is high enough so as to eliminate interference from water, its lava flows become those of ropey pāhoehoe and blocky aā lava.|$|R

40|$|Digital natives {{constitute}} {{the majority of}} new employees entering the marketplace. However, they face an organizational corporate culture that enshrines the vested interests of a very different generation of people, whom they would characterize as digital immigrants or even dinosaurs. This organizational culture has very strict values and assumptions about the way people (should) work, resulting in considerable tension between the digital natives and their non-native colleagues. We explore these tensions in an exploratory case study of a hotel <b>chain</b> <b>marked</b> by its conservatism in IT policy. After reviewing the literature on digital natives, digital immigrants and organizational culture, we examine how digitally native hotel employees in China secure access to the digital media of their choice {{in the face of}} corporate obstruction. We discuss the broader implications of our findings for practicing managers, as well as future research opportunities, before concluding this research-in-progress paper...|$|R

50|$|Early in 1896, six men {{gathered}} {{for lunch at}} the Holland House in New York City. These men were Charles Frohman, Al Hayman, A. L. Erlanger, Marc Klaw, Samuel F. Nirdlinger, and Frederick Zimmerman. All were theatrical managers and/or booking agents with influence throughout the country. Frohman and Hayman owned theatres in New York and the surrounding area, Erlanger and Klaw were booking agents for almost all the major theatres in the South, and Nirdlinger and Zimmerman controlled theatres in the Ohio region. Frohman also owned a chain of theatres extending to the West Coast. At lunch, the men discussed the disarray in American theatre. These men had essentially formed {{the outline of the}} Theatrical Syndicate. In order for the Syndicate to succeed, it needed to form a monopoly.
