40|$|The use of {{biobased}} {{materials to}} replace their conventional, synthetic counterparts is clearly increasing today. An interesting application, printed <b>circuit</b> board <b>substrates</b> based on biobased materials, {{has recently been}} proposed, produced, and tested by several researchers. Building on these exploratory studies, this paper aims to evaluate and compare {{the environmental impact of}} biobased and conventional printed <b>circuit</b> board <b>substrates.</b> The conventional materials for printed <b>circuit</b> board <b>substrates</b> are epoxy resin reinforced by woven glass fibre fabric. Recent studies demonstrate that epoxidized linseed oil reinforced by flax fibre can meet most of the requirements specified in standards for printed <b>circuit</b> board <b>substrates.</b> A functional unit of 1 m 2 of a printed <b>circuit</b> board <b>substrate</b> was selected for the comparative cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment, and incineration with energy recovery has been considered as an end-of-life scenario. The comparative life cycle assessment documented in this paper shows that a biobased printed <b>circuit</b> board <b>substrate</b> offers a clear impact reduction compared to the conventional design for most impact categories, except for freshwater toxicity, eutrophication, and land use. These are well-known problems for agro-products with pesticide and fertilizer use in cultivation. The environmental impact caused in the End-of-Life stage is generally negligible compared to the production stage for both types of printed <b>circuit</b> board <b>substrates.</b> However, the biobased substrate has a higher embodied energy compared to the conventional substrate, and consequently enables lowering of the fuel use for incineration or providing a higher energy output {{in the case of a}} combustion scenario. It can be concluded that the biobased design, composed of flax-fibre reinforced epoxidized linseed oil, is characterized by a lower overall environmental impact. The aggregated weighted eco-points score obtained using the ReCiPe methodology is 42 % lower than for the conventional design for the chosen functional unit and scenario. Because the extensively measured technical properties of the biobased substrate were found to comply with almost all international standard specifications, the biobased design offers promising perspectives for further study. However, for industrial application, the major weaknesses of biobased materials, such as the high water absorbance, must be addressed. In addition, the higher land use raises considerable concern, indicating conflicts over food cultivation for use of biobased materials for manufacturing purposes. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIn humans, neuroligin- 3 {{mutations}} {{are associated}} with autism, whereas in mice, the corresponding mutations produce robust synaptic and behavioral changes. However, different neuroligin- 3 mutations cause largely distinct phenotypes in mice, and no causal relationship links a specific synaptic dysfunction to a behavioral change. Using rotarod motor learning {{as a proxy for}} acquired repetitive behaviors in mice, we found that different neuroligin- 3 mutations uniformly enhanced formation of repetitive motor routines. Surprisingly, neuroligin- 3 mutations caused this phenotype not via changes in the cerebellum or dorsal striatum but via a selective synaptic impairment in the nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum. Here, neuroligin- 3 mutations increased rotarod learning by specifically impeding synaptic inhibition onto D 1 -dopamine receptor-expressing but not D 2 -dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons. Our data thus suggest that different autism-associated neuroligin- 3 mutations cause a common increase in acquired repetitive behaviors by impairing a specific striatal synapse and thereby provide a plausible <b>circuit</b> <b>substrate</b> for autism pathophysiology.

40|$|The signal {{channels}} that link high speed processors to memory {{and various other}} peripherals, are limited by the inherent characteristics of the printed circuit board. These are what ultimately connect information to the outside world. One limiting factor {{is the effect of}} nonuniformity of the glass fiber distribution in the printed <b>circuit</b> <b>substrate</b> material, also known as fiber weave effect (FWE). FWE introduces signal skew and timing errors which place an upper limit on bit rate and trace length. Using unique fabrication techniques and a proprietary low dielectric constant glass composition, a revolutionary glass fabric is presented that is essentially free of fiber weave effect while demonstrating inherently improved resistance to conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation. Improved laminate performance is demonstrated with finite element modeling and HyperLynx simulations, and corroborated with dielectric property measurements on prototype substrates. A printed circuit board using this material demonstrates superior signal integrity performance over the traditional glass-based solution. By uniformly distributing glass fibers the maximum surface area becomes available to bond with the resin, which is enhanced by direct application of a finish to provide a high quality interface between glass and resin. Two high profile performance issues, fiber weave effect and CAF, are addressed by a unique laminate reinforcement. Introduction to Fiber Weave Effec...|$|E
