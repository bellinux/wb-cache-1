50|$|Top contact or gravity type {{third rail}} {{seems to be}} the oldest form of power collection. Railways {{pioneering}} in using less hazardous types of third rail were the New York Central Railroad on the approach to New York's Grand Central Terminal (1907 - another case of a third-rail mainline electrification), Philadelphia's Market Street Subway-Elevated (1907), and the Hochbahn in Hamburg (1912) — all had bottom <b>contact</b> <b>rail,</b> also known as the Wilgus-Sprague system. However, the Manchester-Bury Line of the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway tried side <b>contact</b> <b>rail</b> in 1917. These technologies appeared in wider use only {{at the turn of the}} 1920s and in the 1930s on, e.g., large-profile lines of the Berlin U-Bahn, the Berlin S-Bahn and the Moscow Metro. The Hamburg S-Bahn has used a side contact third rail at 1200 V DC since 1939.|$|E

The {{driver of the}} train (Konstantin Ovseannicov) that by coincidence contains Garin, Konstantinov and Galina activates the emergency brake. The train derails and crashes {{into the water and}} rubble. Some of the passengers are killed. Konstantinov, instead of going along the rails, climbs onto the roof of the car. Crawling along, he sees Garin, who is trying to find Ksjushu in a pile of bodies, and helps Garin. Garin is going to follow the others but Konstantinov stops him, pointing out that the <b>contact</b> <b>rail</b> is still electrified. The water rises, a short circuit occurs, and all who did not escape the flooded area of the tunnel die from shock. Garin, Konstantinov and Galina, courier Michael (Stanislav Duzhkinov) and a couple, Denis (Alex Bardukov) and Alisa (Katherine Spitz), finally can seek to escape. All except Michael hurriedly make their way into a passage leading to a maintenance shaft. Michael, being very frightened, refuses to enter the passage and dies when the car rolls over.|$|E

40|$|Decarburisation {{is present}} on all new rails and unless ground off, {{will be on}} the running surface once installed. This paper {{presents}} a detailed investigation into the effect of decarburisation of rolling contact fatigue and wear. Twin disc testing has been used to study the phenomenon under water-lubricated rolling/sliding <b>contact.</b> <b>Rail</b> discs have been cut from grade 220 rail and heat-treated to give samples with varying depths of decarburisation. It was found that as the depth of decarburisation increased the wear rate of the rail disc increased while that of the wheel disc decreased. The effect of decarburisation on rolling contact fatigue was to increase the crack growth rate of samples with increasing depth. Cracks under rolling contact fatigue were propagated by contact stresses via the fluid pressure mechanism and influenced by microstructure. The effect of decarburisation was predicted to have little effect on rail/wheel contact when scaled from the laboratory tests using the depth of maximum shear stress...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{finite element}} (FE) model of railway vehicle-track system is developed {{to study the}} dynamic interaction between the vehicle and track. The vehicle is represented by a lumped parameter system. The track is modeled as a Timoshenko beam on discrete pad-tie-ballast supports. The tie is considered either as a rigid body or a non-uniform beam. The rail-pad and ballast are modeled as distributed spring-damper elements. The non-linear factors such as loss of wheel/rail <b>contact,</b> <b>rail</b> lift-off from the tie and tie lift-off from the ballast are taken into account. A cutting and merging method along {{with a set of}} special boundary conditions is established to extend finite length of track to infinitely long track so that a vehicle can be modeled to travel on the track indefinitely with a time-dependent speed. A numerical direct integration technique is employed to solve the equations of motions of the vehicle and track systems. An adaptive multi-point wheel/rail contact model is proposed and used to calculate the normal and geometrical longitudinal forces due to irregularities in the wheel/rail contact region. The developed FE model is validated using the experimental data obtained from British Rail and Canadian Pacific (CP) Rail. The FE results such as natural frequencies of concrete ties, the wheel/rail contact forces, the rail-pad forces and dynamic strains in the rail, generally show good correlation to the experimental data. The validated model is applied to investigate the characteristics of impact loads due to wheel/rail tread defects such as wheel flats, wheel shells and rail joints. The steady-state interaction between the vehicle and track, and the dynamic force due to rail corrugations are evaluated for high speed operation. The results of this study show that the impact load is maximum at the ties, and is strongly influenced by the axle load, vehicle speed, actual shape of the defect, and rail equivalent mass. Elastomeric shear pads on the wheelset bearing, and reduced rail-pad stiffness, can potentially reduce dynamic bearing force and tie dynamic load, respectively. The magnitude of resonant force for vehicle-track system in a steady-state interaction mainly depends on the unsprung mass, tie spacing, vehicle primary and track ballast damping, and rail stiffness. In the presence of rail corrugation, the energy consumption due to longitudinal force increases quadratically with the depth of rail corrugation. The dynamic contact forces at neighboring wheels are influenced by each other and the basic mechanism that control such an interaction is the superposition of the dynamic responses. Stable solution in the speed range 0 to 1440 km/h demonstrates the effectiveness of the model for high speed simulation...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the methodologies based on multi-body systems {{used to analyze}} the dynamics of rail vehicle in motion in a straight line. Study of the railway vehicles dynamics requires the creation of three mutually independent models: the model of the vehicle, the track model and a model of the wheel – <b>rail</b> <b>contact.</b> A railway vehicle model developed in the multi-body systems convention w as an el ectric locomotive of the EU 07 symbol. The general software model of the wheel- <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> was programmed and is presented, which allows one in the course of analysis to determine the coordinates of the contact point between wheel and rail and thus the designation of the wheels forces in <b>contact</b> with the <b>rail.</b> The model of the contact forces includes normal force with damping hysteresis and tangential forces determined by the Polach method.

30|$|Most {{brake discs}} are ventilated, {{which means they}} possess special cooling ribs that more {{efficiently}} dissipate heat into the environment [1]. Various standards present fundamental algorithms for calculations relevant to design of the discs, but these calculations are not always reliable [2]. Brake discs must also withstand additional loads caused by relatively stiff <b>contact</b> between <b>rail</b> and wheel.

40|$|A moving train {{subjects}} a rail {{cross section}} to many wheel passes and heat generation at the interface from bulk friction and microslip. Frictional heating at the interface causes {{the temperature of}} the <b>contacting</b> <b>rail</b> surface and wheel surface to rise. After the train has passed, the rail temperature drops to ambient till the next train arrives. Wheels, on the other hand, pick up the frictional heat input continuously and hence their steady state temperature could be much higher than that of the rail. A hot wheel provides an additional temperature rise at the rail surface. The accompanying thermal stresses and thermal softening may enhance the rail wear rate. This has been investigated in the present study. A ratchetting failure-based computer simulation has been employed to assess the wear rate of a pearlitic rail steel. It is found that the thermal stress effect on wear rate is only the modest, but thermal softening can enhance the wear rate by up to an order of magnitude for the conditions considered...|$|R

Broggie previously supervised the building of the Disneyland Railroad in Disneyland in Anaheim, California. From his experience with the railroad at Disneyland, Broggie determined that it was better to use existing steam locomotives, rather than building them entirely from scratch like the Disneyland Railroad's first two locomotives. To this end, he <b>contacted</b> <b>rail</b> historian Gerald M.

This was a [...] narrow-gauge system, the same gauge as the Disneyland Railroad. Broggie, along with fellow Disney employee and railroad-building expert Earl Vilmer, went to Mérida in 1969 to investigate.
