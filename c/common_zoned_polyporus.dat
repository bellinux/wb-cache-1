Recognizing that for the design to be implemented zoning laws needed to adapt, an effort was initiated {{by a group of}} four individuals (Rick Chellman, (now [...] "TND" [...] Engineering), Norman Stahl (US Federal Court of Appeals); Andreas Duany and Scott Brooks) who came together to write and then seek the passage of the first [...] "TND Ordinance". This [...] "ordinance" [...] put into a traditional zoning form the necessary legalities that prior to its enactment made it legally impossible to gain regulatory approvals in much of the US as the <b>common</b> <b>zoning</b> laws of the period had requirements that mandated suburban design principles directly contrary to the TND design needs. Most importantly was the adaptation away from a single 35 mph design speed on all suburban streets as had been the standard since the 1960s. The TND zoning was ultimately passed in Bedford, New Hampshire, and subsequently copied and/or used as a starting point by many communities thereafter. Creating a regulatory precedent and practical foothold was the original intent of the four-person team. No TND was ever actively undertaken in the originating Town of Bedford NH (although one was approved by the efforts of Stahl, Brooks, Chellman & Duany and it encompassed over 1,000,000 s/f of commercial space, 829 housing units and acres of riverfront park lands) as {{in the midst of the}} TND zoning Approvals, a banking crisis took hold and defeated the feasibility for new development at that time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In a quartzitic garnet-kyanite-chloritoid micaschist garnet {{is present}} as compact, partly {{euhedral}} grains and as web-like types with numerous inclusions of quartz. Compact types overgrown by web garnets or alternating layers of both types are also <b>common.</b> Continuous <b>zoning</b> is observed with increase of pyrope and decrease of grossular and spessartine component towards garnet rim. A {{first stage of}} garnet growth together with chloritoid is recognized, followed by a garnet rim stage including kyanite. Calculated P-T pseudosections in the KNCFMMnASTH system suggest a prograde path with garnet growth starting in the assemblage chloritoid-chlorite-lawsonite-glaucophane (muscovite-quartz-rutile-H 2 O excess phases). Later breakdown of chloritoid þchlorite {{is followed by the}} reaction chloritoidþquartz garnetþkyaniteþH 2 O. The calculations suggest that glaucophane was present along a major portion of the prograde P-T path. Conditions of 20. 5 kbar, 540 C are suggested for growth of garnet core and 19 – 21 kbar, 580 – 590 C for garnet rim coexisting with the assemblage garnet-kyanite-chloritoid-paragonite. During exhumation, cooling and influx of H 2 O took place. As a result high-XMg chloritoid was formed in the matrix and lower-XMg chloritoid in garnet inclusions. In a later event at lower P-T conditions, minor amounts of low-Si phengite, biotite, chlorite and clinozoisite replaced high-Si phengite, kyanite, garnet and chloritoid.

40|$|Accessory {{minerals}} {{are often}} difficult to investigate with light optics as the mineral grains tend to be small and the refractive indices high. Textural features due to variations in composition are well displayed in such minerals by backscattered lectron imagery under circumstances designed to select only the composition contribution to electron backscattering and displayed as atomic number (Z) -contrast imagery (ZCI). It is shown by this technique that compositional zonation patterns are very <b>common</b> and sector <b>zoning</b> in titanite is described for the first time. The compositional basis for zonation of titanites {{in this study is}} shown to be controlled by coupled substitutions involving the REE. The technique isparticularly good at revealing rounded cores to zircon grains which are normally taken to be refractory grains from the magma source region, and ZCI studies may improve targeting of grains for U-Pb geochronological investigations. Several examples are presented of applications of the technique to accessory minerals encountered in polished thin sections of granitoids in the Caledonian of Scotland. The consequences of ZCI studies for trace element modelling of REE in granitoid petrogenesis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The American {{bias that}} {{privileges}} owners over tenants {{has its roots}} in early US history, in the colonial practices of limiting suffrage to property owners, and in the formation of a Constitution that protected the propertied minority from the propertyless majority. While the property test for suffrage eventually disappeared, the property bias persists, just as other barriers of gender, national origin, poverty, religion and race remain pervasive in our society. The impacts of this bias are felt not only by tenants but also by their landlords and is exercised through community organizations dominated by owners as well as <b>common</b> practices of <b>zoning</b> and tax policy. Three recent property tax bills of the New Jersey legislature illuminate the tenuous status of renters in tax policy.

40|$|While most rocks {{from active}} volcanoes display ((210) pb/Ra- 226) {{activity}} ratios lower than {{or close to}} the equilibrium value of 1, several other have ratios much higher than 1. Transfer of Rn- 222 by magmatic volatiles has often been advocated to explain both Pb- 210 deficits and excesses. We develop here a model to account for Pb- 210 excesses through Rn- 222 accumulation. We show that large Pb- 210 excesses can be readily obtained, even for moderate ratios of degassing magma over accumulating magma, in a closed-system model where the Rn- 222 atoms produced by decay of Ra- 226 in the degassing magma are continuously extracted by a gas phase. For a given duration of volatile transfer, relative Pb- 210 excesses {{are expected to be}} much larger than Pb- 210 deficits. This model is applied to samples from Santorini (Aegean arc) and Surtsey (Iceland) both of which show high ((210) pb/Ra- 226) ratios of 6. 7 and 2. 3 respectively at the time of eruption. The agreement with field data suggests that Rn- 222 accumulation leading to Pb- 210 excesses might be a rather <b>common</b> process in <b>zoned</b> magma chambers as well as in individual lava flows, and that it can be described by a closed-system model...|$|R
40|$|CDATA[Beryl is an {{uncommon}} but characteristic mineral of Hercynian granitic pegmatites associated with S-type granites-granodiorites of the Bratislava and Bojn&# 225; massifs, Tatric Unit, Central Western Carpathians (SW Slovakia). Beryl represents the only essential rare-element phase in {{majority of the}} pegmatites, whereas accessory Nb-Ta-(Sn) oxide minerals occur in the most evolved ones (Moravany nad V&# 225;hom, Jezuitsk&# 233; Lesy). Beryl forms columnar pale green crystals on the boundary between blocky K-feldspar zone and muscovite plus quartz core (beryl I) or locally in saccharoidal and cleavelandite albite unit (beryl II). The EMPA, LA-ICP-MS and XRD data show mostly the presence of common Li, Cs-poor beryl with variable amounts of Na and occasionally small Fe, Mg-enriched domains (up to 3. 5 wt. % FeO and 1. 8 wt. % MgO), with dominant channel-octahedral substitution represented by the Na(Fe&# 060;sup&# 062; 2 +&# 060;/sup&# 062;,Mg) &# 060;span style=„border:solid 1 px black;font-size: 0. 5 em;width: 1 em;position:relative;top:- 1 px;margin: 2 px&# 034;&# 062; &# 060;/span&# 062;&# 060;sub&# 062;- 1 &# 060;/sub&# 062;Al&# 060;sub&# 062;- 1 &# 060;/sub&# 062; exchange. Beryl of the most evolved pegmatites contains moderately elevated Li (up to 5600 ppm; Moravany nad V&# 225;hom) or Cs contents (up to 9800 ppm, 1 to 2 wt. % Cs&# 060;sub&# 062; 2 &# 060;/sub&# 062;O in some zones; Jezuitsk&# 233; Lesy), which indicates also a possibility of channel-tetrahedral substitutions. A <b>common</b> patchy internal <b>zoning</b> of primary magmatic beryl I crystals indicates a late-magmatic to subsolidus, partial dissolution-reprecipitation phenomenon. On the contrary, crystals of beryl II show relatively homogeneous internal texture and lower content of Cs than associated beryl I. Consequently, compositional variations and internal texture of the beryl show magmatic to subsolidus evolution of less fractionated, beryl-columbite subtype populations of the granitic pegmatites. The primary evolution trend of beryl shows increasing Cs and Cs/Na with decreasing Mg and Mg/Fe from less evolved to more fractionated pegmatites. However, a secondary evolution trend, probably connected with post-magmatic partial dissolution-reprecipitation, shows decreasing Cs and increasing Mg/Fe in the beryl. ]]...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1970 s {{enhanced}} eruptive activity of Mount Etna {{has been accompanied}} by selective geochemical changes in erupted lavas, among which a gradual increase of alkalis whose origin is still debated. Here we provide further insight into the origin of this recent evolution, based on a detailed study of the chemistry and dissolved volatile content of melt inclusions trapped in olivine crystals of unusual plagioclase-poor primitive basalt that was extruded during a highly explosive flank eruption in July–August 2001. Two types of lava were erupted simultaneously along a N–S fracture system. Trachybasalts from the upper vents (2950 – 2700 m) were simply drained out by fracturing of the central volcanic conduit. They are identical to summit crater lavas and contain Mg-poor olivines (Fo 70 – 72) with evolved and volatile-poor melt inclusions that represent late-stage crystallisation during shallow open conduit degassing. In contrast, plagioclase-poor basalt (80 % of total) extruded through the lower vents (2550 – 2100 m) derived from lateral dyke intrusion of a more primitive and volatile-rich magma across the sedimentary basement. This primitive melt is best preserved in rare Fo 82. 4 – 80. 5 skeletal olivines present in lapilli deposits from the most powerful activities at the 2550 m vent. Its high dissolved contents of H 2 O (3. 4 wt. %), CO 2 (0. 11 to 0. 41 wt. %), S (0. 32 wt. %), Cl (0. 16 wt. %) and F (0. 094 wt. %) point to its closed system ascent from ∼ 400 to 250 MPa (∼ 12 to 6. 5 km depth b. s. l.). However, the predominance of euhedral olivine phenocrysts with <b>common</b> reverse <b>zoning</b> (cores Fo 76 – 78 and rims Fo 78 – 80) and decrepited inclusions shows that most of the erupted basalt derived from a slightly more evolved, crystallizing body of the same magma that was invaded by the uprising primitive melt prior to erupting. The few preserved inclusions in these olivines indicate pre-eruptive storage of that magma body at about 5 km depth b. s. l., in coherence with seismic data. We propose that the 2001 flank eruption resulted from gradual overpressuring of Etna's shallow plumbing system due to the influx of volatile-rich primitive basalt that may have begun several months in advance. We find that this basalt is much richer in alkalis (2. 0 wt. % K 2 O) and has higher S/Cl (2. 0) but lower Cl/K and Cl/F ratios than all pre- 1970 s Etnean lavas (1. 4 wt. % K 2 O, S/Cl= 1. 5), as further exemplified by melt inclusions in entrained olivine xenocrysts. Combining these new observations with previously published data, we argue that the 2001 basalt represents a new alkali-rich basic end-member feeding Mt. Etna, only few amount of which had previously been extruded during a 1974 peripheral eruption and, more recently, during brief paroxysmal summit events. Over the last three decades this new magma has progressively mixed with and replaced the former K-poorer trachybasalts filling the plumbing system, leading to extrusion of gradually more primitive and alkali-richer lavas. Its geochemical singularities cannot result from shallow crustal contaminations. Instead, they suggest the involvement of an alkali-richer but Cl-poorer arc-type component during recent magma genesis beneath Etna...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} geochemical {{characteristic of}} the shergottites is the large range in initial Sr isotopic ratios and initial ε^(Nd) values. The depleted olivine-phyric shergottites are commonly reduced (∼IW+ 1) and exhibit limited variation in fO_ 2 during crystallization, whereas the enriched olivine-phyric shergottites are more oxidized and exhibit a substantial variation in fO_ 2 during crystallization (∼IW+ 1 (1 log unit above the iron-wüstite buffer) to FMQ+ 0. 7 (0. 7 log units above the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer). Using a reduced, depleted shergottite Y 980459 (Y 98) and an oxidized, enriched shergottite (NWA 1183), we reconstructed the crystallization history of the olivine megacrysts using phosphorus zoning and placed trace element variation and indices of oxygen fugacity into the context of that crystallization history. The olivine megacrysts in Y 98 and NWA 1183 exhibited various episodes of growth defined by the P <b>zoning.</b> <b>Common</b> to both samples were continuous and discontinuous oscillatory chemical zoning in the outer portions of the olivine megacrysts. However, the morphologies of the cores suggest a xenocrystic origin for the core of Y 98 and a phenocrystic origin for the core of NWA 1183. Phosphorus in the olivine ranges from less than 0. 02 to up to 0. 70 wt. % P_ 2 O_ 5. The P in the olivine megacrysts manifests subtle, but real differences, in the P content of different shergottite melts, incompatible element behavior of P during olivine crystallization, and solute trapping during periods of rapid olivine growth. Although P should behave incompatibly in basaltic systems, there is little relationship between the isotopic characteristics and P content in the enriched-depleted array of shergottites. In the olivine, Al is generally correlated with P enrichment and reflects a coupled substitution of P–Al. On the other hand, V is not correlated with P in Y 98, but correlated with P in the oscillatory zoned regions of the olivine in NWA 1183. The changes in correlation to P may reflect differences in V valance state during olivine crystallization. Within the crystallization histories defined by the P zoning in olivine, the calculated fO_ 2 remains fairly constant at ∼IW+ 1 for Y 98, but changes dramatically for NWA 1183 from olivine core to rim (∼IW+ 1. 8 to FMQ+. 07). Numerous lines of evidence suggest that the changes in fO_ 2 during olivine crystallization may reflect auto-oxidation that may be at least partially due to degassing of the NWA 1183 magma prior to eruption. These observations suggest a limited variation in the fO_ 2 of the Martian mantle (IW to IW+ 1), that enriched and depleted sources for the shergottites reside in the mantle, and that magmas produced in these sources have different capabilities for changing their redox state during crystallization...|$|R
40|$|Wind energy {{provides}} an environmentally friendly and renewable source of electricity, {{that can help}} meet Canada's Kyoto commitments, help safeguard against future blackouts, reduce air pollution and create economic opportunities {{in the form of}} manufacturing jobs and land leases for farmers. From a land use planning perspective, however, wind turbines create challenges that municipalities and planners have to deal with more frequently. Ontario in particular lags behind countries such as Ireland and Australia in terms of providing a clear, equitable and comprehensive land use planning framework to deal with wind energy. What is lacking in particular is a clear understanding of how Ontario municipalities are dealing with the issue of wind energy developments, whether the policies that are being developed adhere to good planning principles, what are the land use planning issues that are impacting wind energy development in Ontario and what are some recommendations that could be made to improve wind energy policies. A secondary goal of this thesis was to identify common elements of good wind energy planning frameworks {{that could be used to}} develop wind energy planning policies in the City of Stratford, which currently does not have any policies or a wind energy land use planning framework and is also where the author is employed as the City Planner. To address this lack of information, this report focuses on the current state of wind energy planning policy development in southwestern Ontario and in particular; the types of wind energy planning frameworks have been developed in the world, the elements of "good" planning principles and frameworks and whether or not they are found in these frameworks, whether there are components of these policies that would be appropriate for wider adoption in Ontario and finally, what types of framework should the City of Stratford develop for wind energy? To address these questions, a literature review was conducted on wind energy land use planning issues and examples of international wind energy planning guidelines were reviewed. Additionally, five southwestern Ontario municipalities with wind energy policies were selected as case studies and Planners and other wind energy stakeholders were interviewed. This study found that the main issues and barriers surrounding wind energy planning policy development in Ontario are visual impact, lack of education and a lack of a municipal planning framework. It was also determined that, the public reaction to wind energy proposals in Southwestern Ontario has been mostly positive and the conflicts that have arisen have been in instances where wind turbines are proposed in the vicinity of recreational properties. In terms of a wind energy planning framework, southwestern Ontario municipalities have for the most part opted for General Official Plan policies supporting wind energy development in principle and directing its development to certain land use designations subject to a zoning by-law amendment. The planning frameworks in the case studies for the most part conform to good planning principles identified, however, there was a large variation between the municipalities in terms of the level of detail within the planning framework. Finally, it was determined that the City of Stratford Official Plan and Zoning By-law are inadequate in terms of policy and regulations for wind energy. This study recommends that the Ontario Provincial Government should follow up on the Wind Energy Information Sheet and the recent Provincial Policy Statement with a comprehensive land use-planning framework for wind energy developments that should borrow on existing international guidelines that have been developed. This study also recommends that the City of Stratford should update its Official Plan to include policies that address wind energy generation, should initiate a study to determine if there are any areas within the City that are considered to be natural heritage views or areas that should be protected from the visual impacts of wind energy production, should investigate permitting wind energy facilities in certain industrial areas of the City, subject to a zoning by-law amendment and should work with the County of Perth to develop a <b>common</b> set of <b>zoning</b> by-law regulations for wind energy developments...|$|R
