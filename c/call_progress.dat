In physical (not carrier) E and M trunk circuits, trunks were four wire. Fifty trunks {{would require a}} hundred pair cable between switches, for example. Conductors in one common circuit configuration were named tip, ring, ear (E) and mouth (M). Tip and ring were the voice-carrying pair, and named after the tip and ring on the three conductor cords on the manual operator's console.|$|E
60|$|Hâjî Abdû seeks Truth only, {{truth as}} far as man, in the present phase of his development, is able to {{comprehend}} it. He disdains to associate utility, like Bacon (Nov. Org. I. Aph. 124), the High Priest of the English Creed, le gros bon sens, with the lumen siccum ac purum notionum verarum. He seems to see the injury inflicted upon the sum of thought by the â posteriori superstition, the worship of facts, and the deification of synthesis. Lastly, came the reckless way in which Locke freed philosophy from the incubus of innate ideas. Like Luther {{and the leaders of}} the great French Revolution, he broke with the Past; and he threw overboard the whole cargo of human tradition. The result has been an immense movement of the mind which we love to <b>call</b> <b>Progress,</b> when it has often been retrograde; together with a mighty development of egotism resulting from the pampered sentiment of personality.|$|E
60|$|The {{philosophy}} of the desert can only begin over again. It cannot grow; it cannot have what Protestants <b>call</b> <b>progress</b> and Catholics call development. There is death and hell in the desert when it does begin over again. There is always {{the possibility that a}} new prophet will rediscover the old truth; will find again written on the red sands the secret of the obvious. But it will always be the same secret, for which thousands of these simple and serious and splendidly valiant men will die. The highest message of Mahomet is a piece of divine tautology. The very cry that God is God is a repetition of words, like the repetitions of wide sands and rolling skies. The very phrase is like an everlasting echo, that can never cease to say the same sacred word; and when I saw afterwards the mightiest and most magnificent of all the mosques of that land, I found that its inscriptions had the same character of a deliberate and defiant sameness. The ancient Arabic alphabet and script is itself at once so elegant and so exact that it {{can be used as a}} fixed ornament, like the egg and dart pattern or the Greek key. It is as if we could make a heraldry of handwriting, or cover a wall-paper with signatures. But the literary style is as recurrent as the decorative style; perhaps that is why it can be used as a decorative style. Phrases are repeated again and again like ornamental stars or flowers. Many modern people, for example, imagine that the Athanasian Creed is full of vain repetitions; but that is because people are too lazy to listen to it, or not lucid enough to understand it. The same terms are used throughout, as they are in a proposition of Euclid. But the steps are all as differentiated and progressive as in a proposition of Euclid. But in the inscriptions of the Mosque whole sentences seem to occur, not like the steps of an argument, but rather like the chorus of a song. This is the impression everywhere produced by this spirit of the sandy wastes; this is the voice of the desert, though the muezzin cries from the high turrets of the city. Indeed one is driven to repeating oneself about the repetition, so overpowering is the impression of the tall horizons of those tremendous plains, brooding upon the soul with all the solemn weight of the self-evident.|$|E

6000|$|One day a {{woman that}} I know {{came face to face}} with heroic beauty, that highest beauty which Blake says changes least from youth to age, a beauty which has been fading out of the arts, since that {{decadence}} we <b>call</b> <b>progress,</b> set voluptuous beauty in its place. She was standing at the window, looking over to Knocknarea where Queen Maive is thought to be buried, when she saw, as she has told me, [...] "the finest woman you ever saw travelling right across from the mountain and straight to her." [...] The woman had a sword by her side and a dagger lifted up in her hand, and was dressed in white, with bare arms and feet. She looked [...] "very strong, but not wicked," [...] that is, not cruel. The old woman had seen the Irish giant, and [...] "though he was a fine man," [...] he was nothing to this woman, [...] "for he was round, and could not have stepped out so soldierly"; [...] "she was like Mrs.-----" [...] a stately lady of the neighbourhood, [...] "but she had no stomach on her, and was slight and broad in the shoulders, and was handsomer than any one you ever saw; she looked about thirty." [...] The old woman covered her eyes with her hands, and when she uncovered them the apparition had vanished. The neighbours were [...] "wild with her," [...] she told me, because she did not wait to find out if there was a message, for they were sure it was Queen Maive, who often shows herself to the pilots. I asked the old woman if she had seen others like Queen Maive, and she said, [...] "Some of them have their hair down, but they look quite different, like the sleepy-looking ladies one sees in the papers. Those with their hair up are like this one. The others have long white dresses, but those with their hair up have short dresses, so that you can see their legs right up to the calf." [...] After some careful questioning I found that they wore what might very well be a kind of buskin; she went on, [...] "They are fine and dashing looking, like the men one sees riding their horses in twos and threes on the slopes of the mountains with their swords swinging." [...] She repeated over and over, [...] "There is no such race living now, none so finely proportioned," [...] or the like, and then said, [...] "The present Queen[FN#7] is a nice, pleasant- looking woman, but she is not like her. What makes me think so little of the ladies is that I see none as they be," [...] meaning as the spirits. [...] "When I think of her and of the ladies now, they are like little children running about without knowing how to put their clothes on right. Is it the ladies? Why, I would not call them women at all." [...] The other day a friend of mine questioned an old woman in a Galway workhouse about Queen Maive, and was told that [...] "Queen Maive was handsome, and overcame all her enemies with a bawl stick, for the hazel is blessed, and the best weapon that can be got. You might walk the world with it," [...] but she grew [...] "very disagreeable in the end--oh very disagreeable. Best not to be talking about it. Best leave it between the book and the hearer." [...] My friend thought the old woman had got some scandal about Fergus son of Roy and Maive in her head.|$|E
