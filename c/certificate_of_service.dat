2500|$|After {{securing}} {{his position}} in a bloody confrontation with the Iron Guard, Antonescu involved Romania {{in the war against}} the Soviet Union. Antisemitic measures and the clampdown on dissident activities reached a peak. Ailing from heart disease and noticeably poor, Moscovici was threatened with imminent eviction from his Bucharest home in Vatra Luminoasă, and had to move in with friends. As noted by his daughter Mira, the signal for this persecution was an article in the fascist newspaper Porunca Vremii. Against the family's protests, the house was listed for rent by the Romanianization bureau, which had barred Jews from placing bids. When Moscovici presented his <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in World War I, guaranteeing him special treatment, the officials objected that he was not a war invalid. Moscovici was also prevented from cashing into his Journalists' Union pension, owing to his racial origins. He was advised to seek an interview with Antonescu, but he rejected the idea outright. Although exposed to such persecution, Moscovici had remained cautious of the Soviet Union, and informed himself about its crimes. His young friend Belu Zilber, at the time involved with the clandestine PCdR, recalls a brush with the anticommunist Moscovici some time after the Battle of Stalingrad. According to Zilber, Moscovici shouted at him that: [...] "those Katyn people are coming, and they're going to kill you!". In summer 1943, with Petrescu, Moscovici also wrote a note to the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, detailing the [...] "treason" [...] of Flueraș and Grigorovici.|$|E

They say that worlds are sailing above us, like ships in a clear sea; and there are people who believe, that when we take our departure from this planet, we are only bound to another, in which we are to be rated according to our own deeds here; which is much the same as being drafted for a new ship, with a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in one's pocket." ...|$|E

50|$|The Hague Service Convention {{established}} a more simplified means for parties to effect service in other contracting states. Under the convention, each contracting state {{is required to}} designate a central authority to accept incoming requests for service. A judicial officer who is competent to serve process {{in the state of}} origin is permitted to send request for service directly to the central authority of the state where service is to be made. Upon receiving the request, the central authority in the receiving state arranges for service in a manner permitted within the receiving state, typically through a local court. Once service is effected, the central authority sends a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to the judicial officer who made the request. Parties are required to use three standardized forms: a request for service, a summary of the proceedings (similar to a summons), and a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} new {{certificate}} revocation system for both on-line and off-line use, which is targeted to mobile-commerce systems. It allows to use certificates from any certificate issuer and {{to apply a}} proprietary revocation strategy. Our approach is well suited especially for location-aware services and mobile devices, because 1) our protocol reduces the amount of online communication, 2) the revocation tree is structured {{in such a way}} that <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> which are located in the same region, can be verified using the same revocation proof. ...|$|R
