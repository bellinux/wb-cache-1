50|$|Those {{wishing to}} {{understand}} {{the context of the}} list might refer to the history of cryptography; in the early 1990s, the US government considered cryptography software a munition for export purposes, which hampered commercial deployment with no gain in national security, as knowledge and skill was not limited to US citizens.

The US government had tried to subvert cryptography through schemes such as Skipjack and key escrow.

40|$|The {{heart of}} flight {{operations}} control involves a) communicating effectively {{in real time}} with other controllers in the room and/or in remote locations and b) tracking significant events, decisions, and rationale to support {{the next set of}} decisions, provide a thorough shift handover, and troubleshoot/improve operations. International Space Station (ISS) flight controllers speak with each other via multiple voice circuits or “loops, ” each with a particular purpose and constituency. Controllers monitor and/or respond to several loops concurrently. The primary tracking tools are console logs, typically kept by a single operator and not visible to others in real-time. Information from telemetry, commanding, and planning systems also plays into decision-making. Email is very secondary/tertiary due to timing and archival considerations. Voice <b>communications</b> and <b>log</b> entries supporting ISS operations have increased by orders of magnitude because the number of control centers, flight crew, and payload operations have grown. This paper explores three developmental ground system concepts under development at Johnson Space Center’s (JSC) Mission Control Center Houston (MCC-H) and Marshall Space Flight Center’s (MSFC) Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC).

40|$|Calls to {{investigate}} leadership {{development in the}} nonprofit and voluntary sector have been put forth as concerns about leadership succession have increased. To respond to this call {{to investigate}} this under-researched area, this design-based, multiple case study provides rich, thick descriptions {{of the development of}} the mentoring relationships, between mentor and mentee pairs, {{over the course of a}} virtual mentoring program for volunteer leadership development, in a Catholic nonprofit. I explored how participants’ perceptions of their online interactions shaped their experiences and the development of their mentoring relationships while examining the extent to which mentoring contributed to a greater willingness, on the part of mentees, to accept volunteer leadership opportunities. The findings of this study lay the groundwork for future research into virtual mentoring environments for volunteer leadership development. The experiences of seven mentor-mentee case pairs were examined to explore the development of their mentoring relationships. Each pair’s online interactions were observed for six months, from the initial orientation session until the final note was posted. Participants were interviewed two months, four months, and six months into their participation. Data from online <b>communications,</b> weekly <b>logs,</b> and questionnaires were triangulated against mentor and mentee perceptions that emerged within the context of virtual mentoring for volunteer leadership. The compatibility between mentor and mentee expectations, with respect to mentoring approach and mentoring environment, contributed to perceptions about the quality of the mentoring relationship. The CLM was generally perceived by mentees to contribute to leader development, although relationships in which the mentor used a contribution-oriented approach, rather than a guidance-oriented approach, was found to be more complementary to the supports offered by the program. Design considerations include mitigating communication delays and determining whether social media and mobile platforms, which were found to contribute to positive perceptions about the mentoring experience, can forward program goals. The findings have implications for leadership, based on notions of social participation, in which the meaning of willingness to lead shifts from that of formal acceptance of a leadership position to greater participation in leadership activities...|$|R
40|$|Embedded Real Time {{application}} uses multi threading, a key {{concept of}} any conventional OS. The advantage of multithreading include greater throughput, more {{efficient use of}} CPU so that it cannot remain idle for long time, better system reliability, improved performance on multiprocessor computer. The use of Real Time Operating Systems (RTOSs) became an attractive solution to simplify the design of safety-critical realtime embedded systems. In this modern world, the execution of power applications with their priority at runtime is more important for industrial applications. In this paper, the main focus is on execution of different power applications using priority dynamic scheduling during runtime. According to the User, at runtime he can assign the priorities for power appliances and change the priority according to the user need, each power application named as Task. The embedded software applications require performing a task which is efficiently achieved by dividing the global task into many smaller subtasks. Previously the application of embedded system solutions to power applications are based on unique algorithm which in take maximum amount of time for CPU utilization. Most of such power applications simply go for DSP processors, which in turn takes a simple hardware design based on digital signal controllers or 16 -bit microcontrollers. For such simple power applications, the rich peripherals for <b>communications,</b> data <b>logging</b> and compact microcontrollers are used. For an application that does not use or refer RTOS, may go for complex software architecture based on timers that are available inside the microcontroller. The concept of dynamic assignment of priorities to interruptsis used which reduces the time delay for a lower priority task under some circumstances becomes a higher priority task. We are using ARM with combination of RTOS (ucos-ii) to minimize the complexity of system. In this paper we are doing the scheduling of the tasks or power appliances through Direct Memory Access (DMA) peripherals to optimization of performance of the CPU utilizatio...|$|R

This presents a number of challenges for near-real-time analysis. Recent joint-service guidance in chat room protocols and structures opens new opportunities to revisit investigation of techniques for near-real-time feedback in training programs. In this paper, we describe a research effort to develop chat analysis and filtering methods for after action review tools.

On the one hand, environmentalmonitoring of open water bodies in real or deferred time is essential to assess and make sensible decisions and, on the other hand, the broadcast in real time of position, water and wind related parameters allows autonomous boats to optimise their regatta performance. This proposal, rather than restraining the boats autonomy, fosters the development of intelligent behaviour by allowing the boats to focus on regatta strategy and tactics. The Nautical and Telemetric Application (NAUTA) buoy is a dual mode reconfigurable system that includes <b>communications,</b> control, data <b>logging,</b> sensing, storage and power subsystems.
