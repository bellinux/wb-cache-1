40|$|Altered {{nutrition}} in the {{intervertebral disc}} affects cell viability and can generate catabolic cascades contributing to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Such degradation {{is expected to}} affect couplings between disc mechanics and nutrition, contributing to accelerate degenerative processes. However, the relation of ECM changes to major biophysical events within the loaded disc remains unclear. A L 4 -L 5 disc finite element model including the nucleus (NP), annulus (AF) and endplates was used and coupled to a transport-cell viability model. Solute concentrations and cell viability were evaluated along the mid-sagittal plane path. A design of experiment (DOE) was performed. DOE parameters corresponded to AF and NP biochemical tissue measurements in discs with different degeneration grades. Cell viability was not affected by any parameter combinations defined. Nonetheless, the initial water content was the parameter that affected the most the solute contents, especially glucose. Calculations showed that altered NP composition could negatively affect AF cell nutrition. Results suggested that AF and NP tissue degeneration are not critical to nutrition-related cell viability at early-stage of disc degeneration. However, small ECM degenerative changes may alter significantly disc nutrition under mechanical loads. <b>Coupling</b> <b>disc</b> mechano-transport simulations and enzyme expression studies could allow identifying spatiotemporal sequences related to tissue catabolism...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and investigate}} a four-dimensional hidden hyperchaotic system without equilibria, which is obtained by augmenting the three-dimensional self-exciting homopolar disc dynamo due to H.

Numerical integrations show that sliding mode control provides a better synchronization in time, but causes chattering. The solution is obtained by switching to active control when the synchronization errors become very small. In addition, the electronic circuit of the four-dimensional hyperchaotic system have been realized in ORCAD–PSpice and on the oscilloscope by amplitude values, verifying {{the results from the}} numerical experiments...|$|R

40|$|Inductive dynamic {{drive is}} {{the main part of}} {{ultra-fast}} hybrid breakers. Its principle of work is based on the Thomson phenomenon, where a coil is powered by pulse current (most often from a bank of capacitors) and whose field induces eddy currents in the <b>coupled</b> <b>disc.</b> As a result the disc is impacted by a significant force causing its movement. In the paper the authors present research results of a new simple optimeter used for recording of ultra-fast displacements of an inductive dynamic drive disk.

40|$|In a {{composite}} fluid system of two gravitationally <b>coupled</b> barotropic scale-free <b>discs</b> bearing a rotation curve v∝ r^-β and a power-law surface mass density Σ_ 0 ∝ r^-α with α= 1 + 2 β, we construct coplanar stationary aligned and spiral perturbation configurations {{in the two}} discs. Due to the mutual gravitational interaction, there are two independent classes of perturbation modes with surface mass density disturbances in the two <b>coupled</b> <b>discs</b> being either in-phase or out-of-phase. We derive analytical criteria for such perturbation modes to exist and show numerical examples. We compute the aligned and spiral perturbation modes systematically to explore the entire parameter regime. For the axisymmetric m= 0 case with radial oscillations, there are two unstable regimes of ring-fragmentation and collapse corresponding to short and long radial wavelengths, respectively. Only within a certain range of the rotation parameter D_s^ 2 (square of the effective Mach number for the stellar disc), can {{a composite}} disc system be stable against all axisymmetric perturbations. Compared with a single-disc system, the coupled two-disc system becomes less stable against such axisymmetric instabilities. Comment: 23 pages, MNRAS in pres...|$|R

40|$|Panel SessionPg. 193 - 198 Special purpose {{machinery}} {{applications of}} flexible disc couplings with multiple convoluted diaphragms or disc packs {{at each end}} of the spacer are discussed. Couplings in this category were retrofitted on two compressor trains at a large ethylene plant. The couplings were a 44, 000 hp multiple convolution flexible <b>disc</b> <b>coupling</b> and a 25, 000 hp bolted disc pack flexible <b>disc</b> <b>coupling.</b> The installations were retrofits, as part of a program to uprate the compressor trains beyond the original mechanical ratings, at a minimum cost and with limited machine downtime. The user had overall engineering responsibility for selection of the type of coupling, and performance of the total installation. Selection of the coupling type, coordination meetings, design audits, quality control and installation procedures, and contingency plans were done with the full cooperation of the coupling, compressor, and turbine vendors. This resulted in uprating the trains with a high degree of reliability made possible by the careful application of these types of couplings.

40|$|The recent {{discoveries of}} circumbinary planets by Kepler raise {{questions}} for contemporary planet formation models. Understanding how these planets form requires characterizing their formation environment, the circumbinary protoplanetary disc, {{and how the}} disc and binary interact and change as a result. The central binary excites resonances in the surrounding protoplanetary disc that drive evolution in both the binary orbital elements and in the disc. To probe how these interactions impact binary eccentricity and disc structure evolution, N-body smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of gaseous protoplanetary discs surrounding binaries based on Kepler 38 were run for 10 ^ 4 binary periods for several initial binary eccentricities. We find that nearly circular binaries weakly <b>couple</b> to the <b>disc</b> via a parametric instability and excite disc eccentricity growth. Eccentric binaries strongly <b>couple</b> to the <b>disc</b> causing eccentricity growth for both the disc and binary. Discs around sufficiently eccentric binaries that strongly <b>couple</b> to the <b>disc</b> develop an m = 1 spiral wave launched from the 1 : 3 eccentric outer Lindblad resonance (EOLR) that corresponds to an alignment of gas particle longitude of periastrons. All systems display binary semimajor axis decay due to dissipation from the viscous disc. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{extension}} of the King et al. [1] model for the flickering of black hole accretion discs by taking proper account for the thermal properties of the disc. First we develop a one-dimensional, vertically averaged, one-zone model for an optically thick accretion disc and study the temporal evolution. This limits the current model to the so-called high/soft state, where the X-Ray spectrum is dominated by a thermal black-body component. Then we <b>couple</b> this <b>disc</b> model to the flickering process as described in King et al. [1]. Thus we consider the evolution of a poloidal magnetic field subject to a magnetic dynamo. By comparing to observations of X-Ray binaries in the high-soft state, we can constrain the strength of the energy density of the poloidal magnetic field to a few percent of the energy density of the intrinsic disc magnetic field...|$|R
